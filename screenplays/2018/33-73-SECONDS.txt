           EXT. CAPE CANAVERAL LAUNCH COMPLEX - DAY

           On the launch pad aimed toward the heavens is the Space
           Shuttle Challenger piggybacking a massive rust-colored fuel
           tank. Next to it are two solid rocket boosters (SRBs).

           TITLE: Space Shuttle Challenger, STS-51-L, January 28, 1986,
           11:37 a.m. EST.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        T-minus two minutes, Challenger.

                        Copy, two minutes.

           A hooded vent attached to a retractable arm capping the
           external tank starts to rotate away from the shuttle.

           INT. FLIGHT DECK - CHALLENGER COCKPIT - DAY

           Four members of the shuttle crew are strapped in and ready
           to go. Up front are COMMANDER FRANCIS "DICK" SCOBEE (46) and
           PILOT MICHAEL SMITH (40).

                                 DICK SCOBEE
                        There goes the beanie cap.

           Behind Scobee and Smith are mission specialists ELLISON
           ONIZUKA (39) and JUDY REZNIK (36).

                                 ELLISON ONIZUKA
                        Doesn't it go the other way?

           The crew laughs at the joke.

           INT. MID-DECK - CHALLENGER - SAME

           Below the flight deck, the three other crew members are
           strapped in. CHRISTA MCAULIFFE (37) eagerly awaits liftoff,
           her eyes dancing with anticipation.

                                 JUDY RESNIK (O.S.)
                        You ready, teacher?

                                 CHRISTA MCAULIFFE (INTO COMM)
                        I've been ready my whole life.

           We stay on McAuliffe's wide-eyed enthusiasm another beat.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL ROOM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

           Rows of computer terminals littered with binders and the
           occasional styrofoam coffee cup. NASA ENGINEERS eye several
           giant screens showing data for trajectories, weather, etc. 
           A large screen front and center shows a satellite map of
           Earth with flight patterns curving around the globe.

           FLIGHT DIRECTOR JAY GREENE (40s), bushy hair parted on the
           side and sleeves rolled up, runs the show. He's the picture
           of calm professionalism.

                                 JAY GREENE
                        We're a go in T-minus 60 seconds.

                        Copy T-minus 60.

           EXT. GRANDSTAND - LAUNCH COMPLEX - DAY

           FRIENDS, FAMILY and other ONLOOKERS pack the grandstand away
           from the launch pad. Some bounce with excitement, but others
           shiver and rub their arms.

           In fact, everyone wears heavy winter coats, hats, scarves
           despite the fact they're in Florida. It's cold.

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD - DAY

           The SHUTTLE BOOSTERS spew white smoke.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (V.O.)
                        And five... four... three... two...

           Orange flames shoot out and the shuttle lifts off. A flock
           of geese flies across, fleeing the massive explosion.

           EXT. GRANDSTAND - LAUNCH COMPLEX - SAME

           The crowd cheers and waves, as the shuttle clears the tower.

           INT. FLIGHT DECK - CHALLENGER COCKPIT - DAY

           The entire cabin rumbles and shakes, the G-force pressing
           the crew against their seats.

                                 MICHAEL SMITH
                        Looks like we've got a lotta wind.

           INT. MID-DECK - CHALLENGER - SAME

           The cabin violently shakes. McAuliffe looks worried, not
           being used to this.

           Next to her, GREGORY JARVIS (41), gives McAuliffe a
           reassuring look and a thumbs up. She gives thumbs up back.
           RON MCNAIR (35), next to Jarvis, smiles.

                                 MICHAEL SMITH (OVER COMM)
                        There's Mach one.
                                 DICK SCOBEE (OVER COMM)
                        Going through nineteen thousand.

           INT. FLIGHT DECK - CHALLENGER COCKPIT - SAME

           More heavy turbulence and a HARD JOLT. Scobee and Smith
           share a look.

                                 MISSION CONTROL (OVER COMM)
                        Challenger, go at throttle up.

                                 DICK SCOBEE
                        Roger, go at throttle up.

           Scobee hits the throttle. The shaking grows more violent.

                                 MICHAEL SMITH
                        Feel that mother go! Woo-hoo!

           Scobee smiles, eyes on his instruments.

           INT. MID-DECK - CHALLENGER - SAME

           McAuliffe tries peeking out the window. Air vapor and
           condensation block her vision. She smiles. This is
           everything she could have hoped for--

           Another VIOLENT JOLT. This one harder than the last. And a
           loud CREAKING SOUND. McAuliffe's eyes widen, as we--

           SMASH TO BLACK

           PRELAP - BIRDS CHIRPING

           EXT. EBELING HOME, BRIGHAM CITY, UTAH - DAY, 2016

           A sleepy suburb of Northern Utah. It's a cool, breezy day. A
           flock of birds flies overhead, heading south for winter.

           HEATHER BURNS (30s), national affairs reporter for NPR,
           exits a rental car parked in front of a tidy two-story home.

           Her sound tech, KYLE (20s), opens the trunk and starts
           pulling out equipment.

                                 KYLE
                        He gonna talk to us this time?

           Turning toward the house, Heather sees someone and gives a
           quick wave to--

           BOB EBELING (80s, frail), standing with the help of a
           walker. He lets the curtains fall without waving back.

           Heather approaches and RINGS the bell. No answer. She looks
           at Kyle and tries again. Same result. Now she knocks.
                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        Mr. Ebeling? It's Heather Burns from
                        NPR. We scheduled an interview for
                        today. Mr. Ebeling?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EBELING HOME - DAY

           Bob sits in his La-Z-Boy ignoring her. He's intelligent,
           God-fearing, and, judging from the oxygen tank behind him,
           in poor health. Bob is upset, his hands shaking.

           His wife, DARLENE (70s), usually supportive, but right now
           disappointed, stands in front of him.

                                 DARLENE
                        You agreed to this.

                                 BOB
                        I changed my mind.

                                 DARLENE
                        They came all this way.

                                 BOB
                        From California. It's not that far.

           Darlene sits on the ottoman and takes his hand. She
           understands what he's going through.

                                 DARLENE
                        This could be your last chance to
                        tell people what happened.

           Off Bob, eyes rimmed red--

           EXT. EBELING HOME - DAY

           Heather and Kyle head back to the car, the opportunity
           seemingly lost.

           Behind them, Darlene opens the front door. They turn and see
           her waving for them to come inside.

           INT. EBELING HOME - DAY

           Bob fidgets in his La-Z-Boy. Kyle sets up a laptop and
           connects a microphone.

                                 BOB
                        Last time I did one of these, we used
                        a tape recorder.

                                 KYLE
                        What's a tape recorder?
           Kyle smiles. So does Bob, the ice breaking a little. Behind
           him, Heather gets a feel of the place. Lots of bird-themed
           nick-knacks, wood carvings, and family photos.

           On the wall, she finds an award for the National Wildlife
           Refuge Association's 2013 Volunteer of the Year. There's a
           bright photo of Canadian geese flying.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        Tell me about this.

           Bob cranes his neck to see and smiles.

                                 BOB
                        Proudest day of my life, outside
                        having children. I really found my
                        calling at the sanctuary.

           Heather moves to the mantel and finds a photo of middle-aged
           Bob and a TEENAGE BOY in fishing gear by a lake. Bob is
           smiling, arm around the boy. The boy has a blank expression.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        This your son? My dad used to take me
                        fishing back in Missouri. Wasn't as
                        pretty as this.

                                 BOB
                        I thought you wanted to talk about
                        Challenger.

           Heather turns to Kyle. He gives her the thumbs up.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        I think we're ready.

           Heather sits in a chair set up in front of Bob. Darlene
           watches from the dining room.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        I'm just going to start with a few
                        basics to get warmed up. Ask about
                        your career, where you went to
                        school, that sort of thing.

                                 BOB
                        I don't want to talk about any of
                        that. Just get to it.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        Okay. Tell me about what happened on
                        January 28, 1986.

           Bob gathers himself.
                                 BOB
                        We knew the shuttle wasn't safe. We
                        tried to stop the launch, but we
                        failed.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        You mean you and Roger Boisjoly?

           Bob shakes his head.

                                 BOB
                        Roger. He was an arrogant son of a
                        bitch. Completely full of himself.
                        Don't use that part.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Roger was a brilliant engineer. He
                        was the one who got us as far as we
                        did. If he were still alive, you'd be
                        talking to him, not me.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        How did you and Roger know the
                        shuttle wasn't safe?

           Bob turns away, his mind drifting.

           INT. BEDROOM - EBELING HOME - DAY, JANUARY 1985

           MATCH CUT: A YOUNGER BOB (50s) gets ready to go to work.
           He's in front of a mirror putting on a knit tie.

           On the dresser are several framed photos. One is the same
           picture of him and his son Heather just asked about.

           Bob looks heavily at the photo a moment and adjusts it
           before leaving the bedroom.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Bob enters throwing on his Member's Only jacket and finds
           DARLENE (now 40s) in a nurse's uniform leaving for the day.

           There's a plate of Vanilla Wafers and a glass of milk on the
           counter. Darlene gives him a quick peck.

                                 DARLENE
                        Happy launch day. What time will you
                        be home?

           Bob takes one of the cookies.

                                 BOB
                        The usual probably. Just be ready for
                        more late nights. NASA's ramping up
                        the launch schedule this year.
           Bob drinks the milk. Darlene puts her arms around him.

                                 DARLENE
                        You trying to avoid me?

                                 BOB
                        You know, I do have a little time
                        between launches. Why don't we go
                        back to--

                                 DARLENE
                        The Springs. It's been too long.

                                 BOB
                        Remember that night, when we had the
                        pool all to ourselves?

                                 DARLENE
                        Make the arrangements.

           She kisses him a little more passionately and leaves.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           A quiet tree-lined street in the middle of the desert. Small
           mountains loom over rows of tidy homes.

           ROGER BOISJOLY (40s, heavyset, but strong), dressed head-to-
           toe in a red Adidas tracksuit, jogs with confidence.

           Roger keeps a good pace as he looks at his digital watch,
           but realizes he's late and has to turn back around.

           INT. BEDROOM - BOISJOLY HOME - DAY

           Roger enters and starts stripping off his sweat-soaked hat
           and gloves. His wife, ROBERTA BOISJOLY (40s), comes in with
           a prescription bottle.

                                 ROBERTA
                        What's this?

           She looks at him upset. Roger's busted, but cops to it.

                                 ROGER
                               (
                                slight Boston accent
                                                    )
                        I don't need those anymore, alright?

                                 ROBERTA
                        You know what happens to you if you
                        don't take them.
                                 ROGER
                        I've been off them six months and I'm
                        fine. And I haven't had a panic
                        attack in years.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Six months? When were you going to
                        tell me?

                                 ROGER
                        I said I'm fine. Those things mess
                        with my concentration, and lives
                        depend on me being able to focus at
                        work. I'm better off without them.

           Roger heads inside to shower.

           EXT. MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Bob drives his Honda past a sign that reads MORTON THIOKOL
           LTD. A rocket booster angled toward the sky is behind it.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Bob finds his space and parks. Middle of the pack. He grabs
           his briefcase and gets out.

           Roger drives by in his Volvo station wagon and parks nearby.
           He gets out and sees Bob.

           And Bob sees him. But instead of saying hello, Bob closes
           his door and heads for the main building, like he's trying
           to avoid him. Roger shakes his head.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Bob joins his coworkers to watch the launch of Discovery on
           TV, which is tuned to the live countdown on CNN.

           Among the group of engineers is BETH MCFARLAND (30s), new
           hire and resident wunderkind. Roger's also there.

           Bob avoids eye contact with Roger and goes to the counter to
           grab a bran muffin. Roger sees this and calls him out.

                                 ROGER
                        Hey, you guys think ammonium
                        percholate's unstable, just wait till
                        that muffin goes through Bob.

           Everyone laughs. Bob moves away, not wanting to engage.

                                 ROGER
                        C'mon, it's just a joke.
           Bob ignores him and sits next to Beth in back of the room.

                                 BETH
                        It was funny.

                                 BOB
                        Roger's a real comedian until you
                        become one of his targets. Then he's
                        just an asshole.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I don't think we were properly
                        introduced your first day. Bob
                        Ebeling. Elizabeth, right?

                                 BETH
                        Beth. Good to meet you, Bob.

           Beth chews her finger nails.

                                 BOB
                        You're not nervous, are you?

                                 BETH
                        My first launch. So maybe a little.

                                 BOB
                        I remember my first launch. Project
                        Mercury. I worked for Convair, which
                        built the Atlas rocket. I'll never
                        forget when John Glenn was on the
                        launch pad getting ready to go up--

                                 ROGER
                        Jesus, Bob, you're boring the shit
                        out of her.

           Roger sits next to them with coffee. Bob shuts down.

                                 ROGER
                        Look, it's okay to be nervous. We're
                        sending men and women up there on the
                        back of a 66,000 pound tank filled
                        with over a million pounds of liquid
                        hydrogen burning at 4,000 degrees.
                        The potential for disaster is always
                        there. So my advice, don't relax too
                        much, because when you do that's when
                        bad shit happens.

           Roger smiles and turns back to CNN's coverage, leaving Beth
           confused.

           ON TV, Mission Control goes into FINAL COUNTDOWN. The room
           quiets, all eyes on the screen, as Discovery launches--
                                 CNN REPORTER (O.S.)
                        We have liftoff, and Discovery has
                        cleared the tower. The 15th Space
                        Shuttle mission is on its way.

           The engineers clap and cheer. Even Bob joins in. Everyone is
           happy except Roger, who looks more relieved than anything.

           EXT. UPPER ATMOSPHERE - DAY

           Discovery rumbles through the atmosphere on its way into
           space. Reaching the stratosphere, the rocket boosters DETACH
           and continue upwards until arcing back down toward Earth.

           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - DAY

           Set up for a makeshift celebration. A sign reads: A Banner
           Year 1985. On a table underneath is a space shuttle cake,
           cups and a punch bowl.

           A crowd of Thiokol engineers is gathered in the open hangar.
           They all look obligated to be there. Roger, Bob and Beth are
           among them, but not together.

           HENRY "HANK" LUND (50s), a former athlete turned paunchy
           middle manager, addresses the team on a raised platform.

                                 LUND
                        Great job on our first launch of the
                        year. It's been a pleasure leading
                        this group of engineers. Without you,
                        our success wouldn't be possible.
                        1985 is going to be a banner year,
                        with an increased launch schedule and
                        new contract in the works. As they
                        say, the sky's the limit!

           The crowd politely laughs. Roger rolls his eyes.

                                 LUND (CONT'D)
                        So keep up the great work, and have
                        some cake.

           Smattering of applause. Lund makes his way into the crowd
           lining up for Space Shuttle cake.

           Roger has found Beth and is talking with her alone. Lund
           sees them and comes over. Roger is not thrilled.

                                 LUND
                        Roger. You trying to corrupt the mind
                        of our new hire?
                                 ROGER
                        I was just telling her to watch out
                        for you, so yeah, guess I am.

           Roger heads over for some cake, leaving Lund and Beth alone.

                                 LUND
                        Don't mind him. What Roger lacks in
                        social etiquette he makes up for with
                        his engineering skills.

           Lund puts a hand on Beth's shoulder.

                                 LUND
                        So, you adjusting okay? How was the
                        move from back east?

           Uneasy, Beth takes a step back to disengage. Lund pretends
           not to notice.

                                 BETH
                        Not bad. My husband is still getting
                        used to all the open space. He's a
                        New Yorker through and through.

                                 LUND
                        Well, he's a lucky man. But you'll
                        find we're a very welcoming bunch out
                        here. And if there's anything you
                        need, just let me know.

                                 BETH
                        I appreciate that.

                                 LUND
                        Especially if Roger's giving you
                        trouble. He's the one you have to
                        watch out for.

           Lund puts another hand on her shoulder and walks away.

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

           A rubber DINGHY motors across the waves. Aboard are TWO
           DIVERS in wet suits and a CREW MEMBER manning the outboard
           engine. Anchored behind them is a NASA RECOVERY SHIP.

           Several CREW MEMBERS aboard the recovery ship push the Diver
           Operated Plug (DOP), a large water pump attached to cables,
           over the side and into the ocean.

           The Dinghy stops at a giant white tube bobbing in the ocean.
           One of the SOLID ROCKET BOOSTERS.
           The divers get their gear ready, as the crew member hits the
           switch of a motorized wench that pulls the DOP toward them.

           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - A WEEK LATER

           Separated into sections, the rocket boosters have been
           brought into the large bay and staged. Other ENGINEERS
           prepare for a routine inspection.

           In a white lab coat and surgical mask, Roger enters with a
           camera and clipboard. He waves to the engineers.

           Roger starts taking photos of the SRB. He leans in, snapping
           a few more, but something odd catches his eye.

           He lowers his camera and takes out a pen knife from his
           pocket protector. He digs into the groove on the outside of
           the booster, pulling out black putty on the pen's blade.

           He examines the dark soot. Then starts to carefully pull on
           the inner rubber O-ring that goes around the booster.

           Looking closer, he sees the O-ring is partially frayed, like
           something was eating away at it.

           Roger pulls the O-ring out of the joint, looking closely at
           it as he makes his away around the booster, and lays the
           massive ring on the floor--

           He stops and looks at the O-ring up close, stunned. Roger
           raises his camera and SNAPS several photos.

           INT. DARK ROOM - DAY

           Roger develops the photos of the rocket booster. Dozens are
           pinned to the line drying.

           Roger examines one that shows a close-up of the badly
           damaged O-ring. His concern deepens.

           INT. LABORATORY - DAYS LATER

           Roger is with a LAB CHEMIST, who hands him a file folder.

                                 LAB CHEMIST
                        Heavy amounts of aluminum oxide and
                        other combustion debris mixed in with
                        the epoxy.

                                 ROGER
                        Jesus Christ.

           Roger looks up from the report.
                                 ROGER
                        Not a word of this to anyone.

                                 LAB CHEMIST
                        I have to file my report.

                                 ROGER
                        I need to figure why this happened
                        first, then I'll roll your report
                        into mine. Give me a few days.

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - EVENING

           It's late and employees are leaving for the day. But not
           Roger. He's at his desk poring over calculations and reams
           of data. Roger gets stuck on something and grows frustrated.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           With briefcase in hand, Bob puts on his jacket to leave. As
           he passes Roger's office--

                                 ROGER (O.S.)
                        Bob! Get in here!

           Bob stops in his tracks. He doesn't want to deal with this.

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - SAME

           Bob pokes his head in, reluctant to confront Roger.

                                 BOB
                        I'm going home, so whatever it is,
                        can it wait until tomorrow?

                                 ROGER
                        You have to see this. Please.

           Roger hands him a folder. As Bob flips through--

                                 BOB
                        This is Discovery?

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah. That's the center field joint
                        on the right booster.

           Roger gives him another photo. Bob examines it more closely.

                                 ROGER
                        And that's the primary O-ring.

                                 BOB
                        Almost a third gone? What about
                        damage to the secondary?
                                 ROGER
                        Surface only.

           Bob flips through more. Then he looks up.

                                 BOB
                        Why are you showing me this? Take it
                        to Lund.

                                 ROGER
                        Lund's an asshole. I bring it to him,
                        he'll ignore it.

                                 BOB
                        I don't know what you want from me.
                        Advice? Write your report and hand it
                        off upstairs.

                                 ROGER
                        There's something wrong. I don't want
                        it getting bogged down in meetings
                        and paperwork and all that bullshit.

                                 BOB
                        Honestly, there's not that much here.

           Bob tries to hand back Roger's report, but he won't take it.

                                 ROGER
                        Look at it again. Tell me what
                        would've happened if the secondary
                        ring failed.

                                 BOB
                        I don't know.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, neither do I. And that's what
                        scares me.

                                 BOB
                        But it didn't fail, right?

                                 ROGER
                        Hot gas blew by the primary and
                        almost did the same with the backup.
                        There's soot between the rings. It
                        didn't seal properly. We need to look
                        into this, form a task force or
                        something.

                                 BOB
                        There's your answer. Write a memo and
                        get one started. Good night, Roger.
           Bob hands the file back and walks out.

           INT. STUDY - BOISJOLY HOME - NIGHT

           Roger is at his desk. Roberta enters. He looks up and gives
           her a quick smile before turning back to his work.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You know how I feel about bringing
                        work home with you.

                                 ROGER
                        Something important came up I gotta
                        deal with. I won't be long. What's
                        for dinner?

                                 ROBERTA
                        I just spent hours in parent-teacher
                        meetings. You should be making me
                        dinner.
                               (
                                notices Roger
                                             )
                        What's wrong? You look weighed down.

                                 ROGER
                        Nothing. I'll be along.

           She starts to leave.

                                 ROGER
                        How do you get people to listen?
                                Roberta turns back
                               (
                                                  )
                        It's not something that comes easy
                        for me. I mean, I know I can be off-
                        putting at times.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Abrasive is the word I'd use.

                                 ROGER
                        I gotta get this right the first time
                        or they'll bring up the motor mount
                        thing again. They still bust my balls
                        about that.

           Roberta looks at Roger, understanding.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You need to learn how to be
                        diplomatic. Find a way around instead
                        of charging straight through.

                                 ROGER
                        But the data is all that matters.
                        Politics shouldn't have anything to
                        do with it.
                                 ROBERTA
                        You're working with NASA. There's
                        always going to be politics.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I'll put a Hungry Man in the
                        microwave for you.

           Roberta leaves. Roger leans back to think. Then he opens the
           top drawer of his desk. Finds a folded article under the
           organizer and opens it.

           INSERT ARTICLE

           The front page of the Daily News, March 4, 1974. A headline
           blares in large letters: 346 Die In Paris Jetliner Crash,
           Worst Air Disaster in History.

           Below the headline is a photo of several FIREMEN sifting
           through the wreckage of a downed DC-10 in the woods.

           ROGER suddenly feels his breathing turn shallow and his
           heart race, taking him by surprise. His hands tremble, his
           mind reels--

           Roger jumps up and starts calming himself with strong, quick
           breaths. A practiced technique.

           The attack passes almost as fast as it began. Roger sits
           back down, and hands still shaking, continues to type,
           pretending like nothing happened.

           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - MORTON THIOKOL - TWO WEEKS LATER

           A group of ENGINEERS are gathered to watch the assembly of a
           solid rocket booster. Bob is the one leading the team. All
           wear white scrubs, masks, and beanie caps.

           On a walkway above there's a CROWD of spectators, mainly
           SCHOOL KIDS and TEACHERS.

           Roger makes his way onto the floor, badge on his lapel, and
           finds Lund with other executives. Lund barely glances at
           him. In Roger's hand is a memo.

                                 ROGER
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 LUND
                        Make it quick.

           Roger hands him a memo. Lund barely looks at it.

                                 ROGER
                        I sent this two weeks ago.
                                 LUND
                        See that group of kids up there? They
                        came all the way from Salt Lake to
                        watch us build one of our boosters.

                                 ROGER
                        Did you read this? Look at my report?
                        The photos? Anything?

                                 LUND
                        Yes, and we don't need a task force.
                        We'll address the issue through our
                        standard process.

           Lund hands the memo back to Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        Our process is burying problems in a
                        mountain of bureaucracy.

                                 LUND
                        There hasn't been a launch since
                        January. Two missions were scrubbed
                        this month because Boeing can't get
                        their act together on the IUS. They
                        might lose their contract with NASA.
                        You want us to be like Boeing?

                                 ROGER
                        There's a readiness review with NASA
                        in a couple days. Let me bring it up
                        with them, see what they say.

                                 LUND
                        Roger, you're a brilliant engineer,
                        but we've been down this road before.
                        You spent months on the motor mount,
                        and turned out it was nothing. We
                        have your report, and if we decide
                        it's important enough to raise with
                        NASA, we will. Focus on the next one.

           Lund turns back to watch the assembly crew. Roger can barely
           contain his anger.

                                 ROGER
                        I am focused on the next one.

           Lund ignores him. Roger storms off. From the platform, Bob
           eyes Roger has he leaves.

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD - KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - DAY

           TITLE: Space Shuttle Challenger, STS-51-B, April 29, 1985
           Smoke billows from the rocket boosters. And Challenger
           BLASTS OFF, clearing the tower in a massive display of fire.

           INT. TESTING BAY - DAY

           Roger performs his routine inspection. He takes pictures of
           the inside of the recovered rocket booster sections.

           FLASH! A photo of thick black soot caking the inside of the
           tang, a deep groove that fits a wide clevis.

           FLASH! Now a photo of the primary ring showing heavy damage.

           FLASH! A photo of the other ring, which is partially singed.

           ROGER lowers his camera, eyes intense.

           INT. BOB'S OFFICE - EVENING

           A neat and orderly work space with schematics pinned to the
           wall and a desk that contains only what's necessary.

           Bob is packing his briefcase when Roger crashes inside,
           startling him.

                                 BOB
                        Jesus, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        It happened again.

           Roger hands Bob a folder containing photos and his report.
           Bob goes through the file. Roger paces in front of him,
           running his hand over his bald head. Bob grows uneasy.

                                 BOB
                        I can't focus. Please, sit.

           Roger sits on a nearby sofa, unable to sit still. His starts
           shaking his leg. Bob turns away from him.

           Roger watches intensely. Bob can feel his eyes boring into
           him, as he flips through the pages. Finally, he looks up.

                                 ROGER
                        You agree with me. I can see it.

                                 BOB
                        There's a problem-- potentially.

                                 ROGER
                        We gotta do something.

                                 BOB
                        What happened to your memo?
                                 ROGER
                        In a black hole, like I thought.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        What if the shuttle is more dangerous
                        than we realize? Those astronauts up
                        there have no fucking idea.

                                 BOB
                        We don't know what this means or
                        what's causing it. But you're right,
                        we need to do something.

           Bob stands and leaves, taking the report with him.

           HALLWAY

           Bob moves down the hall with purpose. Roger charges out of
           his office and catches up.

                                 ROGER
                        Where the hell you going?

           INT. BETH'S CUBICLE - EVENING

           Beth wears headphones and listens to Bruce Springsteen on
           her Discman. She's more Born to Run than Born in the USA.

           Bob shows up with Roger. He tries getting Beth's attention,
           but the music is too loud. Bob takes off her headphones.

                                 BETH
                        What the hell?

                                 BOB
                        Sorry. You mind looking at this?

           He hands her Roger's report. Beth goes through it.

                                 BETH
                        What am I looking at?

                                 BOB
                        Roger's findings from Challenger.
                        What do you see?

           Beth flips through.

                                 BETH
                        Significant primary O-ring erosion,
                        soot in the joint-- is this right?

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah. It happened on Discovery, too.
                                 BETH
                        What would cause this?

                                 BOB
                        We don't know. What do you think?

           Beth is surprised to be put on the spot, but dives in.

                                 BETH
                        Okay, so the rings are synthetic
                        rubber made of ethylene dichloride
                        and sodium polysulfide, right? It's
                        supposed to be resistant to anything
                        and seal under any conditions.

                                 ROGER
                        That we know of.

                                 BETH
                        Right. But 4,000 degree gases should
                        seal the rubber almost instantly.

                                 BOB
                        Unless there's some kind of delay.

           Roger turns to Bob. He's onto something. Roger's mind starts
           to race and comes to some realization. He runs out of the
           cubicle farm. Bob and Beth bolt up and follow--

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Roger is digging through stacks of papers, as Bob and Beth
           run in. Bob is completely out of breath--

                                 BOB
                        What is it?

                                 ROGER
                        You just said it. There's a delay.

           Roger finally finds a computer printout and scans it.

                                 ROGER
                        This is it!

                                 BETH
                        What?

                                 ROGER
                        What's the one thing that would cause
                        synthetic rubber to not seal right
                        away under extreme heat?

           Blank stares from Beth and Bob. Roger holds up the printout.
                                 ROGER
                        Cold. Discovery launched in January
                        when it was 53 degrees.

                                 BOB
                        That doesn't make sense. The rings
                        are supposed to seal in temperatures
                        colder than that.

                                 ROGER
                        Theoretically, yes.

           Roger goes to a blackboard, erases what's on it and starts
           scribbling an equation. Bob and Beth watch as Roger finishes
           and circles a fraction: 3/10ths.

           Roger puts down the chalk. Everyone stares at the number.
           Beth knows what she's looking at.

                                 BETH
                        Wow, three-tenths of a second. That's
                        how close the gases came to blowing
                        past the back-up ring.

                                 ROGER
                        That's because the rings were
                        hardened by the cold. If that number
                        increases, who knows what'll happen.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        This is what we need to take to Lund.

           Roger grabs a Polaroid camera and SNAPS a photo of the
           blackboard. He snatches the printouts and hurries into the
           hallway with Bob.

           HALLWAY

           Beth runs out of Roger's office, but Roger turns--

                                 ROGER
                        We can handle it from here.

           Beth stops in her tracks, gut punched, as Roger and Bob
           disappear around the corner.

           INT. LUND'S OFFICE - EVENING

           Roger and Bob charge in, but see Lund has left for the day.

                                 ROGER
                        I know where he lives.
           INT. BOB'S ACCORD, KAYSVILLE UTAH - NIGHT

           Bob and Roger drive through a sedate suburb. Tree-lined
           streets, large homes glowing with warm light, expensive cars
           in the driveway. People here live a good life.

           EXT. LUND'S HOME - NIGHT

           Bob parks out front. Roger get right out. Roger beelines for
           the front door. Bob follows, wary about being here.

           INT. LUND'S HOME, FOYER - NIGHT

           Roger and Bob are waiting in the foyer when Lund comes in
           from the garage wiping engine grease off his hands. His Cal
           Poly shirt is also smudged.

                                 LUND
                        What are you two doing here?

                                 ROGER
                        Surprised to see you still get your
                        hands dirty, Hank.

                                 BOB
                        Cold temperatures are causing blowby.

           Bob hands Lund their findings. Lund reads through the pages,
           glances at photos, including the Polaroid of the equation.
           Finally, he hands it back.

                                 LUND
                        It's inconclusive.

           Roger and Bob are flabbergasted.

                                 BOB
                        Look again. That's the coldest day on
                        record for a launch.

                                 LUND
                        Now he's got you roped into this?

                                 ROGER
                        There's something wrong with the
                        booster, Hank.

           Lund goes through it again. A little more carefully this
           time. His wheels are spinning. Then he finds something.

                                 LUND
                        Here, look. The January launch showed
                        erosion on only one-third the radius
                        of the primary O-ring, while the
                        secondary is intact.

                                 LUND (cont'd)
                        The April launch shows less erosion
                        on the primary. So what's the
                        problem?

                                 ROGER
                        The problem is more blowby occurs the
                        colder it gets. Have you been in
                        management that long you forgot how
                        to be an engineer?

                                 LUND
                        I don't see data here that would give
                        anyone that impression. You're the
                        sealing expert. Did the primary O-
                        ring seal properly?

                                 ROGER
                        No, it didn't. That's why there's
                        black soot in the joint.

                                 LUND
                        But the secondary ring did seal,
                        which acts as a safety in case the
                        primary fails. The system worked.

           Lund hands Roger back his report.

                                 LUND
                        The booster is safe.

                                 ROGER
                        What if it's not? Shouldn't we at
                        least find out for sure?

                                 LUND
                        What do you want me to do, call up
                        NASA and delay the launch schedule?

                                 ROGER
                        Yes!

                                 LUND
                        Goodnight, Roger. Bob.

           Lund turns around and heads back to the garage.

                                 ROGER
                        At least let us have a task force. Me
                        and Bob will run it.

           Lund stops a moment, like he's thinking about it.

                                 LUND
                        We have more launches to prepare for.
           EXT. LUND'S HOME, KAYSVILLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Roger and Bob head back to the car. Bob is perplexed. Roger
           is steaming mad.

                                 ROGER
                        That son of a bitch. It's right in
                        front of his face and he's pretending
                        there's nothing there.

                                 BOB
                        To be fair, it took me a while to
                        believe you.

                                 ROGER
                        Do you? Because your half-assed back-
                        up in there makes me think you don't.

           Bob opens the driver's side door, but doesn't go inside.

                                 BOB
                        I'm not like you, Roger. I don't go
                        charging full steam ahead. I like to
                        win people over to my side. Maybe you
                        should try it.

                                 ROGER
                        Maybe you should try having a little
                        more fucking urgency.

           Roger rips open his door and gets in.

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE, MORTON-THIOKOL - DAY

           Roger sits at his desk frantically typing a memo. His mind
           laser-focused on the task at hand.

           CLOSE ON THE LETTER

           Typebars fly across the screen and land on the page with
           thunderous impact, like a press punching holes in metal.

           On the page reads: The result would be a catastrophe of the
           highest order -- loss of human life.

           ROGER finishes the page and rips it from the carriage. He
           loads another page and continues without skipping a beat.

           INT. BOB'S OFFICE, MORTON-THIOKOL - DAY

           Roger looms over Bob, who reads the memo in his hand.
                                 BOB
                        "It is my honest and very real fear
                        that if we do not take immediate
                        action to dedicate a team to solve
                        the problem with the field joint
                        having the number one priority, then
                        we stand in jeopardy of losing a
                        flight along with all the launch pad
                        facilities."

           Bob stops reading and looks up at Roger.

                                 BOB
                        Don't you think it's a bit overboard?

                                 ROGER
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 BOB
                        We're going over Lund's head straight
                        to Mason. Let's not exaggerate.

                                 ROGER
                        Do you know for sure that blowby
                        won't cause a catastrophic failure?

                                 BOB
                        No--

                                 ROGER
                        Then sign the fucking memo, Bob, so
                        we can get this goddamn task force.

           Feeling the pressure, Bob grabs a pen and signs.

           INT. KITCHEN - BETH'S HOME - MORNING

           A modest single-level home. Beth grabs toast and coffee. Her
           husband, DALE (30s), watches a TV on the counter showing the
           finalists for the Teacher in Space program. He's in a T-
           shirt and shorts, like he's on summer vacation.

                                 BETH
                        What're you up to today?

           Dale shrugs, but says nothing. He's too preoccupied by the
           television.

           ON TV: At a podium, Christa McAuliffe has just been selected
           to go up in the Space Shuttle. She's overcome by emotion.

                                 CHRISTA MCAULIFFE (ON TV)
                        I've made nine wonderful friends over
                        the last few weeks.

                          hen that shuttle goes, there might
                        be one body... but there's gonna be
                        ten souls I'm taking with me.

           Christa steps away from the podium wiping tears. VICE
           PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH gives her comfort.

           DALE is dismayed. Beth puts an arm around him.

                                 BETH
                        You can try again next time.

                                 DALE
                        And go through being a semi-finalist
                        again? No thanks.
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        She deserves it, though. I liked her.
                        Everybody did.

                                 BETH
                               (
                                kisses him
                                          )
                        See you tonight.

           He watches her go and turns back to the TV.

           INT. BEDROOM - EBELING HOME - MORNING

           Bob is in front of the mirror putting on a tie. Once again,
           he looks at the photo of him and his son.

           Bob adjusts the photo, solemn. His daily ritual, and a
           reminder of something deeply painful.

           INT. HALLWAY - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Roger walks down the hall toward his office, briefcase in
           hand. He reaches his office unaware that--

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - SAME

           --inside are Bob, Lund, and two of Thiokol's top executives,
           JERALD MASON (50s, boy scout), and JOE KILMINSTER (50s,
           stiff bureaucrat). Nobody looks happy, least of all Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        What is this, an intervention?

                                 MASON
                        Have a seat, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        I'll stand.

           Kilminster holds up the memo Roger and Bob signed.
                                 KILMINSTER
                        It has both your signatures, but I'm
                        guessing you actually wrote it.

           Roger says nothing. He doesn't need to answer.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        You know this comes at a sensitive
                        time for us. NASA is 60 percent of
                        our revenue.

                                 ROGER
                        How does that help us figure out
                        what's wrong with our product?

                                 MASON
                        Settle down, Roger. Joe and I looked
                        over your findings, and we agree
                        there's a problem.

                                 ROGER
                        You do?

                                 MASON
                        Bob walked us through everything. If
                        what you're saying is true, then
                        that's something we need to bring up
                        with NASA. When the time is right.

                                 ROGER
                        We need to tell them right away.
                        There's a launch scheduled in a few
                        weeks, we need to delay--

                                 MASON
                        There won't be any delays.

                                 ROGER
                        You said you agree with my findings.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        We need to exercise caution here.

                                 ROGER
                        I was clear in the memo. There's a
                        serious risk of catastrophic blowby.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        Nobody's arguing your data, but your
                        conclusions are overwrought. There's
                        no risk of catastrophic failure. And
                        you're going to lead a task force to
                        make sure that's the case.

           Roger turns to Bob for help. Bob is torn between both sides.
                                 BOB
                        We got the task force, Roger.

           Roger deflates.

                                 MASON
                        What did you expect, NASA would stop
                        the shuttle because of how you feel?
                        They have an ambitious schedule. Five
                        more going up this year, 13 in 86.
                        The president is gung-ho on showing
                        the world we're a leader in space
                        again. There's too much at stake. If
                        we argue to delay without proof and
                        turns out we're wrong, heads will
                        roll all over the place.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        So you better make damn sure your
                        data's right before we take it to
                        them. Feel free to back out now if
                        you're not confident.

                                              )
                        I'm a hundred percent.

           Mason and Kilminster share a look.

                                 MASON
                        Then we wish you good luck.

           They leave. Lund trails, giving Roger a look on his way out.

           INT. BUILDING 53 - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Roger, Bob, and two other engineers, ARNIE (40s), a bookish
           mechanical engineer, and BILL (60s), a longtime employee
           nearing retirement, enter.

           The room is being used as storage. Boxed files, old
           equipment covered by dusty sheets, and boxes stuffed with
           glass jars and old Bunsen burners.

                                 ARNIE
                        Could be worse. Could be in Siberia.

           Roger looks around, his disappointment obvious. Then the
           door opens and Beth enters. Heads turn.

                                 ROGER
                        What're you doing here?

                                 BETH
                        This is the task force, right?
                                 ROGER
                        I think we have enough help.

                                 BETH
                        I see a sealing expert, SRB
                        production, mechanical engineering,
                        and an imminent retiree. What I don't
                        see is an expert on fluid mechanics,
                        which you're definitely gonna need to
                        help prove your case.

                                 BOB
                        She's right.

           Roger stares him down, but relents.

                                 ROGER
                        Arnie, take inventory. Bill, map out
                        the launch schedule. Bob and Beth,
                        you're on clean up.

           CLEAN UP MONTAGE:

           In a series of quick cuts, we see:

           - Roger pulls back the dust cover on a large generator that
           has seen better days. He looks disappointed.

           - Beth sweeps the floor. Behind her, Bob wipes down a
           counter top.

           - Bill uses a whiteboard to map out shuttle launches over
           the next year, starting with one going up in July 1985.

           - Roger digs through a box of lab equipment, throwing away
           some of the broken glass jars. He finds a paper bag with
           someone's old rotted lunch at the bottom.

           - Arnie wheels in equipment that they managed to scrounge
           from elsewhere.

           - Beth is mopping the floor. Roger and Bob discuss the
           launch schedule. Arnie and Bill take five.

           EXT. BUILDING 53 - DAY

           Roger carries a box of junk out to the dumpster. He looks
           across the campus at the MAIN BUILDING nearly a half mile
           away across the desert. They really are in Siberia.

           Roger lifts the dumpster lid and tosses the junk inside,
           letting it fall back with a loud thud.
           INT. BUILDING 53 - DAY

           Roger is at the whiteboard. We see there's at least one
           launch for every month of the year.

           Using a red marker, Roger circles two launches scheduled for
           January 1986. He turns to everyone gathered around.

                                 ROGER
                        Five launches left for this year.
                        Challenger goes up next week,
                        Discovery in August. And thanks to
                        Bob, we figured out cold temperatures
                        are causing the primary rings to not
                        seal properly.

           Beth shifts in her seat, annoyed. Roger points to January.

                                 ROGER (CONT'D)
                        But these two are the ones that
                        concern me most. No matter where you
                        are in the U.S., January is always
                        the coldest month.

           Arnie raises his hands.

                                 ROGER
                        This isn't a classroom, Arnie.

                                 ARNIE
                        Didn't April show blowby? Your report
                        says it was warm that day.

                                 BETH
                        Around 73 degrees at launch.

                                 ARNIE
                        If you're saying cold weather's
                        causing it, why's it happening in 73
                        degrees?

                                 ROGER
                        We don't know. But that's why we're
                        here. But so far, the January launch
                        was colder and showed more blowby.

                                 BILL
                        January is when Challenger goes up
                        with that teacher-- what's her name?

                                 BOB
                        Christa McAuliffe.
                                 ROGER
                        We're gonna figure it out before
                        then. But we have to run experiments
                        and give them a mountain of evidence.
                        Then we present it to NASA and get
                        them to delay the launches.

                                 ARNIE
                        The equipment we have is shit. How're
                        we supposed to run experiments?

                                 ROGER
                        I've got recs in for new stuff.
                        Generators, refrigeration units,
                        we'll be up and running soon enough.
                        And when we do, I want answers fast.
                        Before the August launch.

           He circles that in blue.

                                 BILL
                        That's less than a month away.

                                 ROGER
                        Nothing's impossible if you have the
                        conviction you're right.

                                 BILL
                        I've been around a long time, and if
                        you think you're gonna stop NASA from
                        doing what it wants, you're crazy.

                                 ROGER
                        When they see the case we're going to
                        build, they won't have a choice.

                                 BILL
                        Well, good luck with that. Because I
                        don't think it'll matter one bit.

                                 ROGER
                        I think we're done.

           Roger turns away toward the whiteboard, jaw clenched. The
           team breaks to leave, murmuring as they go.

                                 ROGER
                        Not you, Bill.

           Bill comes over, hands in pocket.

                                 BILL
                        Look, I get what you're trying to do
                        here. Really, I do.
                                 ROGER
                        You're off the task force.

                                 BILL
                        What?

                                 ROGER
                        I have enough roadblocks in front of
                        me, I don't need one on my team.

                                 BILL
                        This is outrageous. We just started.

                                 ROGER
                        You're six months away from spending
                        the rest of your days fly fishing in
                        Wyoming. Why are you even here?

                                 BILL
                        Hank asked me.

                                 ROGER
                        So you can keep tabs and tell him
                        what's going on behind my back?

                                 BILL
                        Now you're out of line.

                                 ROGER
                        I don't think I am, Bill.

                                 BILL
                        You were always a son of a bitch, but
                        I never thought you were crazy.

           Bill grabs his coat and leaves. Roger watches him go.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EBELING HOME - NIGHT

           Bob is on the sofa watching an evening magazine show. A
           story about Christa McAuliffe comes on.

           Bob perks up and grabs the remote, turning up the volume.

           A REPORTER does a voiceover while we see images of a
           jubilant McAuliffe becoming Teacher of the Year, the Space
           Shuttle lifting off, astronauts training--

                                 TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                        When it was announced that Christa
                        McAuliffe, the high school teacher
                        from Concord, New Hampshire, would be
                        the first private citizen to ride the
                        Space Shuttle, it propelled her into
                        the national spotlight.
           Now a clip of McAuliffe somewhere outside talking directly
           to the camera. She's a natural.

                                 CHRISTA MCAULIFFE (ON TV)
                        Even now I still can't believe that
                        I'm going to get in the shuttle and
                        it's going to blast off.

           Something about her pulls Bob in. He looks at a photo of his
           son on the mantel. There's a striking similarity between
           them. Same hair and eyes. They could be brother and sister.

           Bob turns back to McAuliffe, now completely transfixed.

           INT. LUND'S OFFICE - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Lund is on the phone. Roger barges in with Bob. Roger holds
           a sheet of pink paper in hand.

                                 ROGER
                        What the hell is this?

           Lund is unnerved by Roger's dramatic entrance.

                                 LUND
                               (
                                into phone
                                          )
                        Let me call you back.
                                hangs up
                               (
                                        )
                        That was my wife.

                                 ROGER
                        You rejected our request for the
                        generators. We need them to cool down
                        the room and test the rings.

                                 LUND
                        They cost tens of thousands of
                        dollars each. We don't have that kind
                        of money to throw around.

                                 ROGER
                        We need to do this experiment, Hank.
                        It's vital to our case.

                                 LUND
                        Find another way.

           Lund picks up the phone, his decision final.

                                 LUND
                        Now can I get back to my wife?

           Roger glares at Bob and storms out.
           HALLWAY

           Roger moves away from Lund's office like a boxer approaching
           the ring. Bob falls into stride next to him.

                                 BOB
                        We'll figure out another way to do
                        the temperature experiment.

           Roger stops and turns to Bob.

                                 ROGER
                        Are you ever gonna be more than just
                        a fly on the wall watching me go up
                        against these guys?

                                 BOB
                        A fly?

                                 ROGER
                        I'm out on a limb in there and you're
                        just staring at your damn shoes.

           Bob is unsettled, but won't let Roger intimidate him.

                                 BOB
                        I don't want to give them an excuse
                        to pull the plug. And you know that's
                        what they're looking for. This is too
                        important. And I'll be damned if I'm
                        going to stand here and let you
                        question my commitment.

           Bob and Roger glare at each other. It's a standoff. Finally,
           Roger breaks it off and walks away.

           EXT. MCFARLAND HOME - DAY

           Bob is at the front door and rings the bell. He waits,
           looking over at the PICKUP TRUCK in the driveway.

           Bob takes a peek through the front window, but pulls away
           when someone unlocks the door. It's Beth.

                                 BETH
                        Hey, what's going on?

                                 BOB
                        Sorry to bother you on a Sunday.

                                 BETH
                        No, it's alright.
           Bob sees a cute FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL behind Beth holding a
           model space shuttle. Her daughter, KATIE. Bob waves hello.
           Katie just stares back.

                                 BOB
                        Hi. That's a nice shuttle. Where'd
                        you get it?

           Silence from Katie.

                                 BETH
                        Sorry, she's being four. We built it
                        ourselves. It's almost an exact
                        replica, right down to the boosters.

                               (
                                 BOB
                                to Katie
                                        )
                        Very impressive. You'll be an
                        engineer just like your mommy.
                               t( o Beth)
                        Listen, I need your help.

           Beth folds her arms. She doesn't seem willing.

                                 BETH
                        I don't know. Dale's not here, and I
                        don't get time with Katie as it is.

                                 BOB
                        It's for the task force.

                                 BETH
                        Where's Roger?

                                 BOB
                        He-- I need your truck. It won't take
                        long, I promise.

                                 BETH
                        Is that all I'm good for?

                                 BOB
                        No. Why would you ask that?

                                 BETH
                        Nothing. It's fine. But Katie has to
                        come with us.

                                 BOB
                        Sure, it'll be fun.

           She opens the door for Bob to come in.
           EXT. SALVAGE YARD - DAY

           Bob and Beth watch as a forklift loads an old INDUSTRIAL
           REFRIGERATION UNIT onto the back of her truck. The unit has
           seen better days.

                                 BETH
                        Does that thing even work?

                                 BOB
                        No, but it's cheap, and I used to be
                        able to fix things like this in my
                        younger days.

           The back of Beth's truck sags heavily when the forklift lets
           go of the unit. Bob goes to the OWNER and pays him cash,
           then rejoins Beth.

                                 BETH
                        What's the point of a task force if
                        you have to use your own money?

           Katie leans out the window.

                                 KATIE
                        Can we go home, Mommy?

                                 BOB
                        Sounds like we're ready.

                               (
                                 BETH
                                        )
                                to Katie
                        In a minute, cupcake.
                                to Bob
                               (
                                      )
                        I didn't want to say anything in
                        front of Katie, but I've been meaning
                        to talk to you.

                                 BOB
                        What about?

                     KATIE
                                                     BETH
           Mommy!
                                            In a minute.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                        Why am I being pushed to the margins
                        by you and Roger?

                                 BOB
                        What? When did we do that?
                                 BETH
                        I had to fight my way onto this task
                        force, and that's only after
                        pretending not to notice my help
                        connecting cold to blowby.

           Bob is taken aback.

                                 BOB
                        I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

                                 BETH
                        You don't know how hard I've worked
                        just to get here in this field.

                                 BOB
                        No, I didn't-- of course, we'll make
                        sure you get proper credit.

                                 BETH
                        I need more than that. You know I'm
                        just as good at what I do as you or
                        Roger. I want to help lead the team.

           Bob sees Katie leaning out the window, almost like she's
           heard them. He turns back to Beth, deadly serious.

                                 BOB
                        You're smart and ambitious, and
                        that's a good thing. But you're also
                        new. This task force isn't a step up,
                        it's likely a step out. So be careful
                        what you wish for.

           Bob heads for the truck. Off Beth, a trace of uncertainty.

           INT. BOISJOLY HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Roger drags himself in after a long day. He sees his
           daughter, LISA (14), digging through the fridge.

                                 ROGER
                        Hey, sweetie.

           Lisa ignores him. She pulls out an apple pie and a knife.

                                 ROGER
                        Mind carving me out a slice?

           Again, she ignores him and puts the pie back in the fridge,
           closing it harder than one normally would before leaving.

                                 ROGER
                        Lisa.
                                 ROBERTA (O.S.)
                        You missed her swim meet.

           Roberta enters from the back porch with an empty wine glass.

                                 ROGER
                        I completely forgot. I'm sorry.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Don't apologize to me.

                                 ROGER
                        Look, I told you this task force is
                        going to consume everything.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Including us?

                                 ROGER
                        C'mon, 'Berta. This is critical work
                        we're doing.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You're under enormous pressure. I get
                        it. But that doesn't mean this family
                        has to suffer for it.

                                 ROGER
                        I've made decisions that cost
                        hundreds of lives... have you? So
                        what if I miss a few swim meets or
                        Sunday dinners, I'm not making that
                        mistake again.

                                 ROBERTA
                        Go be an absent father and husband if
                        that means saving lives, but you
                        don't be an ass about it.

           Roberta moves away.

           EXT. EBELING HOME - NIGHT

           Darlene exits the back door and heads to the garage with a
           cup of steaming coffee. A light glows inside the garage.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Bob kneels on the ground working on the unit with a socket
           wrench. He struggles to twist off a stuck bolt, sweat
           soaking his T-shirt.

           Bob puts his weight into it and finally pries the bolt
           loose. He stands up and wipes the sweat from his brow.
           Then he looks over to the workbench, where the photo of him
           and his son rests. Bob looks at it a moment, before getting
           back to work.

           At the door, Darlene is inside, having witnessed the scene.
           She puts down the coffee on a table and quietly leaves.

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Roger is at a blackboard scribbling calculations, exhausted,
           but focused on the task at hand. Someone KNOCKS on his door.

                                 ROGER
                        What?!

           Roger turns to see his SECRETARY in the doorway.

                                 SECRETARY
                        You need to do these sign-offs.
                               (
                                         )
                                off Roger
                        For Discovery on Monday.

                                 ROGER
                        Just leave them.

           The secretary puts them on his desk. As she leaves--

                                 SECRETARY
                        You should get some sleep.

                                 ROGER
                        I'll sleep when I'm dead.

           Roger turns back to the board. His hand quivers as he starts
           to write. Frustrated, Roger takes in a few powerful breaths
           and starts writing again.

           INT. BETH'S CUBICLE - DAY

           Headphones on, Beth is busy with paperwork when she sees
           Lund make his way into the cube farm. She keeps her head
           down, not wanting to attract his attention.

           But it doesn't matter, because Lund beelines for her anyway.
           He leans against the side of her cubicle.

                                 LUND
                        Got a second? I have some good news.

                                 BETH
                        Sure. What's up?

                                 LUND
                        I'm moving you to the guided missile
                        program, starting immediately.
                                 BETH
                        Wait, the H.A.R.M.? Why? My
                        experience is in the shuttle.

                                 LUND
                        We need somebody in fluid mechanics
                        over there and I thought of you.
                                        )
                               (
                                off Beth
                        Don't thank me too much.

                                 BETH
                        No, it's just unexpected.

                                 LUND
                        This could be a career maker. You'll
                        be on the ground floor of something
                        that'll be a major part of our
                        business down the road.

                                 BETH
                        What about the task force?

                                 LUND
                        The H.A.R.M. is your priority now.
                        I'll get your clearances right away.

           Lund squeezes her shoulder as he leaves. A cold chill goes
           through Beth.

           ARCHIVE TELEVISION NEWS FOOTAGE

           On screen is ABC's TED KOPPEL at the anchor desk.

           TITLE: August 27, 1985

                                 TED KOPPEL
                        Despite delays, and denials from
                        officials that NASA violated launch
                        guidelines, Space Shuttle Discovery
                        went into orbit today, the 20th
                        successful mission of the program.

           Next we see BOB SCHIEFFER of CBS talking to camera...

                                 BOB SCHIEFFER
                        Two previous launches were scrubbed
                        this week, one due to bad weather and
                        the other because the backup orbiter
                        computer needed to be replaced.

           And now ROGER MUDD on NBC...
                                 ROGER MUDD
                        With a storm front moving in,
                        Discovery was on the verge of being
                        delayed a third time. But NASA
                        decided to go ahead, leading to
                        accusations they put the lives of the
                        astronauts at unnecessary risk.

           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - DAY

           Once again Roger does his post-launch inspection. Taking
           photos and copious notes.

           And again, he finds black soot between the O-rings. Only now
           he's more resigned. This is becoming routine.

           INT. BUILDING 53 - EVENING

           Roger and Arnie perform a resilience test on a fresh piece
           O-ring that Roger removes from the freezer.

           Roger clamps the piece into a pendulum block stand, lets the
           hammer drop. Arnie records the needle movement.

                                 ARNIE
                        Twenty three percent. That's the
                        highest yet.

                                 ROGER
                        This doesn't prove anything. We
                        need to know how long it's taking the
                        rings to seal.

                                 ARNIE
                        Then we need to add heat.

                                 ROGER
                        You got a way to apply 4,000 degrees
                        to this, I'm all ears.

           Bob enters looking flustered. Roger is annoyed.

                                 ROGER
                        You're late.

                                 BOB
                        I have a half dozen other projects
                        I'm working on.

           Bob lets his briefcase drop and removes his jacket. He's not
           in the mood to battle Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        Where's Beth? I haven't seen her in
                        almost a week.
                                 BOB
                        You didn't hear? She was reassigned
                        to the guided missile program.

                                 ROGER
                        What? When?

                                 BOB
                        Last week. I thought you knew.

           Roger grabs his jacket to leave, but Bob stops him.

                                 BOB
                        Don't you see what he's doing? He's
                        itching for a reason to pull the
                        plug. Don't give it to him.

                                 ROGER
                        We've been at this for weeks and have
                        nothing to show. We have no
                        equipment, no time, no support from
                        management. We just spin our wheels
                        doing bullshit resilience tests like
                        we're in high school physics!

           Bob holds up his hands trying to placate Roger.

                                 BOB
                        I have a plan.

                                 ROGER
                        Does it involve punching Lund in the
                        face?

                                 BOB
                        Just listen. I bought a refrigeration
                        unit. It's old and broken down, but I
                        can get it to work. We can use it to
                        cool down a section of the booster
                        and test fire it under proper
                        conditions. I just need more time.

                                 ROGER
                        You did that all on your own without
                        telling me?

                                 BOB
                        Yes, I did.

           Roger smiles and pats him on the back. He puts down his coat
           and gets back to work.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Several ENGINEERS are at the table, including Bob. Lund is
           at the end waiting to start the meeting. There's tension in
           the air. Concerned looks and hushed conversation.

           Impatient, he checks his watch right as Roger enters. Lund
           gives him a look. As Roger sits--

                                 LUND
                        Now we can get started. I'll make
                        this quick. And none of this leaves
                        this room. The rumors you've been
                        hearing are true. NASA has opened
                        bidding to to see if our competitors
                        can build an SRB cheaper.

           Murmurs and worried looks around the table.

                                 LUND
                        But that doesn't mean we're losing
                        the contract. They're playing
                        hardball to drive down our bid,
                        because everyone knows we have no
                        competition for our SRB.

                                 ROGER
                        That's not true. Hercules makes a
                        damn good product. And from what I
                        hear, they've already underbid us.

           Heads turn toward Roger. Lund glares.

                                 LUND
                        Perhaps you'd like to work for them
                        instead?

                                 ROGER
                        Excuse me?

                                 BOB
                        Let's get back to what you were
                        saying, Hank.

                                 LUND
                        It's okay, Bob. Roger's a big boy.
                        Seems to me he has Hercules'
                        interests more at heart than ours.
                        That right, Roger?

                                 ROGER
                        I've given eleven years of my life to
                        this company.
                                 BOB
                                glaring at Roger
                                                )
                               (
                        Hank, please.

                                 LUND
                        I was saying NASA is 60 percent of
                        our revenue and Roger would love
                        nothing more than to see Thiokol lose
                        out to our competition.

           Roger bolts up from the table.

                                 ROGER
                        I'm trying to save this company from
                        disaster, goddammit!

                                 LUND
                        You're jeopardizing this company's
                        future. What do you think is gonna
                        happen if we lose NASA?

                                 ROGER
                        There won't be a future if you keep
                        sending people up there on the back
                        of a time bomb!

                                 LUND
                        It's a bomb now. Don't you think
                        that's a bit of an exaggeration,
                        Roger? What exactly have you proven
                        these past six weeks? Because I
                        haven't seen a goddamn thing!

           Roger has had enough and storms out. Bob stares at the
           table, as the tension starts to dissipate.

                                 LUND
                        Now, as I was saying...

           Bob gathers his things and gets. Heads turn in his
           direction, everyone surprised.

                                 LUND
                        That's right, Bob. Follow him out.
                        It's only your career.

           Bob ignores him and leaves the conference room.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Bob looks both ways for Roger and finds him turning a
           corner. He hustles after him and takes the same turn--

                                 BOB
                        Roger!
           Roger ignores him and shoves through the front doors--

           EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE - MORTON THIOKOL - SAME

           Roger heads for the parking lot, but suddenly stops,
           clutching his chest, breathing out of control.

           Roger does his breathing trick and calms down, but now looks
           deeply worried. The attacks are getting worse.

           INT. BOISJOLY HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Wearing his track suit, Roger is alone eating apple pie
           straight from the tin when the phone RINGS. He ignores it
           and the answering machine picks up.

                                 BOB (ON MACHINE)
                        Roger, it's Bob. You there?

                               (
                                 ROGER
                                mouth full
                                          )
                        Go fuck yourself, Bob.

                                 BOB (ON MACHINE)
                        Call me when you get this-- better
                        yet, just come over. You need to see
                        this. Tonight. What I have to show
                        you will change everything. I
                        promise, we're finally gonna get them
                        to listen. Just come over right away.
                                then
                                    )
                               (
                        And I'm sorry.

           Bob hangs up. Roger puts the pie down, thinking about it.

           INT. GARAGE - EBELING HOME - NIGHT

           Bob is busy at work on the refrigeration unit.

                                 ROGER (O.S.)
                        You don't have that piece of shit
                        working yet?

           Bob startles and turns around.

                                 BOB
                        You scared the hell out of me.

                                 ROGER
                        I have that effect.

           Bob grabs a rag to wipe his hands, exuding excitement.
                                 BOB
                        I'm glad you came. Because you are
                        about to witness a true miracle in
                        modern times. Ready?

           Roger gestures-- Get on with it. Bob plugs the unit into an
           outlet and flips a switch. With a cough and flickering of
           the garage lights-- the unit turns on!

           Bob whoops and claps. Even Roger is impressed. The unit
           makes a hell of a noise.

                                 BOB
                        That's it!

                                 ROGER
                        Very good, Bob. Now can you shut it
                        off so I can hear myself think?

           Bob flips the switch and the unit sputters off.

                                 BOB
                        All we have to do is find a way to
                        use this thing.

                                 ROGER
                        There is no 'we' right now.

           Bob loses his excitement, knowing Roger has bad news.

                                 BOB
                        Did they fire you?

                                 ROGER
                        No, but if Lund keeps up this
                        bullshit, I'm gonna quit.

                                 BOB
                        Don't, okay? We need to keep trying.

           Roger's mood darkens and looks a Bob.

                                 ROGER
                        Why did you follow me out?

                                 BOB
                        I wanted Lund to know you weren't in
                        this alone.

                                 ROGER
                        But then you went back in, right?

           Bob doesn't answer. Roger nods and looks at the unit.
                                 ROGER
                        There's no way in hell this thing's
                        cooling down a booster. We have to
                        test something smaller.

           Roger leaves.

           EXT. TEST-FIRE RANGE - DAY

           A group of hard hat engineers are gathered around to watch
           the test firing of a mounted GUIDED MISSILE. Beth is among
           them, clipboard in hand. Everyone stands far back.

           Roger and Bob show up and grab hard hats off a table. They
           approach Beth, taking space on either side of her.

                                 ROGER
                        Long time, no see.

                                 BETH
                        I'm sorry about the task force. I
                        really didn't have a choice.

                                 ROGER
                        We're not here about that.

                                 BETH
                        Then what do you want?

           Roger and Bob exchange a look.

                                 BOB
                        We need to borrow a missile.

           EXT. TEST-FIRE FACILITY - NIGHT

           Bob uses a forklift to unload the refrigeration unit off
           Beth's truck. Nearby is a 20x20 testing bay. A large canopy
           with the tail end of a guided missile sticking out.

           He puts the unit down next to the testing bay and climbs
           down. Arnie comes over.

                                 ARNIE
                        Why aren't we using this on one of
                        the SRBs?

                                 BOB
                        Because the unit won't cool a room
                        big enough to house one. The H.A.R.M.
                        has the exact same O-ring design.

                                 ARNIE
                        But it doesn't use the same fuel.
                                 BOB
                        We're testing whether or not the O-
                        rings seal properly, that's all.

           They begin hooking the unit up to the testing bay, as Roger
           and Beth emerge from inside.

                                 BETH
                        You have no idea how much trouble
                        I'll get into for this.

                                 ROGER
                        We'll take the hit, I promise.
                               (
                                to Bob
                                      )
                        We ready?

           Bob attaches a wide hose, cranks up a gasoline generator and
           turns on the unit. It starts pumping cool air inside. The
           temperature gauge outside reads 62 degrees.

                                 BOB
                        All set.

                                 ARNIE
                        Now what?

           Roger rolls out a sleeping bag on the back of the truck.

                                 ROGER
                        Wake me when it gets down to 40.

           Roger climbs in and crashes.

           HOURS LATER

           A gorgeous purple and orange dawn breaks out across the
           desert horizon.

           Roger SNORES. Someone off-screen shakes him. He wakes up
           with a snort and looks up to see Bob, almost angelic in the
           soft light.

                                 BOB
                        It's time.

           Roger shakes off the cobwebs and gets up.

           TEST FACILITY

           Bob emerges from the facility and reads the gauge.

                                 BOB
                        Gauge reads forty degrees.
           Roger writes it down and they join the others near the
           control panel a hundred yards away. Beth is ready to hit the
           switch. Arnie keeps a nervous eye on the road behind them.

                                 BOB
                        Whenever you're ready.

                                 BETH
                        Goggles on, please.

           Everyone puts on plastic goggles and braces themselves. Beth
           takes a breath and hits a red button--

           The missile IGNITES. Bright orange flame and thick smoke
           erupt from the back of the testing bay--

           Which EXPLODES in massive ball of flame and smoke!

           Everyone drops to the ground and covers their heads, as
           debris rains all around them.

           Beth reaches up and turns off the control panel. Doesn't
           matter, the unit and generator both go up in flames.

           Roger gets to his feet, stunned.

                                 ROGER
                        Holy shit!

           Bob is still in shock, shaking his head as he watches the
           smoke rise from the decimated testing bay.

                                 BOB
                        I'll be damned.

           Beth steps forward and runs toward the wreckage.

                                 ROGER
                        Where you going?

                                 BETH
                        My truck!

           Beth reaches her truck, sees the windows shattered,
           windshield cracked, and charred paint on the left side.
           She's distraught. The others run up to join her.

                                 BETH
                        You asshole!

                                 ROGER
                        This is fantastic!

                                 ARNIE
                        Why are you so happy?
                                 ROGER
                        We just showed what'll happen if the
                        O-rings freeze on a booster!

                                 BOB
                               (
                                realizing
                                         )
                        What did we just do?

           The wail of approaching FIRE ENGINES can be heard in the
           distance. Everyone freezes, knowing they're fucked.

           EXT. TEST-FIRING FACILITY - LATER

           FIREFIGHTERS finish putting out the fire. All that's left
           are charred remains. And Beth's battered truck.

           Roger and Bob stand before Mason and Lund like scolded
           children. Nearby, Kilminster reams Beth and Arnie.

                                 ROGER
                        I take full responsibility.

                                 MASON
                        Jesus Christ, Roger. What on Earth
                        made you think this was okay?

                                                     MASON
                     ROGER
           I know it was foolish--
                                            It was moronic.

                                 ROGER
                        If you would just look at the
                        results, you'll find we did prove
                        cold temperatures prevent the rings
                        from sealing properly inside a test-
                        firing environment.

                                 LUND
                        It doesn't have the same mechanics
                        and fuel properties as the SRB. It's
                        not the same thing.

                                 ROGER
                        They have the same O-ring
                        configuration in the joints.

                                 MASON
                               (
                                to Bob
                                      )
                        You're supposed to be the sensible
                        one. What the hell do you have to say
                        for yourself?

                                 BOB
                        Roger's right, our system might not
                        work in cold temperatures. At least
                        this shows we need more testing.
                                 MASON
                        You've been at this two months and
                        all you've done is waste a hundred
                        thousand dollar missile and burn down
                        a test bay.

                                 BOB
                        You've handcuffed us the whole time!
                        Budget, equipment, manpower... we
                        couldn't get the job done. Are you
                        really that shocked we did this?!

           Mason is taken aback by Bob's anger. So is Roger. Bob calms
           down, as Mason who looks to Lund.

                                 LUND
                        We're pulling the plug.

                                 ROGER
                        Why? We just showed you--

                                 LUND
                        You didn't prove anything, Roger.

                                 MASON
                        Enough. We'll reconvene on Monday.
                        Both of you, go home.

           Mason goes to join Kilminster. Roger glares at Lund.

                                 ROGER
                        You used to be one of us. What
                        happened?

           Lund says nothing and follows Mason. Roger and Bob look at
           Beth, who's giving them a withering look.

           INT. OUTLAW BAR & GRILL - NIGHT

           A country dive. Wood paneling, heavy smoke, BARFLIES
           drinking by themselves, Conway Twitty on the jukebox.

           Bob and Roger are at the bar. Roger downs a Scotch and waves
           at the BARTENDER for another.

                                 BOB
                        Don't you think you've had enough?

                                 ROGER
                        Who're you, my mother?

           Bob looks away, as the bartender pours. Roger notices a
           GRUFF BARFLY across the way and eyes him a minute.
                               (
                                 BOB
                                to bartender
                                            )
                        I'll have coffee.

                               (
                                 ROGER
                                holds up drink
                                              )
                        A toast. To that guy across the bar.

           The Barfly gives him a confused look, but holds up his drink
           anyway. Roger downs his Scotch.

                     BOB
           Let me take you home--
                                                     ROGER
                                            Drink with me.

                                 BOB
                        You've had enough.

                                 ROGER
                        Siddown, I'm juz getting started.

                                 BOB
                        I am sitting.

           Roger looks at Bob, then holds up his glass for another. The
           bartender obliges.

                                 ROGER
                        I ever tell you why?

                                 BOB
                        Why what? What are you talking about?

                                 ROGER
                        Grief. You know what it's like to
                        live with grief?

           Bob turns away, not wanting to answer.

                                 ROGER
                        Wouldn't wish it on anybody. Not even
                        Lund. The regret of knowing you
                        could'a stopped something terrible
                        from happening, but you didn't. The
                        constant anguish you're forced to
                        live with after you fail to stop
                        people from dying. That's grief.

           Bob stares at his coffee.

                                 BOB
                        I know what grief is.

           Bob looks over with something to say, but seeing Roger's
           about to fall off his stool, he changes his mind.
                                 BOB
                        We should go.

                                 ROGER
                        Fine. But one more toast...
                               (
                                loud
                                    , to Barfly)
                        To that fucking guy.

           The Barfly, now pissed, gets off his stool and approaches
           them in a hurry. Bob holds up his hands.

                     BARFLY
           What's his problem?
                                                     BOB
                                            He's drunk, and we're
                                            leaving.

                                 ROGER
                        What, you don't like toasts?

                                 BARFLY
                        You don't wanna do this, pal.

                                 ROGER
                        What kind'a asshole don't like
                        toasts?

           The Barfly pushes Roger off his stool, but Roger grabs his
           shirt and pulls the Barfly toward him--

           Both are on their feet, pushing and falling into each other
           in a sloppy old-man fight more pathetic than exciting--

           Bob tries to wedge between them, but gets pushed to the
           ground. The rest of the bar watches with mild interest.
           Bartender doesn't bother to intervene.

           The Barfly manages to pull Roger's shirt over his head,
           causing him to stumble to the ground. Bob is back on his
           feet and stops the barfly from doing anything else--

                                 BOB
                        Please, that's enough. I'll get him
                        out of here.

                                 BARFLY
                        You better before I kick his ass some
                        more.

           Bob reaches down to help Roger up, but Roger throws his arm
           out, not wanting it. He gets up and staggers out of the bar
           on his own power.

           INT. BEDROOM - ROGER'S HOME - MORNING

           Roberta enters the dark room and pulls open the curtains,
           forcing harsh sunlight to pour in.
           A hungover Roger pries his eyes open and recoils at the rude
           awakening.

                                 ROGER
                        What time d'I get home?

                                 ROBERTA
                        Bob dragged you in after one. He told
                        me everything.

                                 ROGER
                        Mind filling me in?

                               (
                                 ROBERTA
                                sits next to him
                                                )
                        I know you think you're the only one
                        who can fight this. You have all the
                        answers and everyone else is just in
                        your way. But it's not about you,
                        Roger. Put your ego aside and let
                        others help you.

                                 ROGER
                        Can I get a glass of water?

           Roberta reaches over to the nightstand and hands one already
           waiting for him. Roger drinks, appreciative.

           INT. KITCHEN - EBELING HOME - MORNING

           The small TV on the counter is tuned to a weekend morning
           show, where the host interviews Christa McAuliffe.

           Darlene enters and notices Bob's fixation on McAuliffe.

                                 DARLENE
                        I know she's attractive, Bob, but you
                        don't have to be so obvious.

           Darlene smiles at him as she makes coffee.

                                 BOB
                        That's not what I'm thinking.

                                 DARLENE
                        Then what is it? Every time she's on
                        TV, you're off somewhere else.

                                 BOB
                        I don't know why but every time I see
                        her I think about Luke.

           She darkens, and sits next to him.
                                 DARLENE
                        Don't do this to yourself. It wasn't
                        your fault. Nobody blames you, least
                        of all me. There's nothing anyone
                        could have done.

                                 BOB
                        What if it happens again? What if she
                        goes up in that Shuttle and something
                        happens because I didn't do enough?

                                 DARLENE
                        That's not going to happen.

                               (

                                 )
                        The shuttle's not safe.
                                realizing
                               (
                                         )
                        I'm sorry.

                                 DARLENE
                        You're under a lot of stress. But I
                        know you'll do the right thing. You
                        always do.

           INT. BOB'S GARAGE - DAY

           Bob is at his workbench carving a bird from a block of wood.
           So far he has the head and beak of a humming bird. Nearby is
           what's left of the unit covered by a tarp.

           Bob, lost in the thought, cuts too close to the beak and
           cuts it off. He throws down his carving knife, frustrated,
           then looks over at the unit. An idea forms.

           EXT. FRONT LAWN - BOISJOLY HOME - MORNING

           Still looking rough, Roger sweats buckets as he mows the
           lawn. A CAR pulls up and parks in front. It's Bob. Roger
           shuts off the mower, as Bob approaches.

                                 BOB
                        You look better than I thought.

                                 ROGER
                        Thanks for bringing me home in one
                        piece. Roberta thanks you, too. I'm
                        just glad I don't remember much.

                                 BOB
                        Listen, I came here to apologize.

                                 ROGER
                        Apologize for what?
                                 BOB
                        I should've believed you right away.
                        I'm sorry. Maybe if I backed you
                        sooner, we'd be in a different boat.

                                 ROGER
                        You did what you thought was right. I
                        respect that. Not like it matters.
                        We're both gonna get fired Monday.

                                 BOB
                        I'm not going to let that happen.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I need you to bring me copies of
                        everything you have and come by my
                        office first thing.

                                 ROGER
                        What for?

                                 BOB
                        Just do it. I'll see you Monday.

           Bob turns back to his car.

                                 ROGER
                        What did you mean when you said you
                        know about grief?

           Bob stops and takes a long moment.

                                 BOB
                        I had a son.

                                 ROGER
                        I'm sorry. I didn't know.

           Bob forces a smile and gets in his car.

           INT. BOB'S OFFICE - THIOKOL - DAY

           Bob is on the phone when Roger enters with file in hand.

                               (
                                 BOB
                                on phone
                                        )
                        Yeah, I've got it right now. You near
                        a fax machine?

           Bob holds out a hand. Roger gives him a file and an
           inquiring look. Bob intuits the question.

                               (
                                 BOB
                                cups receiver
                                             )
                        Friend at NASA.
           Roger nods.

                                 ROGER
                        You alright?

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, fine.
                               (
                                into phone
                                          )
                        You ready? I'm sending it now.

           Bob turns around and starts loading pages into the fax.

           INT. MASON'S OFFICE - THIOKOL - DAY

           There's a KNOCK on the door. Lund pokes his head in and
           finds Kilminster with Mason. Both are on edge.

                                 LUND
                        You wanted to see me?

                                 MASON
                        We just got a call from NASA. They
                        got Roger's memos and reports.

                                 LUND
                        Son of a bitch.

           INT. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY

           Bob and Roger sit in front of Mason and Kilminster. Lund
           looms behind. Kilminster is mid-tirade--

                                 KILMINSTER
                        This makes us look like we're hiding
                        something, when truth is we have no
                        idea why it's happening!

                                 ROGER
                        Just go ahead and fire us.

           Mason looks at Lund. Lund swallows his pride.

                                 LUND
                        You're not getting fired.

           Bob and Roger are stunned.

                                 LUND
                        NASA wants you to go to the Cape and
                        help them figure out the problem.

                                 MASON
                        Congratulations, you got them to
                        listen after all.
                                 KILMINSTER
                        Now leave before we find a way to
                        change their minds.

           Roger and Bob get up, ignoring Lund on the way out. But Bob
           stops before they leave. Roger gets nervous.

                                 BOB
                        We do have one request.

           INT. KITCHEN - MCFARLAND HOME - NIGHT

           Dale, wearing an apron, makes dinner. Beth has just gotten
           home from work and looks tired.

                                 BETH
                        It's just for a few weeks. That okay?

                                 DALE
                        Yeah, fine.

                                 BETH
                        You don't seem fine.

                                 DALE
                        It's great. I'm happy for you.

           The timer RINGS. A little on edge, Dale shoves on mitts and
           takes a pot roast out of the oven. Juice splatters all over
           the stove.

                                 DALE
                        Dammit!

                                 BETH
                        What's wrong?

                                 DALE
                        Nothing.
                               (

                                    )
                        That's not true. This isn't what I
                        want.

                                 BETH
                        What's not?

                                 DALE
                               (
                                gesturing to apron
                                                  )
                        This... Mr. Mom crap. I can't do it
                        anymore. I want to go back to work.

                                 BETH
                        What do you want me to say? You can't
                        find a job and there's nobody to take
                        care of Katie.
           Angry, Dale throws off his mitts and leaves the kitchen.
           Beth knows right away she screwed up.

           A pot on the stove boils over. Beth jumps into action and
           turns off the burner. Then she spots Katie on the stairwell.
           Katie runs up to her room.

                                 BETH
                               (

                        Shit.

           EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           A bright sunny day in central Florida. Palm trees and a warm
           breeze. A TWA flight land on the runway.

           INT. CAB - DRIVING - DAY

           Roger, Bob and Beth arrive by cab to Cape Canaveral, moving
           past the launch pads and Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB).

           Beth stares, mouth agape. She's never see the buildings in
           person before and is in complete awe.

           Roger doesn't bother to look. He's too busy going over
           paperwork. Bob is lost in thought.

           Beth catches a glimpse inside the VAB and leans forward--

           BETH'S POV: The Space Shuttle Atlantis stands upright on a
           platform with the fuel tank and two SRBs.

                                 BETH
                        Amazing.

                                 ROGER
                        Forgot, it's your first time. Just
                        remember we got a job to do.

           Beth leans back, her view of Atlantis now gone.

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY

           Roger, Bob and Beth exit the cab outside the administrative
           offices near the assembly building.

           There to greet them is their NASA counterpart, ALLEN COBB
           (30s), a bookish engineer with a buzz cut.

           Allen greets them with a pleasant smile and firm handshake.

                                 ALLEN
                        Welcome to the Cape. I'm Allen Cobb,
                        chief engineer on the shuttle.
                                 BOB
                        Bob Ebeling.

                                 BETH
                        Beth McFarland.

           Roger just glares. Allen smiles through it.

                                 ALLEN
                        I know you guys are eager to dive
                        right in. Let me introduce you around
                        and we'll get to work.

           Allen heads inside. They follow him in.

           INT. HALLWAY - CAPE ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES - DAY

           The four head down the hallway. Framed photos line the
           walls, including Kennedy inspecting the Apollo in '63.

                                 ALLEN
                        There's nothing more important than
                        the safety of our astronauts, which
                        is why we want you to get to the
                        bottom of this as quickly as
                        possible. You'll have everything you
                        need. Manpower, equipment, full
                        access to facilities. Just ask.

           Roger doesn't look convinced, but keeps his powder dry.

                                 ALLEN
                        We have a pre-flight meeting for
                        Thursday's launch in a couple hours.

                                 BOB
                        Then we better get started.

           EXT. GRANDSTAND - LAUNCH COMPLEX PRESS SITE - DAY

           TITLE: Space Shuttle Atlantis, STS-51-J, October 3, 1985

           Roger, Bob and Beth are among a smattering of REPORTERS in
           the press seats observing the launch. The seats are quarter
           filled at best. The Reporters look bored and uninterested.

           On the field is a giant digital COUNTDOWN CLOCK that ticks
           down the final minutes to the launch of Atlantis.

                                 BETH
                        Look at this. Nobody cares.

           She's right. The countdown clock hits 60 seconds and the
           press basically ignores it. There's zero excitement.
                                 ROGER
                        Now you know why they're putting that
                        teacher into space.

           Roger's hand shakes in his lap. Bob notices, but doesn't say
           anything.

           Smoke starts to billow as the countdown clock goes from 10
           to 5...4...3...2... and the Shuttle lifts off in a
           thunderous display of white smoke.

           Roger breathes a sigh of relief when the shuttle clears the
           tower. The Reporters start to file out right away. Roger,
           Bob and Beth stay to watch the shuttle disappear into space.

           INT. TESTING BAY - CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY

           Roger does an inspection on the dissembled rocket boosters.
           This time, Allen and a team of ENGINEERS hover over him.

           Roger feels them breathing down his neck, his brow beading
           with sweat as he goes through his process of inspecting the
           inside of the joint.

           But as he does, Roger notices that the epoxy between the two
           O-rings is a healthy beige. There's no black soot.

           Now examining the rings, he sees that there is barely any
           erosion on the primary ring. And the secondary ring is in
           good condition.

           Roger looks up at Allen. He takes off his hard hat.

                                 ROGER
                        That's all eight. No blowby.

                                 ALLEN
                        That's good.

           Roger nods, but looks conflicted.

           INT. EQUIPMENT FACILITY - DAYS LATER

           Roger, Bob and Beth inspect several large modern AIR
           REFRIGERATION UNITS.

                                 ROGER
                        These make that hunk of shit you
                        bought look even sadder.

           Bob shakes his head. Beth smiles.
           INT. TEST-FIRING FACILITY - DAY

           A large open-air hangar where NASA regularly test fires
           rocket engines. Roger, Bob and Beth inspect the area, with
           Allen looking on.

                                 BETH
                        Can you close the bay door?

                                 ALLEN
                        We need to keep it open so the
                        exhaust can escape.

           Bob looks around some more, then he turns to Roger and Beth.

                                 BOB
                        It'll work with a few adjustments.

                                 ALLEN
                        Just know if you scrap the test we're
                        not doing it again. It costs a lot of
                        money and our budget is already
                        stretched thin.

                                 BETH
                        You said we'd have everything we
                        need.

                                 ALLEN
                        Within reason.

           DAYS LATER

           Another booster is mounted inside the facility. On a
           platform, Bob and Beth inspect both sides of an insulated
           casing surrounding the rocket.

           On the ground, Roger and Allen watch. Allen looks on with
           growing apprehension.

                                 ALLEN
                        When does blowby supposed to occur?

                                 ROGER
                        Point six-three seconds.

           Allen turns away. Bob nods to Beth, who nods back, and leans
           over the rail and gives a thumbs up.

           Roger turns to a WORKER manning the refrigeration units with
           hoses attached to the casing. He gives him a thumbs up.

           The worker POWERS ON the units. A large metallic HUM
           reverberates through the facility.
           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAYS LATER

           A separate facility connected to the test-firing bay via
           closed circuit TV.

           Roger, Bob and Beth look on away from Allen and his team. A
           temperature gauge reads 40-degrees. Bob turns to Roger.

                                 BOB
                        Same temperature as the H.A.R.M.

           Roger nods. Bob turns to the IGNITION ENGINEER and gives her
           the okay. The rocket booster ignites, sending flame and
           smoke out the sides of the building.

           But again, the rocket burns itself out. No smoke or gas gets
           released from the joint.

           Roger throws down his clipboard. Allen talks with other
           ENGINEERS. Head shakes and growing disappointment.

           INT. TEST-FIRING FACILITY - LATER

           Roger inspects the separated sections of the booster wearing
           his disappointment on his sleeve. That can only mean one
           thing: no blowby.

           Roger steps away past Allen, who turns and watches him go.

           EXT. BEACH - EVENING

           Roger gets his miles in on the beach, a gorgeous sun setting
           to his left.

           Unlike when we saw him running in Utah, Roger struggles to
           keep stride and pace.

           Roger WHEEZES and COUGHS, and finally stops to catch his
           breath. He looks off down the beach and sees the silhouette
           of the Vehicle Assembly Building in the distance.

           Determined, Roger takes several sharp, angry breaths and
           starts running again.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           Bob nurses a beer alone at the end of the bar, lost in his
           thoughts. He sees something on the TV above the bar and
           becomes instantly transfixed.

           A NEWS REPORT ON TV

           Christa McAuliffe is in a blue NASA flight suit doing zero-
           gravity training aboard an aircraft in parabolic flight. She
           floats, arms out, having the time of her life.
           The BARTENDER grabs the remote to turn the station.

                                 BOB
                        Don't turn that!

           The bartender gives him a look before putting down the
           remote and going about her business.

           Bob watches intently, almost frozen, hand gripping his beer.

           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY

           Bob joins NASA engineers in observing the assembly of the
           rocket boosters and the mounting them on the shuttle.

           The EXTERNAL TANK is loaded with fuel, as the rocket
           boosters are mounted beside it.

           Finally the Space Shuttle Challenger is wheeled in on a flat
           bed that slowly raises it to a ninety-degree angle and
           pushes it toward the tank and boosters.

           Bob watches as the Shuttle clamps in and engineers on the
           scaffolding lock it into place.

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           TITLE: Space Shuttle Challenger, STS-61-A, October 30, 1985

           This time Roger, Bob and Beth observe the launch from inside
           the old mission control room, where Challenger lifts off on
           a large screen dominating the front of the room.

           The room is crowded with ENGINEERS and other NASA EMPLOYEES,
           who clap and cheer when Challenger clears the tower.

           But not Roger. He keeps his arms crossed watching the black
           and white video of Challenger going into space.

           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - CAPE CANAVERAL - DAY

           Roger does another inspection. Allen and team look on.
           Frustration mounts, as Roger again finds no evidence of soot
           or O-ring erosion.

           Roger is baffled. Allen writes something on his clipboard,
           unreadable.

           INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           As seen in C-SPAN coverage on TV. Reagan addresses the White
           House PRESS CORP.
                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN (ON TV)
                        A quick word about the shuttle, which
                        continues to be a shining example of
                        American exceptionalism. We flew
                        eight successful missions in 1985 and
                        we're sending more in the coming
                        year. And in January our Teacher in
                        Space Christa McAuliffe will be
                        teaching class while orbiting Earth.
                        We're all eager to hear her lesson,
                        which I'm sure will have something to
                        enlighten everyone. Especially me.

           The press LAUGHS, as Reagan gives them that folksy smile.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Bob is on the phone with Darlene.

                                 BOB
                        They don't believe us. Just like back
                        home. I honestly don't know what
                        we're even doing here.

           INT. EBELING HOME - NIGHT

           Darlene sits up in bed. It's late and she's tired.

                                 DARLENE
                        You there because you're trying to do
                        the right thing.

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        What if we're wrong?

                                 DARLENE
                        But you're not. Otherwise you
                        wouldn't be trying. But instead of
                        waiting for something to happen, why
                        don't you show them?

                                 BOB
                        We've done that.

                                 DARLENE
                        With a missile, not a booster.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM, ORLANDO - DAY

           Bob is taken aback for a second. Is she saying what he
           thinks she's saying?
                                 BOB
                        That's crazy... and exactly what we
                        should do. I knew there was a reason
                        I married you.

                                 DARLENE (O.S.)
                        I thought it was because I was
                        pregnant with Kathy.

           Bob smiles at that.

           INT. ALLEN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Roger and Bob are with Allen. Beth is not there.

                                 ALLEN
                        Two flights, one experiment and no
                        evidence the shuttle's in danger.

                                 BOB
                        One more, that's all we need. I have
                        an idea to get the temperature down
                        below our baseline of 40 degrees.

                                 ALLEN
                        You're trying to blow up the booster.

           Bob shifts, uncomfortable.

                                 ROGER
                        What? Of course not. That's insane.

                                 ALLEN
                        I heard about what you did in Utah.
                        You're not doing that here.

                                 ROGER
                        All we want is to show that cold can
                        cause gas to escape through the
                        joints, that's all.

                                 BOB
                        We can stop it the millisecond any
                        gas leaks out of the booster. Set up
                        sensors at the joints that will
                        trigger an automatic shut-off.

                                 ALLEN
                        I want guarantees no damage will be
                        caused by this. That means a sworn
                        statements under penalty of law.

                                 ROGER
                        This is gonna be our last test. If it
                        doesn't work, we go home.
                                 ALLEN
                        I want a detailed plan, including a
                        list of all safety precautions.

           INT. ARCADE - NIGHT

           A darkly-lit arcade with all the classic coin-op games and a
           cheesy outer space-themed carpet. BLEEPS and BOOMS permeate
           the room.

           MISSILE COMMAND

           Bob spins the ball, desperately trying to knock down
           invading missiles. Next to him, Roger leans his arm against
           the cabinet.

                                 ROGER
                        You know the booster's gonna explode
                        tomorrow, right?

           That throws Bob, as he his last two cities are destroyed and
           his game ends. Bob gives him a look as Roger steps in and
           takes over for his turn.

                                 BOB
                        Theoretically. But then I'm not a
                        pessimist like you.

           Roger doesn't respond, too busy playing. Bob looks across
           the way and sees Beth on a pay phone in heated conversation.

           Upset, Beth hangs up the phone and heads over.

                                 BOB
                        Everything okay? How's the family?

                                 BETH
                        They're fine. Everything's fine.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        So we sure about tomorrow or what?

                                 ROGER
                               (
                                still playing
                                             )
                        Booster's gonna blow.

                                 BOB
                        It won't. We have a good plan in
                        place. We'll be fine.

           Now Roger's loses his cities. Game over.

                                 BETH
                        You both stink at this.
                                    )
                               (
                                then
                        I think it's gonna blow, too.
           Roger looks at Bob, as Beth takes her quarter off the
           machine and starts her game.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

           ON CCTV: Grainy closed-circuit video of a booster mounted
           inside insulation. Hoses connected to several large
           REFRIGERATION UNITS cool the rocket.

           Roger, Bob and Beth stand in back, as Allen leads the team
           of engineers to test the booster. On the wall, a digital
           temperature gauge shows 35-degrees. Roger leans into Bob.

                                 ROGER
                        Lowest temp yet. Get ready.

           Bob looks tense, but says nothing. Allen turns to him.

                                 ALLEN
                        We're all clear. Ready for your call.

           All eyes on Bob, as he straps on a headset.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, last checks. Everyone out of
                        the facility? And... we're go for
                        ignition.

                                 IGNITION ENGINEER (OVER COMM)
                        Roger, go for ignition.

           ON SCREEN the rocket booster FIRES and continues to burn
           steadily. But like the last time, nothing happens.

           Roger and Beth exchanged perplexed looks. Bob is relieved.

           INT. ALLEN'S OFFICE - DAY

           Allen is at his desk, when Roger and Bob burst in. Beth
           trails, reluctant. Roger hands Allen their report.

                                 ROGER
                        Significant blowby coupled with
                        serious erosion of the back up ring.

           Allen takes the folder and flips through, unreadable.
           Finally he looks up.

                                 ALLEN
                        In other words, you recreated the
                        January launch. Sorry, this isn't
                        enough to delay the program.
                                 BOB
                        You got to be kidding me. We've
                        clearly established the erosion gets
                        worse the colder it gets. It's all
                        here. What more do you need?

           Allen looks frustrated, as Beth jumps in--

                                 BETH
                        The issue isn't whether or not the O-
                        rings aren't sealing properly because
                        of the cold. We know this. What we're
                        not thinking about is thermal
                        conductivity.

           Beth grabs a dry erase marker and talks as she scribbles
           equations on the whiteboard. All eyes on her.

                                 BETH
                        Everyone knows metal, especially
                        steel, is a good thermal conductor.
                        Even though outside it might be 40 or
                        even 50 degrees, the steel booster
                        feels like it's colder.

                                 ALLEN
                        But the temperatures of the steel and
                        outside air are the same.

                                 BETH
                        Yes, but the transfer of heat is the
                        issue, not the temperature itself.
                        Specifically between the galvanized
                        rubber O-rings and the booster joint.

           Roger folds his arms, watching Beth write out her equation.
           He allows himself a small smile of satisfaction.

                                 BETH
                        Even with 4,000 degrees of heat being
                        forced through the booster, the
                        rubber remains more rigid because the
                        steel feels like it's colder than it
                        really is.

           Beth finishes her equation and circles a number: 32.

                                 BETH
                        Thirty two degrees, gentlemen. That's
                        all it takes for blowby to cause
                        catastrophic failure.
                                 ALLEN
                        That's impressive. Except, Florida
                        rarely hits 32 degrees. And even then
                        your numbers are wrong. You have exit
                        temperature and total temperature
                        flipped around. That should be
                        negative 32 degrees.

                                 BETH
                        Wait a second--

           Allen hands Roger's report back.

                                 ALLEN
                        We appreciate you bringing this
                        matter to our attention. I'll make
                        sure to kick it upstairs.

           He leaves. Everyone else is stunned.

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

           Bob wheels out his suitcase and knocks on the door next to
           him. Roger opens the door, ready to go.

                                 ROGER
                        You fucking believe what he did?
                        Whose fucking side is he on?

                                 BOB
                        I don't know. Let's just go home.

           Beth exits her room and heads for the elevator, head down.

                                 ROGER
                        You did good, kid.

           Beth just keeps going.

           INT. EBELING HOME - NIGHT

           The front door unlocks and Bob comes in looking defeated.
           Darlene is there to greet him with a hug. He trudges
           upstairs. Darlene watches him go.

           INT. BOISJOLY HOME - NIGHT

           Roberta comes home to find Roger sitting in the dark alone.
           He has a drink.

                                 ROBERTA
                        When did you get back?

                                 ROGER
                        Couple hours ago.
                                 ROBERTA
                        And you've been sitting here ever
                        since.

                                 ROGER
                        What else am I supposed to do?

           Roberta sits across from him.

                                 ROBERTA
                        You're supposed to fight for what you
                        believe in.

                                 ROGER
                        All this time I thought we were
                        right. That all I needed to do was
                        show them what was possible, and they
                        would see what I see.

           Roberta takes his hand. He squeezes it.

                                 ROGER
                        Instead they're just gonna ignore it.

           Roger lets go of her hand. He has something else to say.

                                 ROGER
                        I haven't been feeling good lately. I
                        might need to see Dr. Kinney again.

           Roberta sinks. This is not what she wanted to hear. Now it's
           Roger's turn to take her hand.

                                 ROGER
                        It'll be okay.

           Roberta smile, but doesn't seem so sure.

           INT. HALLWAY - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Roger moves past other employees, briefcase in hand. Nobody
           says a word to him. The best that he gets is the occasional
           sideways glance.

           INT. OFFICE - BUILDING 53 - DAY

           The old task force building. Roger enters with his briefcase
           and drops it on the desk.

                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Roger!

           Roger turns and sees Bob rushing in with a folder in hand.
                                 BOB
                        You have to see this.

           He hands the file to Roger.

                                 BOB
                        Remember when Lund told us that NASA
                        was opening up the bidding? Turns out
                        that Congress cut NASA's funding.
                        They're trying to force them to find
                        another company to build the booster.

                                 ROGER
                        Why would they do that?

                                 BOB
                        I did some digging. Thiokol won the
                        contract in '73 even though it cost
                        more. Lockheed, United, Boeing-- they
                        all outbid us with a product that was
                        better designed and shipped faster.

                                 ROGER
                        What are you saying?

                                 BOB
                        Somebody had their finger on the
                        scale and tipped it in our favor.

           Roger hands the folder back to Bob.

                                 ROGER
                        What's the point? They're gonna sign
                        a new contract, shuttles will keep
                        flying and we're gonna spend the rest
                        of our careers in fucking Siberia.

           Roger turns away. Bob sees it's no use, and leaves.

           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - MORTON THIOKOL - EVENING

           The annual Christmas party. A booster nozzle decorated with
           lights and garland serves as a mock Christmas tree.

           Employees drink punch and champagne. It's also a celebration
           for the signing of Thiokol's new contract with NASA, as
           evidenced by a large banner hanging from two SRBs.

           While most employees laugh and drink, Bob is by himself in
           the corner sipping punch. Roger is nowhere to be found.

           Bob stares absently at the crowd, but catches Beth looking
           over at him. She's dressed up, hair down, and looking a bit
           uncomfortable about it.
           They look at each other a moment. Then Bob raises his glass.
           Beth raises hers, and smiles. Bob gets up and leaves.

           Beth turns away and spots Lund staring at her from across
           the way. He starts to come over. Beth stands her ground.

                               (
                                 LUND
                                 )
                                tipsy
                        Enjoying the party?

                                 BETH
                        I was just about to leave.

                                 LUND
                        No, stick around. I was going to call
                        you out in my speech.

                                 BETH
                        Why?

                                 LUND
                               (
                                leaning in
                                          )
                        Because I want people to know how
                        special you are to us.

           Beth fumes, having had enough.

                                 BETH
                        Be careful, Hank. If something
                        happens, people are going to know
                        things about you too.

           Beth moves away, leaving Lund a bit shaken.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - THIOKOL - DAY

           Bob's Accord pulls into the lot, slicing through melting
           slush and snow. He parks and gets out to make the long
           trudge to the office.

           EXT. FRONT ENTRANCE - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Several LOCAL TV CREWS set up outside. Lund, Mason and
           Kilminster, along with other TOP EXECUTIVES, are there.
           There's a buzz of excitement.

           A BUS appears on the road and turns down the access road,
           stopping in front of the crowd. Cameras turn on. News
           REPORTERS jostle for position.

           The bus doors open and the Challenger crew steps out,
           including CHRISTA MCAULIFFE, the star of the show.

           McAuliffe radiates down-to-earth charm. She greets everyone
           with genuine warmth and enthusiasm before being led inside.
           INT. PRODUCTION BAY - DAY

           THIOKOL ENGINEERS are lined up to greet the astronauts. Beth
           waits as the astronauts shake hands.

           Bob moves through the crowd and spots Beth. He squeezes his
           way through and stands next to her. Beth looks at him.

                                 BETH
                        Can't believe they're here. Do they
                        do this a lot?

                                 BOB
                        Sometimes, but not lately.

           Beth eagerly waits her turn, as Christa McAuliffe leads the
           way with Scobee next to her. Everyone treats McAuliffe like
           a major celebrity.

           Bob watches as she draws near, completely fixated. His
           anticipation mounts the closer she gets. Finally, McAuliffe
           reaches Bob first and extends her hand.

                                 CHRISTA MCAULIFFE
                        Hi, I'm Christa.

           Bob hesitates to answer. McAuliffe's smile never wavers.

                                 BOB
                        Sorry, Bob Ebeling. I helped design
                        the booster.

           McAuliffe smiles. Then she leans in and kisses Bob on the
           cheek, leaving him stunned as she pulls away.

                                 CHRISTA MCAULIFFE
                        Thank you for keeping us safe.

           She moves down the line to Beth. Bob's heart skips a
           thousand beats. He feels like he's on the verge of losing it
           and squeezes through the crowd.

           EXT. PRODUCTION BAY - SIDE EXIT - MOMENTS LATER

           Bob crashes out, hyperventilating. He collapses against the
           side of the building and looks up at the sky. A FLOCK OF
           GEESE flies south.

           Bob watches the birds and somehow finds calms in them.

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - BUILDING 53 - EVENING

           TITLE: January 27, 1986
           Roger is on the phone with the TV tuned to shuttle coverage
           on CNN, volume off.

                                 ROGER
                        Send me the latest. Thanks.

           He hangs up.

           ON SCREEN: Technicians struggle to fix the outer hatch
           access door. One brings in a hacksaw and starts cutting.

           There's frustration and confusion among them. Then the
           access door opens and the Space Shuttle crew disembarks
           looking annoyed and disappointed.

           Behind him, his fax machine BEEPS to life. Roger turns and
           grabs the sheet. He stares at in a moment and quickly grabs
           a pen, and starts writing--

           INT. BOB'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Roger bursts into Bob's office waving the fax in his hand.

                                 ROGER
                        You need to see this.

           Bob takes the page and reads.

                                 ROGER
                        It's gonna be 30 degrees tomorrow,
                        and teens overnight.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Something's been bugging me since
                        Florida, so I ran through Beth's
                        numbers again. She was right, Allen
                        was wrong. Catastrophic failure is
                        going to occur at 32 degrees.

                                 BOB
                        Okay, so what if you're right? Why
                        would they listen to us now?

                                 ROGER
                        Are you paying attention? They
                        delayed the launch again... fifth
                        time this week-- for a goddamn access
                        hatch. This is it, Roger. This is
                        what we've been fighting for.

           Off Bob, realization setting in--

           EXT. THIOKOL CAMPUS - EVENING

           Roger and Bob race as fast as they can, wearing dress shoes
           in three inches of snow.
           INT. HALLWAY - MORTON THIOKOL - EVENING

           Roger and Bob slip on the smooth floor in wet shoes, getting
           what-the-fuck looks from coworkers.

           But nothing is going to slow them down, as they slip-run
           down the hall and into--

           AN OUTER OFFICE

           They go right past MASON'S SECRETARY--

                                 MASON'S SECRETARY
                        He's on a call--

           Roger and Bob burst into--

           MASON'S OFFICE

           Out of breath, Roger holds out the fax. Bob is also winded.
           Both fight for breath, unable to speak. Mason glares.

                               (
                                          )
                                 MASON
                                into phone
                        Hang on a minute.

           He hits mute and takes the fax.

                                 ROGER
                        It's gonna be 30 degrees at launch.

           Mason looks frustrated.

                                 MASON
                        I warned you about this. The O-ring
                        matter is closed.

                                 BOB
                        It's going to be in the teens
                        overnight. In Florida. This is what
                        we've been trying to tell you--

                                 MASON
                        You never showed what would happen to
                        the shuttle if the outer ring is
                        breached.

                                 ROGER
                        We blew up a missile!

                                 MASON
                        Missiles are supposed to blow up!
                                 BOB
                        This is a death sentence. We have to
                        stop the launch-- not all of them,
                        just this one!

                                 MASON
                        You still haven't gotten the message.

                                 ROGER
                        I think we have. Thiokol doesn't give
                        a shit about the astronauts' lives.

                                 MASON
                        You're way out of line. I've given
                        you a lot of rope these past few
                        months, but my patience is gone.

                                 ROGER
                        Thiokol gave thousands of dollars to
                        Senator Garn to win the contract back
                        in '73. I wonder if campaign
                        contributions were all Thiokol did
                        for him? I'm sure the FBI would love
                        to get to the bottom of that.

           Mason glares at Bob and stands up from behind his desk.

                                 MASON
                        Are you threatening me?

                                 ROGER
                        No, I'm threatening this company.

           Mason glares. Bob senses the moment slipping away...

                                 BOB
                        Let us to talk to NASA again. Put the
                        ball in their court. If they say no,
                        we're on record objecting to the
                        launch. And then we just have to hope
                        nothing happens.

                                 MASON
                        Wait outside.

           INT. OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT

           Roger and Bob wait on a sofa. Mason's Secretary keeps an eye
           on them. The office door opens and Mason exits.

                                 MASON
                        You have 45 minutes to get your acts
                        together and meet us in conference
                        room B.
           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - BUILDING 53 - NIGHT

           Roger scrambles to get his paperwork ready, digging through
           piles on his desk. Bob pokes his head in--

                                 BOB
                        You ready?

           Roger takes one last file and hurries out.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM B - NIGHT

           Roger and Bob push their way in. Already waiting are Lund,
           Mason, and Kilminster. They sit across from them.

                                 MASON
                        Lawrence Mulloy from Kennedy Space
                        Center and George Hardy from Marshall
                        are on the line.

           Lund clicks off the mute button and leans into the phone.

                                 LUND
                        Larry, George. We have Roger Boisjoly
                        and Bob Ebeling with us. They're the
                        engineers who first noticed the O-
                        ring issue in January.

                               (
                                gruff
                                 GEORGE HARDY (ON SPEAKER)
                                 )
                        So what's the problem, Thiokol?

           Mason looks to Roger and Bob. Roger takes the ball and runs.

                                 ROGER
                        We're calling about the serious
                        threat to the Shuttle tomorrow. We
                        strongly urge you to delay the
                        mission until temperatures warm up.

                                 LAWRENCE MULLOY (ON SPEAKER)
                               (
                                Alabama accent
                                              )
                        This is Larry. Why would we delay the
                        mission because of the cold?

                                 BOB
                        Because the O-rings won't seal
                        properly. Which means that compressed
                        hydrogen will shoot out of the joint
                        and possibly put the shuttle at risk
                        for catastrophic failure.

           A long pause.
                                 LAWRENCE MULLOY (ON SPEAKER)
                        Why haven't we been made aware of
                        this before?

           Roger is gobsmacked. Bob steps in.

                                 BOB
                        Me and Roger were out in October
                        discussing this issue with Allen. He
                        said he'd kick it upstairs.

                                 LAWRENCE MULLOY (ON SPEAKER)
                        Allen Cobb? He's no longer with us.

           Roger and Bob look at each other. Mason grows impatient.

                                 LAWRENCE MULLOY (ON SPEAKER)
                        You know, the night before a launch
                        is a hell of a time to change the
                        command criteria.

                                 ROGER
                        The criteria states the O-rings are
                        safe between 40 and 90 degrees, but
                        we've seen blowby as high as 58.
                        Tomorrow it'll be under 40... outside
                        our recommended criteria.

                                 GEORGE HARDY (ON SPEAKER)
                        Frankly, I'm appalled by what I'm
                        hearing.

           Confused looks around the room. Even Mason didn't like that.

                                 GEORGE HARDY (ON SPEAKER)
                        I just got off with the White House.
                        The president wants to talk up the
                        shuttle in his state of the union
                        tomorrow. You want me to call them
                        back and say, "Sorry, Mr. President,
                        we're a no-go 'cause some engineer
                        two thousand miles away is worried
                        it's gonna be a little chilly?"

                                 ROGER
                        We have the data. Blowby is going to
                        happen tomorrow and will cause the
                        shuttle to explode on liftoff!

           More silence on the line. Roger is frustrated. So is Bob.
           Mason finally leans in.
                                 MASON
                        Guys, it's Jerry. Give us a minute to
                        talk about this offline. Okay?

                                 GEORGE HARDY (ON SPEAKER)
                        Five minutes.

           Mason hits mute, and huddles with Lund and Kilminster at the
           other end of the table.

           TIME CUT: 30 MINUTES LATER

           Lund, Mason and Kilminster are in quiet, but heated
           conversation. The clock on the wall reads 8:45.

           Roger keeps an intense eye on Lund, looking like he's ready
           to pounce any second.

           Kilminster is animated, putting pressure on Lund and Mason.
           Tempers fray.

           Lund for once looks uneasy. Kilminster looks at Mason, who
           nods. Then at Lund, who takes a moment, but also nods.

           Roger senses a fateful decision has been made. He grabs a
           file filled with photographs and goes over to the huddle.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        What're you doing?

           Roger lays out photos of blowby from the January and April
           launches. Mason folds his arms.

                                 MASON
                        We know all this.

                                 ROGER
                        Just look one last time.

           Roger jabs a finger at the O-ring erosion from January.

                                 ROGER
                        Fifty three degrees caused this.

           He digs for another photo and finds one from April.

                                 ROGER
                        That's 58 degrees.

           And another photo, this time from the experiments he and Bob
           ran at NASA.

                                 ROGER
                        Forty degrees. What they have in
                        common?
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROGER (cont'd)
                               (
                                off Kilminster
                                              )
                        Look, goddamn it!

                                 KILMINSTER
                        The decision is made, Roger.

           Roger's hands shake. He's on the verge of losing it. Bob
           gets up and leads Roger back. Roger sits, eyes staring
           blankly ahead. Kilminster turns to the others.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        We're all in agreement?

                                 BOB
                        There are icicles hanging from the
                        launch platform right now. Icicles.
                        In Florida. We cannot recommend
                        launch under those conditions.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        They're getting cleared off as we
                        speak. Gentlemen, are we agreed?

           Lund nods.

                                 BOB
                        Just a couple more days until it
                        warms up. Just two fucking days.

           Mason ignores him and nods. Kilminster hits the mute button.

                                 KILMINSTER
                        Everyone still here?

                                 LAWRENCE MULLOY (ON SPEAKER)
                        We're here, Thiokol.

                                 GEORGE HARDY (ON SPEAKER)
                        What's the verdict?

                                 KILMINSTER
                        We're all in agreement. We launch
                        tomorrow morning.

           The air gets sucked out of the room. Bob buries his face in
           his hands. Roger seethes.

                                 LAWRENCE MULLOY (ON SPEAKER)
                        Are there any objections?

           Roger doesn't move, knowing he's defeated. Bob looks across
           the table, but says nothing. His silence speaks volumes.

                                 LAWRENCE MULLOY (ON SPEAKER)
                        Good, we're a go for launch.
           Kilminster hangs up the call. Roger gets up and storms out
           of the room in disgust.

           Bob gets to his feet and glowers at Lund.

                                 BOB
                        You just killed seven astronauts.

           Bob storms out. Lund watches after him, the first cracks of
           uncertainty starting to show.

           INT. BOISJOLY HOME - NIGHT

           Roger enters, trying not to be loud. It's late. He puts down
           his briefcase and jacket, and heads straight for the liquor
           cabinet and pours a drink.

           A light goes on upstairs. Roberta comes down, closing up her
           robe. Roger doesn't seem to notice.

                                 ROBERTA
                        It's late.

                                 ROGER
                        Go back to bed.

                                 ROBERTA
                        What's wrong?

           Roger braces himself against the cabinet, refusing to face
           her. Roberta comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder.

           Roger turns around, tears streaming down his face. Roberta
           is surprised to see him cry. He buries his head into her
           shoulder and lets it all out.

           INT. BEDROOM - EBELING HOME - NIGHT

           Bob lies awake in bed, unable to sleep and staring at the
           ceiling. He hears something HIT the window. And AGAIN.

           Bob slips out of bed and opens the window. Outside, Roger is
           on his lawn holding a bottle of Jim Beam. Bob acknowledges
           him with a nod.

           INT. BOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Roger pours whiskey into Bob's coffee mug and does the same
           for himself. They sit quietly for a moment, then Roger looks
           over at the unit, now covered by a dusty tarp.

                                 ROGER
                        I never told you how impressed I was
                        you got that hunk of shit running.
                                 BOB
                        Yeah. Thanks.

           They drink. Roger downs his and pours another.

                                 ROGER
                        You know, I didn't think much of you
                        when I first started Thiokol. You
                        kept your head down, did what you
                        were told. Nothing like me.

           Bob downs his and holds out his cup for more. Roger obliges.

                                 BOB
                        And now?

           Roger smiles and drinks.

                                 BOB
                        We have time, Roger. Not a lot, but
                        we can still stop this thing.

                                 ROGER
                        Bob--

                                 BOB
                        I can't let it happen again.
                               (
                                off Roger
                                         )
                        His name was Luke. My son. I found
                        him in his room unconscious, took him
                        in my arms... and he died. I was too
                        late. And I just sat there thinking
                        how I could've done something, said a
                        few words, spent more time. I wish I
                        had more time.
                                      )
                               (
                                drinks
                        A few weeks ago the crew showed up to
                        meet everybody. I looked into that
                        teacher's eyes, McAuliffe, and I
                        wanted to scream at her not to step
                        foot on that shuttle. But it didn't.
                        And you know what she said to me?

           Roger shakes his head.

                                 BOB (CONT'D)
                        "Thank you for keeping us safe."
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I was in a fog after Luke. Nothing
                        felt real. But with this I had
                        purpose. Everything was real again.

           A beat.
                                 ROGER
                        At McDonnell Douglas, we built a DC-
                        10 that crashed outside Paris in '74.
                        Killed 346 people. And it was because
                        a faulty cargo door I helped design.
                        For years I thought it was my fault,
                        but then I realized I wasn't the only
                        one. There were literally hundreds of
                        people involved, and any one of them
                        could be responsible.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Same here. NASA, Thiokol, the White
                        House, the media. Even the public
                        wanting to see one of their own go
                        into space. If something goes wrong
                        tomorrow, it's gonna be on everybody.
                               (
                                another beat
                                            )
                        We've done everything we can. It's on
                        them now.

           Roger drinks. Off Bob, not so sure about that--

           INT. ROGER'S CAR - DAY

           Tired from no sleep and too much whiskey, Roger drives into
           work and parks in the lot. He's hesitant to go inside.

           INT. KITCHEN - EBELING HOME - DAY

           Bob enters and sees the plate of vanilla wafers with a note
           that reads: Happy launch day - D. Instead of eating one, Bob
           throws the cookies away and leaves.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Engineers have gathered to watch the Challenger launch on
           CNN. Roger enters and takes a seat in back. There's a buzz
           in the room. Barely anyone notices him.

           Except Beth. She looks over, noticing something the matter.
           She goes over and joins him. They sit in silence a moment.

                                 BETH
                        My numbers were right, you know.

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, I know.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I'm glad you were on the team.

                                 BETH
                        Thanks. That means a lot.
           Roger folds his arms. Beth bites her fingernails like she
           did for her first launch months ago.

           Lund enters the room and gets right behind Beth to watch,
           putting her more on edge. Roger notices.

                                 ROGER
                        After .63 seconds, it'll be okay.

           Beth turns away.

           ON TV: CNN coverage of the launch, the famous moment where
           the crew boards the shuttle bus, smiling and waving.

           INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bob sits alone, trying to keep it together. Nobody knows
           he's there, and that's the way he wants it.

           EXT. LAUNCH COMPLEX PRESS SITE - DAY

           The same press box where Roger, Bob and Beth sat months ago.
           Only now it's crammed with REPORTERS paying close attention.

           EXT. GRANDSTAND - LAUNCH COMPLEX - DAY

           Also packed with people waiting for the launch in winter
           jackets, breath visible in the freezing air. Everyone's
           cold, but no one cares. Their excitement is infectious.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Back at the beginning. Flight Director Jay Greene mans his
           position at the main console.

           Next to him are the FLIGHT DYNAMICS OFFICER (FIDO), BRIAN
           PERRY (40s), and DICK COVEY (40s, mustache), the CAPCOM.

                                 JAY GREENE
                        For a minute I thought we were gonna
                        be delayed again.
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        Begin launch sequence.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Everyone watches with bated breath. But there's more of an
           excited feeling for this one because of McAuliffe.

                                 CNN REPORTER (ON TV)
                        And we've just confirmed Mission
                        Control has initiated the final
                        launch countdown. Liftoff will be in
                        T-minus 60 seconds.
           Beth reaches out and takes Roger's hand. He's surprised for
           a moment by the gesture, but then squeezes her hand a little
           tighter, glad for the mutual comfort.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Greene and his crew operate their consoles with calm and
           efficiency. All eyes on the monitors.

                        Cabin pressure is probably going to

                        Fifteen seconds till launch.

           On screen, we see the boosters start to ignite. Ignition has
           begun. Orange flames shoot out, intensifying. White smoke
           explodes out from the launch pad.

                                 DICK SCOBEE (OVER COMM)
                        Three at three hundred.

           Now both boosters and the shuttle engines are at full
           thrust. The Shuttle starts to move from the tower.

                                 MICHAEL SMITH (OVER COMM)
                        Here we go!

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - SAME

           Everyone watches as Challenger lifts off the platform. Roger
           squeezes Beth's hand more.

                                 CNN REPORTER (OVER COMM)
                        We have liftoff of the 25th space
                        shuttle mission... and it has cleared
                        the tower.

           Roger watches as the shuttle makes its way upwards. He
           breathes a heavy sigh of relief and looks at Beth.

                                 BETH
                        Point six-three seconds.
           Roger smiles as he releases her hand, the worst now
           seemingly over.

           INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           Bob is still by himself. He can hear upbeat conversation and
           laughter from the other room. But something still doesn't
           sit right with him and he doesn't move.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - DAY

           Jay Greene and his team are all business.

                        Looks like we've got a lotta wind

                        Yeah. It's a little hard to see out
                        my window here.

           Jay Greene keeps watch on the monitor.

                                 JAY GREENE
                        Throttle down to 94.

           EXT. SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER - SAME

           Throttling through the atmosphere toward space. Engines and
           boosters shoot fire. Everything rumbles and shakes with
           unpredictable violence.

           Then on the right booster, just below the shuttle wing, a
           small FLASH erupts and disappears.

           Seconds later, another FLASH erupts from the same spot.

           That's followed by a third FLASH that turns into a brilliant
           orange ball of flame that emerges under the right wing and
           quickly merges with the plume from the solid rocket booster.

           INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A COWORKER finds Bob alone, his face buried in his hands.

                                 CO-WORKER
                        You coming in or what?
           Bob says nothing. He's a bundle of nerves. Co-worker shrugs,
           getting the hint to leave him be.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           ON TV, the shuttle continues its upward trajectory.
           Everyone, even Roger, talk easily among themselves. Some
           leave to go back to work.

           INT. MID-DECK - CHALLENGER - DAY

           McAuliffe, eyes filled with innocent wonder, struggles to
           look outside, her body violently shaking. Over the comm
           link, we hear--

                                 DICK COVEY (OVER COMM)
                        Velocity 2,257 feet per second,

                        Throttling up.

                                 MICHAEL SMITH (OVER COMM)
                        Throttle up.

           McAuliffe braces as the G-force pushes her down more.

           EXT. SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER - SAME

           Continuous flame shoots out of the right SRB and becomes
           well-defined going in a downward direction.

                                 MICHAEL SMITH (OVER COMM)
                        Feel that mother go!

           Challenger rolls again, as the plume of flame grows bigger
           and starts to burn the external tank--

                                 MICHAEL SMITH (OVER COMM)
                        Thirty five thousand going through
                        one point five.

           The plume brightens as it burns through the SRB into the
           external tank. It's almost indistinguishable from the flames
           shooting out the bottom of the booster--

                                 CAPCOM (OVER COMM)
                        Challenger, go at throttle up.

                        Roger, go at throttle up.

           Flame now burns through the lower attachment strut on the
           right rocket booster. If we look closely, we can see the SRB
           start to MOVE AWAY from the external tank.
                                 MICHAEL SMITH (OVER COMM)
                        Uh-oh.

           Now the flames consume Challenger, and eerily quiet, the
           shuttle disintegrates.

           A huge plume of WHITE SMOKE expands. Both SRBs continue
           their upward trajectory, but now they're disengaged from
           shuttle and form a Y-shaped pattern of flight.

           Bits of debris break apart and fall back down. And if we
           look closely, we see the main cabin, still fully intact,
           arcing and falling to the ocean below.

           The Challenger is gone.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Everyone is still engaged in random conversation, but it
           starts to grow quiet as some begin to realize something has
           gone terrible wrong.

           Roger is one of the first to notice and looks up at the TV.
           He sees the infamous cloud of Y-shaped smoke and small
           trails following the falling debris.

                                 ROGER
                        Oh my God.

           Now the room goes silent. Everyone struggling to grasp what
           just happened. GASPS and murmurs of confusion. Beth stares
           wide-eyed at the screen. Roger is at a loss.

           INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           And then Bob, still sitting by himself. Though he's not
           watching, he knows what happened. The silence, followed by
           growing panic in the other room, confirms it.

           The moment hits Bob hard, as he buries his face in his
           hands. But he's not crying. He's angry.

           INT. CHALLENGER CABIN - SAME

           Red alarms FLASH, as the cabin, still intact, plummets to
           the ocean and starts to depressurize. The crew is still
           strapped in their harnesses and in one piece.

           Smith has his mask up and breathes normally. He's
           frantically trying to steer the cabin, but it's hopeless.

           He looks over to Scobee, slumped unconscious. Behind him,
           Reznik and Onizuka are alive, aware, and bracing for impact.
           As wind and vapor rushes by the cabin window, nose pointed
           straight down and the big blue Atlantic Ocean rushing toward
           them, we CUT TO:

           INT. MID-DECK - CHALLENGER - SAME

           And Christa McAuliffe, unconscious, her shallow breathing
           fogging her mask. She's alive. And despite the tragic
           calamity, somehow she looks peaceful--

           EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - SAME

           The cabin CRASHES into the water at over 200 miles per hour.
           A violent plume of water shoots out, as other debris pelts
           the ocean around the impact zone.

           A moment later, the water settles into calm as more debris
           quietly lands on the surface.

           INT. BATHROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Bob pushes inside and punches the shit out of an aluminum
           towel dispenser, leaving behind a dent and some blood.

           Bob collapses onto the floor, overcome by emotion, and now
           he starts to cry.

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MORTON THIOKOL - DAY

           Shock, tears, displays of emotion. Beth turns and finds
           Lund, in total shock, still behind her.

           Beth's rage builds. She gets up fast and glares right at
           Lund. Her eyes say it all: this is your fault. Lund feels
           the heat and quickly exits.

           Once he's gone, Beth reels, overcome with emotion. She turns
           back and sees Roger still at the table, frozen in shock.

           INT. MASON'S OFFICE - DAY

           Mason is on the phone. Kilminster comes in with STAN RUSSELL
           (40s, buttoned up), Thiokol's chief counsel. Mason waves
           them in. Door is closed. Everyone is panicked.

                                 MASON
                        I'll tell them. They're here now.

           He hangs up.

                                 MASON
                        That was Garrison. He wants a lid on
                        this right away. No leaks to the
                        press. No comment across the board.
                                 KILMINSTER
                        We have a problem.
                               (
                                off Mason
                                         )
                        Roger and Bob. If it gets out that
                        they knew about this, we'll get sued
                        into oblivion.

           Mason looks at Russell.

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        Civil suits from wrongful death from
                        the families are to be expected. But
                        from what I'm hearing, these
                        engineers of yours knew about some
                        problem with the booster.

                                 MASON
                        If that's what caused it. We don't
                        know that yet! Goddamn it!

                                 KILMINSTER
                        Rest assured, they're going to find
                        out what caused it, and if NASA can
                        shift blame over to us, that's what
                        they're going to do.

                               (
                                 MASON

                                          )
                        You need to talk to Roger and Bob.

           INT. ROGER'S OFFICE - BUILDING 53 - DAY

           Roger hurries to load boxes with files and paperwork, trying
           to get every last scrap of information regarding their
           research into one place.

           Roger thinks he's got everything and races out of the room--

           INT. BOB'S OFFICE - BUILDING 53 - DAY

           Roger bursts in and finds Bob staring out the window.

                                 ROGER
                        Did you get everything?

           Bob doesn't answer, doesn't even move. His right hand drips
           blood on the floor.

                                 ROGER
                        Bob!

           Bob turns around, his eyes haunted.
                                 BOB
                        You were wrong. It took 73 seconds,
                        not point-63.

           Outside, Roger sees MEN IN SUITS coming their way.

                                 ROGER
                        Jesus, Bob. Snap out of it!

           Bob won't budge. Roger grabs Bob's box and races out.

           EXT. BUILDING 53 - MOMENTS LATER

           Roger runs out the back of the building, but slips on a
           patch of ice and does a face-plant, dropping the boxes.
           Papers scatter.

           Roger jumps to his feet and gathers the papers. Then he pops
           open the trunk and throws the boxes inside, slamming it
           closed, out of breath.

           INT. BOB'S OFFICE - BUILDING 53 - DAY

           Roger comes back inside and finds Lund, Mason and Stan
           Russell with Bob.

                                 LUND
                        Bob, this is Stan Russell, our chief
                        counsel.

                                 ROGER
                        I have nothing to say.

                                 MASON
                        We're not here to point fingers.

                                 ROGER
                        I'm pointing fingers. We spent months
                        telling you this was gonna happen!

                                 MASON
                        We don't know if this is an O-ring
                        issue. We don't even know if this is
                        a Thiokol issue.

                                 ROGER
                        But you're here just in case, right?

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        The president is going to announce a
                        commission to find out what went
                        wrong. It's likely everyone in this
                        room will get called to testify.
                                 ROGER
                        I hope so.

                                 MASON
                        We're all on the same team, Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        You should've listened to us a long
                        time ago. Instead you stalled our
                        task force and now you're trying to
                        intimidate us. But that's not gonna
                        happen. I'm gonna tell them
                        everything I know. And there's
                        nothing you can do to stop me.

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        Actually, there's a lot we can do,
                        starting with the NDA you signed when
                        you were hired. That means you can't
                        testify, you can't talk to the press,
                        you can't even talk to your wife.

                                 ROGER
                        One way or another, people are gonna
                        know what went on here. I don't care
                        what I have to do, they're gonna find
                        out you kept the launches going
                        knowing damn well the shuttle was a
                        fucking death trap.

                                 LUND
                        Good luck with that, Roger.

           Roger turns to Lund.

                                 ROGER
                        Be smart, Hank, and resign before
                        it's too late.

           Roger storms out of the room.

           INT. MCFARLAND HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Beth sits on the couch with Katie nestled in her arm, that
           same look of shock she had in the break room.

           On TV, PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN is in the Oval Office behind
           the Resolute desk addressing the nation. He looks solemn,
           his eyes projecting the pain and sorrow of a nation.
                                 PRESIDENT REAGAN (ON TV)
                        I've always had great faith in and
                        respect for our space program, and
                        what happened today does nothing to
                        diminish it. We don't hide our space
                        program. We don't keep secrets and
                        cover things up. We do it all up
                        front and in public. That's the way
                        freedom is, and we wouldn't change it
                        for a minute.

           Dale watches from a nearby doorway, paying more attention to
           Beth and her state of mind than Reagan.

           He goes over to her and puts a hand on her shoulder, letting
           her know he's there. But he gets no response. Beth continues
           staring at the TV.

           Dale leaves her alone and heads back to the kitchen, where
           he dons his apron and gets ready to make dinner.

           INT. BOB'S OFFICE - DAYS LATER

           Bob is at his desk still in shock and unable to work, just
           staring at nothing.

           Outside he hears the sound of GEESE flying over. He gets up
           and goes to the window to look.

           EXT. MORTON THIOKOL - MOMENTS LATER

           It's a beautiful day. Bob exits the main building just as
           the bulk of the geese move past.

           He looks up at the the birds flying across the bright blue
           sky. A sense of calm comes over him.

           Bob watches another moment before looking down at his work
           badge clipped to his pocket protector.

           He rips off the badge, letting it fall to the ground, and
           walks away.

           INT. EBELING HOME - NIGHT

           Bob comes home late. Darlene is waiting for him.

                                 DARLENE
                        Where have you been? I've been
                        worried sick. Are you okay? Why
                        didn't you call?

           Bob is distraught. There's no hiding it.
                                 BOB
                        I didn't do enough.

                                 DARLENE
                        Don't do this to yourself.

                                 BOB
                        I had a chance to stop it, but I
                        failed. I have to live with this the
                        rest of my life.

           Darlene tries to comfort him, but Bob doesn't want it.

                                 DARLENE
                        It's not your fault. Others made the
                        decision, not you. You did everything
                        you could.

                                 BOB
                        I'm not going back. There's nothing
                        left for me there.

                                 DARLENE
                        I know there's some way you can still
                        make a difference.

           Bob looks at her, uncertain whether or not that's true.

                                 BOB
                        What can I possibly do?

                                 DARLENE
                        You can tell the truth.

           INT. GYM - NIGHT

           Roger runs on the treadmill, strong and determined. He hits
           five miles and slows to a stop.

           Roger grabs a towel and wipes sweat off the machine. But
           then he starts breathing heavier and grabs his chest,
           dropping to the ground.

           Audible gasps and shouts from nearby member. A GYM EMPLOYEE
           rushes over.

                                 GYM EMPLOYEE
                        Call 9-1-1!
                               (
                                to Roger
                                        )
                        You're gonna be okay, pal.

           Roger slows his breathing and rolls over on his back, the
           world in and out of focus.
           For some reason he looks at the TV. There's a news report on
           the newly appointed Rogers Commission, which shows NEIL
           ARMSTRONG, SALLY RIDE and CHUCK YEAGER.

           Also onscreen is DR. RICHARD FEYMAN (60s), who's shown in a
           file footage interview with a graphic identifying him.

           Something comes over Roger and he forces himself to sit up.

                                 GYM EMPLOYEE
                        Slow down. Ambulance is on the way.

                                 ROGER
                        No ambulance. I'm fine.

           Roger tries to get up, but feels dizzy and passes out.

           INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Roberta finds Roger sitting up on a bed. An ER DOCTOR goes
           over his vitals. Roger gets to his feet, ready to go.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Take it easy.

                                 ROBERTA
                        What happened?

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        Panic attack.

                                 ROGER
                        I'm fine. I wanna go home.

                                 ER DOCTOR
                        He's free to go. But he should go see
                        his regular doctor.

           The ER Doctor steps away. Roger gathers his things. He's
           ready to leave and moves past Roberta without a word.

           EXT. EBELING HOME - NEXT DAY

           Roger is at the front door still frazzled, but looking
           better. Bob opens the door. Bob hasn't shaved in days or
           slept for a week.

                                 BOB
                        I can't, Roger. Please.

           He tries to close the door, but Roger stops him--

                                 ROGER
                        We still have a chance to do
                        something.
                                 BOB
                        People are dead. What part of that
                        don't you understand?

                                 ROGER
                        Just hear me out! We both know NASA
                        will try to fly that thing again as
                        soon as they can. And if they do
                        anywhere close to the condition it's
                        in now, more people are going to die.

           Bob is listening now. But doubt remains.

                                 BOB
                        They won't let us testify.

                                 ROGER
                        Listen, what if the commission
                        subpoenaed us instead?

           Bob looks at Roger a moment and shakes his head.

                                 BOB
                        I'm sorry.

           Bob closes the door again, and again Roger won't let him.

                                 ROGER
                        I can't do this alone, Bob. I need
                        you there with me. You're the only
                        one I can count on.

           Bob says nothing, but there's a glimmer of recognition.

           INT. COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM - DAY

           A small room with two rows of tables covered in plain cloth.
           COMMISSION MEMBERS sit with name cards identifying who's
           who. Armstrong, Ride, and Feynman are prominent.

           Front and center is WILLIAM P. ROGERS (66), former Secretary
           of State under Nixon. He has a steady, commanding presence.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        We'll begin hearing testimony from
                        our witnesses shortly, but I believe
                        Dr. Feynman would like to say
                        something at the outset. Given his
                        stature in the world of physics, I
                        believe we would benefit from what he
                        has to say. Any objections?

           Nobody on the committee raises an objection.
                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        The floor is yours for five minutes,
                        Dr. Feynman.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                               (
                                Brooklyn accent
                                               )
                        Thank you, Chairman Rogers. I'll be
                        brief. Now, after going through the
                        witness list, especially those from
                        Morton Thiokol, I was struck by the
                        lack of rank and file engineers. Far
                        as I can tell, they're sending only
                        senior management and their lawyers.

           Feynman looks at Lund and Mason in the front row with Stan
           Russell. Kilminster is behind them. All look uneasy.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        I don't know about anyone else, but
                        as a scientist I'd rather hear from
                        other scientists, not muckety-mucks
                        who make financial decisions.

           The crowd CHUCKLES.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Which is why I was happy that two of
                        Thiokol's engineers reached out to me
                        and offered their testimony. But
                        that's only because, if they're to be
                        believed, the company is blocking
                        them from appearing before us.

           Murmurs among the crowd. Some of the Commission Members
           shift uncomfortably.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        So I move that the chairman compel
                        these two gentlemen--
                                checks a sheet
                               (
                                              )
                        Roger Boisjoly and Bob Ebeling, to
                        come here and talk to us.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        If there's no objection.

           Stan Russell stands up.

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        If I may?

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        And you are?
                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        Stan Russell, chief counsel for
                        Morton Thiokol. Mr. Chairman, I ask
                        the committee to reject Mr. Feynman's
                        request. Bob Ebeling is no longer an
                        employee, and Roger Boisjoly has been
                        demoted for disciplinary reasons. We
                        have other engineers with knowledge
                        of the issue who can testify, if that
                        pleases the chair.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        I have no problem with that.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        I do.

           Heads turn. Feynman glares at Russell, as he holds up his
           sheet of paper.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        These two were the primary engineers
                        on SRB production and recovery. Are
                        any of these engineers you just
                        mentioned the primaries on SRB
                        production and recovery?

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        No, sir, they're not. But--

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Then why would we want to hear from
                        them?

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        Roger Boisjoly and Bob Ebeling are
                        bound by an NDA they signed when they
                        were first hired.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        I'm no legal expert, but even I know
                        an NDA won't protect the company if
                        it turns out you're trying to hide
                        something. So unless Thiokol wants to
                        engage in a losing fight, Mr.
                        Boisjoly and Mr. Ebeling will testify
                        before this committee.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, DC - DAYS LATER

           Roger sits on the edge of the bed in a suit. The box of
           papers he took from his office sits behind him.
           In Roger's hand is a prescription bottle. The label says
           it's Prozac. Reluctantly, Roger opens the bottle and takes
           one of the green and white pills with water.

           The phone RINGS. Roger turns and picks up the receiver.

                               (
                                answering
                                 ROGER
                                         )
                        Yeah? Okay.

           He hangs up. Roger gets to his feet and heads out the door,
           but realizes he forgot the box and turns back to get it.

           INT. HALLWAY - NEAR THE ELEVATORS - DAY

           Roger waits for the elevator to arrive. Bob shows up in an
           ill-fitting suit. He's still shaken and looks like he hasn't
           slept. Roger notices.

                                 ROGER
                        You look like shit.

                                 BOB
                        I haven't slept in weeks.

                                 ROGER
                        They have me on this new drug,
                        Prozac. Makes me feel like shit all
                        the time. Worse than the other pills.

           Bob doesn't answer. The elevator arrives. Rogers steps on,
           but Bob hesitates.

                                 BOB
                        What if the commission doesn't listen
                        to us, either?

           Roger stops the door from closing.

                                 ROGER
                        Do you think they'd have us come all
                        this way just to ignore us?
                               (
                                off Bob
                                       )
                        If there's any good that can come of
                        this, somebody from Thiokol will pay.
                        We can be the ones to make them.

                                 BOB
                        This isn't about revenge.

                                 ROGER
                        Then do it for the greater good. Do
                        it to prevent another disaster.
                        Doesn't matter. But I'm gonna make
                        sure somebody takes the fall.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROGER (cont'd)
                                             you those
                        Because I guarantee
                        assholes are looking to do the same
                        to us.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        If anything, do it for the families.
                        Because right now they're feeling
                        like you did once. Hopeless and
                        alone. They need you too Bob.

           The elevator BUZZES, the door having been open too long. Bob
           steps inside, as Roger lets the door go.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Bob is waiting his turn to testify. He's conflicted and on
           edge, his eyes intently focused on the HOTEL ENTRANCE where
           PEOPLE constantly come and go.

           Through the door, we see a RADIO SHACK across the street. We
           realize Bob isn't people watching, he's eyeing the store.
           Bob makes a decision and gets up to leave.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

           Lund is pacing outside, waiting his turn to come in. Bob
           comes over, hands in his pockets. Lund looks at him coldly.
           Bob is antsy and on edge.

                                 BOB
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 LUND
                        Then talk.

                                 BOB
                        In private.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Bob pushes his way inside, with Lund following him. There's
           no one else in there at the moment.

                                 LUND
                        I'm up in a few minutes, so make it
                        quick.

                                 BOB
                        This won't take long. I wanted you to
                        know that I'm sorry.

           Lund is taken aback.

                                 LUND
                        Sorry for what?
                                 BOB
                        For what's about to happen. Roger is
                        going to throw you under the bus in
                        there. He's going to lay the blame
                        right at your door step.

                                 LUND
                        I expect that. Real question is,
                        what're you going to do?

                                 BOB
                        I don't know.

           Lund matches eyes with Bob. Intense, but calm.

                                 LUND
                        Can I offer a suggestion?
                               (
                                off Bob, nodding
                                                )
                        Don't tell them anything. Don't talk
                        about the task force or the memos or
                        your trip to the Cape.

                                 BOB
                        You think they don't already know
                        about all that stuff?

                                 LUND
                        Just keep it general. Yes or no
                        answers. Impress upon them Thiokol
                        isn't responsible. Let them know we
                        did all we could to prevent this
                        heartbreaking disaster.

           Bob steels himself.

                                 BOB
                        And if I don't?

                                 LUND
                        I'm sure that won't be the case. You
                        were always the sensible one, Bob. I
                        doubt you'll be stupid and put
                        yourself at risk.

                                 BOB
                        Risk? Are you threatening me?

                                 LUND
                        I'm looking out for you, Bob. You
                        know what can happen if you stick
                        your neck out like this. Press starts
                        digging around.

                                 LUND (cont'd)
                        Maybe they ask questions about your
                        son, your relationship with him,
                        things like that. Then there's the
                        lawsuits Thiokol and NASA are sure to
                        file. That's going to put you in
                        serious financial jeopardy. But like
                        I said, you're the sensible one. I'm
                        sure you'll do the right thing.

           Lund leaves the bathroom. Bob takes a breath and pulls out a
           SMALL TAPE RECORDER. He hits stop, his hands shaking.

           INT. MCFARLAND HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Beth is home building a futuristic model car with Katie. It
           almost looks like it could be a Tesla.

           Dale comes in from the kitchen with a plate of cookies.

                                 DALE
                        You watching the hearings?

                                 BETH
                        In a minute.

           Dale puts the cookies down and sits.

                                 DALE
                        I think you should change your mind
                        and go. You need to do this, if not
                        for them, then for yourself.

           Beth smiles, appreciating him. She looks at Katie, who's
           focused on assembling one of the wheels.

                                 BETH
                        No, I'm fine here.

           Dale kisses her forehead and leaves.

           INT. COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM - DAY

           The commission is in session. Standing at a podium is Lund
           delivering testimony next to a monitor showing a schematic
           of a rocket booster. The committee members look bored.

                               (
                                pointing
                                 LUND
                                        )
                        And then we have the pressurization
                        line that runs the length of the
                        booster all the way to the nose. Now
                        in this section is the igniter,
                        which, as the name implies, ignites
                        the solid propellant.
           The doors open and Roger walks in with his ATTORNEY.

           Lund stops, as heads turns. Richard Feynman eyes them with
           interest. Roger sits in the front row, eyes on Lund.

                                 LUND
                        So... the gas from the propellant
                        flows through the insulated cable
                        tunnel and out the rear nozzle
                        extension. Now you'll also notice
                        here the aft separation motor--

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Thank you, Mr. Lund, for your
                        compelling testimony. You can submit
                        the rest in writing.

           Lund is surprised to be cut off.

                                 LUND
                        I think it would be better that I
                        explain for those who don't have a
                        technical understanding--

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        Duly noted. Dr. Feynman?

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Thank you. I'd like the chair to call
                        Roger Boisjoly to testify.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        You can step down, Mr. Lund.

           TIME CUT TO:

           ROGER, right hand raised, as he's finished being sworn in.

                                 ROGER
                        I do.

           Roger sits. His attorney says something to him. Roger nods
           and leans into the microphone.

                                 ROGER
                        Before we begin, I want to offer the
                        commission my personal notes and
                        memos pertaining to my work on the
                        shuttle's rocket boosters.

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                               (
                                standing
                                        )
                        Objection.
                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        This isn't Matlock, Mr... what was
                        your name again?

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        Stan Russell.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        We don't blurt out objections. The
                        subpoena clearly asks for all
                        documents pertaining to Mr.
                        Boisjoly's involvement with the SRB.

                                 STAN RUSSELL
                        That box contains property belonging
                        to Morton Thiokol and by law he can't
                        release it.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        You've already argued that in court
                        and lost.

           Russell sits down, defeated.

                                 ROGER
                        If you don't mind, I'd like to bring
                        the commission's attention to one
                        memo in particular. It's only a
                        couple of pages.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        Without objection.

           Roger brings the box over to the committee and reaches
           inside, pulling out a memo and handing it to Rogers. Russell
           sits next to Mason, arms crossed.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        What am I looking at here?

                                 ROGER
                        That's a memo I wrote back in July of
                        1985 to Hank Lund, where I described
                        the dangers of O-ring erosion in the
                        SRM, or solid rocket motor.

           NEIL ARMSTRONG (55) looks at Roger, perplexed.

                                 NEIL ARMSTRONG
                        You're saying that you were aware of
                        the O-ring problem back in July of
                        last year?
                                 ROGER
                        No, sir. I knew as far back as
                        January.

           An audible gasp from some in the audience. Kilminster and
           Mason eye Roger with contempt. Lund grows uncomfortable.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                               (
                                reading
                                       )
                        "It is my honest and very real fear
                        that if we do not take immediate
                        action to dedicate a team to solve
                        the problem with the field joint
                        having the number one priority, then
                        we stand in jeopardy of losing a
                        flight along with the launch pad
                        facilities."

           Rogers glares at Lund.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        I seem to recall Thiokol testifying
                        that they didn't know about the O-
                        ring problem.

           Rogers nods. SALLY RIDE (34) leans into her microphone.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        Is it possible that they didn't
                        receive the memo?

                                 ROGER
                        No, we had numerous discussions about
                        the issue both before and after the
                        memo. We even went to the Cape to
                        prove our case.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        So NASA knew about this as well?

                                 ROGER
                        Yes, ma'am.

           Ride sits back, visibly annoyed.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        And were you able to prove your case?

                                 ROGER
                        No, we weren't able to recreate the
                        appropriate conditions. But we had
                        enough evidence of O-ring erosion and
                        knew that it posed a serious risk to
                        the shuttle crew.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROGER (cont'd)
                        We recommended suspending shuttle
                        missions on numerous occasions,
                        including the night before Challenger
                        launched.

           More MURMURING from the audience. Various commission members
           turn and talk to among themselves.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Tell me, Mr. Boisjoly, why weren't
                        your arguments taken more seriously?

                                 ROGER
                        There were obstacles.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Like what?

           Roger turns to the Thiokol behind him. He matches eyes with
           Lund, who turns away, knowing what comes next.

                                 ROGER
                        Certain members of senior management
                        felt our data was inconclusive.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Who specifically?

                                 ROGER
                        Hank Lund. Gerald Mason. Joe
                        Kilminster.

           Feynman nods. Rogers folds his arms across his chest. DONALD
           KUTYNA (52), an Air Force general, leans in.

                                 DONALD KUTYNA
                        Are there are others who can
                        corroborate your story?

                                 ROGER
                        Yes, sir. Bob Ebeling.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                               (
                                to Chairman Rogers
                                                  )
                        I think it's time we hear from Mr.
                        Ebeling.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        I agree.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Outside the hearing room. Bob sits by himself waiting his
           turn. He's holding a picture of Luke.
           The door opens and a COMMISSION STAFFER exits.

                                 COMMISSION STAFFER
                        They're ready for you.

           Bob puts the photo inside his coat pocket and gets up.

           INT. COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM - DAY

           Bob makes his way to the witness table, moving past Roger,
           now in the audience. Roger nods. Bob, without an attorney,
           is sworn in by Rogers.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                               (
                                standing
                                        )
                        Please raise your right hand.
                               (
                                Bob does
                                        )
                        Do you solemnly swear the testimony
                        you're about to give will be the
                        truth, the whole truth and nothing
                        but the truth, so help you God?

                                 BOB
                        Yes.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        Let the record show that the witness
                        has answered in the affirmative.

           Bob sits down and gets ready for a grilling. Richard Feynman
           gets to start this round.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Thank you. Mr. Ebeling, we heard
                        earlier some rather explicit
                        testimony from your colleague, Mr.
                        Boisjoly. He accused your former
                        manager, Mr. Lund, and others of
                        obstructing your investigation into
                        the O-ring matter. Is that true?

                                 BOB
                        I wouldn't use the word obstruct.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Well, how would you describe it?

                                 BOB
                        I don't know.

           Feynman waits a moment.

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Is that all? You don't know?
                                 BOB
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        We want you to tell the truth. It's
                        okay, nothing's going to happen. But
                        we need you to corroborate or refute
                        Mr. Boisjoly's story. Keep in mind
                        the families of the astronauts want
                        to hear what you have to say.

           Bob turns to at Mason and Kilminster. Neither looks back at
           him. But Lund does. He eyes Bob intensely.

                                 BOB
                        I'm a cautious man, Dr. Feynman, as
                        anyone who knows me will say. I don't
                        make decisions lightly, and I don't
                        declare things to be true without
                        sufficient evidence.

           Bob reaches into his pocket and pulls out the tape recorder.

                                 BOB
                        That's why I can tell you with
                        confidence that Thiokol management
                        tried to suppress our testimony
                        today, and Hank Lund personally
                        threatened me.

           All eyes on Bob, as he puts the recorder in front of the
           microphone and hits play. Everyone listens.

                                 LUND (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        Just keep it general. Yes or no
                        answers. Impress upon them Thiokol
                        isn't responsible. Let them know we
                        did all we could to prevent this
                        heartbreaking disaster.

                                 BOB (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        And if I don't?

                                 LUND (ON TAPE RECORDER)
                        I'm sure that won't be the case. You
                        were always the sensible one, Bob. I
                        doubt you'll be stupid and put
                        yourself at risk.

           Bob stops the tape. Rogers glares at Lund. Others on the
           commission shake their heads, turn to each other, write
           notes. Feynman oddly smiles, like he's enjoying this.
                                 RICHARD FEYNMAN
                        Seems clear Mr. Lund stopped you from
                        doing your job. Maybe he was worried
                        about the contract with NASA, or he
                        was acting under orders from senior
                        management. Maybe he really believed
                        there wasn't a problem. But he wasn't
                        the only one. Thiokol, NASA, even
                        members of the administration played
                        a role in a tragedy that should have
                        been prevented.

           There's a growing buzz in the room. Rogers calls for order.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        Quiet please, quiet.
                               (
                                to Feynman
                                          )
                        Let's not speculate about who's to
                        blame. Certainly Thiokol should have
                        responded differently. A lot of
                        people should have. But what Mr.
                        Ebeling has told us today is
                        important, and in light of Mr.
                        Boisjoly's testimony, we hope it
                        leads to some real change.

           Bob thinks on that.

                                 BOB
                        No, that's not good enough. Someone
                        needs to be responsible. It's true a
                        lot of people were involved. But it
                        takes only one person to make a
                        difference... and I tried to be the
                        one to do something about it, and I
                        failed. This is my fault.

           The room quiets. Bob glances back to Darlene.

                                 WILLIAM ROGERS
                        We all failed, Mr. Ebeling.

                                 BOB
                        No, not like me.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I have nothing else to say. May I go?

           Rogers nods. Bob gets up. Darlene helps him out.

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           The commission is on break. Lund paces the lobby, as Mason
           and Kilminster, both wearing serious looks, come over.
                                 LUND
                        Can you believe what they said? The
                        nerve of those two.

                                 MASON
                        Hank, you're fired.

           Mason and Kilminster depart, leaving Lund gut-punched.

           EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Bob and Darlene exit the building, and see Roger waiting for
           them. Darlene puts a hand on Bob's arm.

                                 DARLENE
                        I'll give you two a minute.

           She leaves them. Roger and Bob look at each other a moment.

                                 ROGER
                        You did good in there. You really
                        stuck it to Lund.

                                 BOB
                        I meant what I said. All of it.

                                 ROGER
                        We did our job. We found the problem
                        and argued for months till we were
                        blue in the face. Their job was to
                        listen and do something about it.
                        They're the ones who should walk
                        around feeling guilty, not you.

                                 BOB
                        I don't think I can let this go,
                        Roger. How can I? How can you?

           Roger sees there's no getting through right now.

                                 ROGER
                        What're you gonna do now?

                                 BOB
                        I've always wanted to work with
                        birds.

           Roger nods. Then he holds out a hand.

                                 ROGER
                        Good luck, Bob.

           Bob looks at Roger's hand, then takes it and shakes. Roger
           turns and leaves. Off Bob watching him go--
           INT. EBELING HOME - DAY, 2016

           And we MATCH CUT to older Bob pausing his interview with
           NPR. He still carries that same guilt he had 30 years ago.
           It's never left him, and over time has worn him down.

                                 BOB
                        I have nothing else to say.

           Heather looks to her sound tech. They have enough.

           INT. NPR STUDIO - DAY, 2016

           Heather records her VOICEOVER for the story.

                                 HEATHER BURNS
                        And for 30 years, Bob Ebeling has
                        carried the guilt of not being able
                        to stop the Challenger launch.

           INT. LUND HOME - DAY, 2016

           Lund, now in his 80s, but still fit, is listening to the
           radio on his porch overlooking a lawn in New Hampshire.

                                 BOB (V.O.)
                        And I think that was one of the
                        mistakes God made. He shouldn't have
                        picked me for that job. I don't
                        know... next time I talk to him, I'm
                        gonna ask him, why me?

           Lund feels the weight of Bob's words, his own guilt over the
           events suddenly consuming him.

           INT. EBELING HOME - DAY, 2016

           Bob is in his easy chair wearing the oxygen tube in his
           nose. He looks frail, his health rapidly declining.

           The phone RINGS. Darlene answers in the kitchen. Bob pays
           the call no mind. Darlene comes over with the cordless and
           hands it to Bob.

                                 DARLENE
                        It's Hank Lund.

           Bob stares at Darlene a moment, then looks at the phone. We
           don't know whether or not he's going to take it. And at the
           moment, neither does Bob.

           INT. LUND HOME - SAME

           Lund waits with the phone to his ear. Then he hears Bob's
           creaky voice on the other end.
                                 BOB (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           Lund takes a breath, and a long beat. He's unsure what to
           say after so many years. As he finds the courage to speak,
           we CUT BACK TO:

           INT. EBELING HOME - SAME

           And Bob, unreadable as he listens, frail hands shaking. At
           first, he gives no visible response. But slowly the granite
           starts to shake loose and his face trembles, as Bob weeps.

           Darlene watches from the doorway, a tear falling past a
           relieved smile.

           INT. EBELING HOME - WEEKS LATER

           There's activity in Bob's house. His TWO DAUGHTERS are there
           with Darlene. Everyone is smiling and looking their best.

           Bob is in his easy chair wearing a suit. Next to him is
           NASA's DEPUTY DIRECTOR putting a gold medal with NASA's
           emblem in blue around his neck.

                                 NASA DEPUTY DIRECTOR
                        It's our honor to give you NASA's
                        Distinguished Service Medal for your
                        efforts in trying to avert the
                        Challenger disaster.

           Bob's family looks on, proud as can be. Though sick, Bob is
           upbeat and happy. He shakes the Deputy Director's hand. A
           PHOTOGRAPHER snaps pictures next to a LOCAL REPORTER.

                                 LOCAL REPORTER
                        How do you feel, Bob?

           Smiling, Bob turns to the table next to him and looks at the
           photo of Luke. He reaches over and adjusts it, and--

           FADE OUT.

           POSTSCRIPT:

           The Rogers Commission concluded that the faulty design of
           the O-rings and cold weather were to blame for the disaster.

           Dr. Feynman insisted his conclusions be added to the report.
           He put the blame on NASA’s refusal to recognize the O-ring
           problem. No one at NASA was ever held accountable.

           Roger became a speaker on workplace ethics. He was given an
           award for his honesty and integrity before the commission.
           Roger died in 2012.
           Because of their testimony, NASA made design changes to the
           shuttle. An escape system was developed and they fixed the
           O-ring problem, which saved astronaut lives.

           Bob Ebeling died in March 2016, just two months after his
           NPR interview aired. He was 89.
