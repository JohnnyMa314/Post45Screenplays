           INT. BAR - EVENING

           East Village dive bar. Winter. 6PM.

           Two strangers - A MAN AND A WOMAN - sit at opposite ends of 
           the bar. 

           Other people sit at the bar too, but they’re not important. 

           The not important people are watching a sports game on TV. 
           The good guys are losing. 

           The not important people bitch and moan about this, as if 
           sports were a matter of real consequence. It’s not. We’re all 
           gonna die. 

           The man, GARY, 30’s, a cynical, charming, quirky type, does 
           not watch the game. 

           Instead, he arranges THREE COASTERS on the bar in front of 
           him, in perfect symmetry. This feels like a compulsive ritual 
           more than a leisurely activity.  

           Unbeknownst to him, the woman, SHEILA, 30’s, a disarmingly 
           disheveled type, stares at him with laser focus. 

           She stares at him with the intensity of a thousand suns.

           She stares at him like she’s been waiting her whole life to 
           meet him. Since childhood. Since forever. 

           But not in a bullshit manifest destiny rom-com kind of way. 
           In a real way. 

           Unbeknownst to her, the BARTENDER, PHIL, 30’s, bearded 
           hipster type, stares at her with amusement.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Thirsty?

           It takes a beat for Sheila to snap out of her intense Gary 
           staring and notice someone is trying to communicate with her. 

           She processes his question, and turns her attention to her 
           drink. It’s half full.

                                 SHEILA
                        I’m good, I got some left.

           Bartender smiles, motions at Gary.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Not talking about the drink.
           It takes Sheila another few seconds to put together his 
           meaning. Then she blushes, shakes her head, laughs awkwardly.

                                 SHEILA
                        What? Pff. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        You’re staring at that guy with the 
                        intensity of a thousand suns. Like 
                        you’ve been waiting your whole life 
                        to meet him. 

                                 SHEILA
                        What? Me? Him? No. What? Pff. 

                                 BARTENDER
                             (shrugs)
                        Why don’t you go talk to him... Buy 
                        him a drink. 

                                 SHEILA
                        What? No. What? Get out of here. 
                        What? Pff. What?
                             (stands up immediately)
                        OK.

           Sheila straightens her dress, leaves her half full drink 
           behind, takes a deep breath, and walks across the bar, 
           towards Gary, who doesn’t notice her, or anything - still 
           lost in his coaster assembly.

           Sheila reaches him, satisfied. Then realizes she doesn’t know 
           what to say. 

           Bartender watches this like it’s an Animal Planet 
           documentary. 

           Sheila scrambles. Thinks. Finally blurts out --

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Thirsty?

           Gary looks up at this strange woman for the first time. 
           Puzzled.

           Sheila immediately realizes how creepy that came out. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        I mean. Your drink. Not like. 
                        Sexually. Gross. I mean a beverage. 
                        I am going to buy an alcoholic 
                        beverage, would you like one as 
                        well? 
           Gary smiles.

                                 GARY
                        Sure. 

           Sheila smiles. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Great.

           She motions to the Bartender. He walks over slowly, to make 
           things more awkward for them.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I get you?

                          SHEILA
                                                          GARY
           Negroni on the rocks.
                                              Negroni on the rocks. 

           The stare at each other, shocked. Bartender smiles, cheeky.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        How adorable. Real meet cute vibe 
                        going on here. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (pointedly, at Bartender)
                        Make that two Negroni’s on the 
                        rocks, and hold the side 
                        commentary.

           Bartender winks at her and makes the drinks. Gary didn’t 
           catch all that. 

                                 GARY
                        What? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Nothing. 
                             (repositions away from the 
                              Bartender)
                        So uh... Hi. I’m Sheila. 

                                 GARY
                        Hi Sheila. I’m Gary. 

           They shake hands. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Huh. It appears we both have old 
                        timey names. 

                                 GARY
                        And ergo, sadistic parents. 
                                 SHEILA
                        So true. Don’t get me started, 
                        there’s no couch in here. 

           Sheila laughs. Gary doesn’t. Awkward. She’s losing him. She 
           scrambles.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        But... Gary is a... good... solid 
                        name.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah. For a used car salesman.

                                 SHEILA
                        So you’re not...

                                 GARY
                        ... A used car salesman? No. Sorry. 

           Sheila stands, crushed.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. I was hoping to buy a car. 
                        Well... I should go.

           He stares at her, confused. A beat. She sits back down.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        I’m just kidding.

           Now he laughs.  

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                             (at his laughter)
                        Yay! I mean nothing. 

           The Bartender places the drinks down in front of them. They 
           both turn to face him.

                      SHEILA (CONT’D)
                                                          GARY 
                 (awful Australian 
                 accent)
           Cheers, mate!
                                                (awful Australian 
                                                accent)
                                              Cheers, mate!

           The three of them exchange glances, freaked out by this. 
           Bartender laughs, mouths “meet cute.” Leaves. 

                                 GARY
                        Heh. Pretty crazy.
                                 SHEILA
                             (laughs, a little too 
                              much)
                        Yeah, what are the odds! Ha ha ha.

           A beat.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Actually the odds are pretty good. 
                        I need to come clean with you, 
                        Gary. I’m a time traveler. From the 
                        future. So I knew everything you 
                        were going to say. 

           Gary raises an eyebrow. More amused than weirded out. She’s 
           fun, and he’s in a playful mood. 

                                 GARY
                        Oh? What’s the future like these 
                        days? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh it’s uh... 
                             (thinking of a witty 
                              response)
                        It’s about what you’d expect. 
                        Flying cars, and you know... 
                             (scrambling)
                        Flying monkeys.

                                 GARY
                        Flying monkeys... Like in The 
                        Wizard of Oz?

                                 SHEILA
                        No, Gary. That’s a work of fiction. 
                        This is reality I’m talking about.

                                 GARY
                        Of course. I’m sorry. Sounds like 
                        things are pretty busy... in the 
                        future... sky... area.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh yeah. Lots of traffic. Luckily 
                        we got... police robot... 
                        hamsters... handing out traffic 
                        tick--- Look, it’s a whole thing. I 
                        better not get into it. Don’t wanna 
                        fuck up your timeline. 

                                 GARY
                        Right right. Smart. So uh... Why 
                        did you go back? In time, I mean?
                                 SHEILA
                        Vacation! 

                                 GARY
                        Huh. And you’re spending it here... 
                        With me?

           Sheila instantly blushes. Scrambles for a reasonable excuse.

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, uh, I came to this bar, 
                        and... And uh.. Oh, and you were 
                        the only guy not watching sports on 
                        the TV!

                                 GARY
                        Ah...

                                 SHEILA
                        Not a sports fan?

                                 GARY
                        Nope. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Wow. Admirable. Impressive. A rare 
                        breed.

                                 GARY
                        Thanks. We have an organization, 
                        actually. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh yeah?

                                 GARY
                        Yeah, we’re called the... the uh... 
                        The Nosportsians. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Wow. That sounds a lot like my 
                        organization. The Neosporins.

                                 GARY
                        Oh yeah. Very similar. Lots of 
                        overlap. But, you know, yours is... 
                        Creamier.

                                 SHEILA
                        Right right... So, the Nosportians.

                                 GARY
                        Actually, it’s pronounced 
                        N’Sportians. 
                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. Like N’Orleans. 

                                 GARY
                        No. Totally different. 

                                 SHEILA
                        But the O is silent. 

                                 GARY
                        Yeah. You know, cuz of--

                          SHEILA
                                                          GARY
           OJ Simpson.
                                              OJ Simpson. 

           They look at each other, shocked. Laugh. Silence. 

           Gary looks at Sheila, thinking.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Since you came all the way 
                        from the future... you’re probably 
                        pretty hungry, huh? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh no, I’m good. 

                                 GARY
                        Oh. I was thinking maybe you’d 
                        wanna... grab dinner?

           Sheila’s face lights up. 

                                 SHEILA
                        SURE! I mean. Sure. Yeah, OK. 

           As they walk out, Bartender Phil looks at them and shakes his 
           head, as if he’s some mythical cupid figure who masterminded 
           this whole thing. 

           (But he’s not. Relax. He’s just a fucking bartender. This 
           isn’t that kind of movie.) 

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary and Sheila walk down 2nd avenue. It’s a cold night and 
           their breath is visible in the air. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So what made you form an anti-
                        sports organization? Did a football 
                        kill your grampa? 
                                 GARY
                        Yes. Thanks for bringing that up. 
                             (holds a finger to the 
                              sky)
                        Love you grampa. No. I dunno. 
                        Didn’t really grow up in a sports 
                        heavy household. Grew up in a small 
                        suburb in Jersey. Only child. My 
                        dad was a traveling professor. Not 
                        exactly the jock type. And he was 
                        gone a lot. Never got to play catch 
                        in the yard like in the movies. 
                        Spent most my childhood indoors 
                        with his sci-fi paperbacks instead. 
                        Which is... just as well I guess. 
                        Anyways. He’s dead now. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I’m sorry. 

           Silence. Sheila tries to find the right thing to say. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        But hey, you’re in the dead parent 
                        club! I’m a card carrying member 
                        myself. 

                                 GARY
                        Oh yeah?

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah. My dad. And he was gone a lot 
                        too. Before he was gone for good. 
                        Except my dad was more of a 
                        traveling alcoholic. He traveled 
                        from bar to bar, mostly. Killed 
                        him, eventually.

                                 GARY

                                 SHEILA
                        It’s OK. The silver lining is I got 
                        to learn the AA motto early on and 
                        it helped me a lot in life!

                                 GARY
                        AA? Nah. I’m more the OCD/ADD type. 
                        But that motto helps our kind too. 

                                 SHEILA
                        OOH ME TOO! 

           She enthusiastically reaches her hand up for a high five. He 
           laughs and gives it to her. 

           They reach -

           EXT. 6TH STREET 

           A street full of colorful lights and Indian restaurants that 
           are indistinguishable from the outside unless you know 
           better. 

           Several of the restaurant have MEN standing outside, waving 
           menus, trying to tempt people to choose their restaurant over 
           the others. 

                                 SHEILA
                        We’re here! But which one to 
                        choose...?

           Gary and Sheila wander around trying to decide which Indian 
           restaurant to go with. 

                                 GARY
                        Man, a real Sophie’s Choice over 
                        here. 

           Sheila laughs at the dark joke and loses herself in the 
           moment.

                                 SHEILA
                        I love it when you make that joke.

           Gary freezes in place. 

                                 GARY
                        What?

           Sheila freezes in place.
                                 SHEILA
                        What?

                                 GARY
                        What?

                                 SHEILA
                        What?

           They’ve stopped by the entrance of an Indian restaurant. 
           AMIT, 40’s, an Indian man steps towards them with menus in 
           his hand. They’re so caught up in the tense moment they don’t 
           notice him. 

                                 GARY
                        What do you mean “I love it when 
                        you make that joke?” We met an hour 
                        ago.

                                 SHEILA
                        What?

                                 GARY
                        What?

                        YELP!

           They notice him for the first time. 

           Sheila grabs a menu, grateful for the distraction. 

                                 SHEILA
                        You heard the man, best Vindaloo in 
                        town! Let’s do this thing!

           Befuddled, Gary grabs the second menu and follows her inside.

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           The restaurant is decked in colorful lights. Everything is 
           pink and blue and surreal. 

           Sheila studies the menu. Gary studies Sheila. Part intrigued, 
           part concerned. 

                                 GARY
                        So... tell me more about this time 
                        travel thing. 
                                 SHEILA
                             (focused on the menu)
                        Hold on I just wanna order first. I 
                        like to get business out of the way 
                        so I can focus on the pleasure, you 
                        know? As one OCD person to another, 
                        surely you can understand. 

           She doesn’t even take her head out of the menu while saying 
           this, all business. 

           Despite himself, he finds her quite charming, in an odd kind 
           of way. 

                                 GARY
                        Why not go for the Vindaloo? You 
                        heard the guy - 8 stars on Yelp.

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah, I’ve had that a bunch before, 
                        I wanna try something new. OK. I 
                        think I got it.

           She lowers the menu.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        You were saying?

                                 GARY

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. Right. Look. I gotta come clean 
                        with you, Gary. 

                                 GARY
                        What? You’re not really from the 
                        future, are you?

           She made it all up. Duh, Gary. Time travel isn’t real.  

                                 SHEILA
                        No, Of course I’m from the future. 
                        I wouldn’t lie about that. Just 
                        not... the far away future. I’m 
                        from 24 hours in the future. 

                                 GARY
                        Oh. Wow. So.. Huh. The technology 
                        exists... already? It exists now?

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah. 
                                 GARY
                        Where... OK. Where did you find a 
                        time machine?

                                 SHEILA
                        At a nail salon. 

           She waves at the WAITER. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, just want to put in our 
                        order real quick. Just... to get it 
                        out of the way. 

           Gary stares at her, increasingly puzzled. 

           The WAITER comes over. 30’s. Long night, even though it’s 
           just 7PM. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Hi. I’ll have the chicken Korma. 
                        And... let’s have two glasses of 
                        your Cab?

           Silence. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Gary? You wanna order? 

           Gary snaps out of his puzzled daze. 

                                 GARY
                        Oh yeah, I’ll have the chicken 
                        Vindaloo. 

                                 WAITER
                        Oh, you won’t regret it. 9 stars on

                                 GARY
                        So I hear. Great. 

           They hand the Waiter the menus. He leaves. 

           The business part over with, Sheila relaxes. She smiles at 
           Gary, flirtatious. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So Gary, what is it you do for 
                        work?
                                 GARY
                        Oh. I’m a graphic designer. For non-
                        profits, mostly. Freelance that is, 
                        I work from home. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Ah... So the lonely child has 
                        become the lonely man.

                                 GARY
                        Wow. Armchair psychologist. 

                                 SHEILA
                        And I’m not even on an armchair. 

                                 GARY
                        Stop it. You make me feel like some 
                        kind of tragic character. 

                                 SHEILA
                        In the best possible way. They 
                        should write a song about you. I’d 
                        call it...
                             (she pauses to think)
                        “Cats In The Cradle.“

                                 GARY
                        I think that one’s taken.

           Gary smiles but his eyes get sad. That joke must have hit a 
           little too close to home.

           Sheila panics. Fuck. She was going for a flirty sassy neg 
           thing, but clearly went too far. She back pedals --

                                 SHEILA
                        No, who am I to say anything about 
                        loneliness. I’m an executive 
                        assistant producer, don’t ask me 
                        what that is, I don’t know either, 
                        and I feel lonelier in an open 
                        floor plan 9 to 5 than I would at 
                        the bottom of a well. 

                                 GARY
                        Better acoustics at least. 

           She smiles.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        “Um, excuse me, Sheila you have a

                        stephanie stephanie. 

           Sheila bursts out laughing. The Waiter comes by to deliver 
           two glasses of wine. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        But hey, sorry, not to switch gears 
                        so suddenly, but - can we talk 
                        about the nail salon time machine 
                        again for a second?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh yeah, no problem. Cheers by the 
                        way.

           They clink glasses. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, yum. Big nose. Very fruit 
                        forward. I’m sorry, what were we 
                        talking about?

                                 GARY
                        The nail salon time machine.

                                 SHEILA
                        Right right right. So... I don’t 
                        normally get my nails done. Cuz 
                        they chip before you know it, and 
                        it’s a whole maintenance nightmare, 
                        you know how it is. But I was 
                        having a really nice day. And a 
                        free afternoon. And I was walking 
                        along 23rd street and I see this 
                        nail salon, and it’s called “Nail 
                        Me Good”, which I thought was 
                        hilarious and horrible and worthy 
                        of my money. So I walked in. 

           INT. “NAIL ME GOOD” NAIL SALON - FLASHBACK

           Sheila walks in, all smiles. 

           She’s greeted by CHUL-SOON, 30’s, Korean, beautiful, tired, 
           seen it all, dealing with New York women for 10 or so years 
           has given her enough wisdom and grief to last a lifetime. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Mani-pedi? 
                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        I was greeted with the 
                        international welcome of nail 
                        salons worldwide--

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        What color?

           They look up at a wall of colorful nail polish choices. 
           Almost too many choices. Why are there so many choices of 
           everything these days? Sheila looks overwhelmed. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. Hmmm. Maybe something that says 
                        “I’ve had a really nice day”?

           Chul-Soon goes to the wall, quickly grabs a warm pink. She 
           shows her the name of the shade. It’s called “Elegant Day.” 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Aw. Elegant Day. Perfect. 

           LATER

           Sheila is getting her nails done.

                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        So I get my nails done. And then I 
                        have to use the bathroom.

           Chul-Soon directs Sheila towards the --

           BACKROOM

           Sheila walks through the back room. It’s like a storage 
           space, filled with a bunch of nail and spa equipment. 

                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        And there in the back was a large 
                        horizontal glowing neon bed that 
                        looked like a tanning machine. 

           Indeed she passes by a glowing neon bed that looks like a 
           tanning machine.

                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        And I was like - Fuck it! I’m 
                        having a great day. I should get a 
                        fucking tan. Live life to its 
                        fullest, like the Housewives of 
                        Orange County. So I call my girl 
                        Chul-Soon over.

           Sheila calls Chul-Soon over. 
                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        And I say --

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        How much to use the tanning 
                        machine?

                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        And she says --

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Oh no. It no tan machine. It time 
                        machine. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (disappointed)
                        Oh. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Owner bought it. But he does not 
                        like it. Machine only goes back 24 
                        hours. No more, no less. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (shakes her head)
                        Damn. False advertisement is such a 
                        problem these days, Chul-Soon.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Yeah. I know. So he go back 24 
                        hours to before he bought time 
                        machine, to not buy time machine. 

                                 SHEILA
                        But... if he did that... why is the 
                        time machine still here? 

           Both women stop talking and wrack their brains trying to 
           figure out this convoluted time travel logic. Eventually they 
           give up. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                             (shrugs)
                        Anyways. Want to try?

                                 SHEILA
                        What? To time travel? I don’t know, 
                        Chul-Soon. I have a sensitive 
                        stomach.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Try it. It’s fun. 
                                 SHEILA
                        Oh fuck it, why not. I’m having a 
                        great day. 

           Chul-Soon helps Sheila lie down on the time machine bed. 

           She hits a few cryptic looking buttons, then everything FADES 
           TO WHITE. 

           END FLASHBACK

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - PRESENT TIME

                                 SHEILA
                        And here I am! 24 hours in the 
                        past.

                                 GARY
                        Wow. Wow. 
                             (thinks)
                        Wow. That’s... Wow.

                                 SHEILA
                        I know! 

                                 GARY
                        What about your other... self? The 
                        one from 24 hours ago? What did you 
                        do with her?

                                 SHEILA
                             (shrugs)
                        Oh huh. I guess I didn’t think 
                        about that!

                                 GARY
                        Well you better watch out. Cuz if 
                        she finds you, she might be pissed. 
                        That you’re here, living her best 
                        life. Out to dinner with a handsome 
                        fellow.

                                 SHEILA
                        Is that right? 

           They smile at each other. 

           You can almost hear the gears turning in Gary’s brain. Going, 
           “Look, she’s obviously nuts. But she’s pretty cute. And the 
           way those colorful lights dance on her face when she 
           laughs...” 

           She catches him looking.
                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        What?

           He shakes his head. Adjusts the napkins and silverware so 
           that they’re all in straight angles.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        You think I’m nuts.

           He nods, caught.

                                 GARY
                        But cute. 

           The Waiter comes and lays several dishes in front of them, 
           ending the moment. 

           EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           They exit the restaurant, pause outside. They both rub their 
           stomachs, grunting, a competition for who is fuller. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Ugh.

                                 GARY 
                        Glurghh.

           A beat.

                                 SHEILA
                        Dessert?

                                 GARY
                        Sure!

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           They walk down the street. 

                                 GARY
                        This is turning out to be quite the 
                        night. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Quite the night! 

                                 GARY
                        Look, Sheila, I gotta come clean 
                        here.
                                 SHEILA
                        Uh oh. You from the future too?

                                 GARY
                        No. 
                             (a beat)
                        Or aren’t I?
                             (a beat)
                        No, I’m not.

           She laughs.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I just... I just came out of a 
                        pretty long relationship. Year 
                        long. With this girl Amber.

                                 SHEILA
                        Ugh. Nothing good ever came out of 
                        a girl called Amber.

                                 GARY
                        Hey, that’s not fair. 
                             (a beat)
                        OK maybe that’s fair. But yeah. It 
                        was a challenging year. She was 
                        sweet. But very... Cookie cutter. 
                        Passive. Expected me to know all 
                        the right things to do all the 
                        time. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So more like... passive aggressive?

                                 GARY
                        Heh. Yeah. Sort of. I don’t know. 
                        It was exhausting. The guesswork. 
                        Trying to get everything right. 
                        Failing. Feeling like I’m lacking 
                        some telepathic skill I’m supposed 
                        to magically possess. So 
                        exhausting. I just couldn’t do it 
                        anymore. So I ended it. And felt... 
                        Relief. But I also haven’t been 
                        going out much since. So... This is 
                        nice, is what I’m very awkwardly 
                        trying to say. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I get you. Lucky for you, no 
                        guesswork needed here. My mouth 
                        speaks before my brain tells it to. 
                                 GARY
                        I like that. 

                                 SHEILA
                        You like that now. Give it a while, 
                        you might get tired of it. 

                                 GARY
                        Never!

           She stops and hugs him, spontaneously. It’s weird. But also 
           nice. Then she lets go. Then it gets awkward. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Here we are! 

                                 GARY
                        Where?

                                 SHEILA
                        Dessert! 

           Gary looks up. They’ve stopped outside a hipster ice cream 
           shop.

           INT. HIPSTER ICE CREAM SHOP - LATER

           Gary and Sheila stand in front of CHAI, 20’s, a cynical 
           hipster woman lady. 

                                 GARY
                        Good evening...

                        So what’s good here? 

                                 CHAI
                        We got a dessert called 
                        “Childhood.” It’s ice cream made 
                        out of milk left to soak in Fruit 
                        Pebbles cereal for two weeks, 
                        served in a cone made out of 
                        deconstructed peanut butter jelly 
                        sandwiches. 
                                 GARY
                        Wow. Do you have like, vanilla ice 
                        cream?

                                 CHAI
                        Nope.

                                 GARY
                        OK then. We’ll take two childhoods 
                        please. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary and Sheila sit on a bench eating their childhoods. 

           Gary takes a bite.

                                 GARY
                        Wow. Tastes just like childhood.

                                 SHEILA
                             (laughs)
                        Mine too. Amazing.  

           They eat in silence. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Wanna hear something crazy, 
                        speaking of childhoods? 

                                 GARY
                             (fake gasps)
                        Are you from the future?

           She elbows him. 

                                 SHEILA
                        No, something really crazy for 
                        real. 

           She points her finger up at an apartment building across the 
           street, a block away. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        I grew up in that apartment 
                        building.

                                 GARY
                        What? No way!
                                 SHEILA
                        Yep. 114 1st Ave, apartment 3B. 
                        Lived there my entire childhood, 
                        from birth till college.  

                                 GARY
                        Crazy. What was it like?

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, the city was different, of 
                        course. But it was fine. A little 
                        lonely. Like I said, dad was a 
                        traveling alcoholic. Mom gave up at 
                        some point too. Didn't really have 
                        a positive parental role model 
                        growing up.
                             (suddenly remembers 
                              something)
                        Except one time the cable guy came 
                        over. I was young I don't remember 
                        much. But he was very nice to me. 
                        Gave me hope. Is that weird?

                                 GARY
                             (laughs)
                        Yes. Very weird.

                                 SHEILA
                             (laughs too)
                        But it was fine. I had friends. I 
                        didn’t murder animals or anything.

                                 GARY
                        The fact that you’d need to clarify 
                        that... 

                                 SHEILA
                             (smacks him)
                        I was normal. I was fine. I played 
                        the flute.

                                 GARY
                        You did?! I played the clarinet.

                                 SHEILA
                        Wow. We should duet sometimes.

                                 GARY
                        Maybe.

           Their desserts are finished. What now?

                                 SHEILA
                        So what now?
                                 GARY
                        Hmm... Do we dare try to milk even 
                        more excitement out of this already 
                        endlessly thrilling night?

                                 SHEILA
                        I think we must. I did come here 
                        all the way from the future, after 
                        all.

                                 GARY
                        That’s right. We owe you a proper 
                        vacation night. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Ooh! There’s a weird vodka bar 
                        around the corner. It’s all about 
                        “”””infused vodkas”””” and the art 
                        of infusion and all that crap. 
                        People act like they're super 
                        curious about what lavender infused 
                        vodka tastes like. But really they 
                        just want an excuse to get sloshed. 
                        Let's be those people! 

                                 GARY
                        Alright!

           INT. VODKA BAR - LATER

           Several tall tables, young people gathered around flights of 
           various small colorful vodkas. 

           Gary and Sheila at their own table, a flight of 4 small vodka 
           glasses in front of them, already mostly consumed. They’re 
           both a little tipsy. 

                                 GARY
                        I can’t tell if I like the jasmine 
                        infused one more, or the cherry 
                        infused one more. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Better take a sip out of each again 
                        to find out.

                                 GARY
                        That’s right. For science.

                                 SHEILA
                        For science.

           They clink their tiny glasses. Drink. Giggle. 
           Sheila looks at Gary, thinking something over.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Look, Gary, I gotta come clean 
                        about something.

                                 GARY
                             (gasps)
                        Are you from the future?!

                                 SHEILA
                        Yes. Ha. But about that... Remember 
                        earlier, at the restaurant... You 
                        asked me what I did with my other  
                        self, when I traveled back to her 
                        timeline. And I was like, “Ha ha 
                        ha, I didn’t think about that, ha 
                        ha ha”? That was a lie. The first 
                        thing I did when I traveled back 24 
                        hours is find my other self, stab 
                        her to death and drag her body to 
                        an alley behind a closed down Radio 
                        Shack.

           Gary blinks. This is a lot to process. 

           Sheila feels the need to explain this. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        You know... cuz no one ever goes to 
                        Radio Shack. Even when it was open. 

           Gary blinks.

           A beat.

           He bursts out laughing.

           A beat. 

           She bursts out laughing too.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        You like that Radio Shack joke, 
                        huh? Yeah it’s a good one.
                             (a beat)
                        But no, for real, I stabbed myself 
                        to death. 

           He keeps laughing and laughing. She laughs too. 

           He reaches a hand down to steady himself, and KNOCKS THREE 
           VODKA GLASSES TO THE FLOOR. 
           They break into pieces with a LOUD UGLY CRASH. 

           Gary is mortified. 

                                 GARY
                        Fuck.

           Everyone stops what they’re doing and looks over, including 
           the FEMALE BARTENDER, who rushes over to clean it up. 

           Gary’s horror grows, he looks... angry. At himself. 
           Disproportionately so. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. FUCK.

                                 SHEILA
                        Heyyyy, it’s OK.

                                 GARY
                             (ignoring her)
                        Fuck. HORSE SHIT. FUCK. 
                             (at Bartender)
                        I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry.
                             (at himself)
                        Cocksucking motherfucker. FUCK.

                                 SHEILA
                        Hey, hey, it’s OK.

           But Gary doesn’t hear Sheila, lost in a spiral of self hatred 
           and anger. 

                                 GARY
                        FUCK. SHIT. FUCK. DOGSHIT. FUCKING 
                        FUCK. 

           He spirals and spirals - until she grabs him. With both 
           hands. Turns him over to face her. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Hey. HEY. It’s OK. Hey. It’s OK for 
                        things to be messy sometimes. OK? 

           She wraps her arms around him. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK for things to be messy 
                        sometimes.

           She lets go. 

           And strangely, with that one weird sentence, it’s like she 
           freed him from a prison cell. 
           He can’t explain it, but it’s a sudden huge load off his 
           shoulders. 

           A pure, beautiful permission - to fuck up. 

           Overwhelmed with relief, and drunk off his ass, he leans over 
           and kisses her, passionately. She kisses back.

           They break away and smile at each other. A deep bond forming.

           The Female Bartender, still crouched on the floor clearing 
           the glass shards beneath them, looks up at their beautiful 
           kiss with disdain.

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                             (under her breath)
                        Fucking hipsters. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary and Sheila walk in silence, blissful smiles on their 
           faces. 

                                 GARY
                        That’s such a great sentence. About 
                        things being messy. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Thanks. I think so too. Someone 
                        told it to me a long time ago, and 
                        I remember it had such an impact on 
                        me. Like it unlocked the door of a 
                        prison cell or something, you know?

           He gets excited.

                                 GARY
                        Exactly. That’s exactly how I felt. 
                        Exactly.

           He feels so understood. She feels so understood. 

           She slips her hand into his. They walk in silence, holding 
           hands. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (on cloud nine)
                        What a night. 

                                 GARY
                        Worth the time travel?
                                 SHEILA
                        A thousand percent. 12 stars on 
                        Yelp.

           They smile at each other. Gary pauses. 

                                 GARY
                        Well. I could keep doing this 
                        forever. But it is getting late. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (sad)
                        Yeah, I guess so.

                                 GARY
                        Where do you live?

                                 SHEILA
                        South Park Slope. You?

                                 GARY
                        Harlem. Dang. 
                             (a beat)
                        But I’d love to see you again.

                                 SHEILA
                        Me too. I’ll see you tomorrow! 
                        Well, technically, today. 

                                 GARY
                             (confused)
                        What?

                                 SHEILA
                        You know, when I travel 24 hours 
                        back again.

                                 GARY
                        Ha ha. 
                             (a beat)
                        Wait, what do you mean “again”?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh yeah, I gotta come clean with 
                        you here, Gary. This ain’t our 
                        first rodeo.

                                 GARY
                        What do you mean?

                                 SHEILA
                        I’ve spent all week with you, Gary. 
                        On this one night. Seven times in a 
                        row now.
           Gary is a little creeped out. A little a lot, maybe.

                                 GARY
                        So this isn’t a joke... 

                                 SHEILA
                        ‘Fraid not, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        So what... You’ve been doing this 
                        again and again... And again... 
                        Trying to.. What? Find the perfect 
                        things to say and do.... To win me 
                        over? Trying to be the perfect 
                        girl? Or what?

           He gets more creeped out the more he thinks about it. 

                                 SHEILA
                        No. NO. Gary. I would never do 
                        that. That’s like psychotic movie 
                        shit. And why even bother trying to 
                        make someone like you who wouldn’t 
                        organically like you?! That would 
                        be obsessive and weird.

           Gary looks her over, pointedly. 

                                 GARY
                        I mean... 

                                 SHEILA
                        No. Gary. Listen. That’s the whole 
                        point. I didn’t have to find the 
                        perfect things to say or do. We 
                        clicked on day 1. All this magic 
                        you just felt? We both felt it the 
                        very first night we met. And the 
                        craziest thing? The times after 
                        that, no matter how I came at you - 
                        charming, awkward, happy, sad - you 
                        played off it perfectly and we just 
                        kept going and by the end of the 
                        night we’re always happy. Always on 
                        cloud nine. Always. That’s what I’m 
                        saying, man. I didn’t have to try. 
                        I never had to try. We just... 
                        Work. I mean, have you had a night 
                        like this recently with someone?

           Gary says nothing. He hasn’t.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        ... Ever?
           Gary says nothing. She’s right. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        That’s right. Cuz you feel the 
                        magic too. You feel it here.

           She pokes his stomach, where his gut might be.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        You feel it here.

           She pokes his chest, where his heart might be.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        And you feel it here.

           She reaches for his penis. He smacks her hand away. 

                                 GARY
                             (begrudgingly)
                        Alright. Yes. I feel it.

                                 SHEILA
                        That’s right. Which is exactly why 
                        I gotta keep revisiting it. The 
                        perfect night. 

           Gary’s brain is digesting.

                                 GARY
                        But why revisit? Why not just 
                        ...visit... See where we go from 
                        here... Tomorrow? Second date? 
                        Third date? Like normal people 
                        without time traveling capabilities 
                        do? Use the traditional methods to 
                        see if we have a future? 
                             (a beat)
                        No pun intended. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (sighs)
                        Look, Gary, I tried that. It never 
                        ends well. Tomorrow what happens is 
                        either Amber calls you and tells 
                        you she's pregnant, and you 
                        reluctantly get back together, or, 
                        or, you get killed in a freaky 
                        subway track accident.
                             (gets lost in thought)
                        Man, your organs went everywhere...
                             (a beat)
                        Anyways. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEILA (CONT'D)
                        If by chance your body remains 
                        intact, suddenly the entire east 
                        coast gets nuked, and at first we 
                        think it's North Korea but then we 
                        realize it was an inside job, or-

                                 GARY
                        Wait what? Also, what?! Also, 
                        WHAT???

                                 SHEILA
                        Nevermind. Gary. It doesn’t matter. 
                        What matters is us. Just trust me. 
                        It's just cleaner this way. 

           Gary shakes his head. This is just too much. 

                                 GARY
                        Sheila, this was cute for a while. 
                        But now I'm tired. And I'm going 
                        home. 

           Sheila doesn’t seem deterred or discouraged in the slightest.

                                 SHEILA
                        OK. Bye Gary! I’ll see you 
                        tomorrow! 

           He shakes his head, then walks away, regretting the whole 
           night. Why are the cute ones always such psychos?

           She watches him go, hopeful smile still on her face.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        Heh. No one will ever look here. Ow 
                        my back. 

           END MONTAGE. And we’re back at page 1 --

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           East Village dive bar. Winter. 6PM.

           Two strangers - a man and a woman - sit at opposite ends of a 
           bar. 

           Other people sit at the bar too, watching a sports game on 
           TV, but they’re not important. 

           Gary does not watch the game. Instead, he arranges THREE 
           COASTERS on the table in perfect symmetry. 

           Unbeknownst to him, Sheila stares at him with laser focus. 

           She stares at him with the intensity of a thousand suns.

           She stares at him like she’s been waiting her whole life to 
           meet him. Since childhood. Since forever. 

           But not in a bullshit manifest destiny rom-com kind of way. 
           In a real way. 

           Unbeknownst to her, Bartender Phil is staring at her with 
           amusement.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Thirsty?

           It takes a beat for Sheila to snap out of her intense staring 
           and notice someone is trying to communicate with her. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah yeah, Phil. I wanna hit that. 
                        I wanna hit that real hard. Happy?

           Bartender is taken aback. Didn’t expect such forwardness. 
                                 BARTENDER
                        Damn. You go girl. Why don’t you go 
                        t--

           Sheila leaps to her feet.

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah fine I’ll go talk to him, buy 
                        him a drink.

           Sheila straightens her dress, leaves her half full drink 
           behind, takes a deep breath, and walks across the bar, 
           towards Gary, who doesn’t notice her, or anything - still 
           lost in his coasters.

           Sheila reaches Gary.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Nice evening for it. 

           Gary looks up at this strange woman for the first time. 
           Puzzled.

                                 GARY 
                        For what?

                                 SHEILA
                             (winks)
                        Exactly.

           Gary looks at her, a little weirded out, but intrigued.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        I am going to buy an alcoholic 
                        beverage, would you like one as 
                        well? 

           Gary smiles.

                                 GARY
                        Sure. 

           Sheila smiles. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Great.

           She motions to the Bartender. He comes over.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I get you?
                          SHEILA
                                                          GARY
           Moroccan Mule.
                                              Moroccan Mule. 

           The stare at each other, shocked. Bartender smiles, cheeky.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        How adorable. Real meet cute vibe 
                        going on here. 

           Bartender winks at her and makes the drinks. Gary didn’t 
           catch all that. 

                                 GARY
                        What? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Nothing. 
                             (repositions away from the 
                              Bartender)
                        So uh... Hi. I’m Sheila. 

                                 GARY
                        Hi Sheila. I’m Gary. 

           They shake hands. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Huh. It appears we both have old 
                        timey names. 

                                 GARY
                        And ergo, sadistic parents. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So true. Don’t get me started, 
                        unless you work in social services. 

           Sheila laughs. Gary doesn’t. Awkward. She’s losing him. She 
           scrambles.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        But... Gary is a... good... solid 
                        name.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah. For an insurance agent. Like 
                        the kind that specializes in small 
                        backyard sheds. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So you’re not... a small shed 
                        insurance salesman?
                                 GARY
                        No. Sorry. 

           Sheila stands, crushed. She gathers her things.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. Well, that’s why I came here. 
                        My shed is in shambles. Anyways. I 
                        should go.

           He stares at her, confused. A beat. She sits back down.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        I’m just kidding.

           Now he laughs.  

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                             (at his laughter)
                        Yay! I mean nothing. 

           The Bartender places the drinks down in front of them. They 
           both turn to face him.

                      SHEILA (CONT’D)
                                                          GARY 
                 (awful Australian 
                 accent)
           Cheers, mate!

                                              Cheers, mate!

           The three of them exchange glances, freaked out by this. 
           Bartender laughs, mouths “meet cute.” Leaves. 

                                 GARY
                        Heh. Pretty crazy.

                                 SHEILA
                             (laughs, a little too 
                              much)
                        Yeah, what are the odds! Ha ha ha.

           A beat.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Actually the odds are pretty good. 
                        I need to come clean with you, 
                        Gary. I’m a time traveler. From the 
                        future. So I knew everything you 
                        were going to say. 

           Gary raises an eyebrow. More amused than weirded out. She’s 
           fun, and he’s in a playful mood. 
                                 GARY
                        Oh? What’s the future like these 
                        days? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh it’s uh... 
                             (thinking of a witty 
                              response)
                        It’s about what you’d expect. 
                        Robots hunting down inferior 
                        robots, while the humans look away 
                        and do nothing. 

                                 GARY
                        Oh, so like... Blade Runner?

                                 SHEILA
                        No, Gary. That’s a work of fiction. 
                        This is reality I’m talking about.

                                 GARY
                        Of course. I’m sorry. Sounds like 
                        things are pretty rough for robots 
                        in the future. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh yeah. Real injustice. But don’t 
                        worry, they’ve started their own 
                        civil rights movement. Their 
                        leader, a sentient blender by the 
                        name of Mal-com X-Z109, is really 
                        making strides. Look, it’s a whole 
                        thing. I better not get into it. 
                        Don’t wanna fuck up your timeline. 

                                 GARY
                        Right right. So uh... Why did you 
                        go back? In time?

                                 SHEILA
                        Vacation. 

                                 GARY
                        Huh. And you’re spending it here... 
                        With me?

           Sheila instantly blushes. Scrambles for a reasonable excuse.

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, uh, I came to this bar, 
                        and... And uh... You were the only 
                        guy not watching sports on the TV!
                                 GARY
                        Ah...

                                 SHEILA
                        Not a sports fan?

                                 GARY
                        Nope. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I guess someone has to arrange all 
                        the coasters at proper right angles 
                        around this bar. 

                                 GARY
                        You noticed. Thanks for recognizing 
                        my work. 

           Awkward. A beat.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        We have an organization, actually. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh yeah?

                                 GARY

           Sheila does a spit take, it lands on Gary. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh gosh I’m so sorry.

           She cleans him up with a napkin. He laughs. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. You were saying. The Angle

           She nods enthusiastically. 

           As they walk out, Bartender Phil looks at them and shakes his 
           head, as if he’s some mythical cupid figure who masterminded 
           this whole thing. Then he frowns.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey. You guys gonna pay for that?!

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary and Sheila walk down 2nd avenue. It’s a cold night and 
           their breath is visible in the air. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So what made you join the Aaaaangle 
                        Makers? Did a sharp angle kill your 
                        grandma? 
                                 GARY
                        Yes. Thanks for bringing that up. 
                             (holds a finger to the 
                              sky)
                        Love you grandma. No. I dunno. I 
                        was always a pretty neurotic kid. 
                        Kind of a nerd. Kind of a loner. 
                        Didn’t really have one of those 
                        stable warm households. My dad was 
                        a professor. And he was gone a lot. 
                        Never got to play catch in the 
                        yard. Spent most my childhood 
                        indoors with his sci-fi paperbacks 
                        instead. Which is... just as well I 
                        guess. But that instability when 
                        you’re a kid... you develop coping 
                        mechanisms. Some of them aren’t the 
                        healthiest. And some of them stick. 
                        But it’s mostly just nervous ticks. 
                        Nothing really debilitating. Not 
                        like fully fledged OCD. I’m a 
                        functioning member of society, I 
                        swear.

                        Well played. No, I get it. I have 
                        them too. The neurotic coping 
                        mechanisms, I mean. Not the dead 
                        bodies. Though also the dead 
                        bodies. But mostly the neurotic 
                        coping mechanisms. Like... Weird 
                        impulses I can’t control. 

           She suddenly comes at him and gives him a quick impulsive 
           hug. Then backs away and keeps walking like nothing happened.

                        And he was gone a lot too. Before 
                        he was gone for good. Except my dad 
                        was more of a traveling alcoholic. 
                        He traveled from bar to bar, 
                        mostly. Killed him, eventually.

                                 SHEILA
                             (fake gasps)
                        Are you a member?

                                 GARY
                        AA? Nah. But it’s out motto at the 
                        Aangle Makers club too. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So much in common.  

           They reach -

           EXT. 6TH STREET 

           A street full of colorful lights and Indian restaurants.

           Several of the restaurants have men standing outside, trying 
           to tempt people to enter their restaurant. 

           Gary and Sheila wander around trying to decide which 
           restaurant to choose. 

                                 SHEILA
                        You know, we’ve been to all of 
                        these so many times already, but I 
                        still couldn’t tell you which I 
                        like best.

                                 GARY
                             (weirded out)
                        What do you mean “we”?

           She shoos his words away like a fly. 

                                 SHEILA
                        You know, the royal “we.” I mean 
                        me.
                                 GARY
                        Oh. Yeah. 
                             (looking around)
                        A real Sophie’s Choice over here. 

           Sheila snickers at this, but doesn’t laugh as loudly and 
           pleasurably as she did last time. 

           I guess it’s true what they say - When you hear the same joke 
           95 nights in a row, it’s not as funny anymore. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah, it’s a real Robert Frost’s 
                        “Road Not Taken.” 

                                 GARY
                        Except less about homosexuality. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (gasps)
                        That poem was about homosexuality?! 
                        I thought it was about 
                        existentially debilitating FOMO. 

           Gary considers this.

                                 GARY
                        I guess for us it would be. 

           They’ve stopped by the entrance of an Indian restaurant. Good 
           old Amit steps towards them with menus in his hand. 

                                 AMIT
                        BEST CHICKEN KORMA ON THE EAST 
                        COAST! Henry P. Zagat himself 
                        raves, “A SYMPHONY FOR THE SENSES”
                             (under his breath)
                        In 1995 before we moved locations. 

           Sheila grabs a menu. Shrugs at Gary. “Shall we?” 

           Gary grabs the second menu and follows her inside.

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           The restaurant is decked in colorful lights. Everything is 
           pink and blue and surreal. 

           Sheila studies the menu. Gary studies Sheila. Part intrigued, 
           part concerned. 
                                 GARY
                        So if you’re from the future... Can 
                        you guess--

                                 GARY AND SHEILA
                        What I’m going to say?

                                 SHEILA
                             (smiles)
                        Yes.

           Gary thinks for a moment. Then suddenly yells--

                                 GARY AND SHEILA
                        TIGER BALLS! 
                             (a beat)

                        DAMN.
                             (a beat)
                        WOW.
                             (a beat)
                        OK, I get it you can stop now.
                             (a beat)
                        Seriously you can stop now.

                                 GARY
                        Seriously stop. 

           Silence. Gary covers his mouth in disbelief. Then he starts 
           laughing. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        That’s fucking crazy. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I KNOW!

                                 GARY
                        I still don’t believe you though. 
                        There has to be a trick. 

           The Waiter comes. 

                                 WATIER
                        What can I get you? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Ooh! You know what I was thinking? 
                        Since I’m just gonna go back in 
                        time again - let’s max out my 
                        credit cards! That would be fun, 
                        no?
                                 GARY
                        I g... I guess... Sure.

           Gary’s having a hard time keeping up with her logic. But he’s 
           trying to go along with it and do the whole “fun” thing he’s 
           heard so much about. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Let’s order everything! And their 
                        fanciest wine! 

                                 GARY
                             (laughs)
                        OK... 

                                 SHEILA
                        We’ll have the chicken Korma, 
                        Makhani, Vindaloo, Samosas, garlic 
                        naan, dosa, dal. And... your 
                        fanciest wine! 

           The Waiter shares a concerned look with Gary, then smiles, 
           takes their menus and leaves. The concern stays with Gary. 

                                 GARY
                        So... tell me more about this time 
                        travel thing... What year are you 
                        from?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. I’m only 24 hours from the 
                        future. I found a time machine in a 
                        nail salon tomorrow and took it 
                        back here for vacation. 

                                 GARY
                             (digesting)
                        OK...

           Sheila sighs, looks him over. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Look, Gary, now that we’ve been 
                        seeing each other for three months, 
                        I feel like I can open up to you 
                        about the truth. 

                                 GARY
                        Three months? We met an hour and a 
                        half ago. 

           She shoos his words away like a fly.
                                 SHEILA
                        It’s a figure of speech. Anyways, I 
                        gotta come clean with you, Gary. 
                        Normally I tell you I just waltzed 
                        into a nail salon on a fun free day 
                        and found the time machine there 
                        and la di da. But that wasn’t quite 
                        the case. You see, Gary, that 
                        fateful day of my first travel, 
                        some three months ago... I planned 
                        on killing myself.

           A JUDGEY WASPY NEW YORK WOMAN in her 50’s sitting in an 
           adjacent table and clearly eavesdropping, turns to look at 
           Sheila and gasps in horror. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                             (turns to woman)
                        Oh relax, Susan. We’ve all been 
                        there.
                             (back at Gary)
                        Anyways. 

           INT. “NAIL ME GOOD” NAIL SALON - FLASHBACK

           The door SWINGS OPEN LOUDLY - and Sheila walks in like a 
           hurricane, a particularly disheveled mess. 

           All the NAIL SALON EXPERTS look up from their meticulous 
           work. 

           All the PATRONS look up from their US WEEKLY magazines. 

           All eyes on this crazy lady at the entrance.

                                 SHEILA
                        HI THERE! Good afternoon. I plan on 
                        killing myself later today, and I’d 
                        like to go out with nice nails.
                             (a beat)
                        You know, for the fans.

           A long silence.

           Is someone gonna call the cops? What’s gonna happen?

           Finally, Chul-Soon perks up from the back of the room.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        What color?

                                                                CUT TO:
           Sheila and Chul-Soon scan the wall of colorful nail polish 
           choices. Almost too many choices. How do we put up with so 
           many choices? Sheila looks overwhelmed. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. Hmmm. Maybe something that says 
                        “She lived a classy life”?

           Chul-Soon quickly grabs a neutral lilac. She shows Sheila the 
           name of the shade (try saying that three times fast!)

           It’s called “Elegant Death.” 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Aw. Elegant Death. Perfect. 

           LATER

           Sheila is getting her nails done.

                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        So I get my nails done. And then I 
                        have to use the bathroom.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, can I use your restrooms? 
                        I’d like to die with an empty 
                        bladder. 

           BACK ROOM

           Sheila walks through the back room. It’s like a storage 
           space, filled with a bunch of nail and spa equipment. 

                                 SHEILA (VOICEOVER) (CONT’D)
                        And there in the back was a large 
                        horizontal glowing neon bed that 
                        looked like a tanning machine. And 
                        Chul-Soon comes over, and tells me 
                        about it. Turns out, it’s not a tan 
                        machine. It’s a time machine!

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Owner bought it. But he does not 
                        like it. Machine only goes back 24 
                        hours. No more, no less. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (shakes her head)
                        Damn. False advertisement is such a 
                        problem these days, Chul-Soon. So 
                        glad I won’t have to deal with that 
                        for much longer, since I’m about to 
                        straight up murder myself. 
                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Maybe before you... off yourself... 
                        You go in there?

           Chul-Soon points at the time machine. 

           Sheila laughs a sad bitter laugh.

                                 SHEILA
                        What? To time travel? What for, 
                        Chul-Soon? My life was shit 
                        yesterday too. 

           Sheila tears up. Chul-Soon gives her a kleenex. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Actually, I don’t wanna get it on 
                        the
                             (motioning at nails)
                        Can you?

           Chul-Soon dabs Sheila’s tears away with the tissue. She helps 
           her blow her nose too.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. I’m such a pathetic sad sack. 
                        Why are you so nice to me? 

           Chul-Soon shrugs.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        You tip decent.

                                 SHEILA
                        Anyways. What’s the point of time 
                        traveling? Tomorrow, yesterday - 
                        it’s all shit. That’s the problem, 
                        Chul-Soon. My life’s always shit. 
                        Also, I have a sensitive stomach.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        It’s a second chance. Those are 
                        very rare. You should take it. 
                        Maybe you’ll see things different 
                        on the other side. And if you don’t 
                        - you can always kill yourself 
                        later.  

           Sheila considers this. She looks at her pretty nails. Then up 
           at Chul-Soon’s kind face. 
                                 SHEILA
                        Oh fuck it, why not. Maybe I’ll get 
                        shit out on the other side of the 
                        rainbow. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                             (confused)
                        That’s the spirit!

           Chul-Soon helps Sheila lie down on the time machine bed. 

           She hits a few cryptic looking buttons, then everything FADES 
           TO WHITE. 

           END FLASHBACK

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - PRESENT TIME

           Their table is now FULL OF TOO MUCH FOOD. A very fancy bottle 
           of wine, half consumed. 

                                 SHEILA
                        And here I am! 24 hours in the 
                        past.

                                 GARY
                        Wow. Wow. 
                             (thinks)
                        Wow. That’s... Wow.

                                 SHEILA
                        I know.

                                 GARY
                        And how are you feeling.. N.. Now? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh much better.

                                 GARY
                        Did you get shit out the other side 
                        of the rainbow?

                                 SHEILA
                        I did. 

           Sheila smiles a genuine real smile. A grateful smile.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        In fact, this is the first time 
                        I’ve been happy in a very, very 
                        long time, Gary. 
                                 GARY
                        That’s great. That’s really great. 

           He digests. It’s a lot. A lot on the table. And a lot from 
           this woman. 

           The check comes. She puts her credit card down. He tries to 
           put his, but she shoos his hand away. 

           He finishes his glass of wine and stares at her signing, 
           pondering this strange creature and her strange game.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - MINUTES LATER

           Sheila and Gary exit the restaurant.

                                 SHEILA
                             (casually)
                        Goodnight, Amit!

           Amit stares at her, weirded out. How did she know his name? 

           Sheila and Gary walk down the street. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Where to now, officer?

           Gary debates. 

                                 GARY
                        Well... I gotta come clean here 
                        too, Sheila.

                                 SHEILA
                        By all means! This is a confession 
                        safe zone, as clearly demonstrated 
                        by my bonkers story. 

                                 GARY
                        Alright, good. So... How to put 
                        this... It’s not that I think that 
                        you’re a passenger on the crazy 
                        train.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. Phew. Good. Thank you.

                                 GARY
                        It’s more that I think that you’re 
                        the conductor of the crazy train.
                                 SHEILA
                             (nods)
                        Fair, fair. That’s fair.

                                 GARY
                             (sighs)
                        But I’ve been on the boring 
                        sidewalk for a very, very long time 
                        now. 
                             (a beat)
                        So I’m willing to take a little 
                        ride. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well then... ALL ABOARD, BABY.

                                 GARY
                        Just don’t... Drive us off a cliff, 
                        OK? 

                                 SHEILA
                        I would never.

           She bumps into a pole.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

                                 GARY
                        Are you OK?

           She rubs her head. He starts to laugh. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Thanks. Thanks. I’m fine. I knew.. 
                        That was coming. Cuz... Future. I.. 
                        Planned it.. We needed... comic 
                        relief. 

                                 GARY
                        Right. Naturally. So. Where to 
                        next?

           INT. ST. MARKS - VINTAGE STORE - LATER

           Gary and Sheila browse racks upon racks of OLD CLOTHES, some 
           sad, some funny, some good, some tacky. 

           Sheila suddenly spots something very exciting in one of the 
           racks. She pulls it out. 
           It’s a vintage dark blue MECHANIC’S buttoned down shirt, the 
           kind with a stitched-on white name tag on it. She shows it to 
           Gary. 

           In red woven font, the NAMETAG reads “GARY.”

                                 SHEILA
                        OH MY GOD. What are the odds?! An 
                        old timey shirt with your old timey 
                        name! It’s a sign. You have to get 
                        it. You have to. I’m getting this 
                        for you.

                                 GARY
                        Nope.

                                 SHEILA
                        You’re getting it. 

                                 GARY
                        OK fine. I’ll get it. If you get...

           He grabs something off a shelf.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        THIS.

           He shows her a scarf. It’s filled with tiny graphics of 
           CLOCKS. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Deal. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Sheila now wears the clock scarf, Gary wears the buttoned 
           down mechanic shirt that has his name. 

           (NOTE: For the rest of the film, they will occasionally be 
           wearing these items.)  

                                 GARY
                        This is turning out to be quite the 
                        night. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Quite the night! 

                                 GARY
                        What other juicy secrets are we 
                        going to uncover? 
                                 SHEILA
                        Oh where to begin?

                                 GARY
                        Not sure how you can top time 
                        travel.

                                 SHEILA
                        Let’s see... 
                             (thinking)
                        Did you know I was married once? 

                                 GARY
                        No! Really? Just once?

                                 SHEILA
                        Yep. Just once. Five long years 
                        though.

                                 GARY
                        Why’d you leave him?

                                 SHEILA
                        Ha. You’re sweet. He left me.

                                 GARY
                        How come?

                                 SHEILA
                        He said I was, “Always looking over 
                        his shoulder.”

                                 GARY
                        Huh. Like grass is greener type 
                        thing? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Maybe. I don’t know. I think he 
                        meant more that I was looking over 
                        his shoulder for someone specific.

                                 GARY
                        Who?

           She shoots a quick vulnerable glance at Gary, then looks at 
           the ground. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (shrugs)
                        I dunno. Guess I didn’t really get 
                        what he meant. 
                                 GARY
                        I get it. I I just came out of a 
                        long relationship too, with this 
                        girl Amber. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Christ Gary, nothing good ever came 
                        out of a girl named Amber. 

           They keep walking and talking. 

           INT. HIPSTER ICE CREAM SHOP - LATER

           Gary and Sheila stand in front of Chai, the ice cream serving 
           hipster who is dead inside. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Tell me, Chai. Do you have any “off-
                        the-menu” items?

           Sheila WINKS. 

                                 CHAI
                             (sarcastic)
                        Um... If they’re off the menu, I 
                        can’t tell you about them, can I?

           Sheila slips her a 100 dollar bill. Chai eyes the bill. 
           Thinks about it. Then subtly takes it. 

                                 CHAI (CONT’D)
                        OK, we have one special. It’s 
                        called “The Teenage Years.” It’s 
                        black liquorice ice cream served 
                        inside a clove cigarette flavored 
                        cone. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Ooooh. Very dark. Very emo. We’ll 
                        take two. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary and Sheila sit on a bench eating their teenage years. 
           Gary takes a bite.

                                 GARY
                        Wow. Tastes just like puberty.

                                 SHEILA
                        Tastes like Tori Amos. 
           They eat in silence. Suddenly Gary freaks out.

                                 GARY
                        Wow, wait. I’m getting a crazy 
                        sense of deja-vu. 
                             (a beat)
                        Quick, say something.

                                 SHEILA AND GARY
                        JUMBO SHRIMP DISCO BALLS!

           Gary reels.

                                 GARY
                        Wow! 
                             (a beat)
                        Wait... Was that my deja-vu... or 
                        your... time travel?

                                 SHEILA
                             (smiles)
                        Does it matter?

           They eat in silence. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Wanna hear something crazy, 
                        speaking of our teenage years? 

           She points her finger up at an apartment building across the 
           street, a block away. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        I grew up in that apartment 
                        building.

                                 GARY
                        What? No way.

                                 SHEILA
                        Yep. 114 1st Ave, apartment 3B. 
                        Lived there my entire childhood, 
                        from birth till college.  

                                 GARY
                        Crazy. What was it like?

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, the city was different, of 
                        course. But it was fine. A little 
                        lonely. Like I said, dad was a 
                        traveling alcoholic. Mom gave up at 
                        some point too.

                        Didn't really have a positive 
                        parental role model growing up.
                             (suddenly remembers 
                              something)
                        Except one time the cable guy came 
                        over... I was young I don't 
                        remember much. But he was very nice 
                        to me. He said something...
                             (thinking hard)
                        I can’t remember... But I feel like 
                        whatever it was - it set me free. 
                        Is that weird? 

                                 GARY
                             (laughs)
                        Um.. A cable guy being your beacon 
                        of hope? Yes. I’d say it’s weird. 
                        But so what. Take it where you can 
                        get it, that’s what I always say.

                                 SHEILA
                        I bet you do.

           They giggle, and he DROPS HIS TEENAGE YEARS ON THE FLOOR. 

           The smile is IMMEDIATELY wiped off his face, replaced with 
           anger, frustration - disproportionate self-hatred.

                                 GARY
                        FUCK. SHIT. FUCK. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Hey, hey, it’s OK.

           But Gary doesn’t hear Sheila, lost in a spiral of self-
           loathing and anger. 

                                 GARY
                        SHIT. HORSE SHIT. Cocksucking 
                        motherfucker. FUCK. FUCK. 

           He spirals and spirals - until she grabs him. With both 
           hands. Turns him over to face her. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Hey. Hey. It’s OK. Hey. Look at me. 
                        It’s OK for things to be messy 
                        sometimes. 

           She wraps her arms around him. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK for things to be messy 
                        sometimes.
           She lets go. 

           And with that one sentence, it’s like she freed him from a 
           life long prison sentence. 

           How can that be? A wave of relief, calm, ecstasy, FREEDOM 
           washes over him. 

           Before his intellect can catch up to his emotions, he leans 
           over and kisses her, passionately. She kisses back.

           They break away and smile at each other. A deep bond forming.

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           They stand there. What’s next?

                                 GARY
                        What a night.

                                 SHEILA
                        Indeed.

                                 GARY
                        Worth the time travel?

                                 SHEILA
                        A thousand percent. Henry F. Zagat 
                        calls it “A SYMPHONY FOR ALL SEVEN 
                        SENSES.”

           They smile at each other. Silence. 

                                 GARY
                        Well, I’d love to see you again.

           Sheila pauses. Saying nothing. Debating... something.

           The silence makes Gary insecure. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        What? What is it? You don’t want to 
                        see me, or... I thought... we had a 
                        nice time, or... Was I...? 

           Finally, she blurts it out--

                                 SHEILA
                        I feel like I’ve been waiting for 
                        you my whole life. 
                                 GARY
                        Oh... O... OK. 
                             (digesting)
                        Well, it’s a little early for that, 
                        don’t you think?

                                 SHEILA
                        It’s been three months, Gary. 

           Gary takes a step back. 

                                 GARY
                        What? No. It’s been one night, 
                        Sheila. It’s been one night. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I... I told you the truth for the 
                        first time today. I wanted to die 
                        Gary. That day, at the nail salon - 
                        I was ready to die. I was dead 
                        inside already. Nothing made me 
                        happy. Nothing. Until you came. And 
                        then everything changed. You’re the 
                        first thing to make me happy, 
                        since... since childhood. Since, 
                        ever, maybe. You’re the person I’ve 
                        been looking over men’s shoulders 
                        for. You’re the thing I’ve been 
                        waiting for my whole life. 

           Gary takes more steps back. He may have underestimated just 
           how crazy this crazy train is. 

                                 GARY
                        Look. I think. We should... Take a 
                        breath here. I think I should go 
                        home now. And we can talk about 
                        this... Later.. Maybe... Or like, 
                        you know, never. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Wait.

           He holds his arms out in front of him, to make it clear he is 
           not interested in continuing the dialogue. 

                                 GARY
                        Goodnight, Sheila. Thank you for an 
                        interesting evening. 

           He walks away, filling with regret, anger, fear, debilitating 
           sadness with every step. 
           For once in his life, he found something good. And it was 
           fake. It was fake. He should have known better. He doesn’t 
           deserve anything good. So stupid. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Wait! Ugh. Fuck. Fine. Walk away. 
                        That’s what you’re best at. 

                                 GARY
                             (yells, from afar)
                        What are you talking about?! WE 
                        LITERALLY JUST MET! 

                                 SHEILA
                             (shakes her head)
                        Typical Gary... 
                             (whispers)
                        I’ll see you tomorrow. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS:

           END MONTAGE. And we’re back at the --

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           East Village dive bar. Winter. 6PM.

           Two strangers - a man and a woman - sit at opposite ends of a 
           bar. 

           Other people sit at the bar too, watching a sports game on 
           TV. But they’re not important. 

           Gary does not watch the game. Instead, he arranges THREE 
           COASTERS on the table in perfect symmetry. 

           Unbeknownst to him, Sheila stares at him with the intensity 
           of a thousand suns.

           She stares at him like she’s been waiting her whole life to 
           meet him. 
           But not in a bullshit manifest destiny rom-com kind of way. 
           In a real way. 

           But also, this time, in an extra frustrated kind of way, 
           maybe. Like someone who’s done this 364 days in a row now and 
           is getting just a liiiiiiittle bit tired of the same-old same-
           old routine. 

           Bartender Phil is staring at her with amusement. But before 
           he can even open his mouth--

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah, Phil, real thirsty. But not 
                        for your side commentary. Super 
                        quenched on that account so don’t 
                        even worry about it.

           Phil stares at this woman he’s never met before like “WHAT 
           THE FUCK?” As she stands up, gives him a “talk to the hand” 
           motion, straightens her dress and walks up to Gary, somewhat 
           mechanically. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                             (deadpan)
                        Hi I’m Sheila. Want a drink?

           Gary looks up at her for the first time. Takes her in.

                                 GARY
                        S... Sure. I’m... I’m Gary. 

           But when she sees him, her cynicism melts a little. She 
           smiles. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Great.

           She motions to the Bartender. He comes over.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I get you?

                           GARY
                                                         SHEILA
           Old Fashioned. 
                                              Whiskey, neat. 

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Right away. 

           Yeah, Sheila knows she can wow Gary with the whole “saying 
           the same thing at the same time, ordering the same drink” 
           trick, but life is shit and who even gives a fuck anymore, 
           and frankly, fuck Gary, just a little bit. 
           Indeed, Sheila looks a little worn in general, like she’s 
           just going through the motions, hoping to feel that old 
           excitement of sweet infatuation again. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So Gary. It appears we both have 
                        old timey names. 

                                 GARY
                        And ergo, sadistic parents. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Is that why you’re neatly arranging 
                        the coasters? A little habit you 
                        picked up as a kid of sadistic 
                        parents?

                                 GARY
                             (surprised)
                        Y.. Yeah, actually. But I promise, 
                        I don’t--

                                 SHEILA AND GARY
                        Murder animals or anything. 

           Gary looks at her, shocked. 

                                 GARY
                        How’d you know? 

                                 SHEILA
                        ‘Cause I’m from the future. It’s a 
                        long story, I won’t bore you with 
                        the details. 

           The Bartender places the drinks down in front of them. They 
           both turn to face him.

                           GARY 
                                                         SHEILA
                                                (deadpan)
                                              Yeah thanks, Phil. 
                 (awful Australian 
                 accent)
           Cheers, mate!

           Bartender laughs, leaves. 

                                 GARY
                        So... from the future you say? 
                        Please bore me with the details. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I went back to kill Hitler. But my 
                        calculations were off by three days 
                        and seventy years. So I ended up in 
                        this hipster nightmare.

                                 GARY
                        Wow. OK.

                                 GARY
                        Sure. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (more desperate than being 
                              funny)
                        I’ll do everything you say. 

                                 GARY
                        OK. Well the first phase in our 
                        modern day courting ritual is--

                                 SHEILA
                        Dinner? I’d love to. 

           As they walk out, Bartender Phil looks at them and shakes his 
           head, as if he’s some mythical cupid figure who masterminded 
           this whole thing. Then he frowns.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey. You guys gonna pay for that?!

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary and Sheila walk down 2nd avenue, in the middle of their 
           usual jokey routine. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (clears her throat)
                        “God, grant me the serenity to 
                        accept the things I cannot 
                        change...” 

                                 GARY
                        “... Courage to change the things I 
                        can...” 

                                 GARY AND SHEILA
                        “...and the wisdom to distinguish 
                        the one from the other." 

           They smile at each other. Ah yes, one of their classic 
           trademark bonding moments... 
           Then Sheila frowns. 

                                 SHEILA
                        For real though, I don’t think you 
                        should use your childhood as a 
                        crutch so much. I mean yes, our 
                        parents were neglectful. And yes, 
                        your father is gone, and you will 
                        never get the justice you’re owed. 
                        But you’re a grown ass man now. You 
                        can make your own decisions. You 
                        can rise above the lack of support 
                        and love you experienced as a child 
                        and build a proactive healthy life 
                        for yourself, you know? 

                                 GARY
                        I... What? I don’t use my childhood 
                        as a crutch.

                                 SHEILA
                        No, I know you don’t. I just mean.. 
                        You’re so smart and funny and you 
                        just have such great potential to 
                        succeed in life... It just sucks to 
                        watch you kinda... meander... and 
                        let opportunities pass you by... 
                        instead of grabbing life by the 
                        balls, ya know? 

                                 GARY
                        What are you talking about, lady?? 
                        We just met! 

           He distances himself from her, creeped out. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I know. I know. Hey. I’m just... 
                        I’m just joking around! It’s... 
                        future humor! Ha ha. You’ll get it. 
                        In about thirty years. Oh look - 
                        Indian restaurants! 

           EXT. 6TH STREET 

           A block full of colorful lights and Indian restaurants that 
           are indistinguishable from the outside unless you know 
           better. 

                                 GARY
                        Wow, so many choi--
                                 SHEILA
                             (impatient)
                        Here, let’s go to this one. 

           They pass by Amit. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Sup, Amit?

           She high fives Amit one-sidedly as she walks past. 

           Amit looks at her shocked, who is this strange woman?

           She yanks the menu from his hands and enters the restaurant. 
           Gary grabs a menu and runs after her, trying to keep up. 

                                 GARY
                        OK then, this one it is!  

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           The restaurant is decked in colorful lights. Everything is 
           pink and blue and surreal. 

           Sheila studies the menu. Gary studies Sheila. A little 
           intrigued, very concerned. 

                                 GARY
                        So if you’re from the future... Can 
                        you guess--

                                 GARY AND SHEILA
                        What I’m going to say?

                                 SHEILA
                             (smiles)
                        Yes.

           Gary thinks for a moment.

                                 GARY
                             (yells)
                        TIGER BALLS!

           Everyone turns to look.

           Sheila bursts out laughing.

                                 SHEILA
                        Sorry. I couldn’t resist. 
                                 GARY
                             (shakes his head)
                        Fair, fair... I walked right into 
                        that one...

           Gary studies the menu.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        So what looks good here?

                                 SHEILA
                             (indifferent)
                        It’s all decent. I don’t really 
                        care. You choose. 

                                 GARY
                        Wow, so many yummy options...

                                 SHEILA
                             (irritated)
                        Yes. I know, Gary. It’s a menu. 

                                 GARY
                        What do you feel like?

                                 SHEILA
                        I don’t know man! Why can’t you 
                        choose for us? Why do you defer to 
                        me? Why can’t you just be proactive 
                        and make decisions for us?

                                 GARY
                        Wow. Yikes! I was just trying to be 
                        a gentleman.

           Sheila softens. Smiles. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I’m sorry. Sorry. That time of the 
                        month, am I right? Yikes! 

           Gary stares her over. Shakes his head. Forgives her. Smiles. 

                                 GARY
                        Alright crabby lady. I will do the 
                        choosing.

           They order. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        So... you wanna tell me about the 
                        future?
                                 SHEILA
                        Not really. What’s the point?

                                 GARY
                        The point is it’s interesting!

                                 SHEILA
                        Is it? The future isn’t what it 
                        used to be, Gary. 

           Gary chuckles. She studies him. This charming man child. So 
           much potential. Yet so endlessly frustrating. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Honestly... I gotta come clean with 
                        you here, Gary. We’ve been doing 
                        this for a year now, and... I 
                        wanted to give this a chance, 
                        but... Things are starting to feel 
                        a little one-sided here.

                                 GARY
                        A year? We met two hours ago!

           Sheila shoos away his words like a fly. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Look, I get it. To you it’s just 
                        one night. But for me it’s my life 
                        now. My life is this night. My 
                        entire life is dedicated to this 
                        one night and nothing else, you 
                        understand? And is it a great 
                        night? Yes. And is it by my own 
                        design? By my own choice? Yes. But 
                        damnit, Gary, even perfectly cooked 
                        steak starts to taste like shit if 
                        you eat it all day every day.

                                 GARY
                        I’m sorry, I think I’m a little 
                        lost here. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I just don’t know if it’s working, 
                        Gary. At first I thought we were a 
                        perfect match. But now... I just 
                        don’t know anymore. This is 
                        stunted. And maybe that’s my fault, 
                        by getting us stuck in this 
                        impossible loop. But I’m starting 
                        to think it’s your fault too. 
                        You’re just so... Passive. And 
                        careful. And neat about everything.

                                 SHEILA (CONT'D)
                        You’re so afraid of making a mess. 
                        You’re so afraid of taking a risk. 
                        Making a mistake. There’s just 
                        nowhere to go with you... but down.

                                 GARY
                        Um. I think I’m gonna go now.

                                 SHEILA
                             (cynical)
                        Wow. Big surprise.

           He stands. 

                                 GARY
                        This was a mistake. I.. No offense, 
                        but I think you need help. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (bitterly)
                        We need help.

                                 GARY
                        No, you need help. Sheila, is it? 
                        Take care of yourself, OK? 

           Gary storms out.

           Sheila sits at the table alone, watching him leave, and 
           drinks wine straight from the bottle. 

           The JUDGEY WASPY NEW YORK WOMAN from their adjacent table 
           stares at her in shock.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh give it a rest, Susan, we all 
                        know you steal purses from Bergdorf 
                        Goodman on the regular.

           Susan GASPS, shocked by the accusation, then secretly kicks 
           her EXPENSIVE PURSE under the table and out of sight. 

           EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           Sheila slowly exits, slouched, miserable. She stops by Amit. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Rough night, Amit. Can I bum a 
                        smoke?

           Amit doesn’t know if to be creeped out cuz she knows his name 
           or cuz she knows he smokes. He reluctantly gives her a 
           cigarette and lights one for himself. 
           They smoke in silence for a minute, watching people go by.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Love, huh? What a muddy sinking 
                        swamp shithole fire trash dumpster. 

                                 AMIT
                        I’m happily married.

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah, we get it, Amit. Your life is 
                        perfect.

                                 AMIT
                        Maybe one day luck will change for 
                        you too, ah?

                                 SHEILA
                        Pff. Yeah right.

           She stares at the street. At the people. At the couples.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Nothing ever changes for me, Amit. 
                        That’s the whole problem. My life 
                        is consistent shit and nothing ever 
                        changes. 

           Suddenly something hits her.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Wait... 
                             (a beat)
                        Change....

                        That’s it, Amit! You restaurant 
                        entrance seducing menu dangling 
                        brilliant sexy bastard! Though 
                        happily married, I get it, not 
                        trying to flirt with you. BUT 
                        CHANGE. I can change! 

                                 AMIT
                        Well, I meant your luck. People 
                        don’t really change. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well not change myself - that would 
                        be crazy! I mean change him. I can 
                        fix him. I can change HIM! 
                                 AMIT
                        Well, no, like I said, people don’t 
                        really change. And you certainly 
                        can’t change people. 

           She shoos his words away like a fly. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I mean, sure. But what’s that, 
                        really? That’s just words, Amit, 
                        OK? And what are words really? 
                        Except a bunch of thoughts spoken 
                        out loud. We talk too much, Amit. 
                             (a beat)
                        I mean, as a civilization. Not you 
                        and me. We barely talk. And I 
                        regret that on a daily basis. 
                             (a beat)
                        Anyways. 

           She gives him a big hug. He recoils. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Thanks Amit. You’ve been a huge 
                        help. 

           She runs off, excitedly. 

           Amit shakes his head, stomps his cigarette.

                                 AMIT
                        Fucking millennials.

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           East Village dive bar. Winter. 6PM.
           Two strangers - a man and a woman - sit at opposite ends of a 
           bar. 

           Other people sit at the bar too, watching a sports game on 
           TV. The good guys are losing. 

           Gary watches the game too, deeply invested. 

           He cheers and claps and boos with all the other men.

                                 GARY
                             (yells)
                        OH COME ON! BAD CALL!

           The other men yell too.

                                 OTHER MEN
                        Bad call! SHIT CALL! 

           Gary nods at them with shared sympathy as he chugs his beer. 

           He looks... different.

           Better shape. Better posture. More wholesome somehow. Well 
           adjusted. Relaxed. Happier, maybe. 

           He’s definitely not lining up coasters like a weirdo, that’s 
           for sure. 

           Unbeknownst to him, Sheila stares at him with laser focus. 
           With the intensity of a thousand suns. Like she’s been 
           waiting her whole life to meet him. 

           The Bartender stares at her with amusement. She puts a hand 
           out in front of the Bartender, blocking his face, as if to 
           say - “There is nothing I need to hear from you.”  

           Slowly, Sheila stands, makes her way towards this new Gary, 
           studying him with great fascination along the way. 

           She’s visibly nervous. Like he’s a new man. Like it’s their 
           first date (for the first time!) 

           She cautiously takes a seat next to him.

                                 SHEILA
                        Hi there!

           Gary turns to look at her, smiles an easy vacant smile. Then 
           looks back at the giant TV’s.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                             (clears her throat)
                        Are the good guys winning?
           It takes Gary a second to answer, because his attention is 
           split between her and the millionaire men in tights with not 
           so good working brains anymore on TV.

           Luckily, we go to commercials.

                                 GARY
                        I’m afraid not. They’re losing. 
                        Bad. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Such injustice! 

                                 GARY
                        Yeah, it fucking sucks. 

           He looks her over. She’s pretty cute. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Gary. Want a drink?

                                 SHEILA
                        S... Sure. I’m Sheila. 

                                 GARY
                        Wow, old timey name like mine. 
                        Thanks mom and dad, am I right?

           Sheila laughs, studying him as he reaches for the wallet, 
           calls the Bartender over. He’s surprisingly... smooth. 
           Confident. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        What would you like?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh... I don’t know. Um... A.. 
                        Cosmo? 

                                 GARY
                             (at Bartender)
                        A cosmo for the lady and another 
                        IPA for me. 

           Bartender nods. Gary throws a 20 on the table like he’s 
           fucking Tom Cruise. (Meaning, like he is Tom Cruise, not like 
           he’s fornicating with Tom Cruise.... You get it.)

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        So I take it you’re not a sports 
                        fan?

                                 SHEILA
                        How do you figure that?
                                 GARY
                        Well, first tell - you called them 
                        “the good guys.”

                                 SHEILA
                        Ha. Busted. 

                                 GARY
                        So you just here... picking up 
                        guys?

                                 SHEILA
                        You got me. Just one though. 

                                 GARY
                        Who?

                                 SHEILA
                        You.

                                 GARY
                        Is that right?

           They both smile at each other. Things are flirty and new and 
           exciting!

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Well tell you what. Ain’t no way 
                        our guys are coming back from this. 
                        What do you say we get out of here, 
                        go get a bite to eat?

                                 SHEILA
                        Let’s do it! 

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Sheila and Gary walk down the street. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So where do you wanna go? There’s a 
                        bunch of Indi--

                                 GARY
                        There’s a new Italian place right 
                        across the street I’ve been meaning 
                        to try. What do you say?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. Yeah, sure!
           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           Gary and Sheila sit at a corner table in a romantic cozy 
           Italian restaurant. Sipping on wine. 

           It’s like the cover of ROMANCE MAGAZINE. Everything is 
           perfect. Elegant. Classy. Cozy. Intimate. 

                                 GARY
                        So what do you do, Ms. Sheila?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh. I’m uh. I’m an executive 
                        assistant producer. 

                                 GARY
                        Wow. Sounds serious.

                                 SHEILA
                        Like cancer. What about you? What 
                        do you do, now that I fixed yo--
                        What do you do, Gary?

                                 GARY
                        I run a small start-up. About 15 
                        people right now. Hopefully more 
                        soon.

                                 SHEILA
                        Wow! That’s pretty badass.

                                 GARY
                        If we can secure this year’s 
                        investments, it might just be. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So you’re a fancy mister CEO man?

                                 GARY
                             (laughs)
                        I guess I am. 

           Silence. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (suddenly serious)
                        Are you happy, Gary? In life, I 
                        mean?

                                 GARY
                        Yeah. I mean, yeah. Sure. Why not? 
                        Life is complicated. But I’m here 
                        for the good parts.
                                 SHEILA
                        I like that.

           Sheila feels very proud of herself. She fixed Gary!

           Then a silence falls on the table. Huh. That’s never happened 
           before. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        So um...

                                 GARY
                        Uh...

           Sheila suddenly feels a little lonely.

           She catches herself looking over Gary’s shoulder.... For old 
           Gary. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        So uh... What do you like to do for 
                        fun?

                                 SHEILA
                             (blurts out)
                        I’m from the future, Gary. 

           Gary laughs.

                                 GARY
                        OK... 

                                 SHEILA
                        It’s true. 

                                 GARY
                        Why’d you travel back here?

                                 SHEILA
                        For you.

                                 GARY
                        OK...

                                 SHEILA
                        It was an accident at first. But 
                        then I fell in love with you. And 
                        started spending time with you. 372 
                        days straight to be exact. I loved 
                        everything about you. Everything. 
                        But then... I didn’t. I mean, I 
                        did. I still love everything about 
                        you. Just... There were just a few 
                        little things... I had to change. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEILA (CONT'D)
                        For everything to be great. I 
                        mean... It happens in all 
                        relationships, right? No one’s 
                        perfect. You can’t love 100% of 
                        everything about someone. 

           Gary’s eyes start to dart between this crazy woman and the 
           Waiter. He does the “can we get the check?” motion. 

                                 GARY
                             (stalling till the check 
                              comes)
                        OK... So... Let me get this 
                        straight... You... “changed me”? 
                        How, exactly? I didn’t know you 
                        could change people. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, here’s the thing, Gary. You 
                        know how I always tell you the time 
                        machine in the nail salon is a dud 
                        and can only go 24 hours into the 
                        past?

                                 GARY
                        No. You never told me that. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (not listening)
                        Well I gotta come clean with you 
                        Gary. I may have lied about that. 
                        In reality--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NAIL SALON - BACK ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Chul-Soon shows suicidal Sheila the time machine for the 
           first time.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        It no tan machine. It time machine. 
                        It can go anywhere in the past. 
                        BUT!

                                 SHEILA
                        But?

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Only for 24 hours. Then ZAP! You’re 
                        back here.
                                 SHEILA
                        That’s a cool story, Chul-Soon but 
                        I’d like to go commit suicide now. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Maybe before you... off yourself... 
                        You go in there?

                                 SHEILA
                        Why would I travel to the past? 
                        Why? A week ago, five years ago - 
                        it’s all shit. That’s the problem, 
                        Chul-Soon. My life’s always shit. 
                        Also, I have a sensitive stomach.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        It’s a second chance. Those are 
                        rare. You should take it. Maybe 
                        you’ll see things different on the 
                        other side. And if you don’t - you 
                        can always kill yourself later.  

           Sheila considers this. She looks at her pretty nails. Then up 
           at Chul-Soon’s kind face. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh fuck it, why not. Maybe I’ll get 
                        shit out on the other side of the 
                        rainbow. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                             (confused)
                        That’s the spirit!

           Chul-Soon helps Sheila lie down on the time machine bed. 

                                 CHUL-SOON (CONT’D)
                        When would you like to go to?

                                 SHEILA
                        Surprise me! 

           She hits a few cryptic looking buttons, then everything FADES 
           TO WHITE. 

           END FLASHBACK

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - CONT’D

                                 SHEILA
                        And here I am! 24 hours in the 
                        past.
                                 GARY
                        Wow. Wow. 
                             (thinks)
                        Wow. That’s... Wow.

                                 SHEILA
                        I know! 

                                 GARY
                        So you could travel to literally 
                        any point in the past, and you 
                        chose..... Yesterday?

                                 SHEILA
                        I mean, technically Chul-Soon chose 
                        for me. And sure, when I first came 
                        out I was like - “What the fuck 
                        Chul-Soon? Yes my whole life is 
                        shit but I don’t need a reminder of 
                        my most up-to-date version of shit, 
                        you know? Would have preferred a 
                        more distant nostalgic shit part of 
                        my life.” But then I thought - 
                        alcohol. So I stumbled into a bar. 
                        And then I met you. And everything 
                        changed.

                                 GARY
                        O... OK. And that was... a year 
                        ago?

                                 SHEILA
                        Well technically yesterday. But 
                        yes. We’ve been seeing each other 
                        for a year. We’ve been doing 
                        tonight for a year. Our 
                        anniversary, Gary! 

           The check comes, not soon enough. Gary gratefully takes it 
           and pays quickly.

                                 GARY
                        Shall we?

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           They emerge from the restaurant. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Thank you for dinner. It was 
                        delicious!
           Gary is torn. On one hand, he can’t wait to get the FUCK AWAY 
           FROM THIS BATSHIT INSANE WOMAN HE JUST MET. 

           On the other, he’s fascinated with and creeped out by her 
           story. And he has just about a million questions. 

           They start walking. 

                                 GARY
                        So I still don’t get the part how 
                        you... changed... me?

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh! Right. Sorry. I forgot. So I 
                        uh... You know. I know you pretty 
                        well by now. You really opened up 
                        to me over the past year. Heard all 
                        your stories. Past relationships. 
                        Childhood stuff. Traumas. Regrets. 
                        Disappointments. Heartbreak. Etc. 
                        Etc.  And I’ve isolated the moments 
                        that I think were pivotal to the 
                        decline in your mental health. The 
                        “where things went wrong” moments, 
                        I like to call them.

                                 GARY
                             (cynical)
                        Oh, is that what you like to call 
                        them?

                                 SHEILA
                        Yep. And let’s chill it with the 
                        sarcasm, OK, Gary? It’s our 
                        anniversary, after all. Anyways. So 
                        I traveled to those pivotal 
                        moments. To fix them. 

                                 GARY
                        Like... What? Give me an example?

                                 SHEILA
                        OK... Like... 

           EXT. GARY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - PORCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Jersey. A quaint suburban house. Porch. 

           We see A MAN’S BACK as he knocks on the front door.

           Gary, 12, opens the door. He’s dressed in 80’s-90’s nerd 
           fashion. He’s holding an Ursula K. Le Guin paperback in his 
           pale hands. 
                                 GARY
                        Yes?

           The man speaks in a low old man’s voice--

                                 MAN
                        Good afternoon, young man.

           We turn around and see the MAN for the first time.

           It’s Sheila in a baseball hat, thick rimmed glasses, a fake 
           moustache and padded menswear. She slumps forward, faking the 
           posture of an older man. 

           She has her hands behind her back, holding... something. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (old man’s voice)
                        My name is Charlie. I just moved in 
                        across the street. 

                                 GARY
                        OK.

                                 SHEILA
                        And I was wondering if I could 
                        interest you in... 

           She dramatically brings her hands forward to show Gary what 
           she’s holding - A BASEBALL MITT IN EACH HAND. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        A friendly game of catch?

           Gary’s face lights up when he sees the baseball mitts, but 
           then he shrinks in place.

                                 GARY
                        I’m not supposed to talk to 
                        strangers. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, we’re not strangers. I live 
                        across the street. You’re... Gary, 
                        aren’t you? And you know I’m 
                        Charlie. You can even call me Uncle 
                        Charlie if you’d like. 

           Gary still debates, standing by the door.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Can I tell you a secret, Gary?

           Gary nods.
                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        I lost my son in a boating 
                        accident. And I miss him very, very 
                        much. He was... Why, I’d say he was 
                        just about your age. More or less. 
                        You know... It would mean the world 
                        to me if you just played a little 
                        catch with me right here in your 
                        yard. Just for a minute or two. 
                        What do you say, champ? Just right 
                        here, outside.

           Gary debates. Finally he nods. Smiles.

                                 GARY
                        OK!

           EXT. YARD - LATER

           Gary and Sheila in old man drag play catch. 

           They’ve warmed up. Gotten into a groove. Friendlier now.

                                 SHEILA
                        So how’s school these days, champ?

                                 GARY
                             (shrugs)
                        It’s OK.

           They throw the ball back and forth.

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh yeah? Not a fan, huh? It’s OK, I 
                        wasn’t either. 

           Silence. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        So whatcha reading back there?

           Then - Gary’s face lights up.

                                 GARY
                        It’s a story about a man. In 
                        another planet. But he... He can 
                        also be a woman. He can change. 
                        However he wants. Whenever he 
                        wants. He can change.

           We FADE OUT SOUND and show them laughing and talking and 
           bonding. 
           Just a boy and a man playing catch. 

           END FLASHBACK

           EXT. NYC STREET - PRESENT TIME

           Gary stops. Shocked.

                                 GARY
                        Wait wait wait wait wait.

                                 SHEILA
                        What?

                                 GARY
                        YOU were Uncle Charlie?

           Sheila bows, like an actor at the end of a Shakespeare play. 

                                 SHEILA
                        It was I.

                                 GARY
                        You’re fucking crazy. That’s 
                        fucking crazy.

                                 SHEILA
                        What? We just played a little catch 
                        one time. So what? 

                                 GARY
                        Sheila, I played catch with Uncle 
                        Charlie every Sunday afternoon for 
                        THREE YEARS. 
                             (thinking)
                        Until he died in a boating 
                        accident. Which to be honest, I 
                        always thought was strange 
                        considering his son died in a 
                        boating accident three years 
                        earlier. Would figure the man would 
                        stay away from boats. 
                             (pauses to reflect)
                        BUT THAT’S NOT THE POINT. The point 
                        is I fucking played catch with that 
                        man for three fucking years. 

                                 SHEILA
                        What can I say, Gary? I’m 
                        methodical. OK? I’m thorough. I 
                        went back a bunch to really make a 
                        difference in your life. SUE ME. 
                                 GARY
                             (reeling)
                        That’s fucking crazy. You don’t 
                        even get it.

                                 SHEILA
                        What?

                                 GARY
                        I LOVED Uncle Charlie. I fucking 
                        loved that man. He was like a 
                        father to me. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I know. That’s the point.

                                 GARY
                        No that’s not the point. The point 
                        is it’s not your choice. It wasn’t 
                        your choice to make. To cram a 
                        positive influence into my life 
                        like that. 
                             (digesting)
                        Oh god. Oh god. What else? Tell me. 
                        What else did you change?

                                 SHEILA
                             (sheepishly)
                        Oh... Not a whole lot. Just... 
                        little things.

           MONTAGE OF MOMENTS FROM GARY’S LIFE

           INT. GARY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Gary, 17, a nerd in the height of puberty and boy it ain’t 
           pretty, sits on his bed, in a PROM TUX, on the phone.

                                 GARY
                        Oh. You can’t make it? Oh man. Flu 
                        huh? That’s OK. I didn’t wanna go 
                        anyways. Yeah, well OK, so feel goo-
                        - Hello? Kelly? Hello? 

           He hangs up the phone. Sniffs. Wipes something from his eyes. 

           THE DOORBELL RINGS. 

           INT./EXT. GARY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Gary opens the door, eyes still red. But not from crying, 
           crying’s for pussies. 
           Standing there is Sheila in a blonde wig, puffy turquoise 
           prom dress, light blue colored contact lenses and a metric 
           shit ton of make-up. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Hi there. I’m a Canadian exchange 
                        student from Canada. Will you go to 
                        prom with me? 

           Gary looks her up and down. 

                                 GARY
                        You look old.

                                 SHEILA
                        It’s the dry air. You know, up in 
                        Quebec. Also, I was held back a 
                        year or two. Because I’m special! 

           Gary considers this. 

                                 GARY
                        Well my date did just bail...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - PROM - NIGHT

           In a sea of hormonal teenagers, Pubescent Gary and Sheila the 
           Canadian exchange student from Canada slow dance. 

           “TIME AFTER TIME” by Cyndi Lauper or a less expensive 
           copyrighted song about time loops plays in the background. 

           Sheila leans in close, gently lays her head on pubescent 
           Gary’s shoulder. TWO OTHER NERDS a few feet away give Gary 
           the thumbs up. He smiles. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FANCY NYC CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Skyscraper. Top floor. Conference room. Floor to ceiling 
           windows. Killer view. These people have money. A shit ton of 
           it. 

           SIX MEN in expensive suits, ages 30-50 sit around a 
           conference table looking through a series of FILES spread out 
           on the table. Each file has a MAN’S NAME at the top.

           The leader of the pack, boss man HENRY, 50’s, turns to a 
           chair faced away from us.
                                 HENRY
                        Now, Gloria, you’ve only been at 
                        the company for a week now. But 
                        your reputation on candidate 
                        selection precedes you. Which of 
                        these, in your estimation, is 
                        worthy of our substantial financial 
                        investment? 

           The chair slowly swivels, revealing - Sheila, in a killer 
           POWER SUIT, padded shoulders, short black wig, sitting there, 
           looking like a billion dollars. She dramatically removes a 
           pair of fake glasses.

                                 SHEILA
                        Appreciate the confidence, Henry. 
                        Well gentlemen, I’ve combed every 
                        one of these files. As you know, 
                        I’m a stickler for details. 

           Everybody nods, full of respect.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        And after weighing all the micro 
                        pro’s and con’s of each prospect, 
                        I’ve come to the conclusion that 
                        this man--
                             (pushing one file forward)
                        Is your winning candidate.

           Henry grabs the file and takes a look. The name “GARY” on 
           top. The other men gather around Henry, looking over the 
           file. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Allow me to explain my choice. Is 
                        this man the smartest of the bunch? 
                        Hardly. The most well adjusted? 
                        Unlikely. But he’s got that... that 
                        extra something Henry, that you 
                        learn to spot, having done what I 
                        do all these years. That X-factor 
                        that you can’t put into words. He’s 
                        a wild card, Henry. An outside the 
                        box thinker. A savant. You know who 
                        else was? Every great inventor in 
                        the history of mankind. Think about 
                        it. 

           With that Sheila stands dramatically.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                             (nods)
                        Gentlemen.
           She power stomps out of the room. The men stare at her. At 
           the file. Shrug. 

                                 HENRY
                        OK. You heard the woman. Gary it 
                        is.

           END MONTAGE OF GARY’S LIFE

           EXT. NYC STREET - PRESENT TIME

           And we’re back with Sheila and Gary arguing in the middle of 
           the street. 

                                 GARY
                             (realizing)
                        Oh my god. You’re the reason I got 
                        the green light. Oh my god. No. No. 
                        No.

                                 SHEILA
                        So I changed your life a little. 
                        Gary. OK? And in turn, that changed 
                        you. So what? Who hasn't changed 
                        you? Your parents changed you. Your 
                        teachers changed you. Friends. Past 
                        girlfriends changed you. Maybe 
                        freakin’ Amber, even, if you still 
                        dated that lifeless sack of passive 
                        aggressive excuse for a woman in 
                        your current version. What's the 
                        difference between that and what I 
                        did? It’s all just a bunch of shit 
                        that shaped you! 

                                 GARY
                        The difference is those people were 
                        organic. They were an organic part 
                        of my life.

                                 SHEILA
                        Organic is overrated, Gary. Have 
                        you ever tried organic bananas? 
                        Tastes exactly the same as regular 
                        bananas! 

                                 GARY
                        Well, I don’t know what to say, 
                        Sheila, I’m not a banana! 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well that’s debatable.
                                 GARY
                             (what?! anyways-)
                        You invaded my past. You violated 
                        me. You violated my childhood. My 
                        memories.

                                 SHEILA
                        To make you better! To make your 
                        happier!

           Two old ladies walking by, ETHEL and GERTRUDE, 70’s, stop to 
           see what all the fuss is about. They’re snacking on popcorn - 
           probably just came back from one of those four-quadrant old 
           people movies, like “Something’s Gotta Give” or “Just Go With 
           It” or “It’s Complicated” or “The Bucket List.” 

           They slowly eat while watching the fight unfold, their heads 
           going back and forth like watching a tennis match. 

                                 GARY
                        It's not up to you. You can't 
                        change people. And if, according to 
                        your batshit story, you love me as 
                        much as you say you do, which 
                        again, feels psychotic considering 
                        I just freakin met you and 
                        honestly, I’m not even feeling the 
                        so-called great chemistry we 
                        allegedly have - but if you really 
                        love me so deeply in your insane 
                        messed up brain - you should accept 
                        me the way I am.

           Ethel and Gertrude slowly take a seat on a bench a few feet 
           away and continue to watch, snacking on popcorn. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well to be honest with you, “Gary”, 
                        I feel like you’re overreacting a 
                        little, paradoxically, on account 
                        of you being a wholesome 
                        emotionally healthy man now, and 
                        having a stronger radar for red 
                        flags, an emotionally stable man 
                        that I’VE SINGLE-HANDEDLY CREATED, 
                        mind you, ironically, and to be 
                        totally honest, I don’t feel such a 
                        great connection between you and me 
                        here either. I mean, would I travel 
                        back in time to spend another night 
                        with THIS Gary? Un-fucking-likely. 
                             (thinks)
                        OK. Maybe. 
                             (looks him over)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEILA (CONT'D)
                        OK probably. Like 7 times. 
                             (thinks)
                        23 tops. But not 374 times like I 
                        did for Old Gary. Nope. He was my 
                        man. He was my everything. And I 
                        ruined it. And that’s on me. But 
                        that’s not the point. The point is 
                        you’re overreacting, and old broken 
                        insecure weird OCD Gary, MY GARY, 
                        he would understand where I’m 
                        coming from.

                                 GARY
                        Um. OK. Sure. Cool. Cool story. 
                        Maybe in some other bonkers 
                        universe there’s another bonkers 
                        Gary who buys your bonkers story 
                        and loves you for it. But over here 
                        on planet earth there’s only one 
                        Gary, me, and I, for one, think 
                        you’re certifiable. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Fine. Cool. 

                                 GARY
                        Cool. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Cool story.

                                 GARY
                        Really cool story. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Cool. 

           They stare at each other, full of anger and fire. 

           They could walk away from each other right now. But for some 
           reason they don’t. 

           Damnit, there’s just something between these two that 
           apparently nothing, not even the most profound violation of 
           trust, can destroy. 

           LOVE AM I RIGHT?

           Ethel leans in towards Gertrude.

                                 ETHEL
                             (hushed)
                        What’s with all the shouting?
                                 GERTRUDE
                             (hushed)
                        I think she violated his uncle when 
                        he was a child.

                                 ETHEL
                        Oh no, that’s terrible. 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I know.

                                 ETHEL
                        Then why doesn’t he just walk away? 
                        Or call the police? 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I think he’s pretending to be angry 
                        and violated but secretly he’s 
                        touched that someone would care 
                        about him so deeply to go back in 
                        time and try to take all the pain 
                        from his life away. 

                                 ETHEL
                             (nods, understanding)
                        That is a pretty grand romantic 
                        gesture.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It is a pretty grand romantic 
                        gesture. 

                                 ETHEL
                        Doesn’t get much more grand than 
                        that. 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Sure doesn’t, Ethel--

           Suddenly Sheila turns to face the old ladies.
                                 SHEILA
                        HEY. Ethel, Gertrude. I’ve been 
                        trying to have this fight properly 
                        with New Gary for 5 days straight 
                        now, and you ladies are always 
                        here, and all up in my shit, pardon 
                        my French, and while your side 
                        commentary is oddly spot-on, and in 
                        general I am very pro old ladies, 
                        and that’s important for me to 
                        state, you’re still really killing 
                        the dramatic tension of what I’m 
                        trying to do here, and I would 
                        really appreciate if you stopped.

                                 ETHEL
                        Sorry! 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Sorry, we’ll be quiet.

           Ethel and Gertrude mime locking their mouths and throwing 
           away the key. 

                                 ETHEL
                        Not another peep from us.

                                 SHEILA
                        Thank you. Much appreciated.

           Sheila turns back to face Gary, who is still reeling with 
           anger and disbelief, pacing back and forth. 

                                 GARY
                        My prom date!! Canadian foreign 
                        exchange student from Canada my 
                        ass... I knew you looked familiar. 
                        I KNEW it. Fuck. 

           Gary kicks a pole. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Relax, Gary. Geez. This whole alpha 
                        male thing, I’m not sure it suits 
                        you. 
                             (winks)
                        Might have to go back to the ol’ 
                        time machine, do a few more tweaks 
                        to Gary’s olll’ emotional history.

                                 GARY
                        Unbelievable. Un-fucking-
                        believable! You’re a straight up 
                        selfish psychopath.
                                 SHEILA
                        Hey, no. Wait. That’s not fair. Did 
                        I change you to make us work 
                        better? Selfishly? Maybe. But I 
                        also did it because I’ve heard you 
                        talk about your pain and the pain 
                        in your past so many times, Gary. 
                        Night after night after night. And 
                        I care so much about you... it 
                        broke my heart. I have... The rare 
                        gift... The rare chance... To take 
                        that pain away from you. It was an 
                        act of kindness. It was an act of 
                        love. Ethel and Gertrude get it. 

                                 GARY
                        IT’S NOT YOUR PAIN TO TAKE AWAY! 
                        How would you feel if I went back 
                        in time, messed with your 
                        childhood? With your memories?

                                 SHEILA
                        If you did it for the sake of us - 
                        I’d let you! I would trust you to 
                        be responsible. And I would 
                        cooperate. Willingly. 

                                 GARY
                        Bull-SHIT. 

           Suddenly, he smiles a wicked smile.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        How would you feel if I went back 
                        in time and erased your obsession 
                        with this night? Made sure you 
                        didn’t meet me? So you’d never 
                        enter this insane psycho time 
                        loop??

           Her face falls. She shakes her head violently.

                                 SHEILA
                        No. You wouldn’t do that. 

                                 GARY
                        Maybe I will. Hey, you told me 
                        where this magical nail salon is. I 
                        could go right now. Pay a little 
                        visit to our old pal Chul-Soon.

                                 SHEILA
                        No. NO. You wouldn’t. YOU WOULDN’T. 
           Sheila is on the verge of tears. He just smiles. A beat.

                                 GARY
                        Relax. I would never. That would be 
                        stooping to your despicable low. So 
                        I’m just gonna walk away now, and 
                        try to deal with the lie that is my 
                        life, and hopefully, in time, and 
                        with a lot of alcohol, I will 
                        convince myself that this was all 
                        just a bad dream. OK? 

           Sheila breathes a huge sigh of relief. He’s not gonna erase 
           himself  from her memory. Their sacred night is safe. Their 
           sacred night is safe. 

           Then, with her relief and gratitude, comes a wave of guilt. 
           Of recognition of what she’s done. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (softly)
                        Look. I’m sorry, Gary. I’m sorry. 
                        I.. I know it was wrong now. I get 
                        it. But it came from a good place. 
                        It did. 

                                 GARY
                        Yeah well. So did the Holocaust.

                                 SHEILA
                        No actually I’m pretty sure the 
                        Holocaust came from a bad place.

                                 GARY
                        In any case, I will now bid you 
                        goodnight. 

           Gary walks away. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh you’re just gonna leave?! 
                             (a beat)
                        Yeah well, screw you, New Gary! You 
                        suck! Old Gary rules! 

           Sheila watches him till he disappears around the corner, a 
           desperate look in her eyes. 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Forget him. 

                                 ETHEL
                        You deserve a man who would fight 
                        for you. 
                                 GERTRUDE
                        That’s right. A man who would go 
                        back in time and violate your uncle 
                        just the way you did his. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Thanks ladies. That means a lot. 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What are you gonna do now?

                                 SHEILA
                        I’m gonna go back in time, undo all 
                        the shit I did, get my Old Gary 
                        back and we’ll work it out from 
                        there.

                                 ETHEL
                        Sounds like a solid plan. Good 
                        luck! 

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Invite us to the wedding!

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK MONTAGE - OF SHEILA ELIMINATING ALL HER PAST SELVES 
           BEFORE THEY CAN CHANGE GARY --

           EXT. GARY’S CHILDHOOD HOME - PORCH - DAY

           Sheila dressed like Uncle Charlie climbs the porch steps, 
           smooths down her fake moustache and prepares to knock on the 
           front door for the first time. 

                                 SHEILA
                             (old man voice)
                        Testing testing. Old man voice. Old 
                        man voice. I am an old man. I eat 
                        oatmeal. Testing. Arthritis. 
                        Oatmeal. Testing. 

           Meanwhile, Sheila, in her current modern day clothes, sneaks 
           up behind Uncle Charlie Sheila, and STABS HER before she can 
           start the door knock.

           EXT. DARK ALLEY - LATER

           Modern-day clothes Sheila drags stabbed Uncle Charlie Sheila 
           to an alley behind a shut down WOOLWORTH STORE. 
           EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

           In a fitting room, Canadian Exchange Student from Canada 
           Sheila adjusts her turquoise prom dress and applies heavy 
           make-up.   

                                 SHEILA
                        Aboot. Aboot. Soory. Aboot. 

           SWOOSH! The curtain opens. Modern day Sheila walks in. STAB!

           EXT. ANOTHER DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Modern-day clothes Sheila drags stabbed Canadian Exchange 
           student from Canada Sheila to an alley behind a shut down 
           SBARRO’S. 

           INT. NYC OFFICE BUILDING - BATHROOMS - MORNING

           Power suit wearing investment analyst Sheila adjusts her wig 
           in a bathroom stall.  

           A HAND REACHES IN FROM ANOTHER STALL - STABS HER IN THE LEG. 
           (Spoiler alert - It’s modern-day Sheila.)

           EXT. ANOTHER DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

           We now see SUPER QUICK CUTS of Sheila dragging MULTIPLE 
           SHEILAS IN MULTIPLE CLOTHES IN MULTIPLE TIME PERIODS TO 
           ALLEYS BEHIND MULTIPLE STORES. (3rd grade teacher Sheila who 
           always believed in Gary when no other teacher did, fake 
           Chinese pen pal Sheila who Gary would confide in when he had 
           no friends, etc. etc.) 

           Bottom line - BITCH PUT IN SOME SERIOUS WORK.

           And with that - Sheila has fully erased all her meddling from 
           Gary’s life. At least, theoretically. 

           END MONTAGE

           INT. NAIL SALON - NIGHT

           Sheila emerges from the time machine, exhausted, panting. A 
           particularly disheveled mess. 

           Chul-Soon is there, reading a magazine. 
                                 SHEILA
                        I did it, Chul-Soon. Or rather, I 
                        undid it. And now I have my Old 
                        Gary back. Hopefully. And we can go 
                        back to our good old routine! 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        You mean your good old one-night 
                        loop that you’ve grown completely 
                        frustrated with and no longer 
                        enjoy? 

                                 SHEILA
                        Nonsense! I just needed a wake-up 
                        call. To realize the treasure I 
                        had. And I got it. Now I’ll be 
                        happy forever.

           Chul-Soon sighs, massaging her temples.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Sheila, in your 391 days at this 
                        shop, did you ever stop to ask 
                        about me? About what my life might 
                        be like?

                                 SHEILA
                        No. To be honest, Chul-Soon, I’ve 
                        been pretty self-obsessed. And I’m 
                        not proud of it. I’m really not. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Alright. Well. Did you know Chul-
                        Soon was a man’s name?

                                 SHEILA
                        Boy, I sure did not. Strike two. 
                        Guess I’m self-obsessed AND 
                        ignorant. Thanks, Chul-Soon, so far 
                        this is a great pep-talk.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                             (ignoring her)
                        Well, Chul-Soon IS a man’s name. My 
                        parents... they always wanted a 
                        boy. They really really really 
                        wanted a boy. They wanted a boy so 
                        much, that when I came out, they 
                        still gave me a boy's name. Tried 
                        to raise me like a boy. Like a man.  

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh, Chul-Soon. Those bastards! 
                                 CHUL-SOON
                        So when I got old enough to be my 
                        own person - I murdered both of 
                        them.

                                 SHEILA
                        Wow. OK. Cool. Wait, really?

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        No, not really, Sheila. But I did 
                        move to Bed Stuy with a woman who 
                        is now my wife, so in many ways, I 
                        did murder them. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Good for you, Chul-Soon. Thanks for 
                        sharing.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Do you get what I’m trying to say 
                        with this story? 

                                 SHEILA
                        I sure don’t.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        I'm trying to show you that you 
                        can't control people anymore than 
                        you can force a situation. It’s 
                        like trying to fit a square peg 
                        into a round hole. It won’t fit. Do 
                        you understand?

                                 SHEILA
                        No. I mean yes, but I refuse to 
                        apply it to my situation. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Why?

                                 SHEILA
                        I dunno, Chul-Soon. I just feel 
                        like too often people apply other 
                        people’s lesson to their lives 
                        willy-nilly. You know? We keep 
                        doing that, and before you know it, 
                        BOOM!

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Boom?

                                 SHEILA
                        Trump is president. You know?
                                 CHUL-SOON
                        I don’t think that’s an accurate 
                        cause-and-effect statement to make. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Tomato-tomato. Anyways. I got a 
                        date with my favorite man in the 
                        world - Old Gary. RIP New Gary - 
                        Deuces! Not gonna miss ya, Buddy. 
                        Chul-Soon - a pleasure as always. 

           She slowly enters the time machine.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        See you tomorrow. Love you!

           She hits some keys.

           INT. BAR - EVENING

           East Village dive bar. Winter. 6PM.

           Two strangers - a man and a woman - sit at opposite ends of a 
           bar. 

           Other people sit at the bar too, but they’re not important. 
           They watch sports on TV. 

           Gary is arranging a set of coasters in an impressively 
           symmetrical shape. Sheila sees this and her face lights up.

           Bartender Phil stares at her with amusement. Before he can 
           open his mouth--

                                 SHEILA
                        He’s back, Phil! Old Gary is back! 
                        And he’s all mine! And everything 
                        is good now!

           Phil, who never met this woman in his life, stare at her, 
           confused. 
                                 BARTENDER
                        Cool...

           But Sheila is already halfway over to Gary’s. She takes a 
           seat by his side.

                                 SHEILA
                        Hi, I’m Sheila. That’s an 
                        impressive coaster set-up!

           Gary looks up at the strange woman. Smiles.

                                 GARY
                        Why thank you.

           MONTAGE OF THEIR NIGHT TOGETHER - OLD GARY IS BACK AND THIS 
           IS THE MOST MAGICAL NIGHT OF ALL 402 MAGICAL NIGHTS THEY’VE 
           HAD TOGETHER

           STILL AT THE BAR

           Bartender places the drinks down in front of them. They both 
           turn to face him.

                      SHEILA (CONT’D)
                                                          GARY 
                 (awful Australian 
                 accent)
           Cheers, mate!
                                                (awful Australian 
                                                accent)
                                              Cheers, mate!

           The three of them exchange glances, freaked out by this. 
           Bartender laughs, mouths “meet cute.” Leaves. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Heh. Pretty crazy.

                                 SHEILA
                             (laughs, a little too 
                              much)
                        Yeah, what are the odds! Ha ha ha.

           A beat.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        Actually the odds are pretty good. 
                        I need to come clean with you, 
                        Gary. I’m a time traveler. From the 
                        future. So I knew everything you 
                        were going to say. 

           Gary raises an eyebrow. More amused than weirded out. She’s 
           fun, and he’s in a playful mood. 
                                 GARY
                        Dinner?

                                 SHEILA
                        Yes please!

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary and Sheila walk down 2nd avenue. 

                                 GARY AND SHEILA
                             (dramatically)
                        “God, grant me the serenity to 
                        accept the things I cannot 
                        change... Courage to change the 
                        things I can... and the wisdom to 
                        distinguish the one from the 
                        other." 

           They laugh together, a real bond forming. 

           EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

                                 AMIT
                             (yells)
                        CHAD F. ON TRIPADVISOR.COM WRITES - 
                        FIVE STARS - “If you have not eaten 
                        here - your life is garbage.” 

           Sheila and Gary grab menus and enter.

           INT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           We don’t even need to hear their conversation anymore. They 
           laugh and joke and surprise and challenge each other, and it 
           just fucking looks like love, OK?

           Even goddamn Susan at the other table can see it, and she 
           knows deep in her heart that no amount of stolen Prada bags 
           from Bergdorf Goodman will ever fill that deep dark hole.

           EXT. ST. MARKS - VINTAGE STORE - LATER

           Sheila picks out the mechanic “Gary” shirt. He laughs and 
           puts it on, models it for her. She claps, loving it. 
           INT. HIPSTER ICE CREAM SHOP - LATER

                                 CHAI
                             (deadpan)
                        We got a new dessert special. It’s 
                        called “College.” Basically it’s 
                        ramen noodles twice cooked in 
                        lukewarm Coors Light, with a dollop 
                        of emulsified Nyquil-flavored 
                        Nachos.

                                 GARY
                        Wow. That sounds disgusting. We’ll 
                        take two. 

           EXT. NYC STREET - LATER

           Gary bumps into an OLD LADY, causing her to drop a bag of 
           groceries, items flying everywhere. He helps her salvage what 
           can be salvaged. Apologizes profusely. 

           Then he enters one of his rage episodes. 

                                 GARY
                        Fuck. Shit. FUCK. FUCKING DOGSHIT.

           Sheila holds him close. Whispers that magical sentence in his 
           ear. 

           He relaxes. Exhales. 

           Then he kisses her deeply. 

           They sit down on a bench, just holding each other. He 
           caresses her face.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I really like you, Sheila. I know 
                        its crazy to say after one night, 
                        but it’s how I feel. So... Let’s be 
                        real. You can drop the whole time 
                        travel shtick now. It’s funny, 
                        but... that’s enough. 

                                 SHEILA
                        But Gary... everything I told you 
                        is real. 

                                 GARY
                        Right.
                                 SHEILA
                        Look, it doesn’t matter. I’ll just 
                        see you here tomorrow and we can do 
                        this all over again. 

                                 GARY
                        How many times has it been now?

                                 SHEILA

           Gary shakes his head. 

                                 GARY
                        You know, I keep thinking you’re 
                        making this whole thing up. But 
                        I’ve been feeling a weird feeling 
                        in my stomach all night.

                                 SHEILA
                        Yeah, cuz of the magic between us.

                                 GARY
                        No. Like I’m stuck. Like I’m in 
                        purgatory. I know I can’t possibly 
                        know it for sure, but I feel.. 
                        Something... Off. Like... Like a 
                        ghost in the machine type thing. I 
                        feel like a prisoner. I feel stuck.

                                 SHEILA
                             (shrinks)
                        I’m sorry. Fuck. I’m sorry.

           Gary stands, needing clarity. Distance. 

                                 GARY
                        Why can’t you just... see what 
                        tomorrow brings? Why can’t we 
                        just... see where this goes? Like 
                        normal people?

           Sheila stands too, frustrated. 

                                 SHEILA
                        I told you like a billion times, 
                        Gary! Tomorrow you get back 
                        together with Amber. Or you get 
                        decapitated by an Uber. Or a pack 
                        of mangy polar bears attacks New 
                        York City ripping everybody to 
                        shreds in a global warming twist no 
                        one saw coming. Tomorrow just 
                        doesn’t work out for us, Gary!!
                                 GARY
                        Really?? Sheila? Really though?? Or 
                        is this just one of the billion 
                        things you need to come clean to me 
                        about every five minutes?

           Sheila’s eyes fill with tears. She’s speechless for the first 
           time since she met him. She stomps the ground, angrily.

                                 SHEILA
                        You don’t understand, Gary. I’ve 
                        been so... so very sad. For so 
                        long. Since I was a child... 
                        Since.. Maybe since forever. And 
                        you... You saved me. In one night. 
                        Just by existing. This night saved 
                        me. And... I’m so afraid... What if 
                        this is a one time thing? What if I 
                        never feel this way again? What if 
                        it’s back to sadness from here on 
                        out? 

                                 GARY
                        So... Wait. You’ve never actually 
                        tried to see what happens 
                        tomorrow?!

                                 SHEILA
                        Well. No! I mean! Gary! What if the 
                        time machine fails tomorrow? Or 
                        disappears? What if you change your 
                        mind? About me? And I never see you 
                        again? I can control things now. 
                        And I can control things yesterday. 
                        And five years ago. But I can’t 
                        control tomorrow. And I don’t want 
                        to risk it. 

                                 GARY
                        But... Sheila... That’s just a 
                        chance you have to take! It’s part 
                        of the human experience!

                                 SHEILA
                        Fuck the human experience! 

                                 GARY
                        You can’t freeze time. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Well, clearly I can. And I have. 
                        And I will. It makes me happy, 
                        Gary. It’s the only thing that 
                        makes me happy. 
                                 GARY
                        But it’s selfish. And it doesn’t 
                        even make you happy anymore. You 
                        have to stop.

                                 SHEILA
                        No. 

                                 GARY
                        You have to. 

                                 SHEILA
                        NO. 

           Gary shakes his head.

                                 GARY
                        Then I don’t... I don’t know what 
                        to say. 

           Silence.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Look, this whole night has made my 
                        brain explode. I can barely even 
                        wrap my head around the logic of it 
                        all, much less the emotional 
                        insanity you’ve caused us both. I 
                        gotta go. I gotta go.

                                 SHEILA
                        OK. Well. I’ll see you tomorrow I 
                        guess!

           Gary shakes his head, in disbelief. And walks away. 

           She watches him go. But unlike always, we stay with Gary. 

           OH MAN. I mean, the script is almost over, BUT WE’VE NEVER 
           BEEN WITH GARY ALONE BEFORE! HOW EXCITING! A WHOLE NEW WORLD! 
           WHAT’S HE GONNA DO? WHERE’S HE GONNA GO?

           Oh. Home apparently. 

           Typical sad sack Old Gary. So timid and afraid. Grow a pair, 
           Gary! Slouched, head to the floor, he just walks the NYC 
           streets, feeling demoralized. 

           He stops by an intersection, waiting for the light to turn 
           green. 

           A few feet away sits a STREET PERFORMER, manipulating a 
           beautifully crafted WOODEN PUPPET, pulling on its strings and 
           making it dance.
           Gary watches the cheery performance. And gets TRIGGERED. And 
           ANGRY AF. 

           (Get it?... cuz he feels like a puppet. With Sheila pulling 
           all the strings. METAPHORS! You get it.)

                                 GARY
                        You know what? FUCK THAT!

           He turns around and walks the other way - WITH A PURPOSE.

           The Puppet’s wooden “jaw” drops, he turns to look at the 
           Puppet Master.

                                 PUPPET
                        Well that was uncalled for!

           The Puppet Master nods in agreement.

           BUT BACK TO GARY.

           Angry, determined - he’s walking with purpose. But where?

           He reaches his destination.

           EXT. “NAIL ME GOOD” NAIL SALON - CONTINUOUS

           The nail salon is closed. OF COURSE IT IS, GARY, ITS FREAKIN’ 
           MIDNIGHT. 

           Doors are locked, lights are off. 

           Gary stares at the front door, mumbling angrily to himself.

                                 GARY
                        FUCK. HORSE NUTS. Of course the 
                        store is closed. IT’S FREAKIN 
                        MIDNIGHT, GARY.

           A WOMAN, 40’s, and her DAUGHTER, 12, walk down the street. 
           When they hear Gary yell at himself, the Woman puts a 
           protective arm around her Daughter.

                                 DAUGHTER
                        Why is that man talking to himself, 
                        mama?

                                 WOMAN
                        Because he’s a schizophrenic, baby.

           BUT BACK TO GARY.
           Gary slides his hand into his shirt, prepared to punch the 
           front door open and break in.

           Except this is New York freakin’ city and the doors are thick 
           as steel. What are you thinking, Gary?!

                                 GARY
                             (mumbles)
                        Fucking breaking and entering, 
                        Gary. You don’t do breaking and 
                        entering. What are you, some kind 
                        of riff raff? Fucking dogshit. 

           Luckily, before he gets a chance to severely injure himself, 
           THE LIGHTS GO ON. 

           Inside the store - one woman. Chul-Soon. Pencil behind her 
           ear. Notebook in her hand. Like she was just doing late night 
           accounting stuff. 

           She sees Gary, walks towards the front doors, unlocks them 
           and lets Gary --

           INSIDE

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Good evening. You must be Gary.

                                 GARY
                        Jesus Christ, does everybody know 
                        who I am?

           She points at his vintage mechanic shirt. A knitted patch 
           reads “Gary.”

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Sorry. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        What can I do for you, Gary? You 
                        here for a midnight pedicure? 

                                 GARY
                        No. I’m here because of Sheila.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                             (confused)
                        Who?

           Gary’s face turns white. 

           Was it all a lie? Did he just buy Sheila’s entire weird sci-
           fi story, hook line and sinker?
           OF COURSE ITS ALL A LIE, GARY, YOU IDIOT. A NAIL SALON TIME 
           MACHINE? ARE YOU FUCKING JOKING ME??

                                 GARY
                        I’m such an idiot. She made it all 
                        up. Christ. I bought her insane 
                        story. And I came here. To a 
                        fucking nail salon... At midnight. 
                        Oh god. I’m so stupid. I’m so 
                        stupid. She made it all up. And I 
                        bought it. I’m such an idiot. I’m 
                        such an idiot. 

           Chul-Soon watches him, amused. 

           She lets him spiral for a beat for her own entertainment. 
           Then -

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Relax, Gary. I know Sheila. You 
                        probably wanna go see the time 
                        machine.

                                 GARY
                             (exhales)
                        Oh fuck. OK. Yes. I would.

           She motions for him to follow her. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Right here behind the curtain. 
                        Let’s go meet the wizard.

                                 GARY
                        Doesn’t the wizard end up being 
                        just an old man on a bicycle?

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Are you calling me an old man on a 
                        bicycle? Also, spoiler alert.

                                 GARY
                        Oh, have you never seen the Wizard 
                        of Oz? AND it’s on your to-do list?

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Actually yes, Gary. It’s on my 
                        Netflix cue. 

                                 GARY
                        My bad.
           INT. NAIL SALON - BACK ROOM - LATER

           Gary and Chul-Soon sit by the time machine. Gary tries to 
           process all the insane time logic things happening. He’s 
           doing time math calculation stuff in his head. 

                                 GARY
                        Wait.. How do you even know Sheila? 
                        She won’t come in here till a few 
                        hours from now. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Oh. Yeah. She dropped in from the 
                        past, left this giant novel-sized 
                        chronicle of everything that’s been 
                        happening with you guys.

           Chul-Soon points at an INSANE THICK NOTEBOOK on her desk. 

                                 CHUL-SOON (CONT’D)
                        She updates it regularly so I’m up 
                        to speed. Very meticulous, that 
                        one. She’s got that OCD, but you 
                        know, like adorable OCD.

                                 GARY
                             (lights up)
                        Oh I have that too!

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        ... Cool. 

           Awkward silence. Gary turns his attention to the time 
           machine. He caresses it, admiring it.

                                 GARY
                        So this is the source of all my 
                        problems. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Problems? Sounds like you had a 
                        pretty sweet night.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah. Over and over and over again 
                        in permanent purgatory hell. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        So... Like, love. 

                                 GARY
                        No, Chul-Soon. It’s... It’s like a 
                        muddy sinking swamp shithole fire 
                        trash dumpster. 
                                 CHUL-SOON
                        So basically, love.

                                 GARY
                        No, Chul-Soon. She forces me to 
                        spend all this time with her. Night 
                        after night after night. And the 
                        sick part is - I like it. Every 
                        time. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        So, like a relationship. 

                                 GARY
                        No! And like, I get emotionally 
                        invested every single night - and 
                        then I end up getting hurt. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        So, like love. 

                                 GARY
                        Christ, Chul-Soon. It’s not like 
                        love. It’s fake. It’s orchestrated. 
                        It’s a puppet show. It’s... It’s 
                        INORGANIC.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Organic is overrated. Ever had an 
                        organic banana?

                                 GARY
                        I’M NOT A BANANA, CHUL-SOON.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        You’re sweet though.

                                 GARY
                        Aw, thanks.

           A beat.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Look, what's organic? Life is a 
                        series of shitty mess piles. We all 
                        fall into messes. And make bigger 
                        messes. And try to find happiness 
                        in the messes. You know? You can't 
                        blame Sheila for chasing happiness.

                                 GARY
                        I can if she’s holding me hostage. 
                                 CHUL-SOON
                        So what do you want to do, Gary? 
                        Huh? Why are you here?

                                 GARY
                        I want to travel back in time and 
                        prevent this night from ever 
                        happening.

           Chul-Soon points at the time machine. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Go ahead.

           Gary doesn’t move. 

                                 GARY
                        But...

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        But?

                                 GARY
                        Does that make me as bad as her? 
                        Morally speaking?

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        I don’t know, Gary. I paint nails 
                        for a living. 

                                 GARY
                        But I gotta end this. I gotta set 
                        us both free. She won’t do it. So I 
                        have to. It’s the humane thing to 
                        do. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Then go ahead!

                                 GARY
                        But... it would turn me into a 
                        monster like her. 

           Chul-Soon massages her temples. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Look, Gary, I feel like you want me 
                        to be your moral thermometer here. 
                        And I cannot provide that service. 
                        The only service I can provide is 
                        French manicure. Barring that, do 
                        what you will. You want to go into 
                        the past? Go. You want to maintain 
                        moral superiority? Don't go. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHUL-SOON (CONT'D)
                        It makes no difference to me. Or 
                        the universe. Unless, you know, you 
                        kill Hitler. And even then. Who 
                        knows. OK? Have a good night.

           She starts to leave. 

           Gary - timid flip flopping scared Gary who always needs to 
           have everything in order - reaches a decision. THIS HAS TO BE 
           DONE.

                                 GARY
                        Wait. I wanna do it. I have to end 
                        this. I gotta meet a younger her, 
                        talk some sense into her. I gotta 
                        do... I don’t know. Something.

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        OK. Lie down.

           Gary enters the time machine.

           But then he gets last minute jitters. 

                                 GARY
                        Wait. Wait. When... How early 
                        should I even go? 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                             (shrugs)
                        1992? That seems like a good year. 

           She punches some buttons. 

                                 GARY
                        Wait!

           A WHITE FLASH.

           And Gary wakes up on the floor of a POLISH RESTAURANT.

           EXT. NYC STREET - DAY

           Gary stumbles outside. He is on the same New York City street 
           as before. Except, very clearly, it is now 1992. 

           New York is grimier, edgier, weirder. No sign of a Starbucks 
           or Chase Bank.

           He walks around in awe, dazed, looking at the people and the 
           sights. Everything is different. 

           Sheila’s voice echoes in his mind.
                                 SHEILA (V.O.)
                        Wanna hear something crazy? I used 
                        to live in that house right up 
                        there. 114 1st Ave, apartment 3B. 

           Gary makes his way to that address, enters the building. 

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT’D

           Gary climbs up the stairs.

           HALLWAY

           He stops outside Apartment 3B. 

           Takes a big breath. Shaking. He knocks on the door. 

           SANDRA, 40’s, a DEADBEAT looking woman, trashy, big hair, too 
           much makeup, cigarette in her hand, opens the door. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Yes?

           Gary doesn’t know what to say.

           She squints at his vintage mechanic shirt.

                                 SANDRA (CONT’D)
                        Gary is it? You’re late. 

                                 GARY
                        Wait. What? 

                                 SANDRA
                        Come in.

           She ushers him into -

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONT’D

           Inside he sees a very 80’s living room. Shades of brown 
           everything. Neglected. Sad. But not horribly sad. Not social 
           services sad. Just... normal sad. 

           On the carpet in the corner, sits an adorable young girl 
           playing with toys.

           This is SHEILA, 8. 

           Against the wall - an old school TV. Bunny ears. WHITE SNOW. 
           But Gary doesn’t even spot the TV - his eyes locked in on the 
           adorable Sheila.

                                 GARY
                        Fuck. I went too far back. She’s 
                        too young. 

                                 SANDRA
                        Um, OK, Weirdo. TV’s right there. 

                                 GARY
                             (still in a daze)
                        I was hoping to catch her at 16. 
                        17. You know, when her crazy is 
                        probably fully taking form. Then I 
                        could nip it in the bud. Talk some 
                        sense into her. But this early?! I 
                        can’t yell at such a young child. 
                        I’ll traumatize her. You know?

           Sandra snaps her fingers in front of his face.

                                 SANDRA
                        HEY GARY. You talk a lot for a 
                        cable guy. Why don’t you just go 
                        back there and fix the goddamn TV, 
                        huh?

                                 GARY
                        Oh. The.. The TV. OK.

                                 SANDRA
                        Fantastic.
                             (at Sheila)
                        Sheila, don’t bother the man while 
                        he works, OK? 
                             (back a Gary)
                        Careful, she’s got a mouth on her, 
                        that one. 

           With that, Sandra walks away into a bedroom, SLAMS THE DOOR 
           SHUT. 

           Gary stands there, frozen, staring at Little Sheila, 
           oblivious to him, playing with her toys. 

           He sits down by her side, to see what she’s doing. 
           Fascinated, despite himself. 

           She’s trying to force a square wooden peg into a round hole. 

           Obviously, it won’t fit. But you know Sheila - that’s never 
           stopped her before. (Or after, technically.) 
                                 GARY
                        Yeah. Um. You can’t. Um. That 
                        won’t. It won’t fit. It won’t--

           But she tries and tries and tries with all her little girl 
           might, making grunting noises, until suddenly -- 

           WHAM! The wooden piece BREAKS IN HALF, and hits her in the 
           face.

           She stares at the broken mess on the floor, the pieces, now 
           broken and worthless, and immediately... starts... to... 
           CRY... HYSTERICALLY. THE CHILD CRY TO END ALL CHILD CRIES.

           Gary panics. FUCK. HORSE SHIT. FUCK. This won’t look good for 
           him. He shoots a look at the bedroom door. 

           But it remains closed. Thank god for neglectful parenting! 

           He turns his attention back at Sheila who is crying like 
           she’s dying.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Shh. Shhhhhh. Shh. Don’t cry.

           That has less than zero effect on her. She cries even harder.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Shhh. Shhh. OK. Shhh.
                             (at himself)
                        Fuck. Dogshit. Fucking 
                        motherfucker.

           He tries to caress her hair. No effect. He rubs her back. No 
           effect. He pulls her in for a hug. No effect. 

           She cries and cries and cries. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                             (mumbles quietly)
                        Fuck. Horse nuts dogshit 
                        motherfucker.

           He takes a deep breath. FUCKING GET IT TOGETHER GARY. 

           He does. He does. For the first time, maybe ever - he gets 
           himself together.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                             (yells)
                        HEY!

           She turns to face him, startled.
           He tenderly grabs her little cheeks in his hands and turns 
           her face to his with great urgency. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK for things to be messy, OK? 

           She stops crying for a second, surprised by his bluntness.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Say it. Repeat after me. It’s OK...

                                 SHEILA
                        It’s OK...

                                 GARY
                        For things...

                                 SHEILA
                        For things...

                                 GARY
                        To be messy. Sometimes. 

                                 SHEILA
                        To be messy. Sometimes. 

           He nods at her, approving.

           And suddenly she does something weird.

           She smiles.

           Then she jumps forward and gives him a big hug. 

           With one sentence, he opened up the prison cell door. 

           Caught by surprise by all the emotion, Gary lets out a 
           strange whimper. He hugs her back. His eyes well up. Fuck. 

           He begrudgingly understands that all this is bigger than him. 

           He accepts his fate, on some level - And it frees him. 

           He hugs her tight and caresses her hair. 

                                 GARY
                        It’s OK. One day you’ll meet a nice 
                        man. And he’ll make you feel free. 
                        And you’ll make him feel free too. 
                        And everything will be alright. 

           Little Sheila looks up at him with increasing admiration and 
           gratitude. 
           She stares at him with the intensity of a thousand suns. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           CLOSE UP ON ADULT SHEILA. 

           At a bar. 6PM. Staring at Gary, with the intensity of a 
           thousand suns.

           She stares at him like she’s been waiting her whole life to 
           meet him. Since childhood. Since forever. But not in a 
           bullshit manifest destiny rom-com kind of way. In a real way. 

           Bartender Phil opens his mouth to say something sassy but she 
           cuts him off.

                                 SHEILA
                        Phil, I wanted to thank you for 
                        your dedicated service all these 
                        months. 

           Phil stares at her - he’s never seen her before in his life.

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been thinking, Phil. About 
                        letting go of control. I think I 
                        might have to. 

           Suddenly she grabs Phil’s hand tight. It’s creepy. 

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t want to. 

           She stares longingly at Gary, who, as per usual, unaware of 
           her stares, arranges coasters in a strange configuration.

                                 BARTENDER 
                        Um... So... Do you... Want a shot? 
                        Or...? 

           But she shoos his words away like a fly, and gets back to 
           staring at Gary. Getting ready to walk over. Maybe for the 
           last time. 

           But before she gets a chance - Gary stands up.

           Huh. That’s new. He gets up and walks over. To Sheila. 

           He reaches her and extends his hand.

                                 GARY
                        Hi, I’m Gary.
                                 SHEILA
                        Hi, Gary, I’m Sheila. 

                                 GARY
                        Can I buy you a drink?

                                 SHEILA
                        I would like that. 

           They turn to the Bartender. 

                           GARY
                                                         SHEILA
           Aperol Fizz.
                                              Aperol Fizz. 

           They turn to face each other - shocked.

                                 GARY
                        What are the odds?!

                                 SHEILA
                        What are the odds?! Actually the 
                        odds are pretty good, Gary, I gotta 
                        come clean with you - I’m from the 
                        future.

                                 GARY
                        Me too.

                                 SHEILA
                        No way! 

                                 GARY
                        Way.

           Sheila doesn’t know if he’s fucking around or not. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        You know, I even took a page from 
                        the Sheila time traveling notebook. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh?

                                                                CUT TO:

           QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS:

           - Gary finds OTHER GARY, STABS HIM, crying all the while.

                                 GARY
                        Oh god, why? Oh god! WHY??!
           - Gary drags OTHER GARY to an alley behind a closed down 
           CIRCUIT CITY.

           END MONTAGE

           Sheila laughs in wonder and disbelief. 

                                 SHEILA
                        You did it. You really did. You 
                        time traveled. Like me!  

                                 GARY
                        I did. Oh. But. 

                                 SHEILA
                        What?

                                 GARY
                        I gotta come clean with you, 
                        Sheila. I didn’t time travel like 
                        you do.

                                 SHEILA
                        What do you mean?

                                 GARY
                        Well. When I went to the nail 
                        salon, Chul-Soon was like --

           INT. NAIL SALON - BACK ROOM - FLASHBACK

           Gary sits on the time machine, returned from his trip to the 
           past, panting, emotional. 

           Chul-Soon sits there, legs on the table, reading US WEEKLY. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Welcome back, sport. All sorted 
                        out?

           Gary sighs, despondent.

                                 GARY
                        Not really. But in a way, yes. I’ve 
                        surrendered to my fate. I will live 
                        life in purgatory forever. 

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        Oh. Cool.

           Silence. She loudly flips a page of her magazine.

           Gary gets up to leave.
                                 CHUL-SOON (CONT’D)
                        Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you 
                        earlier. I finally read the manual 
                        for this time machine. See that 
                        purple knob there at the bottom?

           Gary looks for it. Spots it.

                                 GARY
                        Yeah?

                                 CHUL-SOON
                        If you press it real hard, you can 
                        go to the future instead of the 
                        past.

           Gary’s jaw drops. 

                                 CHUL-SOON (CONT’D)
                        I know. MANUALS! Who knew?!

           Gary’s too shocked to speak. 

           Chul-Soon flips the magazine to face Gary.

                                 CHUL-SOON (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god, did you know they broke 
                        up?!

           END MONTAGE

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god.

           Sheila’s brain is spinning. She never knew this. She never 
           knew this. Why didn’t she know this?! She never knew this!!

                                 SHEILA (CONT’D)
                        So you... You went to the future? 
                        Like the actual... future future? 
                        Like the actual future future 
                        future?

                                 GARY
                        I did.

           She swallows. She panics. She doesn’t know what to say. The 
           ground has dropped beneath her feet. She is no longer in 
           control. Nothing is known from this point on. 

                                 SHEILA
                        And?!? What was it like?
                                 GARY
                        Oh you know, it’s pretty much the 
                        same. 

           Silence.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, except Hitler’s back. 

           Sheila smiles. Tries to relax. 

                                 SHEILA
                        No.

                                 GARY
                        Yes. He’s like. 
                             (basic bitch voice)
                        “What’s up biiiiitches? Guess who’s 
                        back biiiitches? Fourth Reich 
                        biiitches. Let’s do shots, I wanna 
                        dance!”

                                 SHEILA
                             (laughs)
                        So he came back as a valley girl?

                                 GARY
                        Basically. But don’t worry. I hear 
                        there’s a civil rights robot leader 
                        getting ready to fight him full 
                        force. 

                                 SHEILA
                        Oh my god... It can’t be...

                                 GARY
                        Yep. It’s Mal-Com-Xz1049. 

                                 SHEILA
                        The hero we need.

                                 GARY
                        But not the one we deserve. 

           They laugh. Then the laughter dies. A tense silence.

           Sheila has something to ask. But she’s afraid. So afraid. She 
           shivers. Fights back the need to cry. Scream. She swallows 
           hard. 

                                 SHEILA
                        So in the future... Did you... I 
                        mean.. Did you.. Like.. See us? Or 
                        I mean - not us - not us - I mean.. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHEILA (CONT'D)
                        Me? I mean, not me. Did you like... 
                        See yourself though? Did you... I 
                        mean... what’s that like?

           He warmly puts his hand on hers to stop her from spiraling. 

                                 GARY
                        I did. I saw you. And I saw me. 

           Sheila swallows hard again, so afraid of not knowing where 
           this conversation is going. Of not knowing where any of this 
           is going. 

                                 SHEILA
                        ... And?

                                 GARY
                        And... 

           He squeezes her hand. Winks.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t wanna fuck up your 
                        timeline. 

           But the way he says it, with warm confidence, makes her know 
           that tomorrow is safe. That the future is happy. 

           She lets out a whimper. She starts to laugh. Confused and 
           overwhelmed and hopeful. A few tears roll down her cheek. He 
           wipes them away, and kisses her cheek.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Wanna go have dinner? 

           She’s too overwhelmed to speak.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I came all the way from the 
                        future, so I’m pretty hungry...

           She nods. Slowly first then violently. 

           They get up, holding hands, and walk out.

           Phil the Bartender watches them go, shaking his head, like a 
           crazy cupid who made it all happen. BUT HE’S NOT, OK? HE’S 
           JUST A GODDAMN BARTENDER. Then his smile fades.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey. You didn’t pay for those! 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
