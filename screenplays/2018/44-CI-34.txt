          In both 1964 and 1966, the F.B.I., struggling to 
          solve two heinous crimes, hired notorious Mafia 
          assassin, Greg Scarpa, to go to Mississippi and 
          kidnap and torture members of the Ku Klux Klan.

          While declassified documents, and subsequent court 
          testimony, confirm the existence of these 
          operations, little else is known about what 
          actually transpired.

          This story is based on these real events. 
           EXT. RURAL ROAD - LATE NIGHT

           We’re on a quiet rural highway.  Two lanes.

           And then we hear the SOUND OF CAR ENGINES approaching. 

           Their HEADLIGHTS illuminate A LARGE WOODEN SIGN on the 
           side of the road that reads, “Welcome to Hattiesburg.  
           Hub of the South.  Population 35,731 And Growing!”

           We STAY ON THE SIGN as the cars get closer, their engines 
           GETTING LOUDER.

           All of the sudden, a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL is thrown out of 
           the car, SMASHES AGAINST the sign and SETS IT ON FIRE. 

           We watch it burn.

           GRAPHIC: 1966.

           EXT. THE DAHMER’S HOME - LATE NIGHT

           This ample-sized ranch home is located right next to a 
           small shop with a storefront that says, “Dahmer’s 
           Grocery”.  

           There’s a banner stretched across the store’s facade that 
           reads, “Voter Registration Event This Sunday 3 PM!  If 
           You Don’t Vote, You Don’t Count!”   

           The grocery and the house are closed up for the night.  

           TWO CARS, headlights off, glide quietly down the street 
           and pull up in front of the house.

           We’re CLOSE ON THE VEHICLES’ DOORS OPENING.

           And then we see a collection of TIGHT SHOTS...

           Legs and boots exiting the vehicles.  Looks like FOUR OR 
           FIVE MEN, but we don’t see any faces.

           SHOTGUNS are distributed.

           GAS CANS are pulled out the back of a truck.

           The men start to CREEP toward the house. 
           INT. THE DAHMER’S - VERNON AND ELLIE’S ROOM - SAME

           VERNON DAHMER (fifties, African-American) and his wife, 
           ELLIE (forties, also African-American), are asleep in 
           bed.

           Quiet.  Still.

           And then Vernon’s eyes burst open just as -- KRI-KRASH! -- 
           GAS CANS with flaming rags stuffed down their throats FLY 
           THROUGH THE WINDOWS IN THE LIVING ROOM.  

           As these makeshift bombs hit the floor, they immediately 
           EXPLODE and set the room ON FIRE.  

           The gas cans are followed by SHOTGUN FIRE -- BOOM!  BOOM!  
           BOOM! -- that BLASTS APART the interior of the house. 

           IN THE BEDROOM, Vernon and Ellie are both out of bed.

           Vernon pushes his wife toward the ground, making sure she 
           stays low to avoid the gunfire.

                                 VERNON DAHMER
                        Go to Bettie!  I’ll deal with 
                        them!

           As Ellie crawls to the window, Vernon grabs the RIFLE 
           next to his bed and TEARS out of the room.

           INT. THE DAHMER’S - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The SHOTGUN BLASTS continue to savage the house, PUTTING 
           HOLES through walls, RIPPING APART the mantle.  

           Meanwhile, the FLAMES continue to consume everything in 
           their path.

           Holding the rifle, Vernon enters, coughing and gasping 
           for air.  He RETURNS FIRE, BUCKING RIFLE SHOTS out the 
           window at unseen assailants.

           INT. THE DAHMER’S - BETTIE'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Ellie has gotten their terrified daughter out of bed.

                                 BETTIE
                        Where’s Daddy?!  Where’s Daddy?!

           As if on cue, Vernon enters the room and scoops up his 
           daughter in his arms.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 VERNON DAHMER
                        I’m right here, baby.  Right here.

           He turns to Ellie.

                                 VERNON DAHMER (CONT’D)
                        The window in the bedroom.

           Ellie nods and heads down the hallway which is FILLED 
           WITH SMOKE.

           The SHOTGUN BLASTS at the front of the house continue.

           INT. THE DAHMER’S - VERNON AND ELLIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ellie goes to the big window at the rear of the bedroom 
           and tries to lift it, but it’s stuck.  It won’t budge.

           Vernon is about to put Bettie down and help his wife, 
           when Ellie picks up a CHAIR and THROWS IT THROUGH THE 
           WINDOW, ripping the entire frame apart.

                                 VERNON DAHMER
                                 (to Ellie)
                        Go out!  I’ll hand her to you!

           Ellie climbs through the window and then turns back to 
           reach for her daughter, who Vernon gives to her. 

                                 VERNON DAHMER (CONT’D)
                        Run to the Mitchells’!  Get help!

           Ellie wants her husband to come with them.

                                 ELLIE DAHMER
                        Come with us!

           No.

                                 VERNON DAHMER
                        Gonna keep them busy while you get 
                        away!  I’ll be right behind you!

           She’s terrified that it won’t play out this way.

                                 ELLIE DAHMER
                        Come now, Vernon!

           He assures her that he will.

                                 VERNON DAHMER
                        I’ll be right out.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           With Bettie in her arms, Ellie RACES for the tree line.

           INT. THE DAHMER’S - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Vernon grabs the GUNS and RIFLES that he’s placed 
           strategically around the house and FIRES out the windows.

           The men outside continue to FIRE THEIR SHOTGUNS into the 
           house, but a far more pressing problem for Vernon are the 
           FLAMES and SMOKE.

           He has burns all over his body and face, but he just 
           keeps FIRING HIS RIFLE.  

           Having emptied his last gun, and about to collapse, he 
           STUMBLES through the house and FALLS OUT the window that 
           Ellie smashed.

           EXT. THE DAHMER’S - CONTINUOUS

           With all the remaining strength he has left, Vernon pulls 
           himself off the ground and STAGGERS across his backyard 
           toward the tree line.

           He makes it about twenty yards before he falls to the 
           ground again.

           This time he doesn’t get up.

           EXT. CITYSCAPE - JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

           Mississippi’s capital has a population of roughly 150,000 
           residents. 

           Graphic: Jackson, Mississippi.

           As we FLY OVER some of the city’s most notable structures 
           - the Governor’s Mansion, the State Capitol Building, the 
           Standard Life Building and the Mississippi Coliseum - we 
           can track Jackson’s architectural evolution from the 
           antebellum South to this moment in time.        

           In 1966, Jackson is a fairly cosmopolitan city.  At least 
           for Mississippi.  It has museums, a symphony, even its 
           own small opera house.  

           This is the “New South”.
           EXT. NORTH STATE STREET - MORNING

           A CITY BUS pulls up in front of the Old Capitol Building.  

           TERENCE WAYNE (early thirties, African-American), dressed 
           in a suit that’s just slightly too small for him, RACES 
           off the bus, across the street and into...

           EXT. F.B.I. FIELD OFFICE - JACKSON DIVISION - MORNING

           In fact, only the top floor of this relatively new and 
           horrifically ugly EIGHT-STORY BUILDING houses the offices 
           of the Jackson Division of the F.B.I.  

           And it was only opened two years earlier - in 1964 - 
           after the infamous murders of civil rights workers 
           Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman.

           INT. F.B.I. FIELD OFFICE - STAIRWAY - MORNING

           Terence runs up the stairs, two at a time, until he gets 
           to the top floor and then rips open the door.  

           INT. F.B.I. FIELD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Terence is greeted by a corridor that is teeming with 
           activity.  F.B.I. AGENTS (young, white, all wearing J. 
           Edgar Hoover-mandated dark suits and black shoes polished 
           to a gloss) move quickly up and down the hallway and in 
           and out of various offices. 

           Terence, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible, walks 
           cautiously down the corridor with his head down.  He’s 
           bumped and jostled by various agents, who don’t bother to 
           say, “Excuse me”.  

           No one notices him.  Or even sees him.  He’s invisible.  

           As he walks by the office SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE ROY K. 
           MOORE (fifties), he can see Moore having an animated 
           conversation on the phone.  

           Terence can’t hear what he’s saying, but he still stands 
           here for a beat and watches.

           INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - MOORE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Moore is being berated by whomever is on the other end of 
           the line.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        I understand, sir.  

           He pauses.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                                 (into the phone)
                        I can assure you that we’ll find 
                        the parties responsible as soon as 
                        possible, Director Hoover.  

           Hoover.  As in, J. Edgar Hoover.  Director of the F.B.I.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                                 (into the phone)
                        And please assure President 
                        Johnson of that as well.

           We can hear Hoover yelling through the phone.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                                 (into the phone)
                        Of course. No stone unturned, sir.

           Moore cuts an imposing figure.  A former Marine, he 
           distinguished himself as a uniquely talented agent when, 
           in 1955, he helped solve the midair explosion of an 
           airliner over Colorado in which 44 people died. 

           Within 13 days, he discovered that Jack Gilbert Graham 
           had placed a bomb in his mother's suitcase before she 
           boarded the plane in order to collect her life insurance. 

           Moore is also credited with solving the murders of 
           Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                                 (into the phone)
                        Our agents are on the ground in 
                        Hattiesburg right now.

           INT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Terence is still standing there, watching Special Agent 
           Moore when...

                                 AGENT RHODES (O.S.)
                        You’ve been working here only 
                        three months...

           CONTINUED:

           Terence turns and finds himself face-to-face with AGENT 
           EVERETT RHODES (white guy, forties). 

                                 AGENT RHODES (CONT’D)
                        And you’ve been late twice 
                        already. 

                                 TERENCE
                        The buses were off-schedule, sir.  
                        I’m sorry.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        You keep pleading with me to put 
                        you on a case, but how can we even 
                        consider putting you out in the 
                        field when you can’t even perform 
                        properly here in the office?  

           Terence Wayne is nobody’s punk.

                                 TERENCE
                        I didn’t plead, sir.  I asked.

           Rhodes ignores this subtle barb.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        A critical piece of working for 
                        the Bureau is being where you’re 
                        supposed to be when you’re 
                        supposed to be there, Agent Wayne.

           Rhodes doesn’t like Terence.  The feeling is mutual.

                                 AGENT RHODES (CONT’D)
                        You’re work is waiting for you in 
                        the file room.

           Terence nods, but before he goes...

                                 TERENCE
                        Did you get a chance to give my 
                        memorandum to Agent Moore, sir?

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        I did.

                                 TERENCE
                        And did he say anything about it?

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        Not to me.

           Terence isn’t sure what that means exactly.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        I’m happy to report that 
                        monitoring the reading habits of 
                        Special Agent in Charge Roy K. 
                        Moore is one of the few things 
                        that doesn’t fall under my purview 
                        here at the Jackson Division of 
                        the Federal Bureau of 
                        Investigation.

           Terence grabs a last look at Moore, locks eyes with 
           Rhodes for a beat and then heads down the hallway.

           INT. F.B.I. FIELD OFFICE - FILE ROOM - A SECOND LATER

           This room could not be more appropriately named.  It is a 
           large space that has massive filing cabinets lining every 
           single one of its walls.

           In the middle of the room are rows of tables covered in 
           documents and dossiers.  A TEAM OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN 
           AGENTS are busy sorting everything here.

           In fact, there are no caucasian agents in here.

           Terence enters and he’s greeted by his friends and fellow 
           agents, ARCHIE CRAWFORD (thirties, African-American) and 
           RANDY TOLLIVER (thirties, African-American).

                                 ARCHIE
                        You and Allie okay?

                                 TERENCE
                        Allie’s scared.  But we’re okay.

                        At least Vernon’s wife and 
                        daughter got out. 

                                 TERENCE
                        The house and store are gone.

           Vernon Dahmer was a well-known figure in Mississippi.

                                 ARCHIE
                        Vernon Dahmer was good people.  
                        Trying to change things.

                        I joined the Bureau because of 
                        what they did to Emmett Till. 

           Randy quotes the famous Nina Simone track about the 
           killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers.

                        Say that again.

           Terence grabs a fistful of folders.

                        day filing 302’s and 395’s and 
                        292’s.

                        You guys ever see that episode of

                        Me neither.

           OFF TERENCE, seething.  And filing.

           EXT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Terence, Randy and Archie sit on the stairs outside the 
           building and eat their lunch.

                                 TERENCE
                        Burned over forty percent of his 
                        body, and he inhaled so much fire 
                        that he scorched his lungs.

           Randy and Archie pick at their lunches.  

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        This is what they do to blacks who 
                        try to get folks to vote.

           Terence tosses what’s left of his lunch into the garbage.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe if the Bureau would let us 
                        fight something bigger than a 
                        paper clip we could get some 
                        justice for Vernon Dahmer.

           Something that Terence just said gives Archie pause. 

                                 ARCHIE
                                 (to Terence)
                        “Blacks”.  That’s a new one.

           Randy clues him in.

                                 RANDY
                        Stokely Carmichael and all them 
                        say that we’re moving on from 
                        negro.  Calling ourselves “black” 
                        from here on out.

           Archie smiles.

                                 ARCHIE
                        Black.  I like it.  

           Terence sees Special Agent Moore walking up the block 
           with Agent Rhodes and a COUPLE OTHERS. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                 RANDY
                        They called us colored and negro, 
                        and now we’re calling each other 
                        black.  Naming ourselves.  Feels 
                        like some sort of progress, right? 

           Terence watches Moore and his entourage approach.

                                 TERENCE
                        Colored, negro, black.  Don’t 
                        matter what we’re called as long 
                        as they’re still killing us.

           Terence is gearing up, trying to muster the courage.  And 
           then he stands up and heads straight for Moore.  

                                 RANDY
                        Where you going, Terence?  

           We FOLLOW TERENCE as he walks determinedly toward Agent 
           Moore, who’s briefing the other senior agents.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        The President said that this 
                        murder is an attack on democracy.  
                        He said that the Voting Rights Act 
                        isn’t a suggestion, it’s a law.  
                        And he told Director Hoover that, 
                        if we can’t adequately protect our 
                        citizens in Mississippi, he’ll 
                        find someone who can.

                                 SENIOR AGENT #1
                        We need more manpower.

           Not going to happen.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        They’re not going to approve any 
                        additional funding for us.  Just 
                        opening this office two years ago 
                        broke the bank.  We have to be 
                        resourceful.  Clever. 

           He looks over at Rhodes.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                        We may have to revisit 
                        unconventional methods we’ve used 
                        in the past. 

           Meanwhile, Rhodes sees Terence approaching.  

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 TERENCE
                        Special Agent Moore?

           Rhodes tries to head this off at the pass.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        Not the right time, Agent Wayne.

           But Moore steps in.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                                 (to Terence)
                        What can I help you with, son?

                                 TERENCE
                        I was wondering if you had a 
                        chance to read the memorandum I 
                        put together for you.

           Moore looks over at Rhodes, who comes clean.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        I actually haven’t put it on your 
                        desk yet, sir.  I was holding it 
                        until you got past other, more 
                        urgent, business first. 

           Back to Terence.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        Maybe you can synopsize it for me, 
                        Agent Wayne.

                                 TERENCE
                        I’ve been collecting crime 
                        statistics, anecdotal information 
                        and empirical evidence on the 
                        increase of Klan activity in 
                        Forrest and Lamar Counties over 
                        the last year, sir. 

           Okay.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        And how do you know so much about 
                        Forrest and Lamar Counties?

                                 TERENCE
                        I live in Hattiesburg, sir.

           Interesting.

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        Did you know Vernon Dahmer?

                                 TERENCE
                        Everyone knew Vernon.  My wife was 
                        working with him on registering 
                        people to vote.

           Moore is suddenly intrigued by Terence.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        Hattiesburg is two hours south of 
                        here.  You live there and work 
                        here?

                                 TERENCE
                        I take the bus, sir.  Actually, 
                        five buses.  I take five buses 
                        each way to get here and go home.

           Moore is impressed.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        Tell all your friends in 
                        Hattiesburg that we’re going to 
                        find the people responsible Vernon 
                        Dahmer’s murder.  Soon.

                                 TERENCE
                        I’d like to help, sir.  

           Moore sizes up Terence for another beat and then...

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                                 (to Rhodes)
                        Get me Agent Wayne’s memorandum.

           Rhodes nods.  But he’s still pissed that he just got 
           shown up by Terence.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                                 (to Terence)
                        I’ll read it tonight.

           Moore might have plans for Agent Terence Wayne after all.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                        You travel four hours everyday to 
                        work here.  Least I can do is read 
                        the material you prepared.

                                 TERENCE
                        Thank you, sir.

           CONTINUED: (4)

           And with that, Moore and his entourage head into the 
           building, leaving Terence alone on the stairs.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (O.S.)
                        Five buses each way.  I believe 
                        that’s three more buses than I’ve 
                        ridden in my whole damn life.

           Archie and Randy approach Terence.

                                 ARCHIE
                        You let Special Agent Moore know 
                        that he needs to call us black 
                        from here on out?

                                 TERENCE
                        Didn’t get to it.

                                 RANDY
                        That’s alright.  Just send him one 
                        of your memorandums.

           They laugh.

           EXT. CITYSCAPE - NEW YORK CITY - LATE NIGHT

           As we fly south over New York City, we see all the 
           familiar landmarks.  Central Park, the Empire State 
           Building, the Chrysler Building... 

           Once we get to lower Manhattan, though, we  see 
           construction down near the tip of the island.     

           This little project will become none other than the World 
           Trade Center.

           GRAPHIC: New York City.

           This is the year they broke ground on the Twin Towers.

           We keep FLYING OVER the Brooklyn Bridge.  Past Brooklyn 
           Heights, Park Slope and Borough Park.

           We finally DROP DOWN INTO GRAVESEND, a working class 
           neighborhood that’s notorious for its residents’ violent 
           distaste for outsiders. 

           If you’re not from Gravesend, don’t come to Gravesend.  

           We end up on Avenue U where the only lights that are 
           still on come from...
           EXT. MORETTI’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Moretti’s is a dive bar.  Plain and simple. 

           A brand new Pontiac Grand Prix pulls up outside of the 
           bar and stops in front of it.  The driver’s door opens 
           and out of it emerges GREGORY SCARPA (late thirties).

           Over time, Greg Scarpa would be known by many names - 
           “The Grim Reaper,” “Hannibal Lecter” “The Mad Hatter” - 
           but the one he preferred most was, “The Killing Machine.”  
           (In fact, he even took to signing personal letters with 
           the initials, “KM”.)

           As he exits the car, we see that he’s dressed to the 
           nines in a slick suit, replete with a pocket square.  
           He’s also wearing a seven-carat pinky ring and a watch 
           that’s covered in diamonds.

           Scarpa doesn’t bother turning off the car’s engine or 
           closing his door as he heads for the bar.

           INT. MORETTI'S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           This spot is completely empty save for CARMINE DESTEFANO 
           (forties), VINITA (twenties, African-American), his date 
           for the night, and WILLY THE BARTENDER (twenties).

           Vinita hangs on Carmine as they sit at the bar together.

                                 CARMINE DESTEFANO
                        I know who really killed Kennedy.  
                        Whole neighborhood does.

           Vinita giggles, even though there’s no reason to giggle.

           Carmine turns to Willy the bartender.

                                 CARMINE DESTEFANO (CONT’D)
                        Tell her Willy: Go to any corner 
                        in Bensonhurst and they’ll tell 
                        you it was New Orleans.  Carlos 
                        Marcello did it.    

           From behind them...

                                 SCARPA (O.S.)
                        Wouldn’t recommend bringin’...

           He gestures toward Vinita.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Harriet Tubman here around 
                        Bensonhurst.

           The blood drains from Carmine’s face.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Doubt she’d get a very warm 
                        reception.

           In one hand, Scarpa has a PISTOL trained on Carmine.  

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Couldn’t understand why you’d be 
                        gettin’ drinks in this fuckin’ 
                        dump...

           He uses the other hand to take a handful of nuts from a 
           small glass bowl on the bar.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        But now I get it.  Looks like 
                        someone’s got a deep...
                                 (re: Vinita)
                        Dark secret.

           Vinita hasn’t even taken a breath.

           Immediately, Carmine tries to talk his way out of this.

                                 CARMINE DESTEFANO
                        I was never gonna do it, Scarpa.  
                        It was just talk.  Just runnin’ my 
                        mouth.  

                                 SCARPA
                        Talkin’ about whackin’ the boss is 
                        way worse than actually doin’ it, 
                        Carmine.  You know that.  At least 
                        if you do it, you got a seat at 
                        the table.  A hand you can play.

           Carmine is shitting himself.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        But you ain’t got shit but a cheap 
                        nigger on your arm and a watered-
                        down drink in your hand. 

                                 CARMINE DESTEFANO
                        I-

           BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!  Scarpa SHOOTS him three times.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Vinita, covered in Carmine’s blood, has fallen to the 
           ground.  She looks up at Scarpa and pleads for her life.  

                                 VINITA
                        It’s our first date!

                                 SCARPA
                        First and last, sweetheart.

           BOOM!  BOOM!  He shoots her dead too.

           The only one left alive in here is Willy, who has 
           watched, paralyzed in horror, as all this has transpired. 

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                                 (to Willy)
                        Scotch.

           Willy grabs a bottle of Johnnie Walker.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck Johnnie Walker.  You got 
                        Dewar’s?

           Willy nods, reaches under the bar, grabs the Dewar’s and 
           starts to pour Scarpa a glass.  His hand shakes, spilling 
           the liquor all over the bar.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Just gimme the bottle.

           Willy hands the bottle to Scarpa, who looks this kid up 
           and down.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

           This kid is hyperventilating with fear.

                                 WILLY THE BARTENDER
                        Willy Ambrosino.

                                 SCARPA
                        You Joe’s kid?

                                 WILLY THE BARTENDER
                        Nephew.

                                 SCARPA
                        Gimme your driver’s license.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           His hands still shaking, Willy pulls out his wallet and 
           quickly hands his license to Scarpa, who looks at it and 
           then puts it on his pocket.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        You know who I am?

                                 WILLY THE BARTENDER
                        Yeah.

           Willy didn’t understand the question.

                                 SCARPA
                        You know who I am?

           Now he gets it.

                                 WILLY THE BARTENDER
                        No.  No.  I don’t know you.  I 
                        don’t know you at all.

                                 SCARPA
                        Would you know who I was if you 
                        saw me again?

                                 WILLY THE BARTENDER
                        No.

                                 SCARPA
                        Sure about that?

                                 WILLY THE BARTENDER
                        Really, really sure.

           And with that, Scarpa leaves.

           EXT. MORETTI'S LOUNGE - A MOMENT LATER

           Scarpa exits the bar, steps into his idling car and 
           drives off into the Brooklyn night.

           INT. BUS - NIGHT

           Terence sits in the back and reads the recently published 
           Autobiography of Malcolm X.

           The bus cuts through the Mississippi night. 

           As he finishes a chapter, he looks up from the book and 
           stares out the window at the passing fields and pastures.  
           The full moon gives everything a silvery glow.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The South.

           For a moment, Terence gets lost in the beauty of it all.

           The bus passes by A FARM that has a giant CONFEDERATE 
           FLAG hanging from a pole in front if it.  

           Terence stares at it for a beat.

           And then gets back to his book.

           EXT, HATTIESBURG STREET - NIGHT

           The bus pulls up to the stop, opens its doors and 
           Terence, weary from a long day, exits.

           As he steps out of the bus, Terence helps ADELENA HAMLETT 
           (African-American, seventies) down the stairs.

                                 ADELENA HAMLETT
                        Thank you, Terence.

           The bus pulls away.

                                 ADELENA HAMLETT (CONT’D)
                        The F.B.I. gonna catch whoever did 
                        that to poor Vernon Dahmer and his 
                        family?

                                 TERENCE
                        We are, Ms. Hamlett.

           Adelena looks out at downtown Hattiesburg.

                                 ADELENA HAMLETT
                        These white folks don’t understand 
                        that there are a hundred thousand 
                        negroes behind Vernon Dahmer that 
                        are gonna step right in and take 
                        his place.  And another hundred 
                        thousand behind them.  They 
                        underestimate us.  They always do.  

                                 TERENCE
                        You’re right.

                                 ADELENA HAMLETT
                        Of course I’m right, Terence.  You 
                        get to my age, you get to be right 
                        about everything.

           Terence laughs.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TERENCE
                        You’re right.

                                 ADELENA HAMLETT
                        See?

           More laughter.

                                 TERENCE
                        You want me to walk you home?

                                 ADELENA HAMLETT
                        That’s alright, baby.  My nephew, 
                        Grafton, gonna pick me up.  You go 
                        home and give my best to that 
                        beautiful wife of yours.

                                 TERENCE
                        I will.  You have a good night, 
                        Ms. Hamlett.

           Adelena walks toward a waiting car; Terence heads off in 
           the opposite direction.

           EXT. HATTIESBURG STREET - LATER

           As Terence walks down this tidy street lined by small 
           shops on both sides, we can hear men LAUGHING and YELLING 
           from the Veterans of Foreign Wars post up the street.

           And Terence immediately tenses up.  

           Like most small southern cities in the sixties (and still 
           today), Hattiesburg is segregated.  There are white and 
           black neighborhoods...and never the twain shall meet.  

           Terence is going through the white part of town.  We see 
           it on his face and in his focused and purposeful gait.

           As he passes by the V.F.W. post, he sees a COLLECTION OF 
           MEN standing around, drinking in the parking lot.

           And they see him too.  One of them calls to him.

                                 CRACKER #1
                        Hey boy!

           Terence keeps walking.

                                 CRACKER #3
                        We’re talkin’ to you, Sambo!

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The other men LAUGH.

           Terence continues to walk.  Not faster.  Not slower.  
           Same pace as before.  But he stares straight ahead.

                                 CRACKER #1
                        You hear us, Smokey?

           Getting no response, this guy and SEVEN OF HIS FRIENDS 
           run across the street and approaches Terence. 

                                 CRACKER #1 (CONT’D)
                                 (to Terence)
                        You deaf, boy?

           Now that we get a better look a this guy, we see that 
           he’s got slicked back hair, a thin mustache and a narrow, 
           angry face.  

           And he’s big.  Bulky.  

           His name is LAWRENCE BYRD, SR. (forties).

           He’s joined by BILLY ROY PITTS (thirties) and CHARLES 
           CLIFFORD WILSON (thirties) and a CREW OF OTHER CRACKERS.

           They block Terence’s path.

                                 CHARLES CLIFFORD WILSON
                                 (to Terence)
                        Because I know you’re not ignoring 
                        me.

           Terence puffs out his chest.

                                 TERENCE
                        I don’t know you.

           Wilson flips Terence’s tie.

                                 CHARLES CLIFFORD WILSON
                        Why you all dressed up this late 
                        at night?  

           He makes a crack about Vernon Dahmer.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        Little early to be dressed up for 
                        ol’ Vernon’s funeral, ain’t it?

                                 TERENCE
                        I’m coming home from work.

           Wilson sneers.

                                 CHARLES CLIFFORD WILSON
                        Who trusts someone who look like 
                        you to work for them?

           Terence stares him down.

                        The Federal Bureau of

           Byrd breaks into a smile.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        Hey, boys!  We got us an important 
                        niggra here.

           Terence’s fists are clenched as tight as they can be.

           Billy Roy isn’t enjoying this as much as his friends.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                                 (to his friends)
                        We should go back to the club.  

           He’s perpetually anxious.

                        Shut up, Billy Roy.

           These guys want to beat Terence’s ass as badly as he 
           wants to beat theirs.  This entire exchange is a study in 
           repressing one’s most violent inclinations.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        You need to pass along the word to 
                        J. Nigger Hoover up in Washington.  
                        We don’t need his help.  
                        Mississippi just fine the way we 
                        are.  

           Byrd gets in Terence’s face and stares him down.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t we?

           Wilson adds his two cents.

                                 (re: Terence)
                        Hoover got this niggra feelin’ all 
                        special and shit, and that’s no 
                        good for nobody.

           Byrd’s hot, liquor-filled breath is right on Terence.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                                 (to Terence)
                        Especially you.

           The two men LOCK EYES and it really feels like punches 
           are about to be thrown.

           Billy Roy interjects yet again.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Come on, man.  Let’s go get 
                        another beer.  Ain’t nothin’ but 
                        bullshit out here.

           And then from across the street...

                                 SAM BOWERS (O.S.)
                        Let that boy get on about his 
                        business...

           All of them look across the street and see SAM BOWERS 
           (forties), the elder statesman here, calling to them from 
           the doorway.

                                 SAM BOWERS (CONT’D)
                         And get on back here.

           Terence and Byrd stare each other down for another beat, 
           and then the white man breaks into a wide smile. 

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        You have yourself a pleasant 
                        evening, G-Man.  Or should I say, 
                        G-Boy.

           They break into laughter.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD (CONT’D)
                        We’ll see you around.

           They head back across the street to Bowers.

                                 SAM BOWERS
                        Don’t need no trouble right now.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        Wasn’t no trouble, Sam.  That was 
                        just fun.

           As the men disappear inside, Bowers stays outside and 
           stares over at Terence.

           If you could point your finger at the most violent and 
           virulent racist in Mississippi during the civil rights 
           era, your finger would be aimed squarely at Sam Bowers.

           He is as vicious, cruel and hateful as anyone who has 
           ever walked this planet.

           Terence and Bowers LOCK EYES for a pregnant beat, and 
           Bowers smiles.

           And then he steps back into the hall.

           Terence resumes walking up the block.

           But not before wiping a few beads of sweat from his brow. 

           INT. TERENCE AND ALLISON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Terence is sitting up in bed as his wife, ALLISON 
           (thirties, African-American) massages his back.

                                 ALLISON
                        I don’t understand why you don’t 
                        just take Pine Street home.  You 
                        know they’re gonna be there at the 
                        V.F.W.

                                 TERENCE
                        First off, Pine Street adds ten 
                        minutes to my walk.  Secondly, and 
                        more importantly...

           Terence turns around and stares at his wife.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck them.  

           Allison doesn’t like that kind of language.

                                 ALLISON
                        Terence.

           But he’s furious

                                 TERENCE
                        They’re killing us, Allison.  
                        Killing us and then going about 
                        their lives like it’s the natural 
                        order of things.  Like we don’t 
                        matter.

           He’s on a roll.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Malcolm X says that nobody can 
                        give you freedom or equality or 
                        justice.  If you’re a man, you 
                        take it.  Well, I’m a man.

           Terence gets up out of bed.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        They murdered Vernon Dahmer last 
                        night.  Burned him to death in his 
                        own house.  In front of his wife 
                        and child.  We don’t mean anything 
                        to them. 

           He pounds at his chest.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        They need to know I mean 
                        something.  

           Terence storms out of his bedroom, through his house and 
           OUTSIDE where he walks over to a HEAVY BAG that he’s hung 
           from tree in his front yard. 

           He PUNCHES the bag.  Hard.  Angry.

           Straight rights, left hooks, crosses...  Big hits.  
           Sneering with every blow.

           Allison emerges from the house and gets between him and 
           the bag.

                                 ALLISON
                        Vernon was my friend too.  And I 
                        feel his loss just like you.  I 
                        feel all of ‘em.

           She looks her husband in the eye.

                                 ALLISON (CONT’D)
                        But you’re an agent in the Federal 
                        Bureau of Investigation, Terence.

                        And whether you believe it or not, 
                        that means something.  To me.  To 
                        this community.  To the world.

           Terence just doesn’t see it the way his wife does.

                                 TERENCE
                        Half the people on our street 
                        won’t look me in the eye.  To 
                        them, I’m just part of the 
                        problem.  And they may be right. 

                                 ALLISON
                        You’re blazing a trail.  Breaking 
                        down barriers.

           Terence disagrees.

                                 TERENCE
                        All I am is a damn signpost.  A 
                        marker that Hoover and Johnson can 
                        point to and say, “See?  We kinda 
                        trust ‘em, so maybe you should 
                        too.”  But they don’t really trust 
                        us.  Not enough to let us join 
                        this fight.

           Terence has been ruminating on all this for a while.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Can you imagine if someone who 
                        looked like me arrested these 
                        crackers who killed Vernon?  

           He punches the bag again.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Can you imagine how proud of me 
                        you’d be then?  How proud everyone 
                        around here would be?

                                 ALLISON
                        I don’t think I could be any 
                        prouder of you than I am every 
                        morning when you get on that bus.

                                 TERENCE
                        You could.  I could.

           Allison steps closer to Terence.

                        And so what if you are a signpost?  
                        What that sign says to me is, 
                        “Look how far we’ve come.  Look 
                        where we’re going.  You can’t stop 
                        us.”  That’s a powerful sign.  

                                 TERENCE
                        The people that killed Vernon 
                        aren’t scared of signs.  All a 
                        sign is to them is one more thing 
                        they can burn down.

           OFF TERENCE, his eyes steely and determined...

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Ellie and Bettie, Vernon’s wife and daughter, 
           respectively, sit in chairs next to Vernon’s casket, 
           which is suspended above the plot that’s been dug. 

           A LARGE CROWD, comprised of black and white folks, 
           surrounds the grave and listens as PASTOR TOLBERT 
           delivers the eulogy. 

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT
                        How do we confront a pain that 
                        feels endless?

           We FIND TERENCE and ALLISON WAYNE amongst the crowd.  
           Both are wearing sunglasses.  Allison dabs at her eyes.

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT (CONT’D)
                        For me, I think back to what my 
                        friend, Vernon Dahmer said me at 
                        one of my lowest moments.

                        like possums neither, but I let 
                        one cross right in front of my car 
                        the other day and drove right 
                        around him.  And that’s what I do 
                        with niggras too.  I just avoid 
                        ‘em.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A LARGE CROWD, mostly African-American, but there are 
           some white folks sprinkled in here as well,  marches down 
           the middle of Main Street, singing, “We Shall Overcome”.  

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT (V.O.)
                        Think about your best day, Vernon 
                        said to me.  The day when you were 
                        happiest.  The day when everything 
                        was as brilliant and wonderful as 
                        you ever hoped it could be.

           The people in the front carry a large banner that reads, 
           “Who Killed Vernon Dahmer?”

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           We still hear the people SINGING (and we will hear them 
           throughout the rest of this montage)  as the pastor 
           continues to speak back at the cemetery.

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT
                        Remember how that day transpired?  
                        How fleeting it felt?  How quickly 
                        it passed?

           The pastor wipes at his own tears.

           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           Grease on his face, MAURICE ALLEN (thirties, African-
           American) stands in the middle of his garage and speaks 
           with TWO FBI AGENTS.

           Maurice is justifiably skeptical of the agents.

                                 MAURICE ALLEN
                        If the F.B.I. don’t know nothin’, 
                        why would I?

                        Well, we’re not from around here. 
                        We just assumed that, as a 
                        resident of Hattiesburg, you might 
                        have heard rumors or gossip or 
                        something of that nature.

                                 MAURICE ALLEN
                        Right.  You’re not from around 
                        here.  But I am.  I live here.  My 
                        family lives here.  And we’d like 
                        to keep on living here.

           Maurice is done here.

                                 MAURICE ALLEN (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get back to work.  These 
                        cars ain’t gonna fix themselves.

           EXT. MT. CALVARY BAPTIST CHURCH - NIGHT

           A car skids to a stop in front of this church. THREE MEN 
           exit and THROW MOLOTOV COCKTAILS through the windows.

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT (V.O.)
                        This day -- your worst day -- is 
                        no longer than your best day.  And 
                        like that one, this day will pass 
                        faster than you think.  

           They explode and the church starts to burn.

           The men get back in the vehicle and speed away.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The pastor continues.

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT
                        The sun will rise and set.  The 
                        moon will climb into the night 
                        sky.  

           The crowd voices their agreement.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Billy Roy Pitts nervously sips from a cup of coffee and 
           eats his breakfast as TWO DIFFERENT AGENTS question him.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Everyone heard of ‘im.  But it’s 
                        not like we were friends or 
                        nothin’.

                                 AGENT #4
                        We’re not suggesting that you and 
                        Mr. Dahmer were friends.

           Pitts’s hand shakes as he takes a sip of his coffee.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS

                        talkin’.

           He gets up and sits somewhere else.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The pastor’s voice is rising.  Building.

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT
                        And there will be a tomorrow.  
                        There’s always a tomorrow.  There 
                        has to be!  It’s ordained!  It’s 
                        affirmed!  It’s guaranteed!

           INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY

           Adelena Hamlett, who we met at the bus stop earlier, and 
           BIRDIA KEGLAR (African-American, seventies) are sitting 
           in barber’s chairs as they get their hair done.

           F.B.I. AGENTS question them.

                                 ADELENA HAMLETT
                        I don’t know who killed poor 
                        Vernon, but you tell ‘em that they 
                        ain’t stoppin’ us from votin’.

           Birdia agrees.

                                 BIRDIA KEGLAR
                        Tell ‘em they just made us more 
                        powerful.  Because now Vernon’s 
                        with God, lookin’ down and 
                        watchin’ over us.  Pushin’ us to

           The F.B.I. agents scribble down notes.

           EXT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           As Sam Bowers walks down the stairs that lead to the 
           Bureau’s office in Jackson, he’s trailed by a FEW 
           REPORTERS, who bark questions at him.

                                 SAM BOWERS
                        The F.B.I. drug me all the way to 
                        Jackson to tell them what I’m 
                        gonna to tell you: I didn’t like 
                        Vernon Dahmer and I didn’t agree 
                        with Vernon Dahmer.  But I also 
                        didn’t kill Vernon Dahmer.  That 
                        niggra wasn’t worth my bullets.

           Bowers steps into a waiting car.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE PARK - NIGHT

           Located in the middle of downtown Hattiesburg, this park 
           is the site of countless civic events and celebrations. 

           But not tonight.

           A GIANT CROSS is AFLAME in the center of the park, and a 
           CREW OF HOODED KLANSMEN stand around it with torches in 
           their hands.

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT (V.O.)
                        Tomorrow is God’s will!  Tomorrow 
                        is the promise!  Tomorrow is the 
                        revelation!  Tomorrow is the 
                        truth!  

           It’s a message.  To everyone.  Everywhere.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The pastor’s got the crowd here worked up.

                                 PASTOR TOLBERT
                        The sun comes up, goes down and 
                        comes up again!  That’s God’s way!  
                        That’s his bond with us!

           They’re clapping their hands and cheering now.

                        like it, or not!  

           Everyone’s hearts are about to pound out of their chests.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The service over, Terence and Allison walk back toward 
           their automobile.

           Up ahead, parked amongst all the other cars, Terence sees 
           Agent Rhodes standing outside a black sedan.  

                                 TERENCE
                        Damn.

                                 ALLISON
                        I hope whatever it is that 
                        inspired you to just blaspheme in 
                        a cemetery is worth it.

           Terence gestures toward Rhodes.

                                 TERENCE
                        Work.

                                 ALLISON
                        Didn’t you tell them that you were 
                        going to be out for a couple days?

                                 TERENCE
                        Guess they didn’t get the memo.  
                        As usual.  Can you get a ride home 
                        with Rachel?

           She kisses Terence on the cheek.

                                 ALLISON
                        Don’t take long.

           As Allison breaks off toward her friends, Terence 
           approaches Rhodes.

                        speak with you.

           Terence opens the door to the sedan and steps inside.

           INT./EXT. MOORE’S CAR - DAY

           Terence and Agent Moore sit in the back as the car drives 
           through Hattiesburg.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        No one around here is talking to 
                        us.  We’ve questioned over a 
                        hundred people -- negroes and 
                        whites, alike -- and we’re hitting 
                        a dead end before we even get on 
                        the road with our investigation.  
                        President Johnson is beside 
                        himself.

                                 TERENCE
                        The Klan killed Vernon Dahmer, 
                        sir.  Everyone knows the Klan 
                        killed him.  And with all due 
                        respect, sir, the reason folks 
                        around town aren’t talking to you 
                        is because they figure that if the 
                        F.B.I. doesn’t know that the Klan 
                        did it, the Bureau’s either in on 
                        it, or too useless to catch the 
                        guys who did it anyway.

           It’s more complicated than that, of course.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        There’s a big gap between knowing 
                        something and proving something, 
                        Agent Wayne.

           Moore looks out the window.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                        I read your memorandum.  It was 
                        excellent.  And thorough.  But as 
                        good as it was -- as many names as 
                        you named -- it won’t bring your 
                        friend’s murderers to justice. 

           Terence knows this.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        You’re angry.

                                 TERENCE
                        Hell yes I’m angry.

           Moore likes it.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        I’m angry too.  And more 
                        importantly, President Johnson is 
                        angry.

           Moore gets to the reason he’s here.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                        There may be an opportunity for 
                        you to assist in this 
                        investigation.  There-

                                 TERENCE
                        I’m in.  Whatever it is.  I’m in.

           Moore can’t help but smile at Terence’s enthusiasm.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        Given the dearth of information 
                        and evidence, we’re taking an 
                        unorthodox approach here.

           Moore studies Terence closely.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                        You’d be paired up with a 
                        consultant.  He’s uniquely skilled 
                        when it comes to this kind of 
                        work.  Your familiarity with the 
                        area and the players could be 
                        invaluable to him and our 
                        investigation.

           Terence nods.  This keeps sounding better and better.

                        Off the books.  And it’s 
                        dangerous. 

           The car pulls up in front of Terence’s house.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                        You need to know that, if anything

                        Director Hoover will protect the 
                        Bureau at all costs.

           Terence could give a fuck about all that.  As far as he’s 
           concerned, he just got called up to The Show.

                                 TERENCE

                        We’ll be in touch.

           Terence exits the car, Rhodes shuts the door behind him 
           and then gets back into the car’s front seat.  

           Terence watches them drive away.  

           And then he pumps his fist.

           He can’t help himself.

                        the one catchin’ a heater in his 
                        ribs.  That kid hit you on 
                        purpose.

           Scarpa has a mouthful of steak.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        And when someone hits you, you hit 
                        ‘em back.

           The phone rings.  Connie answers.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Hundred times harder.

           Greg Jr. worships his father, but just like everyone 
           else, he’s also terrified of him.

           Connie interrupts.

                                 CONNIE SCARPA
                                 (to Scarpa)
                        Phone’s for you.

           We STAY WITH GREG JR. as he watches his father take his 
           call.  This sixteen-year-old kid will end up following 
           his old man into a life of crime and ultimately spend 
           most of his life in prison.  

           But for right now, he’s just a son who adores his dad.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (into the phone)
                        Yeah.

           He listens for a beat.

                        It’s late.

           He looks out the window and sees a downpour.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                                 (into the phone)
                        It’s also pissin’ rain out there.

                        Okay then.

           He hangs up the phone.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                                 (to Connie)

           Connie’s justifiably skeptical.

                        At this time of night?

                        they work around your schedule, 
                        not the other way around?

           Scarpa gives his wife a look that tells her that she’s 
           overstepped.  And she knows it.

                                 CONNIE SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll keep your dinner warm.

           On his way out the door, Scarpa kisses his wife and 
           tousles his son’s hair.

                                 SCARPA
                        Won’t be long.

           INT./EXT. GREG SCARPA'S CAR - NIGHT

           Scarpa drives up the mostly empty New Jersey Turnpike. 

           Up ahead, he sees a sign for a rest area.  

           He checks his rearview mirror to make sure no one’s 
           following him.  No one.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He exits.

           EXT. REST AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           This rest area is no more than a couple dirty bathrooms 
           and a few picnic tables.

           AGENT ARTHUR LEVINE (forties) sits by himself at one of 
           the tables in the pouring rain.  

           Scarpa approaches.

                                 SCARPA
                        Sittin’ out here all alone in the 
                        rain like this, people are liable 
                        to think you’re some kind of 
                        pervert.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        What’s your excuse?

           Scarpa laughs and sits down across from him.

                                 SCARPA
                        How goes it at the Bureau, Art?

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        Fightin’ the good fight.

                                 SCARPA
                        That makes two of us.

           Now it’s Levine’s turn to laugh.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        What do you know about the hit on 
                        Carmine Destefano in that bar in 
                        Gravesend? 

                                 SCARPA
                        Moretti’s.

           Yes.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Carmine got clipped.  That’s all I 
                        know.

           Scarpa is cool as a fan.

                        hustles.  Slippery motherfucker.  
                        Shit happens.

           Levine is scrutinizing the hell out of Scarpa.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        This informant arrangement between 
                        us - it’s predicated on you being 
                        honest with the Bureau, Scarpa.  
                        If you lie to us, the whole thing 
                        falls apart.  

                                 SCARPA
                        I’m not lyin’ to you, Art.  You 
                        lyin’ to me?

           Levine continues to size up Scarpa.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        If you hear anything about the 
                        hit, let me know.  All we got 
                        right now is a bartender who says 
                        he was in the can when bullets 
                        started flying and didn’t see a 
                        thing.  

           Scarpa’s had enough of this particular conversation.

                                 SCARPA
                        I know you didn’t bring me out 
                        here in the middle of the night, 
                        and in a fuckin’ typhoon, to talk 
                        about Carmine Destefano.

           He’s right, of course.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        We need you to go back down South.

                                 SCARPA
                        Jews gone missing again?

           Levine takes offense but doesn’t say anything.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        Negro in Mississippi.  Voting

                        a couple weeks back and no one’s 
                        talking.

           Scarpa’s interested.

                        How much you paying?

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        This isn’t a drive-by like the 
                        last one.  Gonna need you on the 
                        ground.  There’ll be some shoe 
                        leather this time around.

           There’s nothing Scarpa likes more than driving the deal.

                                 SCARPA
                        You know I’m gonna want my get-out-
                        of-jail-free card extended to

                        Need to be compensated for time

           Levine’s been down this road before.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        We’ll talk to the man in charge.

           large hotel located in downtown Atlanta.

           He exits his car and heads for the front doors.

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Terence walks into the lobby and looks around.  He hasn’t 
           been standing here for more than ten seconds when a HOTEL 
           EMPLOYEE (white woman, thirties) approaches him.

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        I haven’t seen anyone you would 
                        know.

           Terence can’t help but give a cynical chuckle.

                                 TERENCE
                        How would you know who I know?

           Just as he says this, he sees Agent Levine, dressed in 
           the standard F.B.I. attire.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Levine?

           Levine sees him and walks over with his hand extended.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        Mr. Wayne.  Welcome to Atlanta.

           As they shake...

                        Does he look like someone I’d 
                        know?

           She turns her attention to the white agent.

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                                 (to Agent Levine)
                        Are you a guest here, sir?

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        I’m renting out the entire top 
                        floor of this hotel.  Is there a 
                        problem?

           She forces a smile.

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        You both have a nice day.

           As she walks away, Levine shakes his head.

                                 TERENCE
                        She was just making sure I was in

           Levine knows what’s up.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        Of course she was.

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Agent Levine gives Terence the lowdown as they stand 
           outside a door to a room.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        I don’t know what they’ve told you 
                        about Confidential Informant 34.

                                 TERENCE
                        They haven’t told me anything, and 
                        I didn’t ask.

           It’s clear to Agent Levine that Terence has no idea what 
           the fuck he’s getting into here.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        C.I. 34 is one of our most 
                        valuable assets.

           He reaches for the door’s handle and then stops himself.

                                 AGENT LEVINE (CONT’D)
                        He’s also an absolute son of a 
                        bitch.  If he’s talking, he’s 
                        lying.  If his feet are moving, 
                        he’s dancing.  If he’s standing 
                        near you, make sure you still have 
                        your wallet. 

           This is a lot to take in.

                                 AGENT LEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Having said that, he’s been around 
                        the block.  You’ll be following 
                        his lead.

           Levine opens the door and the two men step inside.

           INT. HOLIDAY INN - SCARPA’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Terence and Levine are greeted by the sight of Scarpa, in 
           a bathrobe, sitting on a couch with a WOMAN, also in a 
           bathrobe (but hers is open), straddling him. 

           Levine clears his throat.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        Company.

           The woman, who is, at the most, in her early twenties, 
           closes her robe and dismounts Scarpa.  

           Immediately, we notice that she is not Scarpa’s wife.

           Her name is LINDA SCHIRO (twenties) and she will give 
           birth to, and raise, two of Scarpa’s children...while 
           she’s married to another man.

           Scarpa does the introductions.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                                 (to Linda)
                        This is Art.

           They exchange nods and smiles.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                                 (re: Terence)
                        And that’s Art’s driver.

           No.  Asshole.  It’s not.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        Terence Wayne.  He’s going to be 
                        working with you in Mississippi.

           Scarpa’s surprised.  Stunned is more like it.

                                 SCARPA
                        That right?

           Scarpa extends his hand as he sizes up Terence.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I’m-

           Before he can gets another word out, Levine steps in.

                                 AGENT LEVINE

           Scarpa chuckles.

                                 SCARPA
                        Yeah.  34.

           Linda takes a sip from a glass of champagne.

                        We’re doing code names again?  
                        That’s fun.

           Again?  This gives Terence momentary pause as he and 
           Scarpa shake hands.

                                 TERENCE
                        Terence Wayne.

           Levine offers up the particulars.

                                 AGENT LEVINE
                        You and Terence will drive to 
                        Mobile tonight, and then you’ll 
                        continue on into Mississippi 
                        tomorrow.

           Scarpa is still studying Terence.

                                 AGENT LEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Terence is from Hattiesburg.  He 
                        knows the city and everyone in it.

           Scarpa wants to establish the ground rules right now.

                                 SCARPA
                        Don’t know what Art told you, but 
                        I’ve done this before.

                                 TERENCE
                        He told me.

                                 SCARPA
                        I know more than you, and I’m the 
                        best at what I do.  

           From the peanut gallery.

                                 LINDA
                        And he’s really humble.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (to Linda)
                        Watch your mouth.
                                 (to Terence)
                        Point is, I’m freelance.  Only 
                        clock I punch is my own.  

           This guy is already a pain in the ass.

                                 TERENCE
                        I’ll keep that in mind.

                        You better.

           Sizing him up.

           EXT. HOLIDAY INN - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Scarpa stands outside the car and says good-bye to Linda 
           before he steps inside with Terence, who’s behind the 
           wheel already.

                                 LINDA
                        I get so little time with you back 
                        in New York, and now you’re 
                        leaving me again.  It’s not fair, 
                        Greg.

           Terence hears her call him Greg and takes note.

                                 SCARPA
                        I saw you droolin’ over that bus 
                        boy.  He can keep you busy for a 
                        few days while I’m gone.

           She playfully slaps Scarpa.

                                 LINDA
                        Stop!

           But he really doesn’t give a fuck.

                                 SCARPA
                        Do what you need to do.

           Scarpa kisses her and grabs her ass in the process.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Keep it tight for me. 

           Gross.

           Scarpa steps into...

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

           As Scarpa takes the seat next to Terence, he pulls a GUN 
           out of his jacket and places it under the seat. 

           Terence watches him do it; Scarpa notices him watching.

           Terence stares at Scarpa...and then starts the car.

           He pulls out of the parking lot.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING

           Scarpa’s window is down and he breathes in the air.

                                 SCARPA
                        Love it down here.  Nobody knows 
                        me.  Nobody sees me comin’.

           He takes another deep breath.

                        Like I been born again.

           The Four Tops play on the radio -- “I Can’t Help Myself” -
           - as Terence continues to drive up the road. 

           Terence hands Scarpa a folder.

                                 TERENCE
                        It’s a memorandum I wrote about 
                        the Klan in Hattiesburg.  I 
                        thought it might be helpful. 

           Scarpa take a quick look and then tosses it at his feet.  
           He could give a fuck about Terence’s memorandum.

                                 SCARPA
                        I’ll read it later.

           He won’t.

                        So when they start letting niggers 
                        into the Bureau?

           Terence turns to him.

                        I’m going to ask you not to use 
                        that word around me.

           Scarpa’s testing him.

                                 SCARPA
                        Just a figure of speech.

           Scarpa smiles.  He likes Terence’s toughness.

                                 SCARPA
                        Never seen a negro agent before.

           The car continues up the road.

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - NIGHT

           Terence’s eyes are getting heavy; Scarpa is asleep.

           Suddenly, POLICE LIGHTS appear behind them.

                        Fuck.

           Terence slowly pulls over to the shoulder and brings the 
           car to a stop.  

           He watches TWO COPS get out of their car and approach.

           And then he sees Scarpa grab his pistol and put it under 
           his leg.

           The cops come up both sides of the car and SHINE THEIR 
           FLASHLIGHTS into Terence and Scarpa’s faces.

                                 COP #2
                        Mobile’s not going nowhere, so why 
                        you tearin’ up our roads?  

                                 TERENCE
                        I didn’t realize I was.

           The cop in his window gets in his face.

                                 COP #1
                        He just told you that you were, 
                        boy.

           This interaction feels like it could fly off the rails, 
           and turn violent, at any moment.

                                 COP #2
                        What’s in Mobile?

                                 TERENCE
                        Just a motel.  We’re staying there 
                        for the night.

                                 COP #1
                        You queers?

           What Scarpa says next will most likely get them both 
           killed, but Terence stops him.

                                 TERENCE
                        I’ll get you my paperwork.

                        We need identification from both 
                        of you.

           Scarpa protests.

                                 SCARPA
                        I wasn’t driving.

           The second cop gets loud. 

                                 COP #2
                        You refusing to obey an order from 
                        a law enforcement officer?

           Terence settles things down.  He looks over at Scarpa.

                                 TERENCE
                        We’ll both give you our 
                        identification.

           Scarpa pulls out his wallet and hands the guy his 
           license.  Terence does the same.

                                 COP #1
                        Stay in the car.

           The cops head back to their vehicle.

           Terence turns to Scarpa.

                                 SCARPA
                        They’re just fuckin’ with us to 
                        fuck with us.

           No shit.

                                 TERENCE
                        They see your gun, they’ll kill us 
                        right here.  No questions asked.

                                 SCARPA
                        Why don’t you tell them that 
                        you’re an F.B.I. agent?

           Because that’s the worst idea.

                                 TERENCE
                        We’re on an empty highway in 
                        Alabama at night.  And I’m a black 
                        agent in the Bureau.  Only thing 
                        these guys hate more than people 
                        that look like me are people who 
                        work where I do.  They could put a 
                        bullet in my head right now and 
                        get a medal of commendation from 
                        the governor before the week is 
                        up.    

           The cops return to the car and the one on Scarpa’s side 
           hands him back his I.D.

           Scarpa begs to disagree.

                                 SCARPA
                        The first negro F.B.I. agent was 
                        Earl Wormley in 1932.

           He fucks this all up, of course.

                        As a matter of fact, this one’s in 
                        the F.B.I. right now.

           Cop #1 takes a beat to process this and then pulls out 
           his GUN and points it at Terence’s face.

           Terence looks at Scarpa and then does as he’s told.

           The other cop points his gun at Scarpa.

                                 COP #2

                        You don’t wanna do that.

           Terence and Scarpa share a look.  

           The gun underneath Scarpa’s leg.

           As Scarpa opens his door, he expertly PALMS HIS GUN in 
           his left hand so it can’t be seen by the cop.

           As he steps outside, he drops the gun down his leg kicks 
           it under the car in one fluid, undetectable motion.  
           Coughing along the way to camouflage any noise. 

           The guy’s a fuckin’ pro.

           Terence, who has watched the whole thing, can’t help but 
           be impressed.

           EXT. ALABAMA HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Terence and Scarpa are both facedown on the pavement as 
           the two officers stand over them.

           One of them holds Terence’s memorandum. 

                                 COP #1
                        We could throw you both in jail

           The cop takes the memorandum and tears it into pieces and 
           throws it into the road.

           He gets low, right next to Terence and presses his gun to 
           his head.

           Terence and Scarpa are back in the car and they watch as 
           the two cops pull away past them, eyeing them as they go.

                                 SCARPA
                        Lemme get my gun from under the

           Terence can’t help but laugh at Scarpa’s absurdity.

           Terence and Scarpa, both with cups of coffee in their 
           hands (Scarpa has a biscuit too), walk across the parking 
           lot toward the entrance to the motel.

                        Is it ever not hot and humid down

                        straight into someone’s ass.

           Greg Scarpa.  

           Terence will remember that.

           Scarpa turns and sees MARCO ESPOSITO (forties, Italian, 
           fat).  And he is not happy about it.

           Under his breath...

                        You gotta be shittin’ me.

                        I’m pretty familiar with local 
                        real estate.

                                 SCARPA
                        Wish we could.  Heading back to 
                        New York this morning.

                                 MARCO
                        Well, if you want a belt before 
                        you head out, I got the good stuff 
                        back in 314.  Stop by before you 
                        leave. 

                                 SCARPA
                        Appreciate the offer.  In a rush.

           Scarpa gives Marco another hug

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Good seeing you, Marco.

                                 MARCO
                        You too.

           Scarpa heads over to Terence.

                                 SCARPA
                        Gotta finish packing.  I’ll meet 
                        you at the car.

           Terence’s watches Marco head into the motel. 

           INT. MOTEL 6 - ROOM 314 - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Marco sits on his bed and talks on the phone.

                                 MARCO
                        If he’s here, New York’s here.  
                        And Mobile’s not big enough for 
                        both of us.

           There’s a KNOCK at his door.

                                 MARCO (CONT’D)
                                 (into his phone)
                        Someone at my door.  Gotta go.

           Marco gets up, opens his door and finds himself staring 
           at the business end of a pistol with a silencer on it.

           Scarpa.

                        Wrong place, wrong time.

           THWIP.  Right between the eyes.

           Scarpa, holding his luggage, walks into the room and 
           closes the door behind him.

           EXT. MOTEL 6 - PARKING LOT - A MINUTE LATER

           Terence puts his bag in the car’s trunk; Scarpa 
           approaches.

                                 SCARPA
                        Sorry to make you wait.

           Scarpa throws his bag in the trunk as well. 

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Turns out this southern cooking 
                        doesn’t agree with me.

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - DAY

           Terence and Scarpa drive by the burned sign on the side 
           of the road.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (re: the sign)
                        What’s that supposed to say?

                                 TERENCE
                        Welcome to Hattiesburg.

           They keep driving.

           EXT. CAMP SHELBY - DAY

           Located in the southern boundary of Hattiesburg and 
           covering 136,000 acres, Camp Shelby is the largest state-
           owned training site in the United States.  During times 
           of war, the camp’s mission is to serve as a major 
           independent mobilization station for the army. 

           Terence and Scarpa drive through the camp’s North Gate.
           INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Terence pulls into a massive, empty hangar where Agents 
           Moore and Rhodes, as well as TWO OTHER SENIOR-LEVEL 
           AGENTS, are sitting at a table that’s been set up in the 
           middle of the enormous space.  

           Terence and Scarpa exit the car.

           They walk over to the table and take the two seats across 
           from the agents.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (to Moore)
                        Can’t get enough of me.  Can you, 
                        Special Agent Moore?

           Another surprise for Terence.  Scarpa knows Moore. 

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        The situation here is different 
                        than your prior engagement.

           And yet another reference to Scarpa being here before.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE (CONT’D)
                        We know less this time.  So you 
                        need to do more.

           Rhodes steps in.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                                 (to Terence, re: 
                                 Scarpa)
                        If anyone asks, he’s a special 
                        agent on assignment from New York.

           Scarpa loves it.

                                 SCARPA
                        Special agent on assignment.  
                        That’s who the fuck I am.

           OFF TERENCE, more and more in the dark...

           INT. HANGAR - LATER

           Scarpa eats at the table while Terence talks to Moore and 
           Rhodes off to the side and out of his earshot. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        When you were in Mobile, did you 
                        happen to cross paths with someone 
                        named Marco Esposito?

           Of course.

                                 TERENCE
                        In the parking lot of the motel.  
                        They knew each other.

           Moore and Rhodes share a look.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                                 (re: Scarpa)
                        He gave him a story about visiting 
                        from New York and looking for a 
                        location for a club he was 
                        thinking of buying.

           Terence clocks yet another loaded glance between Moore 
           and Rhodes.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                                 (re: Scarpa)
                        Can you tell me who he is?  I know 
                        he’s an informant.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        It’s better for you -- safer for 
                        you -- that you don’t know the 
                        specifics.

           Terence wants more than that.

                                 TERENCE
                        We’re working together, sir.  I-

           Rhodes is Moore’s hammer.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        Just do your job.

           OFF TERENCE, getting tired of all the cryptic bullshit...

           EXT. TERENCE AND ALLISON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Terence talks on the phone while Allison sits at the 
           kitchen table and drinks from a cup of tea.

                        They found him dead in the 
                        bathroom at the motel in Mobile?

           Marco Esposito.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                                 (into the phone)
                        Damn.  I guess he could’ve done it 
                        when he went to get his luggage.

           He shakes his head in bewilderment.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Shit.  I don’t know.

           Allison looks up at him.  He needs to wrap this call up.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                                 (into the phone)
                        It’s Scarpa.  S-C-A-R-P-A.  First 
                        name Greg.  Lemme know what you 
                        find.  Thanks. 

           He hangs up.  More disturbed than ever.

                                 ALLISON
                        I think I liked it better when you 
                        were just doing the filing.

           Terence studies his wife for a moment.

                                 TERENCE
                        You should go to your sister’s in 
                        Laurel.

                                 ALLISON
                        Why?

           Terence’s patience is stupidly short right now.

                                 TERENCE
                        Because I said you should.

           Allison takes another sip of her tea.

                        There will never be a time in this

                        I’m sorry.

                        You know I didn’t mean it.  

           Terence comes clean, or at least as clean as he can.

                        They brought someone in from New 
                        York who I’m working with to catch 
                        the guys who killed Vernon.

           Allison smiles.

                                 ALLISON
                        That’s what you wanted.  You’re 
                        working to bring Vernon’s killers 
                        to justice.

           She can see that it’s not all he’d hoped it would be.

                        But...

                                 TERENCE
                        This guy isn’t an agent.  He’s an 
                        informant.  I’m assuming he’s in 
                        the Mafia up in New York.

                                 ALLISON
                        Why would you think that?

           Simple.

                                 TERENCE
                        One look at him.

           To make matters worse, though...

                        When we stopped over in Mobile, we

           So?

           If Allison was scared before, she’s terrified now.

                        And you think your Mafia informant

           Allison’s had enough.

                                 ALLISON
                        Don’t do this, Terence.  Just tell 
                        them you can’t.  Tell them you 
                        want to go back to the file room.  
                        Whatever you need to do.  Because 
                        this isn’t not who you are.  It’s 
                        not who you’re supposed to be.

           As much as she’d like Terence to step away from this, she 
           knows he never will.  So she’s not surprised when he 
           doesn’t even acknowledge what she just said.

                                 TERENCE
                        I need you to go to Cynthia’s in

                                 ALLISON
                        We’re a family now, Terence.  And 
                        this family needs you.

                                 TERENCE
                        I love you.

           And then he shuts the door and watches her drive away.

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - DAY

           Terence and Scarpa, both with hats pulled low over their 
           heads and the collars of their jackets turned up, sit in 
           a car outside of the OAK GROVE DAIRY, a local milk 
           manufacturing facility.

           Their eyes are focused on the front door.

           Billy Roy Pitts, one of the men from the V.F.W. who 
           approached Terence that night, exits.

           He’s dressed in an Oak Grove Dairy uniform.

                                 TERENCE
                        Billy Roy Pitts.

           Billy Roy heads over to his FORD TRUCK, gets inside and 
           starts to pull away.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Billy Roy Pitts.  Klan.  Nervous.  
                        Talks too much.  And for whatever 
                        reason, he doesn’t hate us as much 
                        as all the other guys do.  

           Terence follows behind him at a safe distance.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        In this chain, Billy Roy’s the 
                        weak link.
           EXT. BILLY ROY PITTS’S HOUSE - DAY

           As Billy Roy pulls up in front of his small, decrepit 
           house, he’s greeted by a BARKING DOG.

           He bends down and pets the dog, lets him lick his face.

           Billy Roy goes inside.

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

           Terence and Scarpa are about a block away.

           Scarpa points to the curb.

                                 SCARPA
                        Pull up there.

           Terence does as he’s told.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        These things always work better 
                        when they’re a surprise.  Keeps 
                        ‘em off-balance,

           Terence sees Scarpa pull his gun out from under the seat.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I like to be prepared.

                                 TERENCE
                        For what?

                                 SCARPA
                        Anything.

           EXT. BILLY ROY PITTS'S HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER

           As Terence and Scarpa SNEAK AROUND THE BACK OF THE HOUSE, 
           they see Billy Roy, boiling some potatoes on his stove.

           They’re trying to be as quiet as possible, but suddenly, 
           the DOG spies them and immediately starts BARKING.  

           He MAKES A BEE-LINE for Scarpa, but before he gets to 
           him, Terence sees a stick nearby.  

           He GRABS IT and THROWS it as far as he can. 

           The dog, being a dog, chases it.
           INT. BILLY ROY PITTS’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

           Billy Roy is still at his stove when his BACK DOOR IS 
           KICKED OPENED by SCARPA.  Terence follows behind him.

           Billy Roy reaches for a knife.

           Scarpa already has his gun out and pointed at him.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (to Billy Roy)
                        You don’t wanna do that, sugar pie 
                        honey bunch.

           Billy Roy puts down the knife.

           INT. BILLY ROY PITTS’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Terence and Scarpa sit across from Billy Roy.

                                 SCARPA
                        What’d you do to Vernon Dahmer?

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Nothin’.    

           Billy Roy has already sweat through his shirt.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS (CONT’D)
                        Just like I told those other 
                        F.B.I. guys.

                                 SCARPA
                        We’re not those guys.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Who are you then?

           Without any warning at all, Scarpa rears back and SLAPS 
           THE SHIT out of Billy Roy, sending him FALLING BACKWARD 
           OFF HIS CHAIR and onto the floor.

                                 SCARPA
                        I’m a special fuckin’ agent.

           Terence is shocked but doesn’t do anything.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        On special fuckin’ assignment. 

           Scarpa pulls out his gun.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Or some fancy-soundin’ shit like 
                        that.

           He points it at Billy Roy.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Basically, it translates to, I 
                        don’t have any problem at all 
                        putting a bullet in your empty 
                        fuckin’ head.

           Billy Roy starts to panic.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        I don’t know anythin’!  I swear!

           Scarpa places his gun on the table, picks Billy Roy up 
           off the floor and THROWS HIM AGAINST THE CABINETS, which 
           SHATTER and FALL OFF THE WALL.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (to Billy Roy)
                        You know something, Billy Roy.  I 
                        can smell it on you.

           Terence continues to watch.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                                 (to Billy Roy)
                        Or did you just piss yourself?

           Scarpa THROWS ANOTHER PUNCH into Billy Roy’s jaw, and his 
           KNEES BUCKLE.  But Scarpa holds him up by his collar. 

           Suddenly, the DOG COMES RUNNING into the house. 

           He ATTACHES himself to Scarpa’s leg.  Growling and 
           bearing his teeth. 

           Without a second thought, Scarpa grabs his gun and SHOOTS 
           THE DOG IN THE HEAD.  

           He’s dead.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Boone!

           Billy Roy collapses on the floor next to his dead dog.

                                 SCARPA
                        Boone!

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Scarpa blows on his swollen knuckles.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Boone.  Even the dogs down here 
                        got country fuckin’ names.

           Billy Roy is devastated.  Tears well up in his eyes.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Boone.

           Scarpa gets down next to Billy Roy.

                                 SCARPA
                        Vernon Dahmer.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        You killed my fuckin’ dog!

           Scarpa grabs a knife off the counter and sticks the BLADE 
           INTO THE STOVE’S FLAMES.

                                 SCARPA
                        That was just a start.

           Terence continues to watch in amazement.  He can’t 
           totally believe what he’s seeing.

           As the blade glows red hot, Scarpa pulls Billy Roy up off 
           the floor again.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        What’d you do to Vernon Dahmer?

           He raises the searingly hot blade to Billy Roy’s face. 

           He’s about to press it into his flesh when Terence GRABS 
           his arm.

                                 TERENCE
                        No.

           Scarpa looks at Terence.

                                 SCARPA
                        You fight fire with fire.

           But Terence has had enough.

                                 TERENCE
                        We’re leaving.

           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SCARPA
                        I told you how this works.

           Their eyes meet, and Terence says it again.

                                 TERENCE
                        We’re leaving.

           Scarpa looks at Terence for a long beat and then...

                                 SCARPA
                                 (to Terence)
                        This is why things down here don’t 
                        ever change for you people.  No 
                        heart.

           Scarpa throws the knife across the room and it sticks in 
           the wall.  Right next to Billy Roy’s head.

           Scarpa exits, leaving Terence behind.

           Terence stares down at Billy Roy, who’s still kneeling 
           next to his dead dog.  It almost looks like Terence is 
           about to apologize but before he can, Billy Roy looks up 
           at him and with tears in his eyes...

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Fuck you, nigger.

           And with that, Terence leaves.

           EXT. STREET - A MINUTE LATER

           Terence heads to the car where Scarpa is waiting for him.  

           As Terence approaches, without so much as a word, Scarpa 
           REARS BACK and THROWS A RIGHT into Terence’s face.

                                 SCARPA
                        Don’t ever tell me what to do.

           And just like that, IT’S ON. 

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I’m a gun for hire.  

           A HOOK to Terence’s ribs.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        A goddamn soldier of fortune.

           These two go toe-to-toe.  

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t answer to you.

           And for the first thirty seconds or so, it’s a pretty 
           close fight.  They TRADE SHOTS with no one getting the 
           upper hand. 

           But after about a minute, it becomes clear that Terence 
           is the better fighter.  His punches are sharper, crisper.

                                 TERENCE
                        I don’t stand by and watch people 
                        hurt people.  No matter who they 
                        are.

           And his defense is even more impressive.  He BLOCKS most 
           of Scarpa’s blows.

                                 SCARPA
                        Yeah.  You do.  That’s why I’m 
                        here.  Cuz you ain’t doin’ shit to 
                        help your own people.

           Terence starts to beat the ever-loving shit out of the 
           infamous hitman.  JABS, HOOKS, CROSSES...  They all land.

           Finally, after getting his ass handed to him for long 
           enough, Scarpa TACKLES Terence.  They both hit the ground 
           hard, but Scarpa is able to get on top of Terence.

           He’s about to start raining down blows when he realizes 
           that he’s completely fuckin’ gassed.  

           He’s got nothin’ left.

           He collapses next to Terence.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        They brought me back down here 
                        because I’ll do things you won’t.

           Scarpa reaches in to his mouth to check on loose teeth.

                                 TERENCE
                        What does that mean, brought you 
                        back down here?

           Terence touches his ribs.  They hurt like hell.

                                 SCARPA
                        You want to catch the guys that 
                        murdered your friend?

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                                 TERENCE
                        I do.

                                 SCARPA
                        Then let me do what I do.  

           Scarpa wipes blood from his nose.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        And stay the fuck out of my way.

           As they talk, Billy Roy, exits his house, gets in his 
           truck and tears out of his driveway.

           Terence and Scarpa get into the Chevy and follow him.

           EXT. V.F.W. POST - TWO MINUTES LATER

           Billy Roy’s truck skids to a stop outside the V.F.W.

           He runs inside.

           Terence and Scarpa pull up just down the block.

           INT. V.F.W. POST - LATER

           Like most of these “posts”, this spot is nothing more 
           than a glorified bar.

           A black and white TV plays reruns of “Your Show of 
           Shows”.

           Billy Roy sits at a table with Charles Clifford Wilson, 
           Lawrence Byrd, Sam Bowers and a FEW OTHER WHITE GUYS (in 
           their thirties, forties and fifties, respectively).

                                 SAM BOWERS
                        What kind of accent did he have?

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Shit, Sam!  I don’t know!  An 
                        accent of someone who’s not from 
                        around here?!  

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        You gotta do better than that.  
                        That ain’t shit to go on.

           Billy Roy thinks.

                        I don’t know.

           And then he looks up at the television where SID CAESAR 
           is playing a mad professor.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS (CONT’D)
                        He sounded like that!

           ON THE TELEVISION, Sid Caesar rolls his eyes.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS (CONT’D)
                        The fuckin’ guy sounded like Sid 
                        Caesar!

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        He sounded like a Jew.

           Bowers has a slightly more nuanced take.

                                 SAM BOWERS
                        New York.

           Meanwhile, Billy Roy is beside himself.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        He shot Boone!  Right there on my 
                        kitchen floor!

           Bowers is deep in thought as Byrd gets the details.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        And the nigger F.B.I. agent was 
                        there too.

           Billy Roy nods his head.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD (CONT’D)
                        You tell ‘em anything, Billy Roy?

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        Course not, Byrd!

           Bowers speaks.

                                 SAM BOWERS 
                        Couple years back, when they came 
                        lookin’ for the two kikes and the 
                        nigger, there was a rumor -- damn 
                        near legend -- that the F.B.I. 
                        brought in a guy from New York -- 
                        gangster-type -- to work over 
                        Edgar Ray Killen.

                                 SAM BOWERS  (CONT'D)
                        Story goes that this New York guy 
                        beat Killen up and down, left and 
                        right, until he told ‘im about the 
                        bodies being buried in the dam in 
                        Philadelphia. 

           Bowers looks over at Billy Roy.

                                 SAM BOWERS (CONT’D)
                                 (to Billy Roy)
                        Way it was told to me, New York 
                        was the kinda guy, who’d shoot 
                        your dog dead on your kitchen 
                        floor.

           Bowers thinks.

                                 SAM BOWERS (CONT’D)
                        Who was the pizza nigger we dealt 
                        with when we bought the dynamite 
                        and guns from the Marcellos in New 
                        Orleans a while back?

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        Donato.  Frank Donato.

           That’s the guy.

                                 SAM BOWERS
                        See if he knows anything about a 
                        guy from New York being around.  
                        They keep track of each other, the 
                        dagos.

           Byrd nods.

                                 SAM BOWERS (CONT’D)
                                 (to Billy Roy)
                        And you’re right, Billy Roy.  You 
                        don’t know nothin’.  And the more 
                        you keep telling yourself that, 
                        the better off you’ll be.

           OFF BILLY ROY, still mourning his dog...

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - DAY

           Terence and Scarpa watch as Billy Roy exits the V.F.W. 
           post with Bowers, Byrd, Pitts and the rest of the crew.

           The men all circle around Bowers as he talks.

                        The guy in the middle is Sam 
                        Bowers.

                                 SCARPA
                        The boss.

           Byrd is standing closest to Bowers, and whenever he 
           talks, Bowers listens.  More so than when any of these 
           other jokers speak.

                                 TERENCE
                        Klan wasn’t violent enough for 
                        him, so he started his own 
                        version.  We been trying to put 
                        him away for the last five years, 
                        but these juries down here don’t 
                        want to see him go. 

           Scarpa’s eyes are locked on Bowers.

                                 SCARPA
                        I know Bowers.

           Everyone does.

                                 TERENCE
                        Probably from the news.  They 
                        brought him in front of the House 
                        Un-American Activities Committee, 
                        and he took the Fifth. 

           That’s not what he’s talking about.

                                 SCARPA
                        I know him from before.  

           Terence has had enough of all this bullshit.

                                 TERENCE
                        What the hell does that mean?  Why 
                        were you in Mississippi before?

           Bowers and all the other men get into their cars and 
           drive off. 

                                 SCARPA
                        They don’t tell you nothin’, do 
                        they?

           Scarpa looks over at Terence.

                        Bowers is the don, but the top dog 
                        don’t hunt.  We gotta go after the 
                        capo.  The number two.

           Scarpa points at Lawrence Byrd.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Him.  

                                 TERENCE
                        We don’t know for sure that he’s 
                        second-in-command.  No one does.  
                        The Klan keeps their 
                        organizational structure pretty 
                        loose for just this reason.  They 
                        don’t want us to know who’s who.

           Scarpa knows a capo when he sees a capo.

                                 SCARPA
                        He’s our guy.

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - AFTERNOON

           Terence and Scarpa follow Lawrence Byrd as he drives 
           around town.

           He swings by the LAUNDROMAT and picks up his clothes.  

           Then he stops by the GROCERY STORE and grabs a six pack 
           of beer that he cracks open before he even sits back down 
           in his car.

           Finally, he drives down an alley that leads him to the 
           parking lot behind the BYRD ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCES, 
           his own shop in the middle of Hattiesburg.

           He goes inside.

           Terence and Scarpa park nearby.

           EXT. BYRD ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCES - EVENING

           Terence and Scarpa are still here when Byrd leaves and 
           close up the shop for the night.

           CONTINUED:

           Once again, they follow him.

           This time he drives HOME. 

           He exits the car and walks to his front door where he’s 
           greeted by his WIFE AND YOUNG SON.

           Scarpa pulls out his gun.

                                 SCARPA
                        Time to dance.

           No.

                                 TERENCE
                        His wife and a kid are there. 

                                 SCARPA
                        And your friend got burned to 
                        death in front of his wife and 
                        kid.  There’s a nice balance to it 
                        all.

           Scarpa opens his door, but before he can get out, Terence 
           starts to drive away.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?!

           Scarpa tells Terence how it works.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        They’re going to come back at us 
                        for that guy and his fuckin’ dog 
                        today!  And they’re going to come 
                        hard.  We need to hit them first!

                                 TERENCE
                        Not in front of his family.

                                 SCARPA
                        Christ.  Rules.  You actually got 
                        rules.  There are no rules!  
                        That’s the point!  That’s why

                        I’m sitting across from you!

                        I need to talk to Moore.  I told

                        or the highway.

                        tell that powers that be that you 
                        threw in the towel because I 
                        wouldn’t let you torture a guy in 
                        front of his woman and her child.

           Exactly.

                                 TERENCE
                        As long as they don’t know about

           Terence doubles down.

                        You cross the Bureau, they’ll come

                        know it just like I do.

           Scarpa knows Terence is right.  At least for now.

           They continue up the road.

           EXT. CITYSCAPE - NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA - NIGHT

           We FLY OVER NEW ORLEANS’S FRENCH QUARTER.

           Laissez les bons temps rouler.

           EXT. CARLOS MARCELLO’S COMPOUND - NIGHT

           This massive house in the center of the French Quarter is 
           home to Carlos Marcello, head of the local crime family. 

           INT. CARLOS MARCELLO’S COMPOUND - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           CARLOS MARCELLO (fifties) sits at the head of the table 
           and picks apart a freshly boiled crawfish.

           When all said and done, Carlos Marcello will preside over 
           the New Orleans branch of the Mafia for over thirty 
           years.  During that time, he will be implicated in crimes 
           ranging from insurance fraud to the Kennedy 
           assassination.  He will also be responsible for scores of 
           killings, kidnappings and robberies.

           Simply put, you don’t want to fuck with Carlos.

           Carlos, who’s the only one eating here, is surrounded at 
           the table by various LACKEYS and HEAVIES, but he speaks 
           exclusively to FRANK DONATO (forties).

                        You think this clown in 
                        Hattiesburg is the one who whacked 
                        Marco?

           Frank doesn’t know.

                        Gotta get in his face and see 
                        what’s what.  Might be him.  Might 
                        be some other guy.  Can’t call it.

           Carlos sucks at a crawfish.

                                 CARLOS MARCELLO
                        Don’t bring him back here, Frank.  
                        I don’t want blood in the Quarter.

           Frank nods at two other guys, and all three of them get 
           up and leave.
           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Terence sits across from Archie and Randy in this diner 
           that’s filled exclusively with African-American patrons.  

                                 TERENCE
                        I’m on this because, if the whole 
                        thing goes wrong, they can hang me 
                        out to dry.  I’ll be some rogue 
                        agent that went off the 
                        reservation.  And no one will ever 
                        believe me about what happened.

           Randy nods.

                                 RANDY
                        They’ll bury it so deep, no one 
                        will even sniff it for fifty 
                        years.

           Archie shares what he knows about Scarpa.

                                 ARCHIE
                        We looked into him and all we know 
                        is that he’s part of the Top 
                        Echelon Informant Program.

                                 RANDY
                        Which means he’s a big fish.

                                 ARCHIE
                        Everything else is classified.

           That’s not much to go on.

                                 TERENCE
                        No idea why he was down here 
                        before.

           Archie offers an alternative.

                                 ARCHIE
                        Maybe he’s lying about that.

           Terence rules that possibility out immediately.

                                 TERENCE
                        He knew Bowers.  And not from 
                        seeing him on the TV or in the 
                        papers.  I could see it on his 
                        face.

           OFF TERENCE, trying to put it all together...
           INT./EXT. FORD GALAXIE - NIGHT

           GRAFTON GRAY (forties, African-American) drives this 
           brand new car up a dark highway.

           Adlena Hamlett, who we met in the beauty salon earlier, 
           sits next to him.  Birdia Keglar and two other AFRICAN-
           AMERICAN WOMEN sit in the backseat.

                                 ADLENA HAMLETT
                        I’m a Sidney Poitier girl.  Always 
                        have been.  Always will be.

                                 BIRDIA KEGLAR
                        I’m with Harry.  I’m a sucker for 
                        any man who can sing and look like 
                        that at the same time.

           As they all laugh, a car pulls up close behind them.  Its 
           headlights are just inches from their rear bumper.

                                 GRAFTON GRAY
                                 (re: the car)
                        What in the-?

           Suddenly, the car VEERS into the lane next to them, 
           SPEEDS UP and SLAMS into their car as hard as it can.

           We hear SCREAMING as the Galaxie RUNS OFF THE ROAD and 
           CRASHES into a COLLECTION OF TREES and CATCHES FIRE. 

           INT. MAURICE ALLEN’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Maurice Allen, who we also saw answering the F.B.I.’s 
           questions, is working underneath a car in his garage.

           We hear the SCREECH OF TIRES out in the street as a car 
           BLASTS past the open doors to the garage.

           As it SPEEDS BY, someone throws a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL that 
           lands in a corner of the space. 

           It EXPLODES in flames.

           INT. TERENCE AND ALLISON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Terence sits at his kitchen table.  And thinks.

           Dahmer.  Bowers.  Byrd.  Scarpa.  So many pieces to this 
           puzzle.

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           And then he hears something.  He gets up and walks to the 
           front of his house.

           BA-BOOM!  He DIVES for cover as his front windows are 
           BLOWN OUT by SHOTGUN BLASTS.

           BA-BOOM!  BA-BOOM!  More shot sprays across the room.  

           As his house is torn apart, Terence crawls over to a 
           nearby closet, opens the door and pulls out his own 
           REMINGTON 12-GAUGE.

           Terence pumps it, stands up and RETURNS FIRE.  BOOM!  
           BOOM!  BOOM!

           From where he’s standing, he can see that the ASSAILANTS 
           are RUNNING BACK to a WAITING CAR. 

           Terence rips open his front door...

           EXT. TERENCE AND ALLISON'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Terence FIRES AT THE CAR from his porch.  BOOM!  BOOM!

           But he misses, and the car TEARS AWAY. 

           Terence jumps off his porch, hops into his own car and 
           GIVES CHASE. 

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - CONTINUOUS

           Terence floors it as he chases after what are only 
           taillights in the distance.

           But he’s GAINING ON THEM.

           As he gets closer, one of them leans out a rear window.  

           He’s wearing a mask and he has a SHOTGUN in his hand.

           He FIRES at Terence.  BOOM!

           Terence SWERVES to avoid the incoming blast.

           BOOM!  The masked man FIRES again.  

           Terence STEERS away.

           He’s CLOSING IN, but the road is winding and there are 
           sharp turns.  Needless to say, the Impala doesn’t handle 
           corners all that well. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The CHASE continues.

           They FLY THROUGH a SINGLE-LANE BRIDGE, BOUNCE over a 
           RAILROAD CROSSING...

           And Terence is still there.

           There’s a SLOW-MOVING TRUCK up ahead, and the car uses 
           the opposite lane to pass it.

           But when Terence tries to do the same as he goes AROUND A 
           BEND, he sees ONCOMING CAR heading right for him.

           He PULLS THE WHEEL WILDLY TO THE RIGHT to avoid the 
           collision, but LOSES CONTROL of the car in the process.

           It FISHTAILS back and forth until it VEERS off the road 
           and SPINS OUT on the GRASS SHOULDER.

           The other car has gotten away.

           Terence punches at the steering wheel in anger.  Over and 
           over again.

           EXT. CAMP SHELBY - BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Barracks are barracks.  Small, cramped, ugly.

           INT. CAMP SHELBY - BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Scarpa’s the only one in here.

           He lies on his bed sipping from a bottle of Johnnie 
           Walker as he plays solitaire with a worn deck of cards.

           He sees headlights approaching.

           And then the doors to the barracks are ripped open, 
           revealing Terence, in a rage. 

                                 TERENCE
                        Let’s go.

           INT./EXT. CHEVY IMPALA - NIGHT

           Angry as hell, Terence burns down the road.

                                 TERENCE
                        I don’t know exactly know who you 
                        are, what you do...

                                                              (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Scarpa listens.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Or where you come from, but more 
                        of my people are dead tonight.  

           Terence foot is pushed to the floor.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        And they came to my house to kill 
                        me.  Where I live.  Where my 
                        pregnant wife lives.

           Scarpa looks out the window.

                                 SCARPA
                        Here’s hopin’ it’s a boy.  Every 
                        king needs his prince.

           Terence isn’t passing out cigars.

                                 TERENCE
                        The Bureau put me with you because 
                        they figured I’d just stand by and 
                        watch you do your thing.

           Scarpa sees it differently.

                                 SCARPA
                        No.  They put you with me because 
                        they figured someone who looked 
                        like you would be angry enough to 
                        ride with me.

           Terence turns and faces Scarpa. 

                                 TERENCE
                        You said you came here to do a 
                        job.

           He SKIDS to a stop in front of the V.F.W. post.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do it then. 

           Terence exits the car.

           EXT. V.F.W. POST - CONTINUOUS

           With Scarpa following behind him, Terence makes his way 
           toward the entrance. 

                                                              (CONTINUED)

                        There’s a smart way to do this and 
                        a stupid way.  

           Scarpa grabs Terence.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Once we step in there, we’re not 
                        in control anymore.  We don’t hold 
                        all the cards.  We’re in the belly 
                        of the beast. 

           Terence laughs.

                                 TERENCE
                        This is Mississippi, man.  I been 
                        in the belly of the beast since I 
                        was born.

           He pulls away from Scarpa and heads for the doors. 

           INT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT

           Lawrence Byrd, Charles Clifford Wilson, Billy Roy Pitts

                        That’s private property, nigger.

                                 SCARPA
                        Funny what happens when guys like 
                        you see all your pure blood 
                        spillin’ out on the floor.  You 
                        start talkin’.  Start tellin’.  
                        It’s a beautiful thing.   

           Byrd turns back Terence.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                                 (to Terence)
                        You and yours will never be safe 
                        here.  Not as long as I’m alive.

           Terence points his gun at Byrd.

                                 TERENCE
                        Tempting offer.  

           His finger twitches on the trigger.

           Scarpa pushes Terence’s arm down.

                                 SCARPA
                        No.

           We hear SIRENS in the distance, and Scarpa pulls Terence 
           toward the door.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Gotta go.
           EXT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT

           Terence and Scarpa exit the post, get in their car and 
           drive away just before the police arrive.

           EXT. EVERETT’S BAR - NIGHT

           This small bar is really no more than a shack located in 
           the Mobile-Bouie neighborhood, Hattiesburg’s African-
           American enclave.

           It’s perched next to a small creek.

           A BUNCH OF CARS are parked out in front of the bar, 
           including Terence’s Chevy Impala.

           INT. EVERETT’S BAR - NIGHT

           The bar is crowded.  Scarpa’s the only white guy in here, 
           and he’s catching some wary looks. 

           He and Terence sit at a small table off to the side.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (re: the bar)
                        They don’t like me in here. 

                                 TERENCE
                        They don’t like me much either.

           Terence takes a pull off his drink.

                        So the Bureau brought you to 
                        Mississippi for Schwerner, Chaney 
                        and Goodman.

           Correct.

                                 SCARPA
                        They couldn’t find the bodies.

           Scarpa drinks too.

                        So I did.

           Terence puts his glass down.

           Scarpa doesn’t speak of his methods.

                                 SCARPA
                        Look, this thing’s starting to get 
                        stupid.  Too out in the open.  Too 
                        exposed.  And if it goes off the 
                        rails, the Bureau’s washing their 
                        hands of me.  I’m the first 
                        fuckin’ write-off.  The goddamn 
                        cost of doing business.

           Scarpa’s had enough.

                        This isn’t my fight.

                        What about what you said in there?

                        spillin’ and those guys doing some 
                        tellin’?

           Scarpa waves all that off.

                                 SCARPA
                        That’s just tough guy talk.  Shit 
                        you say in the heat of the moment.  
                        Makin’ muscles.  Doesn’t mean 
                        nothin’.  

           Terence can tell that Scarpa’s about to bail.

                        You walk away from this, I’ll make

                        for the guy you murdered in

                        much shit on them?

           Scarpa’s still not sure what to make of Terence.

           Scarpa gets up and heads for the door.

           But we STAY WITH TERENCE, who looks down at his watch and 
           then glances out the window just as TWO OF MARCELLO’S 
           GUYS escort Scarpa to a sedan where Frank Donato waits. 

           Terence looks closely and sees one of these guys has a 
           GUN pressed into Scarpa’s back.

           EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT

           Terence is on a pay phone across the street from the BEST 
           NIGHT MOTEL.

           Moore and Rhodes are huddled around the speaker phone.

                        There’s three of them, and they 
                        have Louisiana plates on their 
                        car.

           Rhodes mouths the word, “Marcello” to Moore, who nods.

           Scarpa is on the floor, chained to a pipe in the bathroom 
           as he’s worked over by the heavies who grabbed him.

                        bought some guns off us to kill

                        That was coldblooded murder, 
                        Terence.

                                 TERENCE
                        I know what it was.  But right 
                        now, I’m focused on what it takes.

           He looks over at his friends.

                        What it takes to get justice.

                        If that was justice in that motel 
                        room, we’re all going to hell.

                                 TERENCE
                        Tell that to the Klan.

                        We all joined the Bureau so we 
                        could enforce the law, not break 
                        it.

           Now it’s Terence’s turn to call out the hypocrisy.

                                 TERENCE
                        The Bureau’s the one that

                        Him down here.  And this isn’t the 
                        first time.  They used him for 
                        Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman too.

           Fuck.

                        He worked Edgar Ray Killen until 
                        he gave up the bodies.  Scarpa -- 
                        that guy right there! -- cracked 
                        the fuckin’ case!

           Randy and Archie are speechless for a beat.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes to get justice, you have 
                        to break the law.

           Randy and Archie’s eyes meet.

                                 ARCHIE
                        There’s a law bigger than the 
                        Bureau.  Bigger than Hoover.  
                        Bigger than President Johnson.  
                        That’s the law I answer to.

                                 RANDY
                        We all do.

           Archie throws his gun into the river.

                                 ARCHIE
                        We weren’t here, Terence.  

           Randy throws his gat into the water as well.

                                 ARCHIE (CONT’D)
                        We had nothing to do with any of 
                        this.

           And with that, Randy and Archie head back to their car.

           EXT. BYRD ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCES - DAY

           Driving a FORD FAIRLANE, Lawrence Byrd takes a turn into 
           the alley next to his shop. 

           EXT. REAR PARKING LOT - DAY

           Byrd exits his car, opens the backdoor to his store and 
           walks inside.

           INT. BYRD ELECTRONICS AND APPLIANCES - AFTERNOON

           Byrd sits in his shop and works on a Sylvania television.

           The bell on the door chimes, and Billy Roy Pitts walks 
           in.

           Byrd looks ups.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        You hear anything?

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        They grabbed him at Everett’s last 
                        night.

           Billy Roy nods.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD (CONT’D)
                        He won’t be bothering us anymore.

                                 BILLY ROY PITTS
                        What about the F.B.I.?

                        They got jackshit.  If they did, 
                        they wouldn’t have brought this 
                        from New York.  He’s the hail 
                        Mary.  The shot in the dark.

           Billy Roy checks out a Westinghouse television.

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        More than you can afford.
           EXT. REAR PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Byrd exits his shop and locks it up for the night.

           He heads to his car and, as he puts the key in the door, 
           a BLACK HOOD is thrown over his head, and he’s slammed up 
           against the car.

           Scarpa puts a gun to his head.

                                 SCARPA
                        Make a fuckin’ noise, and I’ll 
                        kill you right here.

           Terence pulls up in the Impala and Scarpa throws Byrd 
           into the back. 

           He gets in next to him.

           The car speeds off.

           EXT. SHACK - EVENING

           Terence’s Chevy is parked outside this small wooden house 
           in the middle of fuckin’ nowhere.

           INT. SHACK - SAME

           Byrd is bound to a chair in this dirty, decrepit space.

           Scarpa looms over him as Terence stands off to the side. 

                                 LAWRENCE BYRD
                        You think you gonna do me like you 
                        did Edgar Ray Killen?  Because 
                        everyone knows Edgar Ray was a 
                        pussy. 

           Scarpa rolls up his sleeves. 

                                 SCARPA
                        That sounds like a challenge.

           THUD!  Scarpa punches Byrd RIGHT IN THE FACE.  

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I love challenges.

           Byrd’s nose EXPLODES with BLOOD.

           THUD!  THUD!  TWO MORE PUNCHES to Byrd’s face. 

           Byrd laughs. 

           Terence watches.  Uneasily.

           THUD!  Byrd’s face is a bloody pulp.  Already.

           THUD!  THUD!  More blows.  Up and down his body.

           Scarpa turns to Terence.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (to Terence, re: 
                                 Byrd)
                        You want some?

           Terence looks at Scarpa and then at Byrd and then...he 
           walks over.

           He takes a beat.  Unsure if he can do it.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        This piece of shit tried to kill 
                        you.  And your family.

           Terence THROWS A STRAIGHT RIGHT into Byrd’s face.  THUD. 

           And then ANOTHER ONE.  And ANOTHER ONE.  

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Feels good, don’t it?

           It does. Of course it does.  It feels great.  

           Until it doesn’t.

           Terence throws ANOTHER PUNCH.  Solid.  Brutal.

           And he’s about to throw another one when BLOOD from his 
           fist SPATTERS ONTO HIS OWN FACE.  

           He stops.  And looks at his hands.  They’re covered in 
           Byrd’s blood.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)

           INT. BEST NIGHT INN - ROOM 111 - NIGHT

           Moore and Rhodes take in the crime scene.  Frank Donato 
           and the other two thugs lie dead on the floor.

                        been here since last night.

           Moore sees the unlocked chains in the bathroom. 

                                 SPECIAL AGENT MOORE
                        Scarpa.

                        He didn’t get out of this on his 
                        own.

           Moore nods.

           EXT. SHACK - NIGHT

           Terence stands outside the shack and uses a rag to clean 
           the blood off his hands.

           He HEARS BYRD’S SCREAMS coming from inside.

           INT. SHACK - NIGHT

           Scarpa takes a burning cigarette and extinguishes it on 
           Byrd’s bare chest.

           Byrd YELLS.

                                 SCARPA
                        Imagine what it felt like for 
                        Vernon Dahmer as his lungs burned 
                        to a crisp inside his body.

           Byrd’s chest is covered in marks from cigarettes. 

           His face is swollen.  Misshapen.  Grotesque. 

           He’s only in boxer shorts.  The rest of his clothes have 
           been removed.

           Scarpa pulls out a razor blade.  It’s rusty.  Old.

                                                              (CONTINUED)

           He puts the sharp end of the blade to Byrd’s shoulder and 
           CUTS DOWN the length of his arm, all the way to his hand.

           More SCREAMING.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I know Bowers gave the word.  Who 
                        pulled the trigger?

           Scarpa smiles.  He’s enjoying this.  Too much.

           He’s in his element, and for the first time, we really 
           see the depth of his depravity and sadism.

           The Killing Machine.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        I can do this all night.

           He uses the blade to cut Byrd’ arm again. 

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t say the same for you.

           And then he SLICES Byrd’s chest wide open.

           EXT. SHACK - NIGHT

           Terence hears more SCREAMING. 

           He heads back inside.

           INT. SHACK - NIGHT

           Terence walks in to see Byrd looking like his entire body 
           has been dipped in blood.  He’s covered from head-to-toe.

           He’s passed out from the pain so Scarpa takes a BUCKET OF 
           WATER and throws it on him.

           Byrd’s eyes open wide.

                                 SCARPA
                        We don’t take breaks, 
                        motherfucker.

           Byrd is barely coherent.

           Scarpa takes out his gun and -- BOOM! -- SHOOTS BYRD in 
           the foot.  He SHRIEKS in pain.

           Terence watches.

           And then Scarpa SHOVES HIS GUN INTO BYRD’S MOUTH. 

                                 SCARPA
                        Tell me what I want to know, or 
                        I’m going to blow your fuckin’ 
                        head off!

           Byrd is choking on the barrel of the gun.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Talk, motherfucker!

           From across the room...

                        Scarpa.

           Scarpa does not hear him at first.  

           He’s too focused on Byrd.

                                 SCARPA
                        Motherfucker, I will cut you up 
                        and mail back pieces of you to 
                        your kid for Christmas!

           BOOM!  A bullet FLIES by SCARPA’S HEAD.

           He turns and sees Terence with his gun pointed at him. 

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                                 (to Terence)
                        This shit again.

           Scarpa is tired of Terence’s back and forth.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Make up your mind already.  You in 
                        or out?

           Terence keeps the gun trained on Scarpa.

                        believe that you’d kill me?

           Fair point.

                                 TERENCE
                        Walk away.  I’ll tell the Bureau 
                        that you tried, but he wouldn’t 
                        give it up.

                        guy, we rounded a corner we can’t 
                        go back around.  Believe me.  You 
                        ever want to feel safe in 
                        Mississippi again, you and yours 
                        want me to finish this.

           Terence doesn’t see it that way.

                                 TERENCE
                        Just go, Scarpa.  Just get the 
                        fuck out of here.  Please.

           Not gonna happen.

                        You think he’d do the same for 
                        you?  You think if you were 
                        sittin’ there, he’d step in and 
                        save your ass?

                                 TERENCE
                        It’s not about him.  It’s about 
                        me.  And I can’t do this.  I 
                        thought I could, but I can’t.

           Scarpa shakes his head at Terence’s naiveté.

                                 SCARPA
                        Just like a nigger.  So convinced 
                        you’re going to heaven when you’re 
                        dead that you’re willing to go 
                        through hell while you’re still 
                        alive. 

                                 TERENCE
                        It’s not that, Scarpa.  I’m just 
                        not willing to hate myself the way 
                        you hate yourself.

           He points at Byrd.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        The way he hates himself.

           Scarpa doesn’t get it, and he never will.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (re: Byrd)
                        Give him a chance, and he’ll 
                        string up you and your pregnant 
                        wife.  Won’t think twice about it.

           Scarpa explains his “world view” to Terence.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        No war’s ever won without 
                        bloodshed.  But if you’re the one 
                        doing all the bleeding, you can be 
                        goddamned sure you aren’t on the 
                        right end of that fight.  

           But Terence pushes back.

                                 TERENCE
                        Is that what you tell yourself?  
                        That you’re a soldier in some war?  
                        Is that how you justify what you 
                        do?

                                 SCARPA
                        If you were more like me -- if you 
                        thought like I do -- I wouldn’t be 
                        here.

                                 TERENCE
                        But I’m not you.  And I don’t ever 
                        want to be you.

           From the door...

                                 AGENT RHODES (O.S.)
                        Lower your gun, Agent Wayne.

           Terence looks over and sees Rhodes.

                                 AGENT RHODES (CONT’D)
                                 (to Scarpa, re: Byrd)
                        Has he talked?

                                 SCARPA
                        Not yet.

           Terence lets his gun drop to his side.

                                 TERENCE
                                 (to Rhodes, re: Byrd)
                        We need to get him to a hospital, 
                        sir.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        We will.

           He walks over to Byrd.

                                 AGENT RHODES (CONT’D)
                        After he tells us what we need to 
                        know.

           Scarpa grins; Terence tries to protest.

                                 TERENCE
                        Sir-

           Rhodes cuts him off.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        You’re free to leave, Agent Wayne.  
                        We’ll finish up without you.

           He turns to Scarpa.

                                 AGENT RHODES (CONT’D)
                                 (to Scarpa)
                        Where were we?

           THUD!  Scarpa punches Byrd in the solar plexus.

                                 AGENT RHODES (CONT’D)
                                 (to Byrd)
                        I was there for Edgar Ray Killen, 
                        Mr. Byrd.

           CONTINUED: (5)

           Terence watches Scarpa SLUG Byrd again.  And AGAIN.

           Byrd is crying now.  His blood is mixed with tears.

                                 BYRD
                        Please.  Please.

           But they’re not hearing him.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        You don’t want to end up like 
                        Edgar Ray.

           Terence is still standing there as Scarpa takes the 
           barrel of his gun and pushes it into Byrd’s crotch.

                                 SCARPA
                                 (to Byrd)
                        Time we make sure there aren’t 
                        anymore of you that’re born into 
                        this world. 

           He pulls back the gun’s hammer.

                                 BYRD
                        Bowers.

           Scarpa leans in.

                                 SCARPA
                        What’d you say?

                                 BYRD
                        It was Bowers.

           Scarpa looks at Rhodes and then over at Terence.

                                 AGENT RHODES
                        Keep talking.

           This is it.  They’ve won.  This confession is what it’s 
           all been about.  

           But then why is Terence is sick to his stomach?

           As they give Byrd some water, Terence takes out his badge 
           and places it on the floor along with his gun.  

           And with that, he leaves.
           EXT. SHACK - LATE NIGHT

           Terence gets into his car and drives off into the 
           Mississippi night.

           EXT. TERENCE AND ALLISON'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Terence hits at the heavy bag in front of his house.  
           He’s worked up a sweat.  Puttin’ in that work. 

           A SEDAN pulls up, and Scarpa emerges from the front 
           passenger’s side door.

           Terence sees him and stops swinging.

           Scarpa rubs at his jaw as he approaches Terence.

                                 SCARPA
                        I’ve felt that right cross.  I 
                        know how that bag feels.

           Terence doesn’t react.  Stoic.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Wanted to say good-bye.

           There’s a beat of silence between them.  And then...

                                 TERENCE
                        Did he-

           Terence can’t even bring himself to finish the sentence.

                                 SCARPA
                        He talked.  Hell.  He sang.  Gave 
                        up everything.

           Scarpa takes a swing at the bag himself. 

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Should hang one of these in my 
                        garage in Staten Island.

           Scarpa takes another swing and then turns to Terence.

                                 SCARPA (CONT’D)
                        Heard you’re quitting the Bureau.

           That’s right.

                        I appreciate you gettin’ me out of

           Terence cuts him off.

                                 TERENCE
                        I won’t.

                        You say that now, yet here I am.  
                        Down in Mississippi.  Fighting 
                        this war.  Helping you out.

                                 TERENCE
                        You came down here to help 
                        yourself, Scarpa.

           Terence makes it plain.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        That’s what you don’t get.  The 
                        war I’m fighting?  It’s for a 
                        cause bigger than me.  It’s for an 
                        idea.  A principle.  A truth.  And 
                        I’m standing shoulder-to-shoulder 
                        with millions of people just like 
                        me, who believe what I believe.

           Scarpa listens.

                        But you’re the only soldier in 
                        your fight.  It’s a one-man war.

           He’s not wrong, and Scarpa knows it.

                        Real justice won’t ever come out 
                        the barrel of a gun.  

           Scarpa begs to differ.

                                 SCARPA
                        Fifty years from now, someone just 
                        like Sam Bowers will be saying the 
                        same shit he says and doing the 
                        same shit he does.

                                 TERENCE
                        And I’ll be better than that guy 
                        too.

           Terence’s eyes meet Scarpa’s.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Just like I’m better than you.

           Scarpa stares back at Terence for a long beat.

                                 SCARPA
                        The good guys don’t always win.  

                                 TERENCE
                        But the bad guys don’t win until 
                        the good guys say they do.

           Scarpa smiles sadly. 

                                 SCARPA
                        Take care of yourself, Terence.

           And then he walks back toward the car and gets inside.

           As the sedan pulls away, Terence starts pounding on the 
           heavy bag again.

                        The message here is clear.  The

                        There is no place in American 
                        society for prejudice and

                        as a means to further your hateful

           EXT. F.B.I. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Back on the steps, Moore finishes up his speech.

                        law to bear on your person and

           responsible for the murder of over sixty people.

           F.B.I.’s Top Echelon Informant program and provided 
           information that led to countless arrests and 
           convictions.

           EXT. TERENCE AND ALLISON'S HOUSE - DAY

           A long table has been set up outside of Terence’s house 
           with a banner across it that reads, “If You Don’t Vote, 
           You Don’t Count.  Register To Vote Today.” 

           Allison sits behind the table with a few others and they 
           assist the long line of people who have come to make 
           their voices heard.

           Terence, holding his baby son, hands out glasses of 
           lemonade to the people waiting in line.

                                 TERENCE
                        Glad you could come out.

           He smiles as he mingles with his neighbors.

                                 TERENCE (CONT’D)
                        Good to see you!

           The sun is out.  There’s not a cloud in the sky.

           And people from all corners of Hattiesburg are here to 
           help.  Black and white alike.  

           They’re here to make their voices heard.  To take a 
           stand.  To fight for justice.

           It’s perfect day.

           A magical day.

           A miraculous day.

           A day filled with hope and promise and optimism.

           There are days like this in Mississippi.

           There are days like this in America.

                                          THE END
