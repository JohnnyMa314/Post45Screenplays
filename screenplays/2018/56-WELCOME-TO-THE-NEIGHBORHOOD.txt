           EXT. PINYON STREET - DAY

           A regal BLUEJAY, feathers the color of a submerged iceberg, 
           sits on a reed-thin branch of an oak tree. The bird cocks its 
           head, then suddenly flies off.

           Its departure shakes the branch, causing a LEAF to fall.

           We descend with it, gliding from side to side in the gentle 
           breeze until finally we come to rest on the lap of a BABY BOY 
           in a stroller.

           The little lad blinks, startled by this new object. Then, 
           because he’s a baby, he puts the leaf in his mouth.

                                 MARSHA (O.C.)
                        Jackson! Give me that! 

           Wise to her baby, the woman pushing the stroller reaches into 
           frame and liberates the leaf.

           Mom’s name is MARSHA. She’s about twenty-five, no makeup, 
           docile brown eyes, a chunky green sweater and sensible 
           sneakers. She seems likable by dint of her averageness. She’s 
           been a bridesmaid a thousand times, but never maid of honor.

           Marsha is pushing the baby down a tranquil residential 
           street. Big leafy trees, cottages and bungalows and arts-and-
           crafts style homes.

           Yes, the neighborhood is blue collar. Lawns are overgrown. 
           Cars banged up. Houses in need a fresh coat. But it’s shot in 
           such a way -- saturated colors, gauzy light, slight slow 
           motion -- that the locale appears a bit dreamy. 

           SUPER: SOMEWHERE IN PORTLAND, 1993

           As she moves on through the charming little street, she waves 
           at TOM -- sixties, “WW2 Veteran” hat and flannels, missing 
           one front tooth -- who is walking his dog.

                                 TOM
                        Hey there, Marsha! How’s little Jax 
                        doing?

                                 MARSHA
                        Hi, Tom! He’s a handful!

           Tom chuckles knowingly. He’s raised a few himself.

                                 TOM
                        They all are, aren’t they?
           Marsha smiles good-naturedly. Keeps pushing the stroller 
           along, spotting her neighbors. Smiling and waving at all of 
           them. As she does, we see in DREAMY CUTS:

           -A WOMAN, seventies, her hair in rollers, checking on her 
           tomato plant in the front yard.

           -A FATHER, thirties, purple polo shirt tucked into jeans, 
           playing wiffle ball with his TODDLER DAUGHTER.

           -A TEENAGE SON, gangly, red-headed, wearing a Clyde Drexler 
           basketball jersey, washing his dad’s Bronco in the driveway.

           And everyone waves back. Exchanges pleasantries. Coos at baby 
           Jackson. It’s a tight-knit, grungy, Norman Rockwell place.

           But Norman Rockwell paintings never had --

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Oh please help me! Please will 
                        somebody HELP ME!

           ANGLE: A WOMAN staggers down the stairs of a two-story 
           colonial. Brown hair matted with sweat, eyes wide and bright 
           with fear. Her wrists bound with duct tape. Blood drips down 
           her arm and torso from a horrible bite wound in her shoulder.

           The bleeding woman limps into the street. Makes a bee-line 
           for Tom the dog-walker.

                                 BLEEDING WOMAN
                        Please, they’re coming!

           Tom makes no effort to help. He doesn’t even move.

           No one does.

           The whole neighborhood, everyone we saw, just stares. They 
           say nothing. Do nothing.

           The bleeding woman looks up at Tom’s wooden face. Slowly it 
           dawns on her that he isn’t going to lift a pinkie to help.

                                 BLEEDING WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        What is wrong with you? You’ve got 
                        to help --

           Before she can finish, TWO FIGURES emerge from the colonial. 
           They wear hazmat suits, rubber gloves, and gas masks with 
           yellow face plates.

           One of them spots the woman. Nudges his partner.
           On seeing the Hazmat Guys, Bleeding Woman SCREAMS! She limps 
           towards the teenager in the basketball jersey.

                                 BLEEDING WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Please, you’ve got to help me!

           The boy stares, face like a granite cliff.

           ANGLE: Hazmat Guys advance with an easy gait. They know no 
           one will help her.

           Bleeding Woman limps on past the teenager, desperate to get 
           away from the Hazmat guys. She moves on to Marsha.

                                 BLEEDING WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           Marsha scoops up Baby Jackson from his stroller, 
           instinctively protective. Backs away. Jackson senses 
           something is wrong. Beings WAILING, adding to the hellish 
           cacophony of the scene.

                                 MARSHA
                             (scolding)
                        You made him cry!
                             (to Jackson)
                        There, there.

           Bleeding Woman stumbles to the ground. Tears stream down her 
           face. She is utterly defeated, knowing this is the end.

                                 BLEEDING WOMAN
                             (softly)
                        They’re gonna kill me, don’t you 
                        understand? They’re gonna kill m-

           ANGLE: Hazmat Guys are within arm’s reach. They brace the 
           Bleeding Woman and drag her back toward the colonial.

           As they do, the woman unleashes a PRIMAL SCREAM!

           The entire neighborhood looks on dispassionately.

           As the screams and howls recede, Marsha begins rocking Baby 
           Jackson. Singing him a song you may remember from your own 
           childhood:

                                 MARSHA
                        Hush little baby don’t say a word, 
                        Momma’s gonna buy you a 
                        mockingbird.
           Once Hazmat Guys have got the woman in the house, the door 
           slams shut. Bleeding Woman’s screams are cut off. All we can 
           hear is:

                                 MARSHA (CONT’D)
                        And if that mockingbird don’t sing, 
                        Momma’s gonna buy you a diamond 
                        ring.

           The neighbors of this nightmarish place gradually resume 
           their activities. Tom walks the poodle. The old woman goes 
           back to her tomato plant. It’s as if nothing has happened.

           And we end on Marsha rocking Jackson back and forth:

                                 MARSHA (CONT’D)
                        And if that diamond ring turns 
                        brass--

           And off this we SMASH CUT TO:

           EST. HAIGHT-ASHBURY - DAY

           Not what you think of when you say “The Haight”. Beautiful 
           Victorian houses painted a hundred different colors. Gleaming 
           luxury cars under leafy trees. Yuppies walking big dogs, 
           enthralled to their phones.

           SUPER: SAN FRANCISCO, 2018

           PETER DANVERS-CHO, early forties, Asian, jogs along a 
           footpath in an Under Armor shirt. Yes, he takes running too 
           seriously. He’s blandly handsome, career-focused, conflict-
           averse. He disappears easily at dinner parties.

           Peter checks his FitBit, then keeps jogging.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DANVERS-CHO HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           A mildly sweaty Peter enters via the front door and takes off 
           his running shoes.

                                 PETER
                        Hello? Marissa?

                                 MARISSA (O.S.)
                        In here!
           Peter moves on...

           INT. DANVERS-CHO HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...through an oddly empty room. No art on the walls. No t.v. 
           No stereo. The couch is wrapped in plastic.

           This family is about to move.

           INT. DANVERS-CHO HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           MARISSA DANVERS-CHO, late thirties, white, Patagonia vest, 
           huge diamond ring on her finger, leans against the kitchen 
           counter, flipping through something on her iPad.

           A control-freak, everything about her seems perfect yet 
           effortless -- hair, makeup, body. Naturally, she’s a 
           nightmare.

           Peter enters --

                                 PETER
                        Toldja I’d get my ten thousand 
                        steps in.

           He comes over and gives her a kiss on the cheek. Then notices 
           what Marissa is looking at.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        God, that water damage.

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s cosmetic. We’ll put up a new 
                        wallpaper there. I’m thinking a 
                        jungle leaf print.

                                 PETER
                        My co-workers think we’re crazy for 
                        buying a fixer. We coulda gotten a 
                        place in much better shape.

                                 MARISSA
                        Peter --

                                 PETER
                        I know, I know. This was the 
                        arrangement. We move for my new 
                        job...

                                 MARISSA
                             (nodding)
                        ...if I get a blank canvas to work 
                        with.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        It might be a little dusty for a 
                        few months, but turning a toad into 
                        a prince is really going to help my 
                        brand. Once I get 30, 40 thousand 
                        followers, that’s when the 
                        sponsorships come in.

           She gets excited, imagining such a day.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        What if Jonathan Adler wanted a 
                        placement -- how amazing would that 
                        be?

           Before Peter can respond to this, his smartwatch buzzes -- a 
           text.

                                 PETER
                             (reading)
                        Movers are confirmed for two.

                                 MARISSA
                        I’ll go see if Lyla’s ready.

           And as Marissa turns for the exit we hear:

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        Lick my taint, bitch.

           INT. DANVERS-CHO HOUSE - LYLA’S ROOM - DAY

           INSERT: A third-person shooter fills the frame. It’s 
           cartoonish, violent. If you don’t recognize it, you’re 
           getting old. It’s Fortnite.

           The CHARACTER, a woman with purple hair, runs around a house 
           with a sniper rifle. Suddenly she spots an ENEMY. Zooms in 
           and headshots him.

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        Ohhhhh, quickscope, motherfucka!

           And now we see the gamer. Twelve, half-Asian/half-white, a 
           streak of bubblegum pink in her hair, headset on. This is 
           LYLA CHO. She’s headstrong, has no filter, and is utterly 
           fearless.

           A combination that can rub some people the wrong way:

                                 LYLA
                        Oh my god, do you have down 
                        syndrome or are you just fucking 
                        terrible at this game?
           Lyla gleefully mashes buttons on her PS4 and gets another 
           kill.

                                 MARISSA (O.C.)
                        Lyla! Was that swearing I heard?

           All the joy vanishes from Lyla’s face as she hears Marissa’s 
           PIERCING VOICE.

                                 LYLA
                             (muttering)
                        Oh, shit.

           ON SCREEN: Lyla’s character is hit with an RPG and dies.

           Marissa enters without so much as a knock. Looks around the 
           room, dismayed at something:

                                 MARISSA
                        You haven’t even started packing!

           Lyla resumes playing. In part to antagonize her step-mom.

                                 LYLA
                        Marissa, it’ll take two seconds.

                                 MARISSA
                        The movers will be here this 
                        afternoon! 

           With that, Marissa goes to the console and yanks out the 
           power cords.

                                 LYLA
                        Hey!

                                 MARISSA
                        Shooting games don’t stimulate 
                        neuron connections in adolescent 
                        brains. It’s in all the literature.

           Lyla glares. She hates this woman. And behind Marissa’s high-
           minded paternalism, we sense the feeling is mutual.

                                 LYLA
                        You’re an android, Marissa.

           Marissa ignores the insult. Begins wrapping the cords.

                                 MARISSA
                        You know, you may find it easier to 
                        make friends if you toned down the 
                        hostility.
                                 LYLA
                        So I can grow up to do weekly 
                        vegetarian dinners with women named 
                        “Zephyr”? Thanks for taking an 
                        interest in my social life. I’m 
                        doing fine.

           Marissa smiles through bloodless lips.

                                 MARISSA
                        Of course you are.

           It’s a bit of zinger, concealed just enough to be denied. But 
           that’s the type of passive-aggressive queen Marissa is.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        We’re leaving at three. Try not to 
                        be later than usual.

           She hands Lyla the cord. Turns for the exit.

           As soon as the door closes, Lyla’s face floods with pain. The 
           barb about her friends stung.

                                 LYLA
                             (muttering)
                        Bitch.

           EXT. DANVERS-CHO HOUSE - FRONT STEPS - DAY

           Later.

           Peter and Marissa carry a large suitcase down the stairs of 
           their Victorian house to a gleaming cherry-red Tesla Model S 
           parked in the driveway. They’re mid conversation:

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s not just a diet, Peter, it’s a 
                        consciously chosen lifestyle. And 
                        I’m talking about a pattern, here.  
                        She’s constantly rude. Constantly 
                        belittling.

                                 PETER
                        I’m sure she didn’t mean it. 
                        Besides, she’s sensitive about the 
                        friends thing.

                                 MARISSA
                        I was trying to be helpful. You 
                        told me she used to have lots of 
                        friends.
                                 PETER
                        She did, it’s just -- she changed a 
                        lot when...

           Peter trails off. Whatever it is, it’s hard to say.

                                 MARISSA
                        I can’t possibly understand how 
                        hard it was for her. Or you.
                             (then)
                        But that was four years ago. How 
                        much longer can we excuse her 
                        behavior? She needs to move on too.

           We’ll learn more about “four years ago” later. For now, Peter 
           thinks, then nods in agreement.

                                 PETER
                        Once we get to Portland, I’ll sit 
                        her down. Talk about her attitude.

           INT. DANVERS-CHO HOUSE - LYLA’S ROOM - DAY

           Later that day. Most of the things in Lyla’s room are now in 
           cardboard boxes.

           Lyla is now packing up the last shelf of her bookcase, 
           reaching for her impressive collection of video games. She 
           grabs a Call of Duty, a GTA V ... 

           And something slips from between the cases and flutters to 
           the ground. 

           A PHOTO. One of those 4-part photo booth print-outs you do 
           with friends at the mall. In it, a YOUNGER LYLA laughs with a 
           few girls her age.

           Lyla stares at it, looking like she might smile and cry at 
           the same time. For whatever reason, seeing it is bittersweet.

           This moment is interrupted by Marissa’s shriek:

                                 MARISSA (O.S.)
                        Lyla! Where are you? We’re already 
                        seven minutes late!

           EXT. DANVERS-CHO HOUSE - FRONT STEPS - DAY

           Lyla comes out of the house with a small suitcase. She drags 
           it down each of the steps -- CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK. Each one 
           grates at Marissa.

                                 MARISSA
                        Ready to go?
           Lyla ignores Marissa. Puts the suitcase in the trunk and 
           slides into the backseat. As she reaches for the door --

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        No slamming, please!

           Lyla SLAMS the door shut with a grin, off which we go to...

           I/E. PETER’S TESLA / PORTLAND ROADS - DRIVING - NIGHT

           The Tesla motors along a busy thoroughfare through the heart 
           of Portland. A “Feel the Bern” bumper sticker on the back.

           In the distance we can make out the “White Stag -- Portland” 
           sign and the “Old Town” water tower.

           IN THE CAR

           Peter drives; Marissa is flipping through photos on her iPad. 
           Lyla sits in the back, staring out the window. The scene is 
           mostly shot in her POV as we hear Marissa and Peter talk:

                                 MARISSA
                        Looking at these photos again, I 
                        think this house has great bones.

                                 PETER
                        I’m just glad we can stop renting.

           Lyla looks out the window. As the world rolls by she sees hip 
           coffee shops advertising pour-overs. Condos under 
           construction. A gelato shop.

           Signs of gentrification everywhere.

                                 MARISSA
                        Yeah it’s a bit rough -- but 
                        remember, we’re getting in at the 
                        ground floor.

           Still in Lyla’s POV we see a Lebanese fusion restaurant. 
           Homes with those horizontal wooden fences. Homeless people 
           outside their tents.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        We can get an open-floor concept 
                        kitchen. Pergola in the yard.

                                 PETER
                        That’s great, I like that.

           Peter turns back to Lyla.
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What about you, kiddo? Excited for 
                        the new house?

           But something has caught Lyla’s eye out the window. It’s a 
           big BANNER hanging outside a run-down apartment building: 
           “GENTRIFICATION IS URBAN COLONIZATION”.

                                 LYLA
                        Hey dad, what’s gentrification?

           Peter and Marissa exchange a look. Where did she hear about 
           that?

                                 PETER
                        Uh, it’s --

                                 MARISSA
                        PETER!!!

           At that the camera CRASH ZOOMS IN on the figure of a man 
           standing in the middle of the road. He’s growing larger and 
           larger through the glass, about to be hit --

                                 PETER
                        Oh SHIT!

           Peter SLAMS the brakes!

           Lyla JOLTS forward --

           Marissa’s iPad goes flying into the windshield --

           The man doesn’t dive out of the way --

           There’s a horrible CA-CHUNK noise as the brakes struggle 
           against the wheels --

           And the car comes to rest a half a foot from the guy.

           Inside the car, everyone breathes heavily. Peter turns to the 
           backseat:

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           Lyla nods. Peter turns to Marissa, but before he can ask if 
           she’s okay --

                                 VAGRANT (O.C.)
                        What the fuck man!

           The guy they almost killed approaches Peter’s window.
           The VAGRANT is twenties going on fifties, mostly due to meth. 
           Matted hair, missing one front tooth, a “Cut Here” tattoo 
           across his neck. Someone you cross the street to avoid.

           Peter looks around, frazzled by the whole experience.

                                 PETER
                        Tesla, roll down the driver’s 
                        window.

           On voice command, Peter’s window rolls down. It seems to take 
           a painfully long time to happen.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, I didn’t see you!

                                 MARISSA
                        You came out of nowhere!

                                 VAGRANT
                        I was right there the whole time!

           He’s getting in Peter’s face. Aggressive. Scary.

                                 VAGRANT (CONT’D)
                        You can’t just go wherever the fuck 
                        you want, man!

                                 PETER
                        I’m so sorry -- are you hurt? Can I 
                        ... give you some money?

           If anything, this makes the vagrant angrier. He waves away 
           the idea.

                                 VAGRANT
                        Oh, you fucking people -- I don’t 
                        want your money!

           The vagrant has had enough. He shuffles off, giving Peter the 
           bird as he does. Peter exhales, relieved it’s over.

           Marissa glares at the vagrant. Lyla does too.

                                 MARISSA
                        Fucking street people.

                                 PETER
                             (re: Lyla, tone it down)
                        Marissa.

           Lyla chuckles. She’s not used to hearing Marissa curse.
                                 MARISSA
                        Let’s go. The sooner we get off the 
                        road, the better.

           After a beat, the Tesla silently accelerates.

           Lyla looks back at the where the vagrant was. He’s gone. Odd.

                                                                CUT TO:

           E/I. PINYON STREET / PETER’S TESLA - EVENING

           The Tesla swings around a corner and glides down the block.

           Lyla’s got her face pressed up against the glass, taking in 
           the sights of her new home. And what she see is ... spooky.

           The boughs of the trees loom, casting strange shadows. The 
           houses seem to be decaying, overgrown with crawling vines. 
           Rusty cars sit on cinder blocks in cracked driveways. Lawns 
           are more like forests of weeds.

           It all gives off the unsettling sense this place has been 
           abandoned.

           Lyla frowns. Peter and Marissa don’t seem to share her 
           concern.

                                 PETER
                        Here we are, home sweet home!

           The Tesla rolls to a stop in front of the two-story colonial 
           from the cold open.

           Lyla gets out. Regards the new house skeptically.

           It’s the worst of the lot. Paint falling off in long strips. 
           Missing shingles on the roof. A damaged French window BANGS 
           in the wind. Eerie. 

                                 LYLA
                        This is where we’re living?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah -- I mean, it’s different than 
                        SF. But we have a yard. Four 
                        bedrooms. There’s a park nearby.

                                 LYLA
                        Are we in the ghetto?

           Peter laughs -- too quickly.
                                 MARISSA
                        It’s up-and-coming, Lyla. The area 
                        is very unique, culturally.

           Marissa spots husband-and-wife neighbors on a porch next 
           door.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Like those people.

           This is RYAN and CHASTITY STUMP. Both sixties, white, in 
           flannel shirts, scowling. He wears thick aviator frames that 
           make his eyes seem huge; she’s got vivid red hi-lites that 
           make her look even older.

           Marissa gives them a little wave.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Hi, neighbors! We just moved in!

           Ryan and Chastity don’t wave back. They just stare. The 
           Stumps go back inside without acknowledging Marissa.

           ANGLE: Marissa furrows her brow. That’s weird.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Not the friendliest bunch around 
                        here, are they?

           Peter hasn’t been paying attention to this exchange. He’s 
           been looking for a house key. He finds it.

                                 PETER
                        Come on. Let’s meet them later.
                             (to Lyla, re: key)
                        Do you want to do the honors, Ly?

           Lyla takes the keys.

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - EVENING

           FROM THE STAIRCASE: Through the balusters, we watch as the 
           large door creaks open. It’s as if we’re inhabiting the POV 
           of someone on the stairs. Or the house itself.

           Lyla, Peter and Marissa enter the dark home. It’s stately -- 
           bay windows, sweeping staircase. Yet devoid of all 
           furnishings, it gives off crime scene vibes.

           Peter flicks a switch. The lights turn on.

                                 PETER
                             (on the bright side)
                        The lights work.
           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Later. The family moves through the unfurnished house. Lyla 
           trails her dad and step-mom, playing Fortnite on her phone.

           Marissa trailblazes ahead, yammering on a mile-a-minute as 
           she envisions the house.

                                 MARISSA
                        There’s plenty of space for an 
                        island. Breakfast nook could go 
                        there. That windowsill is south-
                        facing. Perfect for succulents!

                                 PETER
                        Yeah. Or herbs.

                                 MARISSA
                        I think succulents.

           Lyla’s game lags a bit. She dies.

                                 LYLA
                        When are we getting wifi? The data 
                        here spews.

                                 PETER
                        Um, I think the cable company is 
                        coming the day after tomorrow.

                                 LYLA
                        Ugh.

                                 PETER
                        I know. You might actually have 
                        to...
                             (fake gasp)
                        ...go outside this summer vacation!

           Lyla doesn’t laugh at his “dad joke”. But she doesn’t teen-
           girl-roll-her-eyes at him either. 

                                 MARISSA
                        What about a breakfast cart over 
                        there?

                                 PETER
                        Let’s get our bags inside before we 
                        decide where the breakfast cart 
                        goes.
           EXT. THE HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

           Marissa takes out a small suitcase from the back of the 
           Tesla. Lyla has her backpack. Peter pops the trunk and goes 
           for a box --

                                 MARISSA
                        Leave that. The movers will be here 
                        in an hour.

                                 PETER
                        It’s not heavy.

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s what we pay them for.

           Before Peter can protest, we hear:

                                 BO (O.S.)
                        Hi there, folks!

           BO HARRIS approaches from across the street.

           Forties, paunchy, in Crocs and a ratty souvenir Disneyland t-
           shirt. Bo smiles constantly, flashing a thousand teeth capped 
           with gold crowns. All this projects home-spun warmth and 
           reassurance -- like a handyman you’ve known since forever.

                                 PETER
                        Hello, there.

                                 BO
                        I’m Bo Harris.
                             (pointing)
                        I live across the way there with my 
                        son, Desi. Welcome to the block!

           Peter shakes Bo’s hand.

                                 PETER
                        Well, thank you. Pleased to meet 
                        you. I’m Peter Cho.

                                 MARISSA
                             (correcting)
                        Danvers-Cho.
                             (then, offering a hand)
                        I’m Marissa. And this is Lyla.

           Lyla acknowledges Bo with a nod of her head.

                                 BO
                        Hi there, Lyla. How old are you?
                                 LYLA
                        Twelve.

                                 BO
                        That’s my son’s age -- he’s around 
                        here, somewhere.

                                 MARISSA
                        Well, that’s great! Maybe we can do 
                        a little play-date one of these 
                        days!

                                 LYLA
                        Yeah, a play-date sounds ... 
                        mature.

           Peter gives her a warning look -- be nice.

           Bo either doesn’t notice or misreads Lyla’s scorn.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        That’s super! Y’all’re gonna hit it 
                        off real nice -- he’s a great kid. 
                             (then)
                        Listen, I saw your car pulling up 
                        and thought I’d offer a hand 
                        carrying some of your stuff in.

                                 MARISSA
                        Oh, that’s so kind of you. Are you 
                        sure?

           Bo waves this off -- it’s what neighbors are for. He and 
           Peter go to the trunk. Lift the box and carry it up the 
           stairs together. Marissa follows, offering emotional support.

           Lyla stands out in the street with her bag. Looks around the 
           neighborhood again and sees...

           ANGLE: A NEIGHBOR, an older woman in a nightgown, staring at 
           her from across the street in an upstairs window.

           She glances around some more. Spots...

           ANGLE: ANOTHER NEIGHBOR, a man in a wife-beater, also staring 
           at her from his kitchen window.

           Creepy.

           And off an unsettled Lyla, turning back to the house...
           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Peter and Bo set down the box. Marissa gives a clap of 
           thanks.

                                 MARISSA
                        Thank you. We just didn’t trust 
                        movers not to break all our china, 
                        you know?

                                 PETER
                        It’s really nice of you to help.

                                 BO
                        My pleasure. I was friendly with 
                        the previous owners, so I just 
                        wanna do my part and keep that 
                        tradition going.

                                 PETER
                        What happened to them? The realtor 
                        said they disappeared years ago.

           Bo runs his hand through his scraggly hair.

                                 BO
                        Your guess is as good as mine, I’m 
                        afraid. We lost touch for a while, 
                        and then one day their car wasn’t 
                        in the driveway. Up and gone.
                             (changing the subject)
                        So where do you guys come from? I 
                        spotted California plates.

                                 MARISSA
                        San Francisco.

                                 PETER
                        Please don’t hold it against us.

           Bo cackles like it’s the funniest thing he’s heard.

                                 BO
                        Now why would I do that?

                                 MARISSA
                        I get the feeling that some of the 
                        neighbors might not like us too 
                        much. I waved at the couple next 
                        door and they just stood there.
                             (then)
                        I mean I get it. California couple 
                        in a Tesla, buying up the real 
                        estate. The optics, you know.
           Bo puts a reassuring hand on Marissa’s shoulder.

                                 BO
                        Folks around here can be like that. 
                        They get nervous when outsiders 
                        move in. Worried it’ll mess up the 
                        charm of the place. But once people 
                        warm up to you, you’ll fall in love 
                        with Pinyon Street as hard as we 
                        have.

                                 PETER
                        Have you lived here long?

                                 BO
                        Yessir. Whole life. My Daddy passed 
                        me the lease on that house, and 
                        I’ll do the same for Desi.

                                 MARISSA
                        Wow. Strong roots.

           Before anyone can say anything else, we hear a HONK o.s.

                                 PETER
                        That’s the movers. Thanks again for 
                        helping, Bo.

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Later that day.

           The movers have finished bringing in the big items but most 
           of the boxes are unpacked.

           Lyla is setting up her PS4 in the entertainment console. She 
           reaches behind, grabs the TV’s power cord and stretches it 
           toward the nearest socket. It falls three feet short.

                                 LYLA
                        Great.
                             (then)
                        Dad?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                             (to Lyla)
                        Yeah?

                                 LYLA
                        Where’s the extension cord?

                                 PETER (O.S.)
                        Try the basement. The plastic 
                        container with the red top!
           INT. THE HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Darkness.

           Into which light comes with a GROAN as a door opens, 
           revealing Lyla standing in the frame. She reaches for a light 
           switch -- nothing comes on.

                                 LYLA
                        Double great.

           And so on comes her cellphone light, dim and blue and barely 
           able to penetrate the gloom of the basement.

           Lyla gingerly descends the stairs, the pale sweep of her 
           phone light illuminating this large, dusty space filled with 
           STACKS and TOWERS of cardboard boxes.

           The flimsy wood steps CREAK with each of Lyla’s footsteps.

           Now in the basement proper, she searches among the boxes, 
           barely able to see three feet in front of her. No plastic box 
           with the red top.

           She ventures further into the basement, and then at a far 
           wall spots --

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Foundja!

           The guilty party. Plastic box, red top.

           Lyla opens it up, rummages through all the crap and, to her 
           glee, finds an extension cord.

           But as she slides the container back into place she notices 
           something.

           CLOSE: A piece of lint caught between the floorboards. 
           Blowing in some breeze. There’s an airflow down here. 

           Lyla is puzzled by this. She pans along the basement wall 
           with her light. Every inch of the wall is sealed to the floor 
           ... except now she notices a small grated CUBBY DOOR, just 
           big enough for an adult to crouch through.

           Naturally curious, she tries to pry it open. It doesn’t give. 
           She crouches down. Peers through. She can’t make out anything 
           but depthless black beyond.

           And as Lyla tries yanking the door open again, we see...
           WIDE SHOT: Of Lyla and her small light alone in the dark 
           room. We suddenly become aware of the SILENCE of the place as 
           she keeps trying to open it. And then... 

           Almost imperceptibly, we hear a SCRATCHING sound. Like a 
           dog’s nails on concrete. It’s over before we can fully 
           register it.

           Lyla pops up. Turns behind her, thinking that’s where the 
           noise came from.

           But there’s just silence.

           Beat, then the SCRATCHING again, from a new angle.

           Lyla spins, trying to illuminate the basement with her feeble 
           cellphone.

           Another beat of silence.

           Lyla is totally still now. Trying to control her breath. 
           Trying to isolate the sound.

           And then it happens again.

           SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH. Louder this time. It’s moving, too.

           Lyla whirls, panicked.

           And as the noise gets LOUDER and CLOSER, Lyla spins again, 
           heart pounding and -- Lyla GASPS as she sees --

           Marissa standing near the basement entrance.

           Lyla breathes heavily. Jesus.

                                 MARISSA
                        Lyla? Is that you?

           Lyla looks around uncertainly. The scratching has stopped.

                                 LYLA
                        Yeah, I’m here.

                                 MARISSA
                        What are you doing?

                                 LYLA
                        I was looking for the extension 
                        cord and then --

                                 MARISSA
                        Well hurry up, please. Dinner is 
                        almost ready.
           Lyla is shaken up. But she nods and follows Marissa up the 
           stairs. As she does...

           ANGLE: On the patch of light created by the open door, we see 
           a SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN on the wall of the basement.

           Not Lyla. Not Marissa.

           Someone else.

           We catch of glimpse of this disturbing image for a short beat 
           before Lyla closes the door, engulfing the room in darkness.

           INT. THE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Before the meal. Lyla and Peter sit at a cozy dining table. 
           Through the kitchen door we see Marissa putting the finishing 
           touches on their food.

                                 LYLA
                        So I think there’s an extra room 
                        down in the basement.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah?

                                 LYLA
                             (nodding)
                        I found this small door down there. 
                        I couldn’t open it.

                                 PETER
                        Huh. That’s weird. There was 
                        nothing like that in the layout we 
                        saw, was there, sweetie?

                                 MARISSA
                        Bonus square footage is always 
                        nice.

                                 PETER
                             (to Lyla)
                        I’ll check it out. See what we’re 
                        working with.

           Marissa enters and places three plates of pasta on the table. 
           It’s not like normal home cooking. It’s a portion of weird 
           brown noodles covered in some green sauce on a huge white 
           plate. Fancy restaurant style.

           Peter is about to dig in, but Marissa stops him. 
                                 MARISSA
                        Hold on, let me get a picture 
                        first. 

           Lyla smirks as Marissa holds her iPhone above the dish for 
           the shot.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        There we go. Gorgeous isn’t it?

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, this looks ... what is this?

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s from “Plenty”. Kelp noodle 
                        cacio e pepe.

                                 LYLA
                             (terse)
                        Yum.

                                 PETER
                        Smells delicious, honey.

                                 MARISSA
                        I thought I’d do something special 
                        for our first meal in the new 
                        house!

           Lyla takes a bite. Nearly gags. Neither Peter nor Marissa 
           notice.

                                 PETER
                        So the neighbors. They seem like a 
                        mixed bag, eh?

                                 LYLA
                        What was with all the staring?

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s better than I expected. You 
                        have to be ready for it when you 
                        move into these neighborhoods.

                                 LYLA
                        What do you mean, “these 
                        neighborhoods”?

           Peter clears his throat. Figuring out how to say this so he 
           won’t look bad.

                                 PETER
                        This neighborhood is, um ... honey, 
                        help me out here.
                                 MARISSA
                        You know how in San Francisco 
                        there’s Pacific Heights and the 
                        Tenderloin?

                                 LYLA
                             (realizing)
                        I knew it! We did move into the 
                        ghetto!

                                 PETER
                        It’s not the ghetto!
                             (searching beat)
                        ...It just hasn’t reached its 
                        potential.

           Marissa nods vigorously. Yes, that’s a great way to put it.

                                 MARISSA
                        And sometimes, when people like us 
                        move in, the people who were here 
                        before get scared.

                                 LYLA
                        What are they scared of?

                                 PETER
                        The G-word. Gentrification.

                                 MARISSA
                        That it’ll turn into Pacific 
                        Heights. That it will become too 
                        expensive for them. That they’ll 
                        have to leave. So sometimes they 
                        act ... unfriendly.

                                 LYLA
                        Like we’re going to get a brick 
                        through the window? God damnit!

                                 PETER
                             (language)
                        Lyla! We’re not going to get a 
                        brick through the window.

           But Lyla is already putting the power dynamics together:

                                 LYLA
                        Oh, God! We’re Columbus and they’re 
                        the Native Americans.

           Eager not to be thought of as a genocidal bastard, Peter 
           waves this concern away a bit desperately.
                                 PETER
                        No one’s the bad guys in this 
                        situation. It’s just ... the way 
                        the world works.

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s silly, really. Who would 
                        complain when your streets get 
                        cleaner, you finally get a decent 
                        coffee shop, and a SoulCycle opens 
                        up?

                                 LYLA
                        I can’t believe we’re the bad guys!

           Marissa and Peter exchange a smirk. She’s too young to get 
           it, anyway.

                                 MARISSA
                        At least we know one neighbor 
                        doesn’t see us as the enemy. Bo 
                        Harris seems very accommodating.
                             (quickly)
                        If a bit rustic.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah. Amazing he’s been here for so 
                        long.

                                 MARISSA
                             (to Lyla)
                        By the way, I went ahead and 
                        scheduled a little playdate for you 
                        and Desi next week.

                                 PETER
                        You did?

                                 LYLA
                        What the fuck? I’m not seven!

                                 PETER
                        Hey! There’s no need to shout. Or 
                        curse.

                                 MARISSA
                        I thought I was being considerate.

                                 LYLA
                        Don’t be, please.

           Marissa appears shocked, playing it innocent. 
                                 MARISSA
                        Did I do something wrong? I thought 
                        you’d’ve jumped at the chance to 
                        make an actual friend.

                                 LYLA
                             (dry)
                        No. It’s very ... thoughtful.

           Lyla nods, then pushes away the mostly full plate of pasta.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for dinner, Marissa.

           Lyla makes for the exit.

                                 MARISSA
                        I try to do something nice.

           Peter swallows something about. He’s not looking for a fight 
           on his first night.

                                 PETER
                             (sotto)
                        I’ll talk to her.

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Later.

           Lyla plays Call of Duty: WWII, aggressively mowing down the 
           bad guys from a turret gun. Peter enters gingerly, unsure of 
           how to begin.

           Lyla keeps playing, ignoring his entrance. He comes over and 
           sits next to her. He just watches the TV for a beat --

           ON SCREEN: Lyla’s character is engaged in a brutal grappling 
           match with an SS Captain. Lyla BRAINS him with a helmet. It 
           is quite graphic.

                                 PETER
                        Wow, this is -- did I buy this for 
                        you?

                                 LYLA
                        I told you it was historically 
                        accurate.

           Peter smiles. He likes seeing his daughter’s cunning, even at 
           his own expense. Then he gets serious.

                                 PETER
                        Can I talk to you about something?
                                 LYLA
                        Is it about “Melania?”

                                 PETER
                        Can you at least call her “her”?
                             (then)
                        Marissa doesn’t have her own kids. 
                        She doesn’t know anything about 
                        them. Yesterday she asked me if 
                        three year-olds can walk. But she’s 
                        trying.

           Lyla isn’t so sure. Says nothing.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        I know the last three years have 
                        been tough.

                                 LYLA
                        Awful.

                                 PETER
                             (agreeing)
                        Awful. First Mom’s diagnosis, then 
                        living with that over our heads...
                             (emotional pause)
                        ...then a new woman moves in, the 
                        marriage seems fast -- I get it.

           Lyla stares ahead, still playing.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, we’re all figuring out how to 
                        do this. Including Marissa.
                             (then)
                        Look at me.

           Lyla pauses the game. Turns to her dad.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Do me a favor, okay? Just hang out 
                        with the neighbor kid. It’ll make 
                        Marissa feel like she knows what 
                        she’s doing. If you don’t like him, 
                        you never have to see him again, 
                        okay? Can you do that for me?

                                 LYLA
                        I can do that. If you answer a 
                        question.

                                 PETER
                        Shoot.
                                 LYLA
                        Do you like the weird vegetarian 
                        cooking?

           Peter pauses, then mouths the word “No”.

           Lyla grins. Peter grins back. Holds up a finger in front of 
           his lips -- our secret.

           And off Peter, bringing his daughter in for a kiss on the 
           forehead...

           EXT. THE HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           The next day. Lyla emerges from the house holding the compost 
           bag. She trots down the back steps and makes for the green 
           bin pushed up against the side of the fence.

           But then she stops, noticing something in the grass. Lyla’s 
           face scrunches up in disgust as she sees:

           ANGLE: Lying in the grass is a RABBIT on its back, four paws 
           in the air, entrails spilling out of its stomach. Eyes glazed 
           over in death. 

           Lyla drops the bag.

                                 LYLA
                        Oh, what in the motherless fuck!

           A beat later, Peter comes POUNDING out of the house --

                                 PETER
                        What is it -- oh.

           He crouches down, putting on the part of “brave Dad” for his 
           daughter. Truth is, he’s a bit queasy.

           ANGLE: And we PUSH IN on the corpse of the rabbit. CAMERA 
           holds here for an uncomfortable length of time.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Must of been got by a coyote or 
                        something.

           Lyla studies the corpse.

                                 LYLA
                        Then why isn’t it eaten?

           Peter doesn’t have a good answer for that eminently 
           reasonable question.
                                 PETER
                        Get the shovel from the basement. 
                        I’ll clean this guy up.

           Lyla does so. And off Peter, staring down at the carcass...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LYLA’S ROOM - DAY

           Later on that week.

           Lyla is lounging on her bed, reading the comic Saga when 
           there’s a knocking at the door.

                                 MARISSA (O.C.)
                        Lyla? Your friend is here.

           Lyla doesn’t know what she’s talking about. With a puzzled 
           look on her face, she rolls off the bed and opens the door to 
           see...

           Marissa standing beside a twelve year-old boy.

           This is Bo’s son, DESI HARRIS. With a bowl cut and oversized 
           “Kid Rock North America Tour ‘99” shirt, he seems younger 
           than his years. Doesn’t help that he’s shy, usually spending 
           conversations staring at his toes.

           But right now he’s staring ga-ga eyes at Lyla. He’s never 
           seen anyone quite so...punk. Certainly not a girl his age.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Lyla, this is Desi Harris.

           Lyla is not returning the open-mouth heart-eyes stare. She’s 
           looking at him skeptically.

                                 LYLA
                        Hey. I’m Lyla. Obviously.

           It takes a beat for Desi to recover.

                                 DESI
                        Hi. I’m Desi.

                                 LYLA
                        Yeah, I picked up on that.

           Lyla is not thrilled that she has to do this. There’s an 
           uncomfortable beat of silence, then Marissa claps.

                                 MARISSA
                        Okay, I’ll let you two “chillax” as 
                        they say.
           As Marissa goes, she mouths at Lyla “be nice”. Ugh.

           There’s another beat. Then:

                                 LYLA
                        So, dude. Do you play any games?

                                 DESI
                        I mean I used to play Left 4 Dead, 
                        but then my controller broke --

                                 LYLA
                        That’ll work.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           The same day.

           In the gloom of the basement the little cubby door Lyla found 
           is illuminated by the spotlight of Peter’s flashlight.

           He tries to open it with his hands. No dice. Peter puts down 
           the flashlight and pulls a flathead screwdriver out of his 
           pocket. He sticks it between the jamb and the frame. Pushes.

           The wood CREAKS, splintering under his effort.

           UNKNOWN POV: As it does, CAMERA goes behind Peter. Handheld. 
           As if we’re someone else in the room. We draw CLOSER and 
           CLOSER in jagged, shuffling footsteps. And then we hear that 
           same scratching sound. Too soft for Peter to notice.

           Peter strains to open the door as...

           UNKNOWN POV: A ghastly HAND enters frame, reaching for Peter. 
           More claw than hand. Nails long and cracked and blackened. 
           Skin covered in boils and the color of ink. And as we REACH 
           for Peter --

           Peter BUSTS the door off its hinge! 

           OVER HIS SHOULDER: No one is there.

           Peter pants from effort, then grabs the flashlight, gets on 
           his knees and crawls through the cubby door, dropping into --

           INT. THE HOUSE - SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           DARKNESS.

           Peter rakes his flashlight about. Discovers he’s in a good-
           sized room. Big enough to fit ten people easily.
           In the middle is a wooden column rising to the ceiling.

           He keeps sweeping the light about, finding...

           Cobwebs in the corners. Nothing on the walls. On the floor, 
           lots of bugs retreating from the light’s harsh glare.

           But nothing unusual. Nothing scary.

           He lights up the floor near the column. He clambers down the 
           slope, having spotted something. He crouches, picking up...

           A burned-up match.

           And off Peter, not sure what to think of it...

                                 LYLA (PRE-LAP)
                        Dude, stop being trash.

           INT. THE HOUSE - DEN - DAY

           Back to Lyla and Desi’s “play date”.

           ON SCREEN: Lyla and Desi are playing Left 4 Dead, a co-
           operative zombie shooting game.

           It’s later. Lyla and Desi are sitting on the floor cross-
           legged. Lyla’s tongue is out like some gamer-chick Michael 
           Jordan. She’s in the zone, mashing buttons, having a blast.

                                 LYLA
                        No, don’t get too close to The 
                        Witch --

           ON SCREEN: Desi’s character gets too close to The Witch, who 
           utters a BANSHEE HOWL and kills Desi.

           Desi grimaces. The whole afternoon has been like this.

           Lyla scowls in frustration.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you’d played this before!

                                 DESI
                        I had but my controller broke and I 
                        haven’t gotten a new one --

                                 LYLA
                        Great, now I have to fight everyone 
                        off myself.

           Lyla mashes buttons for a beat. Desi just watches.
                                 DESI
                        Can you come resurrect me?

                                 LYLA
                        Can you not be such a pussy? BOOM! 
                        Yes, die zombie bitch!

           ON SCREEN: Lyla keeps playing. Desi keeps being dead.

           And after another beat, he tosses his controller. He’s had 
           more than enough.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DESI
                        Yeah, I think I’m done.

                                 LYLA
                        Come on, because of some trash 
                        talk?

                                 DESI
                        I’ve been dying for like 30 minutes 
                        and you won’t help me. I don’t 
                        wanna do this anymore.

           He rises. Makes for the exit.

                                 LYLA
                        You’re seriously leaving because of 
                        a game?

                                 DESI
                        No, I’m leaving because this is 
                        supposed to be fun. This is ... the 
                        opposite of that.

           Desi is legit upset. And seeing that, it dawns on Lyla how 
           harsh she’s been.

                                 DESI (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you around.

           At that Desi heads out, downcast.

           And off Lyla, a sense of guilt gnawing away at her...

           EXT. THE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

           We’re CLOSE on roughly-hewn strip of wood. A BRUSH enters 
           frame and paints the fence, leaving it a deep shade of brown.
           REVEAL that Marissa is staining a freshly-built wooden fence. 
           You know, the type with horizontal slats and sans serif 
           numbering. The ubiquitous gentrification fence.

           She turns and faces an iPhone that’s been set up on a tripod.

                                 MARISSA
                        Now the stain I’m using is walnut. 
                        It’s a nice dark color that will 
                        bring some of those warm yellow 
                        highlights out in the ash wood. Of 
                        course, I’m a huge believer in 
                        sustainability, so the wood is 100% 
                        reclaimed. See how pretty it is?

           Marissa strikes a pose for a beat, then grabs the iPhone off 
           the tripod. Studies the footage she’s just shot. After some 
           minor editing...

           ...Desi emerges from the house, visibly upset by his playdate 
           with Lyla.

           Marissa watches him go briefly, then turns her attention back 
           to her video. As she starts to upload it to Instagram....

           INT. THE HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS

           From a bay window, Lyla watches Desi cross the street to his 
           house, her guilt curdling into shame and sadness...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Later that week. The house is looking better. More done up. 
           The kitchen isn’t quite “Architectural Digest” but it’s 
           getting there.

           Marissa is chopping vegetables as she listens to music, 
           headphones in.

           We can hear the tinny sound of Kendrick Lamar’s “Humble” 
           coming out of her earbuds. 

           And as Marissa cranks up the volume the music DROWNS OUT ALL 
           OTHER SOUND. She begins rapping along:

                                 MARISSA
                             (bad rapping)
                        Get the fuck off my stage, I'm the 
                        Sandman / Get the fuck off my dick, 
                        that ain't right / I make a play 
                        fucking up your whole life...
           Marissa then proceeds to open the drawer beneath her. Then 
           another. Then another on the other side of the kitchen. 
           Whatever she’s looking for, she can’t find it. 

           INT. THE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Marissa dances into the hallway holding her iPhone, grooving 
           to the music and rapping along.

           She’s apparently headed for the basement. 

           NEW ANGLE: CLOSE on the basement door handle. It’s TURNING.

           Marissa is totally oblivious. Her eyes are closed. Rapt. Or 
           she is until she drops her iPhone and the MUSIC CUTS OUT.

                                 MARISSA
                        Shit.

           She crouches down to pick it up, her back to the basement 
           door...

           ...which we now see is OPENING. Out of the gloom a FIGURE 
           materializes...

           ANGLE: Marissa inspects the iPhone for damage. No cracks on 
           the front. Phew.

           But the relief is momentary. Because she’s startled by the 
           sudden creaking of footsteps behind her. She turns and looks 
           up and -- 

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!

           She jumps back, horrified to see...

           Ryan Stump, the creepy neighbor with the aviator glasses from 
           earlier. He’s just standing there in overalls like this is 
           the most normal thing in the world.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        Sorry, sorry, sorry! Didn’t mean to 
                        scare ya.

           And Marissa was very scared. Still is, actually. There’s a 
           strange man in her house --

                                 MARISSA
                        Who the fuck are you? 

           Ryan doesn’t appreciate the language.
                                 RYAN STUMP
                        Apologies, ma’m. My name’s Ryan 
                        Stump. My wife and I live next 
                        door. I think we saw each other 
                        when you moved in a week back.

                                 MARISSA
                        Why are you in my basement?

           Ryan reaches into his back pocket. Produces a mouse trap.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        Neighborly courtesy. The previous 
                        residents gave me a spare key so I 
                        could maintain these. I was 
                        planning on extending you the same.

                                 MARISSA
                        You could’ve asked me first -- 
                        Jesus H Christ...

           Ryan frowns at her blasphemy.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        I tried to call out to ya. But I 
                        guess those headphones must be 
                        pretty dang good.

           Ryan laughs, Marissa doesn’t. She’s still shaken up.

                                 MARISSA
                        If you don’t mind, I’d like your 
                        key to this house. I’m not 
                        comfortable giving strangers access 
                        to my home.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        Well, golly, we aren’t strangers. I 
                        live right next door.

                                 MARISSA
                        The key, please.

           Ryan is miffed. 

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        I was just trying to save you the 
                        expense of an exterminator.

           Reluctantly, Ryan produces the key. Holds it out on his palm.

                                 RYAN STUMP (CONT’D)
                        You know, we look out for each 
                        other in this neighborhood. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RYAN STUMP (CONT’D)
                        That’s part of our values. If you 
                        can’t reciprocate ... you won’t fit 
                        in.

           Marissa doesn’t like the veiled threat. Swipes the key off 
           his palm.

                                 MARISSA
                        I’d like you to get out of my house 
                        right now. Please.

           Ryan smiles unpleasantly.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        Nice to meet you too. Neighbor.

           Marissa stands there until she hears the door close.

           INT. THE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Later that night.

           Peter plays NBA2K18 on the iPad in bed; Marissa stands at a 
           dresser applying various lotions to her face. She’s agitated:

                                 MARISSA
                        And he was just there, like it was 
                        the most normal thing in the world!

                                 PETER
                        It’s really creepy. We can get the 
                        locks changed.

                                 MARISSA
                        And what about, “You won’t fit in”? 
                        What do you think that means? 
                        They’re trying to intimidate us. 
                        The staring, coming onto our 
                        property.

           Peter puts down the iPad. Sighs a little, on the inside. His 
           small joy at the game extinguished.

                                 PETER
                        Why would the neighbors want to 
                        intimidate us?

                                 MARISSA
                        Don’t be naive. These rubes see a 
                        bi-racial couple from San Francisco 
                        drive up in a Tesla and they think 
                        Blue Bottle is right around the 
                        corner, and then they’ll be evicted 
                        when the property values go up.
           Marissa goes to the window and throws back the curtains. She 
           peers out.

           MARISSA’S POV: A beat-up HATCHBACK idles across the way. 
           Lights off. A FIGURE in the front seems to be staring at the 
           house.

           Marissa squints. Is he watching us? She can’t tell.

                                 PETER
                             (beat)
                        I don’t think they know what Blue 
                        Bottle is.

           She turns back to Peter, regaining her train of thought.

                                 MARISSA
                        You know what I mean. They want us 
                        out, Peter.

           Peter rises and goes to her. Puts soothing hands on her hips.

                                 PETER
                             (conceding)
                        They could be a little worried 
                        about what we mean for the 
                        neighborhood. But if we give ‘em 
                        enough time, they’ll see that we’re 
                        more like them than not, and 
                        they’ll leave us alone.

           He tries to kiss her. Marissa evades him, not at all 
           convinced by his words:

                                 MARISSA
                        The cream needs to dry.

           Peter pouts, then shuffles back to bed. And as he does, 
           Marissa takes another look out the window.

           ANGLE: The hatchback is gone.

           And off Marissa’s face, etched with concern...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LYLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Another night.

           Lyla lies on her bed, scrolling through Instagram.

           CLOSE ON HER PHONE: The same three friends we saw earlier in 
           the 4x4 photo booth shot now pose on a pier on a lake. 
           Without Lyla. The caption: how did i get so lucky w these 
           friends [heart emoji]
           Something about their joyous smiles stings Lyla. Even if 
           she’s too tough to admit it, their friendship is something 
           she misses. 

           And by chance she looks out her window and sees...

           ANGLE: Desi sitting in his room, nose buried in a book. He 
           looks lonely. A bit sad, honestly.

           Her mind doesn’t want to go to how she treated him, but it 
           does anyway.

           As she looks at Desi she sighs, taking us to...

           EXT. HARRIS HOUSE - DAY

           The next day.

           Lyla stands on the Harris’ rundown porch, a small box in her 
           hands. She rings the doorbell, then waits. She taps her feet. 
           Nervous.

           After a beat, the door opens. It’s Desi. His face falls on 
           seeing Lyla. Still hasn’t gotten over the video game 
           incident. 

                                 DESI
                        Oh.

                                 LYLA
                        Well, hello to you too.

                                 DESI
                        Hey, I didn’t complain to your mom 
                        about --

           But before he can finish, Lyla hands him the box.

           Desi opens it cautiously, as if it might be a novelty snake-
           in-a-can trick. But to his surprise it’s...

                                 DESI (CONT’D)
                        A new controller?

           Indeed. Inside is a banged up Playstation controller.

                                 LYLA
                        I figure because you suck so bad 
                        you might wanna, you know ... 
                        practice.

           Ah, Lyla’s delicate bedside manner. Still, Desi is thrilled.
                                 DESI
                        Wow, I mean. It’s super nice.

                                 LYLA
                        The “A” Button is a little wonky...

                                 DESI
                        Thank you.

           An awkward pause, then:

                                 LYLA
                        Okay then.

           At that she turns back to her house. But then she stops. 
           Realizing she had something else to say:

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Um, and I’m sorry.
                             (beat)
                        For being such a douche yesterday.

                                 DESI
                        Oh. No, it’s cool. You weren’t --

                                 LYLA
                        Yeah, I was. I’m sorry. 

           Desi nods. Might as well admit it.

                                 DESI
                        Thanks. It’s cool.

           Beat. Lyla stubs the ground with her toe. Desi chews on his 
           lip nervously. These two are pros at communication. 

                                 LYLA
                        All right. So. See ya.

           Now Lyla turns around for real. Starts back for the house. 
           But stops when she hears:

                                 DESI
                        So what are you doing now?
                             (holds up controller)
                        Wanna play?

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - DESI’S ROOM - DAY

           Later.

           Lyla and Desi sit at the foot of Desi’s bed, playing co-op on 
           a small boxy tube. 
           They’re having a much better time than earlier -- smiling as 
           they mash buttons, howling as they avoid digital death.

           As they play, we get a sense of Desi’s room -- it’s the love 
           child of a horror enthusiast and a paranormal detective 
           cosplayer.

           WE SEE: A bookcase filled with horror comics, histories of 
           the Salem Witch Trials, pamphlets on “How To Find Real 
           Vampires”, crystals and dreamcatchers on the shelf, and a 
           Ouija board poking out from under the bed.

           If it’s occult, he’s got it.

           Even as she plays, Lyla can’t help but notice all the strange 
           stuff around the room. Her attention drifts to a STUFFED OWL 
           in a bell jar.

                                 DESI
                        Yo! I’m getting hammered over here  
                        -- darnit!

           ON SCREEN: Desi’s character dies.

                                 LYLA
                        Sorry, I got distracted by all 
                        your, uh, creepy stuff.

           Desi flushes pink, called out on his hobby.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        So what’s the deal with it? Are you 
                        like Kirkland-brand Harry Potter or 
                        something?

                                 DESI
                        I dunno, I just kinda like it.

                                 LYLA
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 DESI
                        Um...

           Desi pauses, unsure how to answer. He seems to be on the 
           verge of saying something, then:

                                 DESI (CONT’D)
                        I just got into it, I guess. I 
                        don’t remember.

           Lyla studies him. There seems to be something more going on 
           here, but she doesn’t want to press.
                                 LYLA
                        All right.
                             (then, re: game)
                        Lemme come resurrect you. What 
                        room’d you die in?

           Desi nods eagerly, happy to be off that topic.

           And off the two of them playing, becoming fast friends...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LYLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Later that night.

           Lyla watches “Rick and Morty” in bed on her laptop. She 
           finishes an episode, closes the computer and rises.

           INT. THE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lyla brushes her teeth, staring at herself in the mirror. She 
           hums the R+M theme song.

           And then the overhead light FLICKERS. Once, twice, and ...

           BLACKNESS.

           We can just make out Lyla’s face in the dark. She glances 
           about, unable to see anything.

           And then we hear that SCRATCHING again. Long talons dragged 
           along concrete.

                                 LYLA
                        Hello?

           The noise grows LOUDER. Nearer.

           Lyla spins, terrified.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?!

           And as the sound approaches and gets RIGHT NEXT TO LYLA --

           The lights FLICKER BACK ON, and in those STROBING FLASHES we 
           catch a GLIMPSE of a monstrous WOMAN IN BLACK. Too quick of a 
           flash to see many details, but everything about her was 
           wrong. (We’ll see more of her later).

           Lyla’s heart beats like a jackrabbit. She looks around the 
           bathroom. Empty.

           She pulls aside the shower curtain. Nothing there.
           Lyla is befuddled. Did she see what we saw?

           We don’t know.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           The next day. Peter sips coffee and reads the news on his 
           tablet. Lyla enters, bleary-eyed from last night’s unsettling 
           events.

                                 PETER
                        Morning, Ly. How’d you sleep?

                                 LYLA
                        Meh.

                                 PETER
                        Something wrong?

                                 LYLA
                        I keep hearing these noises in the 
                        house -- like scratching.

                                 PETER
                        Could be bugs. Rats. We didn’t find 
                        anything when we did the 
                        inspection, but a lot can happen in 
                        six weeks.

           Lyla reaches for a slice of toast.

                                 LYLA
                        It’s probably nothing.

                                 PETER
                        I can check it out --

           Peter’s smartwatch DINGS. It’s a package update: “Your Amazon 
           order #6655321 has been delivered.”

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, can you get the thing from the 
                        front door?

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING

           Lyla pads her way down the stairs and opens the front door...
           EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...where an Amazon package sits. She grabs it, curious, and 
           begins to open it up. Inside is a Magic Bullet -- you know, 
           those juicers everyone has?

           Then she glances up and notices Ryan Stump looking at her 
           from the front porch. She waves. He doesn’t wave back. 
           Whatever.

           Lyla turns around and sees (NOTE: we haven’t seen the front 
           of the Danvers-Cho house at all this scene) ...

           In DARK RUSTY PAINT on the new mint green door, a CROSS 
           INSIDE A CIRCLE. Like a sniper scope. Or the Zodiac Killer’s 
           symbol.

           She studies it. It looks like it’s still a bit wet.

           And that’s when Lyla puts her finger to paint ... it comes 
           off FRESH and BRIGHT. The color of blood.

           HOLD on Lyla standing before the desecrated door...

           EXT. SHERIFF STATION - DAY

           A small, low-slung building with a single sheriff’s car out 
           front. The Tesla pulls in next to it.

           Above the double doors a sign reads: “Multnomah County 
           Sheriff’s Department -- Northeast Substation”.

           INT. SHERIFF STATION - ENTRY - DAY

           Peter and Marissa enter, mid-conversation:

                                 PETER
                        ...we’ll just tell them the facts 
                        and they’ll help us out, okay?

                                 MARISSA
                        Like in San Francisco when that 
                        street person kept using my 
                        planters --

           She cuts herself off because she realizes ...

           There’s no one inside. The front desk is empty.

           And there’s no noise coming from within, either. It’s so 
           quiet the HUMMING of the fluorescent lighting feels LOUD.

           They trade looks. Odd.
                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Beat. Nothing. 

           He knocks on the desk.

                                 PETER
                        Hellooooo?

           The lights HUM in response.

           INT. SHERIFF STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

           Moments later.

           Peter and Marissa walk through the empty precinct accompanied 
           by the relentless DRONE of the lights and their shoes 
           slapping a beat against the two-tone floors.

                                 MARISSA
                        Is anybody here?

           INT. SHERIFF STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

           The bullpen has a small town vibe -- just four desks. Peter 
           and Marissa enter and are dismayed to find them all empty.

           They trade another unsettled look -- what sort of police 
           station is empty at eleven am?

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS (O.S.)
                        Sorry, folks!

           They both give a start as they turn and see SHERIFF ROBERTS 
           zipping up his fly as he enters behind them.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        Our desk girl’s youngest went into 
                        labor this morning and Sheriff 
                        Toole came down with the flu, so 
                        it’s just me until the noon shift.

           He’s forties, stocky, clean-shaven. A terrific head of black 
           hair keeping him looking young.

           Sheriff Roberts grins, realizing he gave them a bit of a 
           fright.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        What can I help you with?
           INT. SHERIFF STATION - BULLPEN - DAY

           Later.

           Peter and Marissa sit opposite Roberts. She’s in the middle 
           of their story:

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s a pattern -- it’s not just the 
                        bullseye. They’re intimidating us!
                             (realizing)
                        And Christ, I just painted that 
                        door!

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        Mrs. Cho --

                                 MARISSA
                             (correcting)
                        Danvers-Cho.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        Yes. It’s extremely upsetting to 
                        you, no doubt.

                                 PETER
                        Not to mention Lyla -- having to 
                        see that? Having to explain it to 
                        her?

                                 MARISSA
                             (quickly)
                        And that too!

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        I assure you, this sort of thing 
                        doesn’t happen in that 
                        neighborhood.

                                 PETER
                        You’re familiar with it?

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        My mother lives in the area.

           Sheriff Roberts thinks.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        Have you two had any other threats 
                        since moving in?

                                 MARISSA
                        A man named Ryan Stump came into 
                        our house last week. Unannounced. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARISSA (CONT'D)
                        He’s the one who did the door, I’m 
                        sure.

                                 PETER
                        Sweetie, we don’t know --

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s him.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        He made a threat?

                                 PETER
                        Not threats, per se --

                                 MARISSA
                        He had a key -- he was snooping 
                        around the basement and snuck up on 
                        me. It was scary too, like he 
                        wanted to frighten me. When I asked 
                        him to leave, he got offended and 
                        sort of told me to watch out.

           For the first time, Roberts likes what he hears. Nods and 
           starts scribbling down notes.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        Ryan Stump did that?

                                 MARISSA
                             (nodding)
                        I think he wants to chase us out of 
                        the neighborhood.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        Any reason you have this suspicion?

           Marissa looks to Peter. He gives a go-ahead nod -- tell him.

                                 MARISSA
                        Sergeant, I’ve been getting the 
                        sense that people in the area ... 
                        well, how do I put this...

                                 PETER
                        They don’t like, um...

           Awkward pause.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        ...Yuppies?

           Peter reddens. He thinks of himself as a “cool yuppie”, not 
           like those other yuppies.
                                 PETER
                        That’s one way to put it, yes.

           Roberts breaks into a smile.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to offend. 
                        It’s just that Portland has changed 
                        a lot in the last ten years. Most 
                        parts are unrecognizable. Except 
                        for the North Union area.

                                 PETER
                        North Union? The realtor told us it 
                        was called Glenoak Gulch.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        In fact, all the residents I’m 
                        aware of grew up there. Inherited 
                        their houses from their parents, 
                        and so forth and so on. It’s very 
                        blue collar.

                                 MARISSA
                             (and bad)
                        Yes. Very.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        It’s a miracle it’s held out as 
                        long as it has. But now that folks 
                        like you are discovering it, I 
                        suppose they’ll have to make do 
                        like everyone else.
                             (then)
                        Listen, I’m going to type this up 
                        and have you sign it for me. That 
                        way, if Mr. Stump does anything 
                        else, it’ll be easier if you want 
                        to do something like get a 
                        restraining order. Sound good?

           And off Peter and Marissa, greatly relieved...

           EST. PINYON STREET - DAY

           Back to the weird Zodiac/bullseye symbol on the door of the 
           Danvers-Cho house.

           After a beat the camera WHIP-PANS 180 degrees across the 
           street to the Harris house.
                                 LYLA (PRE-LAP)
                        Thanks for letting me wait here 
                        while my parents talk to the cops, 
                        Mr. Harris.

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Lyla and Bo are seated across from each other on this 
           scratched up, 70’s style island. A plate of hush puppies sits 
           between them, beckoning.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Call me Bo. And it’s no problem -- 
                        I’m awfully sorry over what 
                        happened to your house.

                                 LYLA
                        It’s just blood.

                                 BO HARRIS
                             (shaking his head)
                        Probably some kid watching too many 
                        movies, is my bet. Some folks just 
                        don’t accept change.

           Lyla reaches for the hush puppies. Looks to Bo -- may I?

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead.

           Lyla takes one. Bites in and ... ohmygod. Heaven.

                                 LYLA
                             (mouth full)
                        This is delicious.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Old Harris family recipe going way 
                        back. Only thing I can cook, to be 
                        honest. Have another.

           Lyla does.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Your daddy ever cook?

                                 LYLA
                        He can order GrubHub, that’s about 
                        it. My mom could cook though. She 
                        made the best spare rib ...

           She trails off, thinking about her Mom.

           Bo senses the subject is touchy.
                                 BO HARRIS
                        Everything sorted out with y’all 
                        after the move?

                                 LYLA
                        I guess. I mean, I think my dad’s 
                        company took care of a lot of it. 
                        He moved for a new job.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        That’s the modern world. People 
                        move all the time now. I’m hoping 
                        Desi won’t have to do that, but 
                        what do I know?

           Bo pops a hush puppy in his mouth.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you two became friendly. 
                        Shows the idiot who did this to 
                        your door it doesn’t have to be so 
                        hard.

                                 LYLA
                        What do you mean?

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Well, in the past there’s been 
                        friction when new folks come to the 
                        block...
                             (changing subject)
                        I’m just sayin’ you two getting 
                        along sets a good example.

           At that, we hear the sound of the door opening. Desi enters, 
           holding a paper bag full of groceries.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        There he is! They have frozen peas?

                                 DESI
                        Yup.
                             (noticing)
                        Hey, Lyla. What’s up?

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - DESI'S ROOM - DAY

           Later.

           Lyla spins in Desi’s desk chair, devouring another hush 
           puppy. Desi sits on the ground, more contemplative.
                                 DESI
                        This blood on the door thing is 
                        strange. Very ritualistic.

                                 LYLA
                        Marissa called it domestic 
                        terrorism.

                                 DESI
                             (admitting)
                        I mean it could be a bullseye. It 
                        could also be Celtic. The symbol is 
                        way older than Christianity. Caesar 
                        mentions it in his writings--

                                 LYLA
                        I’m glad you find this interesting.

                                 DESI
                        Just saying. There’s something 
                        about it that’s kinda...

           Lyla gestures around at all the occult stuff in the room.

                                 LYLA
                        Paranormal?

                                 DESI
                             (very funny)
                        Weird. Alright, weird?

                                 LYLA
                        You don’t buy Marissa’s evil 
                        neighbor theory?

                                 DESI
                        Ryan Stump is like eighty years old 
                        and walks with a limp. What, he 
                        just went to the “blood store” and 
                        bought ten gallons and painted a 
                        bullseye on your door in the middle 
                        of the night? Nah.

           Lyla thinks. It does seem difficult, now that he mentions it. 

           She tosses up a final hush puppy like a grape. Catches it in 
           her mouth. As she chews:

                                 LYLA
                        Honestly, I don’t care what it is 
                        as long as it freaks out Marissa.
                             (off Desi)
                        What?
                                 DESI
                        Do you really hate her that much?

                                 LYLA
                        She’s a bitch. Acts all innocent 
                        around my dad but she sucks. She’s 
                        had it out for me since --

           Lyla stops herself from saying it. It’s part of a self-
           defense mechanism. But Desi, to his credit, understands.

                                 DESI
                        You don’t have to talk about it if 
                        you don’t want.

           Lyla pauses. She’s told no one what she’s about to say.

                                 LYLA
                        My real mom died four years ago.
                             (beat, hard to say)
                        Cancer.

           She turns to look at Desi.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        After she died everyone kept coming 
                        up to me asking how I was doing. I 
                        stopped being a person -- I was 
                        just a ... like a victim. So I 
                        stopped talking to people. Stopped 
                        hanging out with friends. To stop 
                        having to deal with it all.
                             (then)
                        I guess that’s why I like video 
                        games so much. Nobody asks you how 
                        you’re feeling. Because you can 
                        just focus on the game.

           TEARS have formed in Lyla’s eyes. Embarrassed, she wipes them 
           away hurriedly.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck, I’m sorry. I usually don’t do 
                        this.

                                 DESI
                        It’s okay -- I get it. I 
                        understand.

           And he does -- we’ll learn more about that later.
           Impulsively, Desi hugs her. To her surprise, perhaps, she 
           hugs him back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. PETER'S TESLA / PINYON STREET - DRIVING - DAY

           The same day. Peter and Marissa are driving back from the 
           sheriff’s station:

                                 PETER
                        Well I thought that was very 
                        positive, honestly. Sheriff Roberts 
                        seems on top of it.

           As they turn a corner onto Pinyon Street, Marissa clocks...

           ANGLE: Down the block, Ryan Stump speaks into the passenger 
           window of a hatchback. The driver’s tinted window is rolled 
           up. We can’t see who is inside.

           Ryan Stump spots the oncoming Tesla and taps the hood of the 
           car as if alerting the driver. The hatchback guns to life and 
           pulls a U-y, driving away from them.

           Marissa watches it go, gripped by doubt. Is it the same car? 
           Is she being paranoid?

                                 MARISSA
                        Peter --

           Peter HONKS the horn, interrupting Marissa.

                                 PETER
                             (to Harris house, 
                              shouting)
                        Lyla! We’re here!
                             (to Marissa)
                        I’m sorry, what were you about to 
                        say, honey?

           Marissa gazes after the hatchback. It’s turned a corner and 
           is gone.

                                 MARISSA
                        Nothing.

           EXT. THE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - EVENING

           Peter is on his hands and knees, scrubbing the blood out of 
           the door. He looks up to the Stump house -- and sees no one 
           watching.

           He resumes scrubbing.
                                 MARISSA (PRE-LAP)
                        Last time I showed you how banged 
                        up the old floors were...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           ON AN IPHONE: We’re looking at the tips of Marissa’s boots 
           standing on immaculately polished, reddish-brown floors.

           (Until mentioned the whole scene will be shot on the iPhone.)

                                 MARISSA (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        And here are the new floorboards!

           Marissa advances through the living room.

                                 MARISSA (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        The wood is Johnson Cherry, which I 
                        love for its deep henna hues that 
                        instantly make any room look a 
                        touch more refined. We’re using it 
                        throughout most of the house, 
                        including the kitchen... 

           Marissa enters...

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           STILL ON THE IPHONE: Marissa keeps talking.

                                 MARISSA (O.C.)
                        It’s a great wood for families, 
                        because its dark stain can hide 
                        messes --

           She cuts off, noticing that Lyla is in the shot. Standing at 
           the sink, washing the dishes.

                                 MARISSA  (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Ugh! Lyla! What are you doing?

           Here we EXIT the iPhone footage and resume normal camerawork.

                                 LYLA
                        You told me to wash the dishes!

                                 MARISSA
                        You ruined my shot!

           Marissa is suddenly very upset. Lyla’s mere presence can just 
           push all her buttons.
                                 LYLA
                        You told me you didn’t want to see 
                        them in the sink tomorrow morning, 
                        you said --

                                 MARISSA
                        You just have mess everything up, 
                        don’t you?

           Lyla is taken aback. She’s not used to such vitriol, 
           seemingly unprovoked.

                                 LYLA
                        What did I do?

                                 MARISSA
                        Of course you don’t think to 
                        apologize, either. Typical self-
                        centered, single-child, bratty 
                        behavior.

                                 LYLA
                        What?!

           Marissa, sensing she’s gone too far, puts her anger back in 
           the bottle.

                                 MARISSA
                        Just go to your room, Lyla. I need 
                        to get this done.

           Lyla turns and goes, shaking her head at Marissa’s 
           outburst...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LYLA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Moments later.

           Lyla enters her room and plops down on a bay window seat and 
           fires up a YouTube video.

           After a beat, something in the corner of her eye makes her 
           turn her head toward the front yard, where she sees...

           A WOMAN standing there.

           From Lyla’s vantage, it’s hard to make anything out. The yard 
           is dark. There are no streetlights. The Woman wears dark 
           clothes. A hood over her head, like the Nazgul in Lord of the 
           Rings.

           Lyla squints. Who is she? It’s unsettling, to say the least.

           We know who she is: The Woman In Black.
           Almost as if she knew she was being surveilled, the W.I.B. 
           cranes her neck and looks up at the window where Lyla sits.

           We still can’t see the her face from under the hood, but 
           she’s staring right at Lyla.

           A sense of dread grips our hero.

                                 LYLA
                        DAD! I think there’s someone at the 
                        door!

                                 MARISSA (O.S.)
                        Your father’s in the shower.

           Lyla stares down at the Woman.

                                 LYLA
                        Can you see who it is?

                                 MARISSA (O.S.)
                        Lyla, you’re ruining my audio!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           Lyla approaches the front door tentatively. She’s no pushover 
           but there’s something about the Woman that makes her nervous.

           Lyla grips the door knob. Turns it.

                                 LYLA
                        Come on, dummy. What are you afraid 
                        of?

           She swings open the door --

           And nothing is there. The front yard is empty. Lyla cranes 
           her head outside --

           LYLA’S POV: We PAN from left to right as we look around. It 
           is utterly empty. Just the Danvers-Cho house’s immaculate 
           yard, and the much less immaculate yards of the neighbors.

           Lyla turns back inside and --

           Holy shit! The W.I.B. is inside the house! How did she get 
           there? We have no idea. We’re not going to worry about that 
           now, because...

           The Woman reaches out toward Lyla and utters an unnatural, 
           frog-croak WAIL. 
           It’s the first time the woman has made any noise other than 
           that scratching sound, and boy is it unnerving. Like the 
           death rattle of a thousand animals.

           Lyla jumps back. Gives a strangled CRY.

           W.I.B. takes a step forward, and we see her closely for the 
           first time. Her clothes filthy, stained with what seems like 
           centuries of grime and oil. Her hair is matted and dark.

           But that’s not the worst part. Her toenails are long talons. 
           Her skin is cracked in dozens of places, all seeping out a 
           dark pus.

           With each step she takes revolting COCKROACHES slip out of 
           her dress and land on the floor by her feet, squirming and 
           writhing. SPIDERS crawl out of her sleeves onto her hands.

           And her eyes ... there’s nothing there. Just pallid skin 
           where her sockets should be. Terrifying.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus fucking Christ!

           The monster steps forward, SCRATCHING the floor with its long 
           nails.

           Lyla moves back -- right into the door. She reaches for the 
           handle frantically, but her hand keeps slipping. She can’t 
           take her terrified eyes off the monster...

           The woman reaches out a CLAW, long grimy blades for nails, a 
           centipede crawling draped along its knuckles like a ring. 
           It’s inches from Lyla’s quivering face...

           Lyla again reaches for the door knob. Tries to turn it --

           The Woman takes another step forward, leaving a grimy 
           FOOTPRINT and a BLOODWORM on the floor.

           Lyla shuts her eyes. SCREAMS.

           The Woman’s nail rakes Lyla’s cheek...

                                 PETER (O.C.)
                        Lyla?!

           Lyla opens her eyes. The woman is gone.

           The door is open behind her, letting in a small gust of wind. 
           There at the top of the stairs, in a bathrobe, is her dad.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, what’s wrong!?
           Peter rushes down the stairs and grabs her by the shoulders.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        You’re white as sheet -- what’s 
                        wrong? You shouted...

           Lyla looks around. There’s nothing. She touches her face 
           where the Woman grazed her.

                                 LYLA
                        There was a woman -- right here. 
                        She was ...

           Lyla looks to the spot where the woman was. No footprint.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        What the?

           ANGLE: Marissa pops out of the kitchen where she was filming. 
           Regards the two of them.

           Peter presses his hand to Lyla’s forehead.

                                 PETER
                        You’re not running hot...are you 
                        feeling okay?

           Lyla shakes her head.

                                 LYLA
                        ...Yeah. Yeah. I just -- I thought 
                        I saw a woman by the door. But I 
                        guess it was my imagination.

                                 PETER
                        If something’s going on, you can 
                        always talk to me about it. You 
                        know that, right?

           Lyla embraces her dad. He’s provided her with some comfort. 
           And she’s not even sure what she saw was there.

                                 LYLA
                        Thanks, Dad.

           And off Marissa, regarding this all skeptically...

           INT. THE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Later that night.

           Peter works on his iPad in bed. Marissa stands in the 
           bathroom doorway, adding rollers to her hair.
                                 MARISSA
                        Attention-seeking behavior is 
                        typical of girls her age. 
                        Especially in these circumstances. 
                        But Dr. Connor says we can’t 
                        indulge it.

                                 PETER
                        Sweetie, what are you talking 
                        about?

                                 MARISSA
                        Her Electra complex! Lyla made up 
                        this fantasy about seeing this 
                        woman to manipulate us.

                                 PETER
                        Electra complex? She just got a bit 
                        shook up after the graffiti on the 
                        door today.

                                 MARISSA
                        It starts with “just a bit shook 
                        up” and then it goes to “anxious” 
                        and soon it becomes “we need to 
                        move back to San Francisco.”

           Peter glances up at his wife.

                                 PETER
                        I don’t think that’s what this is.

                                 MARISSA
                        The move represents the new -- new 
                        job, new house, and, I hate to say 
                        it, a new family. She resents the 
                        new mother. She wants to kill her 
                        and sleep with the father. 

                                 PETER
                        That’s disgusting!

           Marissa goes to the window, unperturbed. She reaches for the 
           curtains to close them.

                                 MARISSA
                        Metaphorically -- honestly, you’re 
                        so literal sometimes! It’s about 
                        returning to the idyllic past.

           Peter gives Marissa a flat look. He puts down his iPad.
                                 PETER
                        Can we just put today behind us?
                             (beat)
                        Sweetie?

           But something out the window has caught Marissa’s eye.

           ANGLE: The hatchback from earlier is once again idling out 
           front. The DRIVER is again obscured, but seems to stare right 
           at their window.

           Peter clocks Marissa’s concern --

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Something wrong?

                                 MARISSA
                        There’s a car out there. I’ve seen 
                        him a couple times now -- earlier 
                        today, with Ryan Stump.

           ANGLE: We PUSH IN on the driver. Still just a dark outline, 
           faintly backlit by the green glow of the car console. The 
           Driver’s anonymity is somehow ominous.

                                 MARISSA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I think he’s watching us.

           Peter rises. Makes for the window.

           But just as he does, the hatchback’s engine sputters to life. 
           The car slowly drives away.

           Peter arrives in time to watch it go.

                                 PETER
                        Looks like they’re not sticking 
                        around.

                                 MARISSA
                        You’re not gonna do anything?

           A beat. Peter senses this is a test.

                                 PETER
                        If he comes back, I’ll call the 
                        Sheriff.
                             (beat)
                        What else do you want me to do?

           Marissa searches her husband’s eyes. Shakes her head. He’s 
           not taking it as seriously as she is. She brushes by him.

           And off Peter, unsure of what he did wrong...
           EXT. PINYON STREET - MORNING

           The next day. The sun rises over the tree-lined street. 
           Beautiful, calm.

           We PRE-LAP a BUZZING...

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - DESI'S ROOM - MORNING

           It’s almost mid-morning, but Desi slumbers away on his bed, 
           drooling a bit.

           ANGLE: Desi’s cell phone, an old Samsung, BUZZES on his desk. 
           Then again. Then again.

           Desi stirs. Shuffles out of bed and stumbles toward the desk. 
           He picks up his phone. Sees he has 7 new messages from “cute 
           neighbor girl”.

           He opens it. We catch GLIMPSES of the texts: “im freaked out” 
           & “something weird is going on” & “we need to talk”.

           And off Desi, growing more concerned as he reads the texts...

           EXT. MT. TABOR PARK - DAY

           More forest than park. Lyla and Desi stroll among towering 
           pines and evergreen trees. She’s at the tail-end of her 
           story:

                                 LYLA
                        ...You probably think it’s 
                        bullshit. Seeing a ... whatever I 
                        saw. Even I think I’m crazy.

                                 DESI
                        No, I don’t. I believe you.

                                 LYLA
                        Why?

                                 DESI
                        You’ve seen my room.

           Lyla considers. Doesn’t buy it.

                                 LYLA
                        Nah, come on.

           Desi thinks for a beat. Debating whether to do this.

                                 DESI
                        Remember when you told me about 
                        your mom, and I said I understood?
                                 LYLA
                        Yeah?

           Desi reaches into his wallet. Produces a crumpled photo.

           CLOSE: The photo is a EIGHT YEAR-OLD DESI and his MOM before 
           a Christmas tree. She beams at her little angel. He smiles, 
           missing several of his teeth.

                                 DESI
                        Me and my mom. At our last 
                        Christmas. A drunk driver hit her 
                        when she was coming home from the 
                        hospital.

                                 LYLA
                        Jesus. I’m sorry. She was a doctor?

                                 DESI
                        Nurse.
                             (then)
                        After, you know ... it ... I just 
                        wanted to talk to her. I missed 
                        her, you know? I got an Ouija 
                        board, just to see if I could say 
                        hi. Then I tried like a seance, a 
                        buncha other things.
                             (beat)
                        That’s the real reason I got into 
                        all the stuff. That’s why I believe 
                        you.

                                 LYLA
                        And I thought you were just super 
                        creepy.

                                 DESI
                        Thanks.

                                 LYLA
                        Sorry. I shouldn’t be joking about 
                        stuff like that.

                                 DESI
                        Nah, it’s cool. I’d rather be 
                        creepy than haunted.

           Beat. Then Lyla laughs, thrilled her friend is learning the 
           art of trash talking. Desi chuckles too.

           Lyla reins it back in:
                                 LYLA
                        So what do you think? Did we move 
                        to an Indian burial ground? Am I 
                        cursed by some evil spirit?

           Desi thinks. Kicks a pebble on the path.

                                 DESI
                        Not that I know of. But lemme look 
                        into it. Don’t worry, we’ll figure 
                        out what this thing is.

                                 LYLA
                        Okay --

           Lyla’s phone DINGS. A text from Marissa: “Did you leave the 
           dishes in the sink?” Marissa uses proper punctuation in 
           texts. Another DING: “Please get back here and clean this 
           up.” DING: “Now.”

           Lyla ignores it.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Hey -- thanks for helping. And for 
                        believing me.

           Suddenly overcome by genuine gratitude, she gives him a hug.

           And off the two of them embracing...

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Later that week.

           Soul-deadening MUZAK is pumped out over speakers.

           Marissa stands before an aisle of bizarre “snacks”. Whole-
           grain Iranian crackers. Unleavened Latvian potato crisps. She 
           chooses a box, dragging her finger down the Nutritional 
           Information to...

           CLOSE: Her finger stops on “Sugar - 11g”.

           Ugh, unhealthy. Marissa makes a face. Puts it back.

           E/I. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT / PETER’S TESLA - DAY

           After the shop.

           Marissa sits in the front seat, scrolling through an app on 
           her phone, making sure she got everything:

                                 MARISSA
                        Asparagus, tabbouleh, bell peppers-- 
           This quiet moment is interrupted when a hand SLAMS down on 
           the windshield, SHOCKING Marissa.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!

           She drops her phone. Then sees the hand left a FLIER on the 
           windshield.

           She takes a beat to recover her nerves, then gets out and 
           looks at it:

           CLOSE: It’s a variant on the sign Lyla saw when they were 
           driving into Portland - “GENTRIFICATION KILLS -- KEEP 
           PORTLAND ALIVE” and on it, scrawled in caps, a personal 
           touch: “YUPPIE SLUT GO BACK TO FRISCO”.

           Marissa looks around to see who slammed it and catches sight 
           of the back of a strapping YOUNG MAN hurrying through the 
           parking lot, hoodie concealing his identity.

           He’s too far away to do anything.

           Off Marissa, heart still hammering in her chest...

                                 MARISSA (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Now they’re not content just 
                        graffitiing our home -- they’re 
                        following me to the store!

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Peter sits on the couch, a concerned look on his face as he 
           scrutinizes the crumpled up anti-gentrification flier.

           Marissa paces before him, a ball of nerves and anger.

                                 MARISSA
                        This has gotta stop, Peter. We 
                        can’t let Ryan Stump terrorize us 
                        just because we have money.

                                 PETER
                        Sweetie, we don’t know this was 
                        Ryan Stump. You said the guy looked 
                        young.

                                 MARISSA
                        Ryan Stump, or someone working with 
                        him. How else would they know to 
                        put “Frisco” on it?

           Peter rises. Tries to put comforting arms around Marissa.
                                 PETER
                        Maybe they saw the dealer plates...

           She shakes him off, steamed up.

                                 MARISSA
                        Open your eyes, Peter! It’s the 
                        same people who did the door, the 
                        same people watching us at night! 
                        It’s a campaign -- well, I’m not 
                        gonna let them. Their shitty little 
                        neighborhood is gonna change, and 
                        they’re just gonna have to live 
                        with it!
                             (then)
                        In fact, that’s what I’m going to 
                        tell Ryan Stump right now.

           Marissa exits the living room and heads into the foyer.

                                 PETER
                        Marissa! Hey --

           As Peter follows...

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Marissa heads to the front door; Peter is hot on her heels.

                                 PETER
                        Sweetie, they’re our neighbors. We 
                        can’t just declare war on them!

                                 MARISSA
                        Like they’ve done to us?! You can 
                        sit here and stew, but I’m not 
                        gonna let them terrify us!

           And with that, she turns the handle, swings the door open, 
           and GASPS as she sees on the porch...

           Marsha, the woman with the baby from the cold open, now 
           twenty years older. She’s with JACKSON (25), the baby -- now 
           a man.

           Jackson is fit, tall, and has sandy blonde hair. With his 
           neon yellow trucker hat, fake diamond earrings in both ears, 
           and a retro Trailblazers jersey, he projects a kind of 
           arrogant frat boy energy.

           Behind them stands Bo Harris.
                                 BO HARRIS
                        Peter, this is Marsha Kovacs and 
                        her son Jackson. They live down the 
                        way, family’s been here a long 
                        time.

           Peter nods politely, but doesn’t know what this is about.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Marsha here found a bucket of 
                        something that sure looked like 
                        blood in her back yard, and, aw 
                        hell -- I better let them speak.

           Marsha nudges Jackson with her elbow. He blushes.

                                 MARSHA
                        Go on.

                                 JACKSON
                        Mr. Cho, I was the one who painted 
                        your door. It was a prank meant to 
                        scare you because you’re new here.

           Marsha nudges him again.

                                 JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        I am very sorry. If you need any 
                        rooms in the house painted -- or a 
                        cabinet built or anything like 
                        that, I’d be happy to do that for 
                        you.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Jackson’s pretty handy, so be sure 
                        to take him up on that.

           Marsha takes Peter by the hand. Entreating him --

                                 MARSHA
                        I didn’t raise him like this. This 
                        is -- uncharacteristic. I’m 
                        terribly sorry as well.

                                 PETER
                        Well, I don’t know what to say. I 
                        appreciate you coming clean.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Listen -- Sheriff Roberts from down 
                        at the station told me y’all had 
                        some suspicions about Ryan Stump. 
                        You were worried he was trying to 
                        run y’all out of town?
                                 PETER
                        Should he have divulged that?

                                 BO HARRIS
                             (ignoring)
                        So I figured it was time to get 
                        everyone off on the right foot. Get 
                        us together like a neighborhood 
                        should.
                             (then)
                        We’d like to have everyone over 
                        this weekend for a little barbecue. 
                        We’ll introduce you to neighbors. 
                        Show you what this community is all 
                        about. Waddya say?

           And off that question hanging in the air...

           EXT. HARRIS HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

           A BBQ in full swing. Twenty-five GUESTS, including Ryan and 
           Chastity Stump, and Marsha and Jackson, amble around the 
           expansive but unkempt backyard.

           (Note: very savvy viewers will spot some of the people from 
           the cold open. They’re 20 years older, but still living on 
           Pinyon Street.)

           Bo mans a grill, flipping burgers and laughing.

           The Danvers-Cho clan arrives. Looks around uncertainly. Bo 
           spots them and gives them a big wave.

                                 BO HARRIS 
                        Peter! Marissa! Get over here!

           Lyla taps her dad on the arm.

                                 LYLA
                        I’m gonna go find Desi.

           Peter nods. The adults make their way through the party. Bo 
           greets them with a warm handshake.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        So glad you could make it!
                             (gesturing)
                        Now this is how Pinyon Street does 
                        a block party.

           Marissa looks around at the group of overweight, older white 
           people eating slaw, mac’n’cheese, burgers, and potato salad. 
           She suppresses a smirk.
                                 MARISSA
                        It’s quite charming. Very, uh, 
                        homey.

           Bo doesn’t clock her condescension. Peter does. Gives her a 
           warning look -- play nice.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Peter -- beer? 

                                 PETER
                        Sure, why not?

           Bo reaches into a cooler and pulls out a Bud Light. Instead 
           of handing it to Peter, he pours it into a “Prince William 
           and Princess Kate Wedding” beer mug.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        You’re the guest of honor. You want 
                        the special mug?

                                 PETER
                        Uh ... sure!

           We GO CLOSE on the mug being handed off. Stay close as Peter 
           brings it to his LIPS. Drinks. This weird close-up will make 
           sense later.

                                 BO HARRIS
                             (then)
                        Drink for you, Marissa?

                                 MARISSA
                        I’m fine, thank you, Bo.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        What about a burger? It’s my 
                        grandaddy’s special marinade.

                                 MARISSA
                        Oh, I don’t eat meat.

                                 BO HARRIS
                             (pause)
                        I should’ve guessed that. Well, 
                        don’t you worry, there’s plenty of 
                        fixings for you around here, and 
                        the dessert -- Chastity Stump’s ice 
                        cream cake -- all handmade. You’ve 
                        got to try it.

           Marissa’s lips thin. She couldn’t imagine anything worse.
                                 MARISSA
                        That sounds delightful.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - DESI'S ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Various newspaper clippings dating from the 1930s 
           up to the 1990s. The headlines share a dark theme: “Newlyweds 
           missing from North Portland” -- “Portland resident feared 
           dead” -- “Where are the Lathams?” -- “No bodies found after 
           police dredge Willamette”.

           PULL BACK and reveal the articles are arrayed on Desi’s bed.

           Desi shakes his head as Lyla reads one.

                                 DESI
                        I can’t believe something like this 
                        was happening right across the 
                        street and I didn’t know it.

           Lyla puts down her clipping, shocked and having a tough time 
           processing the info.

                                 LYLA
                        How many have there been?

                                 DESI
                        At least five, going back to like, 
                        the twenties. And that’s just what 
                        I could find in the library -- 
                        there was one in 1993, another in 
                        2006, and now this.  

                                 LYLA
                             (thinking)
                        Every thirteen years. So what do 
                        you think it means?

                                 DESI
                        I don’t know. We just have to 
                        figure out what the woman wants, 
                        why she’s there, why she...

                                 LYLA
                        ...killed the other people?

           Desi doesn’t want to voice those fears. Ignores it.

                                 DESI
                        There’s always a reason for this 
                        stuff. It’s never a random 
                        haunting. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DESI (CONT'D)
                        Spirits don’t just terrorize 
                        people.
                             (beat)
                        ...From what I’ve read.

                                 LYLA
                        What have I done?

                                 DESI
                        I’on’know. That house was empty for 
                        as long as I can remember growing 
                        up. Like ... no one lived there. No 
                        one played there. Maybe you moved 
                        in and like ... made it angry.

           Lyla looks helpless, hearing all this mumbo-jumbo. Desi 
           senses it. Takes her by the hand.

                                 DESI (CONT’D)
                        Hey, don’t worry. We’ll figure this 
                        out.
                             (off Lyla’s nod)
                        In the meantime maybe you and your 
                        family should stay at a hotel or 
                        something. 

                                 LYLA
                        Yeah, like Marissa will give up her 
                        Insta-dream-house-project.

                                 DESI
                        Do you really think it’s safe for 
                        another night?

           Before Lyla can answer we hear a faint RINGING from the yard. 
           Desi goes to the window.

                                 DESI (CONT’D)
                        They’re serving cake!

           EXT. HARRIS HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

           Later.

           Chastity is serving slices of her ice cream cake to a small 
           line of guests. Those who have it are standing around, 
           polishing it off with relish. 

           Lyla downs her portion like a POW. She finishes off the last 
           bite. Desi stands next to her, doing the same.

                                 LYLA
                        But damn, this is bomb.
                                 DESI
                        Toldja.

                                 LYLA
                        I’m gonna put my plate inside -- 
                        want me to take yours?

                                 DESI
                        Nah, I’m getting seconds.

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Even though the party is right outside, inside the house is 
           gloomy and quiet.

           The hall is clustered and claustrophobic. Lyla pads along 
           towers of cardboard boxes labeled “Photos” and “Books” and 
           “Videotapes”. Bo is a bit of a hoarder.

           As Lyla passes the dining room she sees --

           THROUGH THE DOOR: The Woman In Black.

           Standing at a cabinet full of china. Her back turned to Lyla.

           Lyla reels, gripped by fear. She’s about to bolt when The 
           Woman In Black turns ...

           And it’s not T.W.I.B. at all. It was just a PARTY GUEST (40s) 
           with black hair, in a black dress. A trick of the eye.

           The Party Guest smiles at Lyla.

                                 PARTY GUEST
                        Hi, honey.

           Lyla takes a beat to recover her words. She blinks, making 
           sure the guest doesn’t somehow transform back.

                                 LYLA
                        ...hi.

                                 PARTY GUEST
                        Whatcha doing inside?

                                 LYLA
                        I’m just -- putting this plate in 
                        the sink.

                                 MARSHA (O.S.)
                        I’ll take that for you.

           ANGLE: Marsha has emerged from the kitchen, hands in sud-
           covered, bright yellow rubber gloves.
                                 LYLA
                        Um, okay. Thank you.

           Like Peter’s beer mug, we GO CLOSE on Lyla handing off a 
           floral-patterned plate to Marsha.

                                 MARSHA
                        Sure thing, dear.

           EXT. HARRIS HOUSE - YARD - DAY

           Later.

           Bo, Ryan Stump, Peter, and Marissa stand in their own group. 
           A savvy viewer will note that Marissa hasn’t touched her 
           cake. We’re in the middle of a Ryan Stump story:

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        I told ‘em -- I’m not the one in a 
                        dress!

           Laughter from Bo and Ryan. Polite chuckles from Peter. 
           Marissa is aghast.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Well, Indians are funny people.
                             (noticing)
                        Marissa, ain’t you gonna have a 
                        bite of cake?

                                 MARISSA
                        I’m not very hungry. All that ... 
                        macaroni salad.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        It’s my wife’s specialty. It’d be 
                        nice if you showed your 
                        appreciation with a bite.

           Marissa looks up. Ryan is staring at her with particular 
           intensity. As are a few of the other guests.

           As if everything depends on Marissa trying the cake. It’s 
           unsettling.

           Peter is worried she’s insulting the Stumps. Intervenes:

                                 PETER
                             (too cheery)
                        It’s real good, honey!

           Beat. Marissa takes in the stony gazes of the Pinyon Street 
           neighbors.
                                 MARISSA
                        Fine. Whatever.

           Marissa cuts a bite off and we again GO CLOSE as she brings 
           the ornate bronze fork to her lips.

           Ryan Stump seems to relax. The chatter of the other 
           partygoers picks up.

           Bo claps Marissa on the back.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        So waddya think? Good, no?

           Marissa hates it.

                                 MARISSA
                        Mmmmmmmmm!

           EXT. PINYON STREET - DAY

           After the party. Marissa, Peter, and Lyla cross the street to 
           their house. Marissa is very worked up.

                                 MARISSA
                        What the hell was that -- making me 
                        eat cake!

                                 PETER
                        I think they just wanted you to, 
                        you know, be a part of the group.

                                 MARISSA
                        And you were the “Guest of Honor” 
                        and I was just “Marissa”. Fucking 
                        sexists.

                                 LYLA
                        The cake was good.

           They get to the front porch. Marissa turns to them, as if 
           she’s about to say something serious.

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s full of transfats.

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Some days later.

           Peter is filling out some official looking forms when Lyla 
           enters. She clocks the title: “Portland Public Schools - 
           Ranked Choice”.
                                 LYLA
                        What’s that?

           Peter keeps filling out the form as he talks:

                                 PETER
                        It’s for your school next year. 
                        There’s some really good options in 
                        this part of town. Surprisingly.
                             (beat)
                        Ninth grade! You’re growing up so 
                        fast.

                                 LYLA
                        “Shorter of breath, one day closer 
                        to death.”

                                 PETER
                        Please avoid saying such depressing 
                        things to your dad.

                                 LYLA
                        I learned it from your songs.

                                 PETER
                             (correcting)
                        Albums, kiddo. Pink Floyd did 
                        albums. One of the great losses for 
                        your generation is the inability to 
                        distinguish the difference.

           Peter slides the form into a manilla envelope.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Will you take this to the mail box?
                             (bribing)
                        I’ll order pizza later. We won’t 
                        tell Marissa.

           EXT. PINYON STREET - DAY

           Moments later.

           Lyla drops the manilla envelope into the mailbox, lets the  
           slot slam shut with a satisfying CLANG!

           She turns and starts walking back to the house.

           UNKNOWN POV: we watch as Lyla continues her little trek. And 
           then we start to follow her. Slowly. Methodically. We hear 
           the RUSTLE of clothes as we walk -- a woman’s dress perhaps?
           Lyla continues walking, blissfully unaware. Pinyon is utterly 
           empty. No one out walking their dogs. No kids playing in the 
           street.

           UNKNOWN POV: We get closer and closer to Lyla.

           She still doesn’t notice.

           UNKNOWN POV: We’re within touching distance now as we hear 
           the strange SCRATCHING noise and with that Lyla turns...

           ...and SCREAMS, seeing The Woman In Black right behind her!

           She hoofs it hard down the street, burning up pavement.

           T.W.I.B. moves like a damn arachnid, taking long, shuddering 
           steps on long, spindly legs. And with each step, she leaves a 
           trail of writhing bugs on the ground behind her.

           Even though Lyla is running, she doesn’t seem to be losing 
           any ground.

           Terrified, Lyla looks ahead. She’s almost home. She sprints 
           through the yard, knocking over one of Marissa’s succulents, 
           reaches for her keys, but drops it! Fuck.

           She glances back -- bad idea. The woman is entering the yard. 
           She scrambles for her keys, picks it up and turns the lock --

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Lyla SLAMS the door shut and leans against it, panting.

           Peter emerges from the kitchen, his face etched with concern.

                                 PETER
                        Lyla, what’s wrong?

                                 LYLA
                        There’s, uh --

           Before she can finish, Marissa appears from within the 
           kitchen as well.

                                 PETER
                        There’s a what?

           Lyla looks through the eye-hole: the yard is empty.

           Lyla doesn’t know what to say. Is she going crazy? Is this 
           real?

                                 LYLA
                        A dog. It chased me.
           Peter crouches down. Gives his daughter a hug.

                                 PETER
                        Oh, honey. I’m so sorry.

           Marissa shakes her head.

                                 MARISSA
                        These people are reckless. Who 
                        keeps a dog off-leash? It can kill, 
                        you know.

           And off Lyla, still breathing heavily...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LYLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Moments later.

           Lyla lies on her bed, staring up at the ceiling. Trying to 
           calm herself down by breathing in and out.

           She’s genuinely frightened. Half afraid of the woman, half 
           paranoid her sanity is slipping.

           And just as she’s breathed herself into a semi-calmer 
           state...

           LOW ANGLE ON: The closet door. It opens SILENTLY. For a 
           moment all we can see are the bottoms of pants and dresses. 
           And then the clothes give way and out come one of T.W.I.B.’s 
           feet -- blackened with filth and grime, accompanied by its 
           usual retinue of creepy-crawlies. Disgusting.

           Lyla glances up, having heard something.

           T.W.I.B. takes another step.

           Lyla’s eyes go wide as dinner saucers.

           T.W.I.B. is right there. Eyeless face gazing directly at 
           Lyla. A few feet away.

           But Lyla doesn’t run this time. There’s some courage left in 
           her.

                                 LYLA
                        What do you want with me?

           Instead of responding, the woman opens her mouth. In the 
           place of normal teeth are long, slender blades -- like the 
           teeth of an angler fish. No tongue. And worst of all, 
           crawling out of this horrible maw is a gaggle of centipedes.

           Lyla’s courage evaporates. She tries to run --
           But one of T.W.I.B.’s long, slender arms SHOOTS OUT and grabs 
           Lyla by the hair.

           She cries out in pain as...

           CLOSE: Her hair TEARS at the root, near the temple.

           The hair RIPS out as Lyla breaks free -- but she stumbles in 
           the process, and T.W.I.B. grabs onto her ankle.

           We’re CLOSE on Lyla’s terrified face, tears streaming down 
           her cheeks, bleeding from her temple, mouth open in a rictus 
           of horror as she is dragged back toward the monster and...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LYLA'S ROOM - DAY

           Lyla SLAMS up, covered in sweat.

           It was a dream.

           She gets out of bed. Goes to the closet and throws open the 
           door. She rifles through the dresses, the hanging pants -- 
           just to be sure. There’s nothing there.

           Lyla smiles, suddenly relieved. She falls back on her bed. 
           But her smile is short-lived.

           Because when she touches the side of her head, she brings 
           back her finger, wet with blood.

           And off this we hear:

                                 PETER (PRE-LAP)
                        A woman did this?

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Peter is dabbing a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol. Marissa 
           looks on skeptically. She doesn’t like what she’s been 
           hearing.

           Lyla nods in response to his question. Peter dabs at the 
           hair; she fidgets.

                                 PETER
                        Hold still.

                                 LYLA
                        I know it all sounds ...

                                 MARISSA
                        ...fantastical.
                                 LYLA
                        But this woman, or thing, I’ve seen 
                        her twice now. Remember when I saw 
                        someone out on the porch and 
                        freaked out?
                             (off Peter’s nod)
                        That was her. And now today ... I 
                        was having this dream, and she was 
                        in it.

                                 MARISSA
                        So it was a dream.

           Peter glances Marissa’s way -- let her talk.

                                 LYLA
                        And when I woke up, my hair was 
                        pulled out. Just like it was in the 
                        dream.

           Peter stares at his daughter, worried.

                                 PETER
                        What does she look like?

           Marissa leans back against the door jamb, exasperated that 
           he’s indulging Lyla.

                                 LYLA
                        She’s dressed in black. She has ... 
                        long nails. Like, overgrown. And no 
                        eyes. It’s just skin. And her 
                        teeth...
                             (shudders)
                        They’re like knives.

           Lyla looks at her dad, scared now that’s she’s voiced it. 
           Somehow it’s become more real.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Dad, Desi found things out about 
                        this house. People disappear from 
                        here -- it’s not safe.
                             (then)
                        I don’t want to be here anymore.

           Peter nods. Hugs his daughter tight.

           Over her shoulder, he sees Marissa giving him a look -- I 
           told you this would happen.

           EXT. PINYON STREET - DAY

           A bit later.
           Lyla emerges from the house and heads over to the Harris 
           residence.

           ANGLE: on a bay window in the living room where...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ....Peter and Marissa watch Lyla cross. Peter turns to his 
           wife.

                                 PETER
                        It’ll be good for her to hang out 
                        with her friend. Clear her head.

           Marissa judges him silently.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MARISSA
                        It’s exactly what I told you -- 
                        she’s manipulating us with these 
                        fears, and visions.

                                 PETER
                        You don’t think it’s alarming!?

                                 MARISSA
                        I think she’s making it up!

                                 PETER
                        Lyla wouldn’t lie. And Desi -- what 
                        about these disappearances?

                                 MARISSA
                        Desi is the 12 year-old son of some 
                        illiterate Sam’s Club member! And 
                        Lyla -- face it, Peter: she’s a 
                        brat! She’d happily lie to get her 
                        way.

           Peter glares. He’s a placid guy on the surface, but there’s 
           anger beneath. Marissa quickly retreats --

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Fine, then let’s assume she’s not 
                        lying. Let’s assume I’m wrong. What 
                        do we do now? We’ve finally settled 
                        into the house I’ve spent weeks and 
                        weeks slaving over, the neighbors 
                        don’t hate us -- and you want to 
                        leave? Because your daughter -- 
                        your almost teenage daughter -- is 
                        seeing a monster in her closet? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Because her on-the-spectrum friend 
                        thinks our house is haunted?

           Peter is a bit brow-beaten here. He knows Marissa is right, 
           intellectually, but in his gut he’s siding with Lyla.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        If we agree that’s out of the 
                        question, then Lyla needs to go see 
                        somebody.

           Peter doesn’t like it. Marissa softens her tone here --

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        She’s your little girl. She needs 
                        help, not indulgence. She’s 
                        hallucinating. It’s not normal, 
                        even after a big change.

           Peter hesitates, then nods in agreement.

                                 PETER
                        I’ll look into some names. See 
                        who’s on our network.

           Marissa nods. Happy Peter has been won over to her side. And 
           off her giving him a tender kiss...

                                 LYLA (PRE-LAP)
                        And now she’s in my fucking dreams!

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - DESI'S ROOM - DAY

           Lyla sits on Desi’s bed, drinking a Diet Coke. Desi is 
           listening to the tail-end of her story:

                                 LYLA
                        You know what I used to love more 
                        than anything? Sleep. I slept like 
                        a baby. Every night, no dreams, no 
                        nightmares, definitely no shit that 
                        messes with me in the real world.
                             (beat)
                        I swear to God, if this monster 
                        ruins sleep for me, I’m gonna punch 
                        her fucking tits off.

           Desi is thinking it over:

                                 DESI
                        It could be a spirit. There’s 
                        plenty in folklore that cross over. 
                        Baku in Japan. Of course, incubi in 
                        Western demonology.
           Lyla shakes her head. Can’t believe this is happening to her.

                                 LYLA
                        This whole move has been fucked -- 
                        ever since we drove up here. The 
                        dead rabbit, the fucked up room in 
                        the basement, then the blood on the 
                        door.

           Desi does a double-take. His memory jotted by something.

                                 DESI
                        What did you say?

                                 LYLA
                        I told you about the basement, with 
                        the weird crawly door --

                                 DESI
                        No, about the rabbit.

           Lyla doesn’t know where this is going. Shrugs.

                                 LYLA
                        Oh, I dunno. I found a dead rabbit 
                        the first morning here. Torn up. It 
                        had been got by a coyote, I think.
                             (then)
                        Why do you look like you’re taking 
                        a shit?

           Desi does, in fact, look a bit constipated. But in truth, his 
           gears are turning.

                                 DESI
                        Where did you find it?

                                 LYLA
                        The back of the house. Why?

           And off Desi, making a connection...

           MOMENTS LATER

           A YOUTUBE VIDEO fills the screen:

           A STREAMER, male, skinny, early twenties, gelled blue hair 
           and in an Iron Maiden shirt, addresses the camera:

                                 NORM NOT NORMIE
                        Ay, waddup!! It’s your boy Norm Not 
                        Normie here and you’re watching 
                        “Astral Frequencies & Paranormal 
                        Beasties”.
           Norm “Not Normie” sits in a room similar to Desi’s -- ferret 
           skeletons in bell jars, dreamcatchers dangle from 
           windowsills, pentagrams adorn the walls.

           The video is edited in the meth-addled, jump-cut style so 
           beloved by YouTubers.

                                 NORM NOT NORMIE (CONT’D)
                        Today we’re going to be talking 
                        about one of my absolute favorite 
                        Dukes of Hell ... The Liiiiiiittle 
                        Maiiiiidennnnnnn!

           Obnoxious DJ airhorns BLARE. Despite the subject matter, Norm 
           speaks in the relentlessly peppy, cheerful style of all 
           YouTube hosts.

                        I’m excited to dive in, but first,

                        I do, please like and subscribe!

           IN DESI’S ROOM: Lyla and Desi watch this ridiculous video. 
           She turns to Desi, not quite believing what she’s seeing. 

                                 LYLA
                        I can’t believe there’s a YouTube 
                        channel for this.

                                 DESI
                        Keep watching. I’m pretty sure this 
                        is it.

           And off this...

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           THROUGH THE OVEN: Marissa checks in on some BREAD PUDDING 
           she’s baking in a teal pan.

           She smiles, removes it from the oven and takes a big whiff.

           She snaps a picture of the bread pudding on her phone, posts 
           to Instagram, and then plugs in her phone to the outlet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - BATHROOM - DAY

           Peter shaves in the mirror. He’s meticulous. Even number of 
           strokes for each cheek.

           Marissa enters the bedroom from the hallway. Pokes her head 
           in the door.
                                 MARISSA
                        I made some bread pudding. The 
                        recipe is from The Food Lab!
                             (fishing for compliment)
                        Doesn’t it smell good?

           Peter stares ahead, still shaving.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 PETER
                        I was just thinking -- none of this 
                        was happening in San Francisco. 
                        With Lyla --

                                 MARISSA
                        She was plenty snotty there, too.

           Peter finishes shaving. Washes off and heads into...

           INT. THE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           ...the bedroom, where he goes to his closet. Pulls on a 
           sweater. He turns to Marissa.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah, she’s been fussy, but you 
                        haven’t been great at extending the 
                        olive branch.

                                 MARISSA
                        Excuse me? I’ve tried to bond with 
                        her plenty of times! I invited her 
                        to the Dan Hoyle one-man show, the 
                        lecture on vegetarianism and 
                        climate change at the De Young --

                                 PETER
                        That’s not what I mean.

                                 MARISSA
                        What do you mean?

                                 PETER
                        We’re getting off topic. I only 
                        meant -- if all it takes to end 
                        this is moving back, why wouldn’t 
                        we? I can get a job somewhere else.

                                 MARISSA
                        Peter, your new job is a big deal. 
                        You’re a founder now!
                                 PETER
                        Of the Portland office. We have 28 
                        around the world.

                                 MARISSA
                        How is it going to look if you just 
                        leave?

           Peter bites his lip, thinking. And then, realizing it as he 
           says it out loud:

                                 PETER
                        I guess it looks like I don’t care. 
                        And I don’t.

           Marissa isn’t used to this. Usually Peter just rolls over.

           But Peter is set on it. Without another word, he exits 
           into...

           INT. THE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           ...the hallway. He makes for the staircase. Marissa follows.

                                 MARISSA
                        Hey! This is a serious 
                        conversation, Peter. You can’t just 
                        walk away.

                                 PETER
                        I’m choosing my daughter over my 
                        career, Marissa. Is that so hard --

           We’ll never know what Peter is about to say next, because the 
           door to the Lyla’s bedroom BURSTS OPEN and in SHUDDERING 
           ARACHNID STEPS comes ... The Woman In Black.

           The monster gives no warning this time. No scratching. No low 
           wail. There’s not enough time for Marissa to scream as 
           T.W.I.B. lashes out with a one of her filth-covered claws and 
           grips Peter’s shirt and drags him toward ...

           ANGLE: That awful, bug-filled maw. Saliva and beetles and 
           gristle of some unfortunate souls dangle from the long thin 
           teeth like a cannibal’s Christmas tree.

           Now Marissa screams. Peter screams. Hell, if you’re in the 
           audience, you’re probably screaming.

           Peter pulls away desperately but...

           Those disgusting, rotted, monstrous teeth draw closer...
           T.W.I.B.’s vise-like grip on the collar of his shirt is too 
           strong...

           He’s inches away from her kisser when...

           Peter’s shirt collar RIPS and he goes TUMBLING down the 
           flight of stairs. There’s a nasty CRACK as he hits the 
           landing.

           Peter cries out in agony. He reaches for his ankle, which is 
           twisted at a highly improbably angle. It’s definitely broken.

           He looks up at the top of the staircase ... and T.W.I.B. is 
           gone. In her place is ...

           Marissa. She stands at the top of the stairs, a shocked look 
           on her face.

           Neither of them quite knows if what just happened, happened.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        ...did you see that?

                                 MARISSA
                        ...I don’t know.

           Peter looks down at his shirt collar. It is unbroken.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - DESI'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ON SCREEN: We’re back to “Norm Not Normie” and his video on 
           “The Little Maiden”.

                                 NORM NOT NORMIE
                        So! One of the reasons I love “The 
                        Little Maiden” is she’s actually a 
                        helpful demon. You summon her, and 
                        she protects you from invasion, 
                        harm, and exile for thirteen years! 
                        Which, if you know anything about 
                        demons, is really good bang for 
                        your buck.

           Various old time-y WOOD ENGRAVING images of T.W.I.B. 
           slaughtering KNIGHTS and SARACENS flash across the screen.

           IN DESI’S ROOM: Desi and Lyla keep watching.

                                 LYLA
                        That’s her! That’s who I keep 
                        seeing!
           She’s excited by the breakthrough -- finally, some answers. 
           Desi is not smiling. Lyla clocks this:

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        This is good, right? Now we can 
                        like, stop it or whatever?
                             (then, realizing)
                        Why isn’t this good?

           As if to answer, we go BACK TO THE YOUTUBE VIDEO:

                                 NORM NOT NORMIE
                        Now, she does this with some 
                        methods that wouldn’t exactly be 
                        endorsed by Mr. Rogers, but more on 
                        that later. First, let’s find out 
                        how it works!

           Another DJ airhorn BLARES as a badly animated title card 
           zooms across the screen: “The Summoning!”

                                 NORM NOT NORMIE (CONT’D)
                        Summoning The Little Maiden is a 
                        four part-process. First, you 
                        invite your enemies to parley under 
                        a banner of truce, which, spoiler, 
                        is bullshit. Then, you mark the 
                        north and southern bounds of the 
                        site with the blood of an animal 
                        and your own blood.

           VARIOUS illustrations of the ritual POP UP as he talks.

                                 NORM NOT NORMIE (CONT’D)
                        Now, at each step of the summoning, 
                        the Maiden’s grip on our plane 
                        grows stronger, so it’s better to 
                        do the whole process as quickly as 
                        you can, as you don’t want to deal 
                        with a half-summoned Maiden -- 
                        she’s known to use teeth!

           An ILLUSTRATION of the Maiden’s terrifying chompers POPS UP 
           and we hear a RIMSHOT at this intentionally bad joke.

                                 NORM NOT NORMIE (CONT’D)
                        Now that last part is where things 
                        get tricky. You need to collect the 
                        essence of your enemies -- DNA, 
                        basically. Why? Because that’s how 
                        the Little Maiden knows who is 
                        friend and who is foe.
           IN DESI’S ROOM: Lyla turns to Desi, the gravity of the 
           situation dawning on her.

                                 LYLA
                        So someone is summoning her ... 
                        because they think my family’s a 
                        “foe”.

           Desi nods gravely.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                             (beat)
                        What does the Maiden do to foes?

           And off this question, hanging in the air...

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Peter, using the handrail and Marissa as support, tries to 
           rise.

                                 MARISSA
                        Come on, we’ll get you to the car 
                        and take you to the ER.

           Peter pulls himself up gingerly. Takes a step down -- and 
           then falls! Pain shoots through him -- he screams, grabbing 
           his messed up ankle.

                                 PETER
                        FUCK!

                                 MARISSA
                        I’ll just call 911.

                                 PETER
                        No, I can make it. Just give me a 
                        minute.

           As Peter sits on the stairs, collecting himself, we hear an 
           old folksy VOICE:

                                 BO HARRIS (O.S.)
                        Is everything all right?

           Marissa opens the door. It’s their friendly neighbor Bo.

           He looks past Marissa. Sees Peter seated on the floor in 
           obvious pain.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        I was passing by and heard 
                        hollerin’. Wanted to make sure you 
                        all were fine.
                                 MARISSA
                        Peter fell down the stairs.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Oh, that doesn’t sound too good -- 
                        mind if I come in and check it out?

                                 MARISSA
                             (nods)
                        Can you dial the hospital -- have 
                        them send an ambulance?

           Bo enters the house. Comes over and crouches by the ankle.

                                 PETER
                        Marissa, I can make it to the car.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        You never want to be too careful 
                        with bones, Pete. An acquaintance 
                        of my brother sprained his ankle 
                        years back, never went to see a 
                        doctor. Fifteen years later, he had 
                        to get it amputated. Turns out he 
                        was grinding down the joint the 
                        whole time, and one day his foot 
                        just quit on him.

           Marissa has grown impatient.

                                 MARISSA
                        Bo, the hospital?

           Bo fake slaps his forehead -- duh.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        I’ll get right on that.

           Bo produces his cell phone. Dials and heads into the kitchen.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                             (to phone)
                        Yeah, I’m at the Cho residence --

                                 MARISSA
                        Danvers-Cho!

           Bo ignores this.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        We’ve had a bit of an accident.

           Bo wanders out of earshot. Peter glares at Marissa.
                                 MARISSA
                        What? You wanted me to just let you 
                        limp over to the car?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HARRIS HOUSE - DESI’S ROOM - DAY

           The video is over.

           We don’t fully know what Lyla and Desi have seen, but they’re 
           both speechless.

           After a beat, Lyla gathers her wits:

                                 LYLA
                        We have to show this to my Dad. 
                        It’s all there -- he’ll believe me.

           And off Desi’s nod...

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Marissa pops open a La Croix. Hands it to Peter. In the 
           background we can hear the murmur of Bo talking to the 911 
           operator.

                                 MARISSA
                        How are you feeling?

           Peter taps his ankle experimentally.

                                 PETER
                        It doesn’t hurt.

                                 MARISSA
                        That’s not good. If it hurts, it 
                        means it’s not broken. If it 
                        doesn’t, your body is flooding you 
                        with adrenaline to dull the pain.

           Peter looks down at his un-ripped shirt. Back up to Marissa.

                                 PETER
                        You saw it, right? That ... thing?

                                 MARISSA
                        I don’t know. I think I did, but it 
                        was only a second.

                                 PETER
                        It was just what Lyla described.
           At this, Bo’s voice grows louder and we catch the tail-end of 
           the call. As he re-enters:

                                 BO HARRIS
                        That’s right, 48 North Pinyon. P-I-
                        N-Y-O-N. Please hurry.
                             (beat)
                        Thank you, God bless.

           Bo hangs up. Smiles cheerfully.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        They’re on their way. I’ll keep you 
                        company while you wait.

           Bo looks around the foyer admiringly. He nods with his head 
           back to the kitchen.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        You know, when I was on the phone, 
                        I couldn’t help but admire what 
                        you’ve done with the place. Subway 
                        tile back splash in the kitchen. 
                        Recessed lighting. The fence -- 
                        it’s all so tasteful.

           Marissa isn’t really paying attention. She’s tending to 
           Peter’s ankle.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear what I said?

                                 MARISSA
                        I’m sorry -- what was that?

                                 BO HARRIS
                        That’s one of the problems with 
                        people like you. You never listen. 
                        Even when it’s for your benefit.

           Bo says all of this with a smile, which makes it very 
           disarming.

                                 MARISSA
                        Excuse me?

                                 BO HARRIS
                        I said, I admire the improvements 
                        you made to the house.

           Peter is sweating profusely. He mops his brow.

                                 PETER
                        Thank you, Bo.
                                 BO HARRIS
                        ‘Course there’s been more than a 
                        king’s share of people who’ve moved 
                        into this house over the years. And 
                        they’ve all brought their own 
                        style. Added personal touches. And 
                        one by one, after they move on, we 
                        always restore her to her former 
                        glory. We’ll do the same thing once 
                        you leave.

           His tone is still sunny as ever, but by now Marissa and Peter 
           realize that something is wrong.

                                 MARISSA
                        Bo ... who says we’re going 
                        anywhere?

           Bo doesn’t say anything. He just smiles at them. Smiles and 
           smiles and smiles. It’s incredibly unsettling.

           Now freshly terrified, Marissa tries to help Peter up --

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Peter. You’re in too much 
                        pain. We’re going to drive to the 
                        hospital after all.

           Very nonchalantly Bo pulls out a .357 REVOLVER from his belt 
           loop. Aims it at Marissa’s head.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Sit down, bitch. You ain’t going 
                        anywhere.

           EXT. PINYON STREET - DAY

           Desi and Lyla exit from the Harris house and cross the street 
           at a quick walk. They enter the front yard, crushing one of 
           Marissa’s perfect plants.

           Then approach the door, which they now notice is open.

           Desi and Lyla exchange an uneasy look. They pad forward 
           cautiously, entering...

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           ...and see nothing. Marissa and Peter and Bo are no longer 
           there. Has the T.W.I.B. taken them? We’ll see.

           Lyla hears some faint noise coming from the kitchen.
                                 BO HARRIS (O.S.)
                        Oh, I can’t wait to try this...

           She motions to it. She and Desi push open the door and see...

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           A strange, horrific tableaux.

           Five people in the same Haz-Mat suits as the cold open -- Bo, 
           Ryan, Chastity, Marsha and her son Jackson -- sit around the 
           kitchen island eating Marissa’s bread pudding.

           Leaning up against the island like an umbrella is 12-gauge 
           shotgun.

           Gagged and duct-taped to a pair of chairs are Peter and 
           Marissa. Their wide eyes scream silently as they see the 
           children enter.

           Bo is bringing a bite up to his mouth when he hears a noise. 
           Sees the two kids in the doorway.

                                 DESI
                        Dad?

           A long beat.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Son, we’re going to need to have a 
                        talk.

           At this, Ryan Stump puts down his spoon and picks up a 
           tranquilizer gun that’s been sitting on the kitchen table.

           He shoots Lyla. The dart buries itself in her thigh.

           He shoots Desi.

           Lyla pulls out the dart just before losing consciousness, 
           taking us to...

           BLACK.

           Over which we hear MUFFLED CONVERSATION.

           Then we FADE IN on a GAUZY, BLURRY POV that gradually gains 
           focus and becomes...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Two men in Haz-Mat suits having a heated conversation before 
           us. It takes us a minute to realize it’s Bo and Jackson.
                                 JACKSON
                        ...it’s kinda brutal, Bo.

           Our POV moves around and finds Marissa and Peter next to us, 
           bound to their chairs with rope, mouths stuffed with dish 
           rags and bound with duct tape.

           We’re in Lyla’s POV. We turn back to Jackson and Bo. A look 
           of anguish and guilt on the younger man’s face.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        You wanted to take part in your 
                        first ritual, this is what it is!

                                 JACKSON
                        I thought it was just the parents -- 
                        she’s a little girl -- she hasn’t 
                        done anything --

           Bo claps Jackson on the shoulder. Buck up.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        I know it ain’t easy. It wasn’t my 
                        first time. But trust me. This is 
                        the only way -- the goddess needs 
                        three victims.

           Jackson is having a hard time coming to grips with this.

                                 JACKSON
                        We can’t find ... I don’t know, 
                        someone else?

                                 BO HARRIS
                        It’s for the community, Jackson. 
                        You see that, don’t you?

           Jackson hesitates a beat, very torn. Then he nods.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Good. Take the generator to the 
                        basement. Make sure the lights are 
                        on.

           Jackson exits.

           Bo clocks Lyla watching this conversation. He gets down in 
           her (our) face.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Lyla. I actually liked 
                        you. This’ll all be over soon.

           And off this, our POV once again FADES TO BLACK.
           Beat. Then we hear Marissa’s SCREAM:

                                 MARISSA (O.S.)
                        This is trespassing!

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Later. Lyla’s eyes SLAM OPEN as she comes out from under 
           sedation. Peter and Marissa have been ungagged.

                                 BO HARRIS  (O.C.)
                        I know, and it’s actually a lot 
                        more crimes than trespassing. 
                        There’s false imprisonment, maybe 
                        battery, and capital murder.

           Joining Bo in the room are Ryan and Chastity, Marsha and 
           Jackson. Faces cold and detached behind their YELLOW 
           FACEPLATES of their gas masks.

           Except for Jackson. His eyes shift back and forth nervously.

                                 PETER
                        What is this? Why are you doing 
                        this?

           Bo pulls up an ottoman. Sits right opposite them, like he’s 
           delivering a fireside chat.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        But our laws are funny. It’s 
                        illegal to set off fireworks, but 
                        if you move into a neighborhood and 
                        chase away everyone who lived 
                        there, it’s called progress.
                             (then)
                        We decided we weren’t going to let 
                        that happen here.

                                 PETER
                        Jesus Christ -- if you don’t want 
                        us here, we’ll move!

                                 BO HARRIS
                        It’s much bigger than just you, 
                        Pete. In every city, every town, 
                        you see the same thing. Rich come 
                        in, poor go out. It’s been 
                        happening in this town since the 
                        30s when the timber industry 
                        collapsed. Well, we figured out a 
                        way to stop all that.
                                 PETER
                        So why ... what will killing us do?

           Bo gives them an astonished look. A fat, crooked grin spreads 
           across his face.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Sorry, folks! I didn’t mean to 
                        scare you! We’re not going to kill 
                        you -- we’re going to sacrifice you 
                        to the Goddess.

                                 MARISSA
                        ...the Goddess?

                                 BO HARRIS
                        She’s our protector. She makes sure 
                        our neighborhood stays just the way 
                        it is. But she has demands. She has 
                        needs.

                                 PETER
                        This is fucking nuts.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Every thirteen years, she calls for 
                        blood.

                                 PETER
                        You’re sacrificing us because we’re 
                        gentrifiers?

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Hell no! We’re sacrificing you so 
                        we don’t get any gentrifiers!

                                 MARISSA
                        ... this is crazy ... you can’t do 
                        this... it’s impossible ...

                                 BO HARRIS 
                        We’re sacrificing you to SAVE the 
                        neighborhood, don’t you get it!?

           The cultists murmur in assent.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        Bo, we’ve wasted enough time. Let’s 
                        get this show on the road.

                                 BO HARRIS
                             (nodding)
                        You’re right. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BO HARRIS (CONT'D)
                        Chastity, Ryan -- you keep an eye 
                        on the proceedings up here.
                             (then)
                        Marsha ‘n’ Jackson ‘n’ I’ll start 
                        with the bitch. I’ve heard enough 
                        of her yapping to last a lifetime.

           Jackson and Bo grab Marissa. Brace her and force-walk her out 
           of the room.

                                 MARISSA
                        Heeellllp!! HEEELLPP!!!!

           The cultists chuckle.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Holler all you want. The whole 
                        neighborhood is in on it.

           Marissa blubbers and screams as the cultists drag her away.

                                 PETER
                        No, take m--

           Peter struggles against his bonds. Gets CRACKED on the temple 
           by the butt of Ryan’s shotgun for his troubles.

           Lyla cries tears of rage, seeing her dad get hit.

           Chastity and Ryan watch her squirm for a beat, then trade 
           glances -- dumb yuppies.

                                 CHASTITY STUMP
                        Check on the boy. I got these two 
                        here just fine.

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Desi lies on the kitchen floor, bound at his ankles, wrists 
           behind his back secured by duct tape. Out cold.

           Ryan enters. Gives the boy a glance, then notices the small 
           kitchen TV. He grabs the remote and settles into a chair. 
           Flips through a few channels until he finds --

           Wendy Williams? That’s right. Ryan is a fan of daytime t.v.

           He gives another look to Desi, then turns it up to a LOUD 
           VOLUME (he’s old).

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THE HOUSE - SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The sub-basement is utterly transformed.

           Work lights on bright yellow tripods have been set up in the 
           corners, powered by the generator. They illuminate the walls, 
           which are covered in freshly painted SYMBOLS.

           In the middle of the room, at the base of the wooden pole, is 
           a black wooden box filed with ash.

           Bo and Jackson and Marsha arrive with Marissa. They shove her 
           towards the pole and start to tie her up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Desi’s eyes flicker open to the sound of the Wendy Williams 
           studio audience clapping along to some point that the host 
           has just made.

           It takes him a moment for him to come to his senses and clock 
           Ryan Stump watching the TV.

                                 WENDY WILLIAMS (ON TV)
                        Now you all know the actor Ryan 
                        Gosling --

           Ryan nods like he’s in the audience.

                                 RYAN STUMP
                        Good actor. Very good actor.

           Seeing Ryan is distracted, Desi sits up silently and scoots 
           over to a cabinet.

           He sits with his back against the corner of the cabinet and 
           runs his wrists up and down along the edge.

           CLOSE: The tape begins to abrade.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The CAMERA circles around THREE CULTISTS as they chant in an 
           hushed, ELDRITCH TONGUE.

           At the center of that circle, bound to the pole with leather 
           straps around the neck and waist and legs is Marissa. Bug-
           eyed with fear. Sweating madly.
           Bo is the master of ceremonies. He stands above the box 
           holding a vial of blood.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Oh Maiden, accept essence of your 
                        supplicant, willingly offered.

           Bo pours the vial of blood into the box. It seems to rock and 
           shake as the chanting grows louder.

           Bo pulls out a match. Strikes it.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Oh Maiden, accept fire to bind our 
                        covenant.

           He drops the match into the black box. Something in it 
           catches fire.

           The chanting grows louder.

           Bo retrieves a gold fork in a plastic baggie. 

           CLOSE: There are some crumbs on it. We might remember it as 
           the fork Marissa used during the barbecue.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Oh Maiden, accept essence of your 
                        sacrifice, unknowingly taken.

           The chanting grows louder.

           Bo drops the fork in the black box.

           All chanting stops. There is silence.

           Suddenly the box emits that eerie wailing.

           Marissa’s eyes dart from side to side, horrified.

           The wailing increases in volume, growing louder and more 
           terrifying and as the CAMERA circles the cultists we WIPE 
           FRAME with one of their heads and when we come out the other 
           side...

           THE LITTLE MAIDEN looms before Marissa, somehow larger than 
           we’ve seen her before. She sniffs. SNIFFS. A blind hunter 
           searching out its prey.

           The chanting resumes, minus a voice.

           ANGLE: Jackson is speechless by his first sight of the 
           Maiden. A combination of awe and terror. 
                                 MARISSA
                        You’re not real. None of this is 
                        real.

           The Maiden draws nearer. SNIFFING.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Peter’s shirt didn’t rip. You can’t 
                        hurt me.

           Marissa raises her hand to the Maiden. She wants to touch the 
           Maiden. Prove that she’s an illusion.

                                 MARISSA (CONT’D)
                        You’re just a vision. Y--

           Sniff.

           Then the Maiden’s jaw comes unhinged like an viper’s and in 
           one motion bites off Marissa’s hands! Marissa SHRIEKS as the 
           Maiden’s mouth tears away, revealing bloody stumps.

           Bo and Marsha look on passively as Marissa screams.

           Jackson is aghast by the blood and carnage, looking like he 
           might puke. As if the brutality of their actions suddenly 
           make him a normal young man, not an evil cultist.

           The Maiden finishes chewing the hands and turns her attention 
           to Marissa again. The Maiden opens her terrible maw and...

           Jackson turns his face away from the horrible spectacle, 
           unable to bear looking any longer.

           And off Bo and Marissa, looking on stoically as we hear 
           TEARING OF FLESH and SCREAMS of Marissa...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Peter and Lyla sit next to a third, empty chair. Chastity 
           Stump sits across from them.

           Marissa’s faint SHRIEKS are audible from downstairs.

                                 PETER
                        Please. You don’t have to do this -- 

                                 CHASTITY STUMP
                        D’you think we like doing what we 
                        do? You think we get off on it? 
                        This is about survival, idiot.

                                 PETER
                        You can let Lyla go. She’s a kid --
                                 CHASTITY STUMP
                        You really don’t understand, do 
                        you?

                                 LYLA
                        I understand you’re a fucking cunt.

           Chastity is taken aback by Lyla’s fierceness. She’s about to 
           retort when they hear a final SCREAM from downstairs.

           She leers down at Peter. Nods in the direction of the sound.

                                 CHASTITY STUMP
                        I’d tell you to raise your children 
                        better, but in a few minutes that 
                        won’t matter, now will it?

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           THRWAAAAP! Desi saws through the final sinew of duct tape 
           using the cabinet corner.

           CLOSE: Ryan is totally oblivious. He claps along with 
           audience. The TV glowing in his eyes. Until --

           His body CONVULSES -- eyes rolling in their sockets -- and he 
           SLUMPS out of the chair, revealing A KITCHEN KNIFE in his 
           back...

           ...and Desi standing behind him, the assassin. He’s breathing 
           hard, trembling. His nerves wracked.

           Beneath him, blood pools and drips out of Ryan’s Hazmat suit.

           Then he hears his dad’s booming voice getting louder, off 
           which we go to...

           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Peter and Lyla watch as Bo and the cultists enter. To their 
           horror, the Hazmat suits are flecked with blood.

           Jackson looks shell-shocked, but Bo moves around like a 
           foreman at a construction site.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        All right, one down, two to go. 
                        Let’s do Peter next and get on 
                        outta here.

           INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Crouching by the kitchen door, Desi listens to dad. Heart 
           hammering in his chest.
           INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           As the cultists untie Peter, he turns to Lyla, face stricken 
           with panic.

                                 PETER
                        Whatever happens, I love you.

           Tears shine in Lyla’s eyes but her voice doesn’t break.

                                 LYLA
                        I love you too, Dad.

           The cultists grab Peter’s arms and stand him up. He winces as 
           they force-march him out of the room, pain shooting through 
           his broken ankle.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Dad --

           And now Lyla’s voice does break as her Dad disappears from 
           view. Now the tears stream freely down her face.

           Chastity sneers.

                                 CHASTITY STUMP
                        You cry, only now thinking of other 
                        people. But for your whole lives, 
                        you think nothing of others. 
                        Nothing of people like me. Like my 
                        family.

           Chastity looms over Lyla, dominating the frame.

                                 CHASTITY STUMP (CONT’D)
                        Just be honest, you hate us just as 
                        much as we hate you. Maybe more. 
                        But--

           CLOSE: A hand gripping an Amazon Alexa.

           ANGLE: Desi SMASHES the Alexa on top of the woman’s head. She 
           goes down in a heap, groaning.

                                 CHASTITY STUMP (CONT’D)
                        Motherfucker.

           The illuminated ring at the top of the Alexa BLINKS.

                                 ALEXA
                        I’m sorry. My mother always taught 
                        me not to use curse words.

           Chastity Stump continues to writhe in pain --
                                 CHASTITY STUMP
                        Stupid fucking yuppie shit --

                                 ALEXA
                        I’m sorry if I disappointed you in 
                        any way. You have a right to be 
                        angry.

           Desi brings the Alexa down on Chastity again, knocking her 
           out. He then goes to Lyla and undoes her bonds. When they’re 
           free she hugs him.

           He takes her by the hand.

                                 DESI
                        We have to go.

           Lyla doesn’t move with him. Pulls her hand away.

                                 LYLA
                        I can’t leave my dad.

                                 DESI
                        There’s three people down there. 
                        Plus the Maiden!

                                 LYLA
                        I know, I just can’t.

                                 DESI
                        This isn’t a game, Lyla. We can’t 
                        just shoot them all!

           Lyla thinks for a beat, then:

                                 LYLA
                        Why not?

           And off Desi, wondering what she means...

           INT. THE HOUSE - SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Mid-ritual. The floor of the basement is now SLATHERED in 
           fresh blood. The Maiden is not a neat eater.

           She stands next to Peter, head bowed. Like a robot who has 
           been powered off.

           Peter is strapped to the column and gagged at the mouth. The 
           cultists are in a semi-circle around him, backs to the door.

           Bo brandishes the Prince William and Princess Kate beer mug 
           that Peter drank from at the barbecue.
           He leers at Peter through the yellow face-plate.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        When you get to the next life and 
                        people ask what happened, just tell 
                        ‘em you had one drink too many!

           Bo laughs very hard at his own joke. Jackson does not.

           Then, suddenly gaining solemnity, Bo hoists up the mug as if 
           to throw it into the box:

                                 LYLA (O.S.)
                        Hey, fuck sticks!

           The cultists turn and see Lyla and Desi standing at the 
           entrance to the room.

           In Lyla’s hands is the 12-gauge pump-action.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what’s gonna happen: you 
                        untie my dad, or I’m gonna blow 
                        your fucking heads off. How’s that 
                        sound?

           Nobody moves for a beat. A standoff.

           Then Bo turns to Desi.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        I don’t know, son. How does that 
                        sound to you -- your dad dead?

                                 DESI
                        Just do what she says, Dad. No one 
                        else needs to get hurt.

           Bo trades looks with Jackson, the cultist nearest to Lyla.

           Jackson nods imperceptibly.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Son, we’re doing this for you, 
                        don’t you understand? It’s for the 
                        future generations. So a Harris can 
                        always live on Pinyon Street.

           Lyla clocks Bo edging closer.

                                 LYLA
                        Back up.
                                 BO HARRIS
                             (re: gun)
                        Do you even know how to use that 
                        thing?

           Lyla pumps the action bar back. Aims it. Yeah, she does.

                                 LYLA
                        Call of Duty, bitch.

           Desi glances back and forth between Lyla and his dad...

                                 BO HARRIS
                        You’re not gonna shoot anyone, 
                        Lyla.
                             (then)
                        Jackson, take that gun off her.

           Lyla aims the gun at Jackson.

           Jackson doesn’t move.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Jackson, I said take the gun!

           Jackson still doesn’t move. He can’t bring himself to.

           And Bo senses this. With a look of disgust he dives at Lyla --

           She turns the gun on him but he’s too fast -- he tackles her 
           and as the gun hits the ground --

           BLAM!

           Martha’s head EXPLODES in a mist of blood and brain matter!

           Jackson’s face twists from disbelief to anguish to spitting 
           rage.

                                 JACKSON
                        Mom!

           Seemingly gone mad, tears streaming down his face, he 
           scampers across the ground for the shotgun. Picks it up and 
           with a snarl, aims at Lyla --

           DESI impulsively rushes Jackson --

           JACKSON sees him coming. Swings the butt of the shotgun into 
           Desi’s jaw --

           EXTRA CLOSE: A tooth flies out of Desi’s mouth, soars through 
           the air ... and lands in the Maiden’s box.
           Oh, fuck.

           ANGLE: The Maiden slowly raises her head, as if activated by 
           the tooth.

           We CRASH ZOOM on Bo, still on the ground, as he realizes 
           what’s happened.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        Oh, no.

           Everyone stops their various struggles.

           Lyla on the ground. Jackson standing above with his gun. Desi 
           clutching his jaw. Peter bound to the pole.

           The Maiden sniffs the air for the scent, then turns onto Desi 
           like he’s a homing beacon.

           As she moves toward him...

           ANGLE: Bo is horrified for his son. Horrified that it could 
           all go so wrong. He pulls his pistol out of his pocket and 
           UNLOADS all six shots into the Maiden.

           She absorbs the bullets like they’re drops of water.

           And just as the Maiden draws near to Desi, lying helplessly 
           near Jackson and Lyla...

           ANGLE: Lyla reaches up and RIPS Jackson’s fake diamond 
           earring from his lobe.

           Jackson grabs at his bleeding ear in pain:

                                 JACKSON
                        Arrgghhhhhh!

           Lyla tosses the earring in the box. Two points!

           The Maiden stops reaching for Desi. Turns to Jackson.

           Grimacing, Jackson aims the gun at Lyla --

           ANGLE ON: Lyla’s face as it is suddenly DOUSED with blood.

           The Little Maiden has bitten Jackson’s head off. His carotid 
           arteries pump out blood at a healthy 60 beats per minute, and 
           then his headless corpse slumps off Lyla.

           Desi and Lyla rise as the Maiden NOISILY devours Jackson o.s.

           Bo is apparently devastated by what’s happened.
                                 BO HARRIS
                             (muttering to himself)
                        It wasn’t supposed to be like this, 
                        it wasn’t supposed to be like 
                        this...

           Finished with Jackson, the Maiden rises and turns slowly to 
           Desi.

           The young man immediately realizes what’s happened:

                                 DESI
                        The Maiden needs three -- my tooth 
                        ... it’s still in the box...

           The Maiden takes one of her lurching steps toward Desi.

                                 LYLA
                        Run!

           Desi turns and rushes for the small door!

           The Maiden wails and lunges after him...

           INT. THE HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Desi crawls out on the other side, almost free -- but he 
           trips, his leg caught on something.

           We’re CLOSE on Desi’s horrified face as he’s DRAGGED BACKWARD 
           through the door by...

           INT. THE HOUSE - SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

           ...The Maiden.

           She looms over her prey. No escape now.

                                 BO HARRIS
                        No!!

           Bo CHARGES the Maiden in desperation --

           She LASHES out, sending him crashing into Peter and the pole.

           Lyla CHARGES --

                                 LYLA
                        Die, fucker!

           Another arm LASHES out. Lyla goes flying across the room.

           Peter can only watch, eyes full of fear.
           Her enemies defeated, the Maiden turns her attention back to 
           Desi. She scoops him up like a ragdoll and brings him toward 
           her gaping maw...

           Lyla looks on in horror as...

           THE LITTLE MAIDEN’S POV: Desi struggles in vain against the 
           Maiden’s vise grip as he is brought closer and closer...

           ANGLE: Bo Harris, slouched by the box, SPITS in it. 

           The Little Maiden stops. Tosses Desi aside and turns to Bo.

           Bo looks to Desi as the Maiden approaches.

                                 BO HARRIS 
                        I’m sorry, son. I don’t want to ask 
                        for your forgiveness, but I hope 
                        one day you’ll understand.

           The Maiden looms over him.

                                 BO HARRIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s because I love you, son.

           We’re on Desi’s face as we hear the horrible flesh-tearing 
           sounds of Bo being devoured.

           Lyla rises. Goes to Desi and gently shepherds away his gaze. 

                                 LYLA
                        Don’t look.

           We catch a GLIMPSE of the Maiden hunched over what’s left of 
           Bo and then there’s a POWER SURGE -- the lights FLICKER and 
           GO OUT for a beat, then come back on...

           ...and then Maiden is gone. The only evidence she existed is 
           the blood streaks on the floors and walls and faces of our 
           protagonists.

           Lyla and Desi stand there, breathing hard. Shell shocked.

           It’s over. They’ve survived.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Lyla and Desi and Peter emerge, battered and weary and blood- 
           soaked from their ordeal. Peter is supported by Lyla, 
           hobbling on his one good leg.

           They stand for a beat. Then Lyla notices something.
           ANGLE: FIGURES in the neighbors’ windows. All of them 
           staring. Like people waiting for white smoke to come out of 
           the Vatican chimney.

                                 LYLA
                        Look.
                             (then)
                        Think they were in on it?

                                 PETER
                        Let’s not find out.

           He takes out his phone. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Tesla, turn on.

           ANGLE: In the driveway, the Tesla’s lights turn on and the 
           doors pop open. 

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Come on, kids. Let’s get the fuck 
                        outta here.

           Off which we go to...

           E/I. OREGON ROAD / PETER’S TESLA - DRIVING - NIGHT

           The Tesla purrs along a dark, tree-lined road.

           INSIDE: Desi and Lyla both sit in the back. A slant of 
           moonlight turns the seat between them pearly white.

           Peter is on autopilot. Desi is stunned too, staring out the 
           window. Lyla clocks this.

                                 LYLA
                        Hey, Desi.

           Desi turns to her.

                                 LYLA (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna be okay, you know?

                                 DESI
                        I know we are. It’s just -- my dad. 
                        I can’t believe he would do ... any 
                        of it.

                                 LYLA
                        He was just ...

           She trails off. How do you comfort someone in this situation?
                                 PETER
                        ...he was just doing what he 
                        thought he had to, to protect what 
                        he loved the most.

           Peter turns to them from the front seat. Regards the kids for 
           a beat, then turns his gaze back to the road.

           The kids nod. In their way, they get it.

           Lyla puts her hand in the gleaming patch of moonlight. After 
           a beat, Desi takes it.

           Lyla smiles, squeezing her friend’s hand. Then she turns to 
           the front seat.

                                 LYLA
                        Hey, Dad. Where are we going?

           Peter doesn’t respond for a long beat. Maybe he can’t process 
           that right now. But then:

                                 PETER
                        Somewhere with a Whole Foods.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PINYON STREET - NIGHT

           The dead of night. The lights are out in the windows, not a 
           creature is stirring. Pinyon suddenly feels devoid of life.

           A SHERIFF’S CAR turns a corner and approaches slowly. It 
           pulls to a stop in front of the colonial formerly known as 
           the Danvers-Cho residence.

           Out steps Deputy Roberts, the cop we met earlier. He sees the 
           front door is ajar. He advances...

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           ...into the pitch black abode. It’s even creepier now than 
           when the Danvers-Cho clan first moved in.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        Hello?

           No response.

           He flips on his flashlight. Moves down the hallway, shining 
           the beam through a door to the dining room. Sees nothing. 
           Then shines it through the kitchen door...
           ...where he sees Ryan Stump lying in a pool of blood. A knife 
           sticking out of his back like an exclamation point.

           Roberts unholsters his service weapon. He’s about to step 
           into the kitchen when he hears a NOISE coming from the 
           direction of the basement door.

           He takes a breath, knowing he’s about to dive into something 
           bad...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Roberts pads through the basement. Up ahead, we can hear the 
           indistinct MURMUR of two people talking. Light shining 
           through the door to the sub-basement.

           He moves forward...

           INT. THE HOUSE - SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

           The room is still a gory mess, the blood turned from vivid 
           red to rust.

           Two PINYON STREETERS, a man and a woman we might recognize 
           from the barbecue, are scrubbing away at the walls and floor. 
           Blood and soap suds drip down and mingle at their feet.

                                 MALE PINYON STREETER
                        I can’t believe Bo let this get so 
                        out of hand.

                                 FEMALE PINYON STREETER
                             (shaking her head)
                        We never shoulda let him be priest 
                        after his wife died. She was always 
                        the one with the smarts.

           Roberts emerges from the cubby door, gun in hand. His jaw 
           nearly drops at the sight of this ghoulish vision.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        Aw, what the fuck?

           The two cultists turn in surprise. They trade glances -- what 
           do we do?

           After a long beat:

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t believe when they told me 
                        ... we should never’ve let him just 
                        take over Charmaine’s duties.
                                 FEMALE PINYON STREETER
                        I was just saying that!

           And then we realize: Sheriff Roberts is one of them.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                             (oh well)
                        The Maiden got her three. We got 
                        thirteen years to learn from our 
                        mistakes. That’s all that matters.

           He points to the Maiden’s box at the base of the column.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS (CONT’D)
                        May I?

                                 MALE PINYON STREETER
                        With pleasure.

           Roberts walks up to the pit and grabs the Maiden’s box.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        Hey, we still watching the Ducks 
                        this Saturday?

                                 MALE PINYON STREETER
                        You know I wouldn’t miss it.

                                 SHERIFF ROBERTS
                        You two keep scrubbing. I want it 
                        clean when I call this in tomorrow, 
                        ya hear?

           The man and woman nod. Satisfied, Roberts head out...

           INT. THE HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           ...and we TRACK with him through the basement as he begins to 
           hum the theme song from “Friends”. He keeps going...

           INT. THE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           ...down the hallway, box in hand, outside...

           EXT. THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           ...down the front steps and out onto Pinyon Street. We TRACK 
           with him, humming the whole time, as he gets into his car and 
           drives off.

           And then we turn back to the house. We’re at some remove. 
           Looking up at this creepy colonial TOWERING over us.

           And as we linger on the house we...
           BEGIN TIMELAPSE

           Days, months, years roll forward in the blink of an eye. 
           Season after season, the weather changing, people and dogs 
           passing.

           And the house at the center of everything.

           Marissa’s yard becomes overgrown. The gentrification fence is 
           stripped. The new paint job fades.

           On and on time marches until a FOR SALE SIGN is planted in 
           the yard and we...

           END TIMELAPSE

           Into the frame comes a REALTOR (40s) we recognize from the 
           barbecue talking to a YUPPIE COUPLE (30s).

                                 REALTOR
                        Now this house might look a bit 
                        funky, but it’s got great bones, 
                        and the neighborhood is only going 
                        to appreciate.

           The male yuppie looks around.

                                 MALE YUPPIE
                        I love it. So charming!

           The Realtor gives a big toothy smile.

                                 REALTOR
                        Trust me, once people move to 
                        Pinyon Street, they never leave.
                             (then)
                        Let me show you inside.

           And off this image of the cycle repeating itself...
