                             The Worst Guy Of All Time, 

                          And The Girl Who Came To Kill Him

                                 by Michael Waldron
           EXT. DOWNTOWN ATLANTA - DAY (FUTURE)

           SMASH OPEN on the deserted I-85 just outside post-apocalyptic 
           Atlanta. That trademark ominous end-of-the-world ash just 
           hangs in the air. It’s disgusting. And probably radioactive. 

           The future sucks.

           SUPER:  2076

           A SHOT UP JEEP WRANGLER FLIPS INTO FRAME, landing on its 
           side. It’s been blown to shit by a squad of BLOOD GRUNTS, 
           menacing soldiers piloting badass futuristic HOVERCYCLES.

           One of the Grunts slings his PARTICLE RIFLE over his shoulder 
           and climbs onto the Jeep’s passenger door. He peers through 
           the busted-out windshield, then turns back to his comrades:

                                 BLOOD GRUNT
                        Did The Duke say what it looks 
                        like?

           THE BLOOD CAPTAIN, a hulking bruiser with a rhinoceros skull 
           tattooed across his scarred torso, pulls forward on his bike.

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN
                        Jesus, Derek, it’s a time machine. 
                        Just look for glowing blue 
                        crystals, or a fancy clock thing.

           The Grunt shrugs and bends over to inspect further -- BUT THE 
           WHEELS OF THE JEEP START SPINNING, and soon the Jeep itself 
           IS SPINNING ON THE ROAD, throwing the Grunt backwards--

           AND SUDDENLY A FREEDOM FIGHTER WITH A VELOCIRAPTOR PAINTED 
           ONTO HIS MOTORCYCLE HELMET BURSTS OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW. 

           Raptor CRACKS the Grunt’s neck, grabs his rifle, and BLASTS 
           two of the remaining three bad guys.

           Only the Blood Captain remains. HE FIRES AT RAPTOR, WHO LEAPS 
           OFF THE JEEP and rolls acrobatically to safety.

           The Blood Captain tears at Raptor on his hovercycle and TURNS 
           IT OVER, knocking Raptor’s legs out from under him. The 
           warriors get to their feet and BATTLE HAND-TO-HAND, both well-
           trained and deadly. 

           (This will get nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best 
           Fight, but it’ll lose to another, even cooler fight sequence 
           from later in this script.)
           Finally the Captain gets the upper hand. He grabs a downed 
           street sign and SWINGS ITS CONCRETE BASE AT RAPTOR, cracking 
           his dinosaur helmet. Raptor staggers backward and removes his 
           helmet, REVEALING:

           DIXIE (20s), a truly bad bitch with a scar across her eye. 
           She’s fucking furious about her helmet.

                                 DIXIE
                        Mother fucker!  This was my 
                        favorite helmet, it’s got a fucking 
                        velociraptor on it!  You can’t find 
                        these anymore, they’re--
                             (laughs a little as she 
                              lands on this)
                        They’re extinct!

           The Captain stares at her in disbelief. He scoffs.

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN
                        I can’t believe you’re a fucking 
                        woman.

           HE SWINGS THE POLE AT DIXIE AGAIN, but she ducks and RIPS IT 
           OUT OF HIS HANDS. SHE VAULTS OVER HIM, then turns and 
           LAUNCHES THE POLE JAVELIN-STYLE at the Captain, IMPALING HIM 
           against a guardrail. 

           She saunters over and whispers in his ear:

                                 DIXIE
                        Believe it.

           But the Captain isn’t responsive. Dixie nudges him.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God, are you already dead?  
                        Did you even hear that??

           She checks his pulse. Definitely dead. She KICKS his corpse.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        You pussy!  I wasted a great line 
                        on you!

           She grabs a NONDESCRIPT BACKPACK from the Jeep and throws it 
           on. Inside is a FANCY CLOCK MADE OF GLOWING BLUE CRYSTALS. 
           She hops onto one of the hovercycles and SPEEDS OFF.

           REVERSE ANGLE: A fleet of Blood Grunt vehicles and aircraft 
           are hot on her tail.
           As she hauls ass down the interstate, headed for a swirling 
           thunderstorm, she pulls an OLD DOG-EARED PHOTOGRAPH from her 
           pocket. She scowls at the picture.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        We’re coming for you, asshole.

           REVEAL: Pictured is a MILLENNIAL SHITHEAD flexing shirtless 
           in the mirror, flashing an awful, smarmy grin...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           CNN INTERVIEW

           THAT SAME MILLENNIAL SHITHEAD, way back in 2018. This is 
           BARRET (32), a social media-turned-reality tv star. He sports 
           a bright Hawaiian shirt and a ridiculous mustache, and is as 
           handsome as he is obnoxious.

           SUPER:  2018

           He’s being split-screen interviewed by ANDERSON COOPER.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        What, in your estimation, started 
                        the whole feud?

                                 BARRET
                        She took offense to a tweet of 
                        mine, something about Uber drivers.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                             (reading)
                        You initially said, “I’d rather 
                        drunk drive and kill a bus full of 
                        babies than ride with another 
                        annoying, poor a-f Uber driver.  
                        Grinning Devil Face Emoji, Eggplant 
                        Emoji, Splashing Water Emoji.  
                        American Flag Emoji.” 

                                 BARRET
                        Right, she got all hot and bothered 
                        cause apparently influencers aren’t 
                        supposed to have opinions?  So I 
                        clapped back.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        “Lena Dunham can eat my ass.”

                                 BARRET
                        You can say “eat my ass” on CNN?
                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        It’s permissible in a journalistic 
                        context, yes.

                                 BARRET
                        Sweet.
                             (straight to camera)
                        Lena Dunham Can Eat My Ass.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        So I take it you’re not here 
                        tonight to say you’re sorry.

                                 BARRET
                        For what?  I’m not sorry, I didn’t 
                        do anything wrong!

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        But with your social media reach -- 
                        you have millions of fans, many of 
                        them teenagers... To be demeaning 
                        those less fortunate--

                                 BARRET
                        --Is super hilarious.  Coop, I got 
                        famous for inventing the Dab-- 
                             (he DABS)
                        --All I care about is getting laid, 
                        and getting paid.  It’s not like 
                        I’m running for President or 
                        anything.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        Not yet, at least.
                             (then)
                        Ever considered it?  President 
                        Barret Dukes?

           There’s a twinkle in Barret’s eye as, for the very first 
           time, he imagines being President.

           MOS: Taylor Swift’s fuck the haters anthem “Shake It Off” 
           begins as Barret concludes the interview, standing to REVEAL:

           I/E. YACHT - DAY

           He’s on the bridge of a ridiculous YACHT (named the 
           “Titandic”) somewhere in the stunning South Pacific.

           Barret POPS A MOLLY, then goes Live on Instagram and SHOTGUNS 
           A BEER. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he steps outside and looks down at 
           the deck, where TOPLESS MODELS AND SYCOPHANTIC BROS are 
           partying in the pool. They see him and DAB in unison.
           Barret stretches and DABS BACK, a millennial Gatsby relishing 
           the good life. WE PULL BACK and realize that he’s naked from 
           the waist down. He has a nice, tan ass. Fuck this dude.

           TITLE APPEARS (in bright neon):  

                                The Worst Guy Of All Time,
                            And The Girl Who Came To Kill Him

           OPENING CREDITS

           T-Swift sings as we see glimpses of Barret’s rise to stardom:

           - He’s a regular high school kid in his first videos, posted 
           to eBaum’s World. The poor quality clips are just immature 
           pranks and Jackass-style stunts.

           - As he churns out more content, his following begins to 
           grow. The videos on his YouTube channel (handle: TheDuke69) 
           become edgier and more slickly produced. He really plays up 
           his bro-y, I-don’t-give-a-fuck persona.

           - In his biggest viral video, he invents the DAB dance move. 
           It becomes a worldwide sensation and his subscriber count 
           SKYROCKETS. He dabs with rappers Skippa Da Flippa and Migos, 
           and Carolina Panthers QB Cam Newton (the guys who actually 
           invented the Dab and made it famous).

           - Barret is now a bona fide social star, with a legion of 
           young fans. He appears in movies, on TV, and in music videos, 
           always flaunting stacks of cash. He even has his own clothing 
           and fragrance line at Urban Outfitters.

           - Clips of Barret hosting his dumb, millennial-focused 
           reality TV competition: The Memeing of Life. 

           - “Shake It Off” concludes as we arrive back on the yacht. 
           Barret pulls off his shirt, rips a line of coke, and does a 
           NAKED GAINER off the bridge into the pool below.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           I/E. UBER - TRAVELING - DAY (ATLANTA)

           Barret rides back from the Atlanta airport, suffering from an 
           awful hangover. His Uber driver tries to make conversation.

           (By the way: When Barret isn’t in front of a camera, he acts 
           and talks more like a real person, less “Yo it’s ya boi!”)

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Where you coming from?
                                 BARRET
                        The airport.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Well I know that, I picked you up.  
                        But where’d you fly in from?

                                 BARRET
                             (sighs, trapped)
                        Fiji.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Fiji, wow!  What’d ya do there?

                                 BARRET
                        Sex trafficked orphans.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                             (either didn’t hear that 
                              or is choosing to ignore)
                        Never been, I’d love to go.  I ask 
                        cause I actually host a travel 
                        podcast where folks I pick up 
                        discuss where they’ve been, what 
                        they did, was it fun...

           Barret is silent, in hell. But his driver persists, gesturing 
           to a microphone on the passenger seat.

                                 UBER DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Whatdaya say, wanna be on?

                                 BARRET
                        Sure, I’ll do it... But only if 
                        you’ll be on my podcast.  It’s 
                        where I interview Uber drivers and 
                        ask what the fuck went so wrong in 
                        their lives that they had to become 
                        Uber drivers.  It’s called “I Hate 
                        Talking To You People, Either Shut 
                        The Fuck Up Or Crash Into The 
                        Median And Kill Me, Please.”

           The driver stares at Barret, genuinely hurt.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        ... You’re a dick, man.

                                 BARRET
                        Yeah well, zero stars.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Zero stars for you too--!
                                 BARRET
                        Oh wow, too bad zero stars means 
                        way more for a driver than a rider--

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Not true, not true, they’re both--

                                 BARRET
                        You’ll get banned from the app--!

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        You’ll get banned from the app--!

                                 BARRET
                        You’ll be driving a fucking Vespa 
                        for Lyft you piece of shit--

           EXT. BARRET’S HOUSE - DAY

           Barret does a BIG JERK-OFF MOTION at the Uber as it drives 
           off. He has a fancy house on a fancy golf course. 

           INT. BARRET’S HOUSE - DAY

           Barret makes his way through his big, empty home. He grabs a 
           beer from the fridge and heads downstairs.

           BASEMENT

           On the walls are photos of Barret with other social media 
           influencers: Psy, Grumpy Cat, Salt Bae, the Cash Me Ousside 
           girl, etc. There’s also a poster for Barret’s reality show, 
           The Memeing Of Life, featuring his infamous catchphrase: 
           “You’re Unfollowed!” 

           The centerpiece is a huge, ridiculous painting of Barret’s 
           super jacked BITMOJI.

           He plops on the couch and checks Twitter. If we’re paying 
           attention, we notice that @TheDuke69’s profile picture is the 
           same photo we saw Dixie holding in the future.

           Plenty of folks support him, but Barret focuses only on the 
           negative @ mentions. He carefully crafts his response:

                                 BARRET
                        “Hey haters: line up behind 
                        @LenaDunham and eat my ass!”

           The @ replies instantly pour in. Barret grins, relishing this 
           stirring of the pot. We see him compose a tweet on screen:
           “Considering actually running for Prez, just to annoy all the 
           losers. The Duke could get some real shit done! #EatMyAss”

           He stares at his phone for a brief moment, contemplating, 
           then hits SEND. He flips on the TV and snickers to himself.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        I’m tight.

           But we HOLD for an extra, quiet beat, feeling at last what’s 
           beneath Barret’s “tight” public facade:

           Loneliness.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN ATLANTA / BARRET’S OLD HOUSE - DUSK (FUTURE)

           Dixie weaves through the abandoned city and across a brown, 
           dead golf course -- the same one Barret lives on in 2018. 

           She stops at the bombed-out remains of his house, shooing 
           away a few HUGE, GLOWING RADIOACTIVE ARMADILLOS before 
           ducking inside. They snort and slobber, it’s gross.

           INT. BARRET’S OLD HOUSE / RESISTANCE HQ - CONTINUOUS

           Some buff FREEDOM FIGHTERS usher Dixie in. Barret’s old home 
           has been turned into a SECRET RESISTANCE BASE. The Time 
           Backpack is torn off her and slid across a long map table to:

           GENERAL JACK HARLEY, leader of the Resistance, played by The 
           Rock. He opens the Backpack, its glow illuminating his face, 
           then turns to Dixie.

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        What Brave Men gave their lives so 
                        that you could acquire the 
                        Backpack?

                                 DIXIE
                        ... None?  I infiltrated the 
                        facility by myself, killed a ton of 
                        Blood Grunts, took down one of 
                        their dragon-shaped drone patrols, 
                        hacked my way into the vault, stole 
                        the Backpack, and escaped through 
                        the laser-guarded sewer system on a 
                        jet ski.  All on my own.  Sir.

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        Ah.  You seek to mythologize 
                        yourself as the lone hero of the 
                        Resistance.
                                 DIXIE
                        No, that’s just what happened, I -- 
                        look, sir, the next mission, the 
                        Final Mission, I want to--

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                             (mansplaining)
                        “Mythologize”, it’s when somebody 
                        creates an aura or myth around 
                        themselves that isn’t exactly true--

                                 DIXIE
                        I know what mythologize means--

           But Harley has already blown past her and is heading upstairs 
           with his troops. Dixie follows them into--

           BARRET’S OLD BEDROOM

           Two dozen embattled soldiers surround Harley as he gives a 
           speech. Dixie stands in the back with the JANITOR ROBOTS.

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        Gentlemen, today is the day.  The 
                        day of days.  Not just the day we 
                        turn the tide of the war, no, today 
                        is the day we lift the tide water 
                        out of the ocean, and replace the 
                        sky with that same ocean water!

           The soldiers ROAR their agreement. Dixie makes a face and 
           whispers to the Janitor Robots:

                                 DIXIE
                        The fuck is he talking about?

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                             (overhearing)
                        What was that?

           The embarrassed Janitor Robots move away from Dixie.

                                 JANITOR ROBOT #1
                        She was talking, sir.

                                 JANITOR ROBOT #2
                        It was really rude.

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        Did you have something to add, 
                        honey?

           All eyes on Dixie.
                                 DIXIE
                        Yeah, just -- how come you get to 
                        be the one to go back in time and 
                        kill The Duke?

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        You think it should be... you?

                                 DIXIE
                             (steps forward and nods, 
                              then pantomimes)
                        A thousand times I’ve imagined 
                        myself on top of him, legs around 
                        his waist and hands around his 
                        neck, his face red, eyes closed, 
                        struggling, sweating, begging me to 
                        stop but I just keep going--

           Awkward silence. Cleared throats. Harley cocks a wary eyebrow 
           at Dixie, who suddenly realizes how all that sounded.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh God come on, NO, get your minds 
                        of the gutter--

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        Legs around his waist, hands around 
                        his neck...

                                 DIXIE
                             (flustered)
                        Choking him to death!  

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        I mean, he was pretty hot when he 
                        was younger, but still--

                                 DIXIE
                        I can’t even -- look, nobody hates 
                        The Duke more than me!

           Harley is done with this conversation. He puts on the 
           backpack and sets the date to July 20, 2018.

                                 GENERAL HARLEY
                        Sorry, sweetie -- I’m going back to 
                        kill The Duke.  It sorta sounds 
                        like you just want to fuck him.

           BAM! 
           HARLEY’S HEAD EXPLODES FROM A PARTICLE RIFLE BLAST FIRED 
           THROUGH THE WINDOW. His headless body crumples to the ground 
           in a bloody heap. 

           Gore and viscera splatters everywhere, and as the Janitor 
           Robots immediately set to mopping it up-- 

           THE ROOF IS TORN OFF THE HOUSE and a squadron of Blood Grunts 
           REPEL DOWN from hovercopters, surrounding the good guys.

           A TOWERING FIGURE leaps from a chopper, landing with his back 
           to Dixie. Save for his face he’s ENTIRELY MACHINE, with FOUR 
           BADASS CYBERNETIC LEGS. He turns dramatically, REVEALING:

           THE DUKE -- AKA the older version of BARRET. He racks his 
           smoking particle rifle and air-jerks Harley’s corpse.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Holy shit, boom, headshot!
                             (to his Blood Grunts)
                        Round of dabs for your boy, that 
                        was tight as fuck!

           As the bad guys exchange dabs like morons, Dixie stares 
           daggers at The Duke. Finally he meets her gaze and stops 
           dabbing. He looks at her for a beat, then approaches:

                                 THE DUKE (CONT’D)
                        I know you.
                             (pause)
                        I saw the security footage, of you 
                        stealing my Time Backpack.  What’s 
                        your name?

                                 DIXIE
                        Fuck You.

           The Grunts look around, uneasy. Nobody talks to The Duke like 
           that. But he just starts LAUGHING HIS ASS OFF. So they laugh 
           too, at least until--

           DIXIE SPITS IN HIS FACE. A Blood Captain DRILLS HER in the 
           gut with his rifle, doubling her over in pain. Two Grunts 
           drag her to her feet, and the Captain is about to shoot her--

                                 THE DUKE
                        Dude, what are you doing?  We don’t 
                        just kill people.

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN
                             (re: Harley’s corpse)
                        ... But you just killed that guy--
           The Duke takes out his revolver and CASUALLY BLOWS A HOLE IN 
           THE CAPTAIN’S HEAD. He turns back to Dixie and runs his hand 
           along her cheek, making her cringe.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Sorry about that...
                             (reading her name patch)
                        ... Dixie.  Wow, you really put the 
                        “dick” in “Dixie”, huh?

                                 DIXIE
                             (massive eye roll)
                        Good one.

           The Duke pulls the bloody Time Backpack off Harley and 
           adjusts the date. We don’t see what he’s changed it to.

                                 THE DUKE
                        You sure went to a lot of trouble 
                        just so you could, I assume, go 
                        back in time and kill me before I 
                        take over the world?

           Instead of answering, Dixie BRUTALLY DISPATCHES the Grunts on 
           either side of her and produces a HIDDEN PARTICLE DAGGER from 
           her boot. SHE CHARGES THE DUKE--

           But just as she reaches him, he activates the Backpack and 
           DISAPPEARS IN A FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT. Dixie is left standing 
           there alone--

           THEN THE DUKE REAPPEARS BEHIND HER. HE KICKS HER TO THE 
           GROUND and stands over her, grinning that smarmy grin.

                                 THE DUKE (CONT’D)
                        Guess what I just did.  I just went 
                        back to Ancient Egypt and stand-up 
                        69’ed Cleopatra, it was very cool.
                             (re: her particle dagger)
                        So clearly you do think you can 
                        kill me.

                                 DIXIE
                        I was born to kill you, Duke.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Oh, I believe you can kill The 
                        Duke.  But Barret?  The old me?  
                        That guy’s a whole different story.
                             (kneels down)
                        Tell me, Dixie: If you made it back 
                        in time, when the moment arrives... 
                        Could you really snuff out an 
                        innocent life?
                                 DIXIE
                        He’s not innocent, he’s The Duke, 
                        he’s a monster--!

                                 THE DUKE
                        Not yet he’s not, not really.  Back 
                        then he was still, well... human.
                             (thinking)
                        Actually in 2018 I’m pretty sure 
                        the only criminal offense on his 
                        record was public urination at a 
                        Taylor Swift concert, which was 
                        such a tight night by the way--

           Dixie gives no fucks. SHE JAMS HER PARTICLE DAGGER THROUGH 
           THE FLOOR, and before anyone knows what’s happening, SHE’S 
           DRAGGED IT IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE AROUND HER AND THE DUKE.

           She nimbly LEAPS onto his metal legs, but he CATCHES HER BY 
           THE THROAT. He looks at her, confused... UNTIL THE FLOOR 
           CRACKS BENEATH THEM. As he realizes what’s about to happen--

                                 THE DUKE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Dixie.

           THE FLOOR COLLAPSES.

           THEY FALL IN SLOW-MOTION through the house. Dixie brings the 
           dagger to The Duke’s neck. His eyes meet hers in a charged 
           moment that seems to last forever...

           DOWN IN THE BASEMENT

           THE DUKE SLAMS TO THE FLOOR AND DIXIE LANDS ON TOP OF HIM, 
           DRIVING THE DAGGER INTO HIS THROAT, KILLING HIM INSTANTLY.

           UP IN BARRET’S ROOM

           The Blood Captains and Blood Grunts crowd around the hole, 
           trying to see what happened. One of them calls down:

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN
                        Hey Duke!  You alright, sir?

           DOWN IN THE BASEMENT

           Dixie frantically rips the Backpack off The Duke and puts it 
           on, turning the date from 49 BC back to July 20, 2018. She 
           can’t help herself and calls upstairs:
           UP IN BARRET’S ROOM

                                 DIXIE (O.S.)
                        The Duke’s dead, dipshits!  I 
                        killed him now, and I’m about to go 
                        kill him again!  Suck my dick!

           A beat as the bad guys process this stunning news... then 
           they RAIN LASER FIRE DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT.

           DOWN IN THE BASEMENT

           Dixie flips The Duke’s body on top of her, using it as a 
           shield. As his metal corpse is BLOWN APART by laser blasts, 
           she activates the Time Backpack. 

           There’s a FLASH of blue light...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT (FUTURE)

           A gross 2076 trailer park. AIR RAID SIRENS GO OFF, making the 
           whole tableau seem, if possible, even more apocalyptic. 

           INT. MOBILE HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A sunken-eyed 16-year-old fuckhead named MILLER and his METH-
           HEAD FOSTER PARENTS are glued to the TV, watching breaking 
           news coverage of THE DUKE’S ASSASSINATION.

           On TV, a photo of DIXIE appears with the graphic: 

           “MURDEROUS BITCH ESCAPES VIA TIME TRAVEL, LOCATION/DATE 
           UNKNOWN. ALSO, TIME TRAVEL EXISTS.”

           Miller stands up in distress. He runs into his bedroom and 
           SLAMS THE DOOR.

           MILLER’S ROOM

           Miller’s room is like a Neo-Nazi Hot Topic, littered with 
           tacky propaganda for The Duke. We see black light posters 
           (with The Duke dabbing in front of an American flag), shot 
           glasses, even a ridiculous yet adorable plush Duke toy.

           Miller disappears into his closet, then reappears moments 
           later in a TACTICAL POWER SUIT, loaded up with WEAPONS AND A 
           JETPACK. He closes the final panel on a crude, homemade TIME 
           WATCH on his desk then straps it onto his wrist.
           He does a silent, ceremonial DAB to himself, sets the date to 
           July 20, 2018, and...

           FWOOSH! He disappears in a flash of black light.

           LIVING ROOM

           Out in the living room, Miller’s foster parents have no clue 
           what’s happened. They just stare at the footage of The Duke 
           on TV, their eyes glazed over.

                                 FOSTER DAD
                        He was gonna bring back coal.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRET’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Back in 2018, Barret is right where we left him: alone on the 
           couch, staring at social media on his phone.

           After a moment he sighs, looks around, and opens PornHub. He 
           scrolls for a while before finding the right video. He’s 
           finally about to start jerking off when--

           THE ROOM FLASHES BLUE AND DIXIE FALLS FROM THIN AIR ONTO THE 
           COUCH, SMOKING, COMPLETELY NAKED, SHIVERING BUT SOMEHOW OKAY.

           Barret stares, mouth open, able to draw only one conclusion:

                                 BARRET
                        I’m God.

           Dixie steadies herself and stands, regarding Barret with ice 
           cold eyes.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Okay, wow.  First off, nice to meet 
                        you, I’m Barret.  I have a lot of 
                        questions.  Obviously I’m wondering 
                        how you got in here, and why you’re 
                        nude, not that I mind that, but -- 
                        I’m guessing maybe you’re a stalker 
                        who’s also a magician?  You must 
                        have a background in the occult, 
                        and that’s how you did the blue 
                        flash thing--

           Dixie can’t speak. Facing down the young Duke, with a chance 
           to fix history... it’s the moment she’s dreamt of forever.
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Anyway all that being said, 
                        stalking isn’t automatically a 
                        turnoff, but I do hafta ask: Are 
                        you a crazy murderer?  Cause if so, 
                        again, not necessarily a deal 
                        breaker but it is good to just put 
                        those cards on the table before--

                                 DIXIE
                             (a wild war cry)
                        I HATE YOU!!

           SHE PUNCHES BARRET IN THE FACE, knocking him to the floor, 
           then jumps on top of him and grabs his throat, THROTTLING 
           HIM, STRANGLING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM!

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        DIE MOTHERFUCKER!!

                                 BARRET
                             (turning blue)
                        .... crazy murderer, got it....

           Barret struggles, but it’s no use. Dixie readjusts, leaning 
           further back on his body. She feels SOMETHING AND JUMPS--

                                 DIXIE
                        What the fu-- is that -- why do you 
                        have an erection right now??

                                 BARRET
                             (barely conscious)
                        .... why wouldn’t I??...

                                 DIXIE
                        Sick!

           IN THE BACK YARD

           Right outside, A FIGURE DESCENDS FROM THE SKY VIA JETPACK.

           BASEMENT

           Dixie squeezes tighter. But as Barret’s face turns blue, his 
           eyes meet hers... and she ever-so-slightly eases up.

           POW-POW-POW! PARTICLE RIFLE FIRE RIPS THROUGH THE WALLS, 
           forcing Dixie to tumble off Barret and take cover behind the 
           section couch. There she finds a folded blanket with BARRET’S 
           GRINNING FACE SEWN ONTO IT. She rolls her eyes.
           Barret gags, gasping for air. The floor-to-ceiling window 
           EXPLODES as the FIGURE who materialized outside JETPACKS INTO 
           THE BASEMENT. He emerges from the smoky debris, REVEALING:

           MILLER, decked out in his power suit, looking heroic as fuck. 
           He goes to Barret and ceremoniously DABS, then KNEELS.

                                 MILLER
                        Lord Duke.  I’ve come to save you.

                                 BARRET
                        .... WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!?!

           WHAP! Dixie, now wrapped in the blanket with Barret’s face on 
           it, CARTWHEEL KICKS MILLER. As they trade blows, Barret hits 
           the deck and Army crawls up the stairs.

           Dixie BREAKS BARRET’S BITMOJI PORTRAIT over Miller’s head, 
           but Miller responds with a POWER PUNCH that sends Dixie 
           THROUGH THE GODDAMN WALL AND INTO THE POOL OUTSIDE.

           UPSTAIRS

           Barret makes it into the foyer and fumbles his phone out of 
           his pocket. HE GOES LIVE ON INSTAGRAM.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (hyperventilating)
                        Okay ‘sup y’all it’s ya boi, so 
                        some crazy shit is going down, 
                        Bieber I donno if this is you 
                        pranking me or--

           CRASH! MILLER JETPACKS UP THROUGH THE FLOOR, landing next to 
           Barret. He offers his hand in friendship--

           But then DIXIE BUSTS THROUGH THE FRENCH DOORS TO THE DECK and 
           lassos his neck with a POOL NET. She YANKS Miller toward her 
           and delivers a CRUSHING KICK to his sternum.

           REVERSE ANGLE: Barret is livestreaming everything.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        See!!?  Holy fuck Justin I’m gonna 
                        get you back, man--!

           Dixie JAVELINS THE POOL NET at Barret’s face, missing him by 
           less than an inch. As her violent fight with Miller moves 
           closer, Barret scrambles out the garage door.

           GARAGE
           Barret dives into his stupid matte black Mercedes G-Wagen. 
           The last thing he was listening to, Taylor Swift’s “Look What 
           You Made Me Do”, blares. 

           HE GASSES IT IN REVERSE, BLASTING OUT THROUGH THE STILL-
           CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Dixie and Miller fight their way out onto the STEEP DRIVEWAY. 
           Miller CACKLES as Barret spins the G-Wagen around--

                                 MILLER
                        Ha ha!  The Duke is too cunning -- 
                        you’ll never catch him now that 
                        he’s made his escape--!

           But Barret CUTS IT TOO HARD AND FLIPS HIS G-WAGEN, tumbling 
           down the dangerous incline and across the residential street 
           below, finally settling in a mossy gulch.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck, no!  NO!!

                                 DIXIE
                        YES!!  He’s fucking dead!  Please 
                        blow up, please blow up!!

           It doesn’t. They keep watching and waiting.

                                 MILLER
                        If he was dead the timeline’d be 
                        fucked, we’d both be disappearing 
                        right now!  He must be alive!!

                                 DIXIE
                        Fuck!!  Fuck I wanna disappear!!

           Miller ACTIVATES HIS JET PACK, burning Dixie with its flames. 

           HE TAKES OFF BUT SHE GRABS HOLD OF HIS POWER SUIT, coming 
           along for the ride--

           THEY FLY ERRATICALLY through the air, climbing and diving and 
           barrel rolling at breakneck speed...

           EXT. MOSSY GULCH - CONTINUOUS

           Barret stumbles out of his wrecked vehicle, T-Swift still 
           blasting. He looks up the hill and sees the FLAMES from 
           Miller’s jetpack. He uses his phone to REQUEST AN UBER and 
           takes off into the woods, heading for the main road--
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Dixie and Miller continue their mid-air jetpack fight, 
           arguing as they rise and dip across the neighborhood.

                                 MILLER
                        You may have murdered The Duke in 
                        our time but I won’t let you kill 
                        him here!

                                 DIXIE
                        I’m gonna kill him so hard you 
                        little dipshit!

                                 MILLER
                        I’m not a dipshit!  I invented time 
                        travel that doesn’t even burn your 
                        clothes off, I’m a fucking genius!

                                 DIXIE
                        Well your precious Duke invented 
                        time travel that sends you back 
                        naked so I guess he’s a dipshit!

                                 MILLER
                        He’s not a dipshit, he just didn’t 
                        have the right people around him!

                                 DIXIE
                        His campaign said he was gonna 
                        surround himself with the smartest 
                        people!  So he’s a liar!

                                 MILLER
                        No he’s not!  That’s just what the 
                        media wants you to think!

           THEY SLAM INTO A MAILBOX but keep right on going.

           EXT. MAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Barret sprints along the road, trying to get to the gas 
           station where he’s meeting his Uber. He checks his phone.

                                 BARRET
                        C’mon Cassie in a Sonata with 4.93 
                        stars, fucking MOVE baby!!

           EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Barret TUMBLES DOWN THROUGH SOME PRICKLE BUSHES just as 
           Cassie arrives at the gas station.
                                 CASSIE
                        For Barret?

           Barret SLIDES ACROSS THE HOOD of the Sonata and jumps in the 
           back seat. Up in the sky, Miller’s jetpack is getting closer 
           and closer.

                                 BARRET
                        Can we get going, please??

                                 CASSIE
                        Sure thing, just as soon as you put 
                        your seatbelt on.

           Fuming, Barret obliges. Cassie starts the trip.

                                 CASSIE (CONT’D)
                        Coolio!  You need a charger or any--

                                 BARRET
                        Please, lady, just drive!!

           Cassie mouths “yikes” and slowly accelerates toward the exit, 
           putting on her left turn signal. She misses a long window 
           where she could’ve made the turn.

                                 CASSIE
                        Always tricky to turn left across a 
                        4-lane without a light.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Miller FISHTAILS his jetpack, slinging Dixie off him and into 
           a parked car. 

           He does a way-too-long, way-too-realistic version of Barret’s 
           AIR-JERK at her motionless body, then finally BLASTS OFF.

           EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Cassie idles, missing yet another opportunity to turn left. 
           Barret looks up and sees MILLER BARRELING TOWARD THEM.

                                 BARRET
                        Okay you can go right now--

                                 CASSIE
                        No, I don’t like the look of that--

                                 BARRET
                        You could’ve gone fifty times!
                                 CASSIE
                        Not without putting you, myself, or 
                        my Sonata in danger!  I’m a safe--

                                 BARRET
                        DRIVE GODDAMNIT, DRIVE!  GO!  GO--!

           Spooked, she pulls out and IMMEDIATELY GETS STRUCK BY AN 
           ONCOMING CAR. The Sonata spins around, doing a perfect 360. 
           After it settles, Barret tumbles out and runs away.

           Cassie CALLS AFTER HIM:

                                 CASSIE
                        You’re a bad person!

                                 BARRET
                        No I’m not, eat a dick--!

           MILLER SWOOPS DOWN AND GRABS BARRET. HE SCREAMS IN TERROR as 
           they take off and soar through the air, like Woody and Buzz 
           at the end of Toy Story.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD / MAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Dixie struggles painfully to her feet, dusts herself off, and 
           looks up at Miller’s rapidly disappearing jetpack. She 
           trudges to the side of the road where cars are SPEEDING BY.

           A MOTORCYCLE approaches. Dixie grabs a DOWNED TREE BRANCH off 
           the ground and steps out into the middle of the highway.

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS

           Miller circles the golf course and touches down in the middle 
           of a fairway. Nighttime sprinklers go off in the distance.

           Barret backs away and almost immediately FALLS INTO A BUNKER.

           Miller joins him in the sand trap. Barret winces, expecting 
           the worst -- but once again, Miller just DABS and KNEELS.

                                 MILLER
                        Duke -- My name is Miller, and I 
                        come from the future.  I am such a 
                        huge fan.

                                 BARRET
                                 MILLER
                        I stole my foster dad’s guns and 
                        traveled across the vast chasm of 
                        time to protect you from your 
                        enemies.

                                 BARRET
                        .... Like the naked chick?

                                 MILLER
                        Yes.  That bitch also time-
                        traveled -- but her goal is to 
                        eliminate you, before you can rise 
                        to power and bring ORDER to this 
                        filthy, disgusting world.

                                 BARRET
                        .... So she’s the bad guy.

                                 MILLER
                        Oh yeah, very much so.

                                 BARRET
                        And we’re the good guys?

                                 MILLER
                        Totally.

                                 BARRET
                             (suddenly pumped)
                        Fuck yeah.

           Miller stands and DABS. Barret awkwardly dabs back.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, why do you keep dabbing?

                                 MILLER
                        You replaced saluting with dabbing 
                        when you were elected President.

                                 BARRET
                        --In the future, I’m President??

                                 MILLER
                        Well, by 2076 you’ve technically 
                        declared yourself Master Chief and 
                        Emperor Of The Universe, but 
                        everyone just calls you The Duke.

                                 BARRET
                        .... And am I... a beloved ruler?
                                 MILLER
                        Oh yes.  You are kind, yet firm 
                        when the situation calls for it.

                                 BARRET
                        Word, that sounds just like me.

                                 MILLER
                        Like in 2048, when you quashed the 
                        rebellion of women, Jews, blacks, 
                        gays, and other non-whites.

                                 BARRET

                                 MILLER
                        Or in 2055, when you had all the 
                        rainforests burned down so you 
                        could print Rainforest Dollars.

                                 BARRET
                        ..... hmm I donno if--

                                 MILLER
                        Or in 2072, when you made dogs 
                        illegal--

                                 BARRET
                             (nauseous)
                        Okay y’know what nevermind, why 
                        spoil all my great accomplishments?

           Just then DIXIE FLIES OUT OF THE TREELINE ON A MOTORCYCLE. 
           She speeds through the sprinklers, TEARING TOWARD the guys.

           Miller shoves Barret down into the bunker.

                                 MILLER
                        Keep your head down!

           He levels his particle rifle and FIRES AT DIXIE. She 
           ACCELERATES AND WEAVES, dodging one laser blast after 
           another. 

           Miller is getting frustrated. Barret looks on, concerned.

                                 BARRET
                        Hey man so were you gonna try to 
                        hit her, or--

                                 MILLER
                        Just... hold... still...
           She’s almost upon them. Miller, panicked now, unholsters his 
           particle pistol and WILDLY FIRES BOTH GUNS FROM THE HIP--

           DIXIE POPS UP INTO A WHEELIE, and the laser blasts strike the 
           MOTORCYCLE’S FUEL TANK--

           She GUNS THE NOW-FLAMING MOTORCYCLE and does a MAGNIFICENT 
           SLOW-MOTION BACKFLIP OFF, landing gracefully on her feet. THE 
           MOTORCYCLE CAREENS INTO MILLER, IGNITING HIS JET PACK! 

           MILLER BURSTS INTO FLAMES. He screams and flails wildly, 
           stumbling dangerously close to the edge of a 20-foot dropoff.

                                 BARRET
                        .... Shit, this is not tight.

           Dixie casually grabs Miller’s particle pistol and UNLOADS, 
           blasting his power suit with multiple rounds.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (over the noise)
                        I feel like he’s probably good--
                             (she TURNS THE GUN on him)
                        Hey but you do you, do your thing!

           The flaming jetpack shorts out and BLASTS MILLER INTO THE 
           AIR, like Boba Fett in Return of the Jedi. He shoots up in a 
           long arc, then crashes down into the woods a few miles away. 

           Dixie turns and sees that Barret is SPRINTING AWAY FROM HER. 
           He frantically composes a tweet as he runs:

           “Yo somebody send the cops to the golf course

           She takes aim with the pistol, goes to pull the trigger...

           But a HUD on the gun reads: OVERHEATED. She grits her teeth 
           and HURLS THE PISTOL LIKE A FRISBEE. It spins through the air 
           and DRILLS Barret in the back of the head, knocking him down.

           Dixie stomps over, grabs the gun, and CRUSHES BARRET’S PHONE 
           WITH HER BARE FOOT. She levels her weapon at his face.

                                 DIXIE
                        Sending one of your infamous 
                        “tweets”?

                                 BARRET
                        Yeah, trying to tell my fans to 
                        call the cops on your crazy ass!
                             (realizing)
                        Although I guess I could’ve just 
                        called them myself, I forget that 
                        thing’s a phone.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARRET (CONT'D)
                             (sadly)
                        Shit.

                                 DIXIE
                        Do you know how long I’ve imagined 
                        this moment?  Standing over The 
                        Duke, gun to his head?

                                 BARRET
                        ... This is about the rainforest 
                        dollars, isn’t it?

                                 DIXIE
                        Don’t you have anything to say for 
                        yourself?  Don’t you feel some 
                        remorse for all the horrible things 
                        you’ve done??

                                 BARRET
                        No!  No I don’t feel any remorse 
                        you goddamn psycho, cause I didn’t 
                        do anything wrong!

                                 DIXIE
                        Yes you did!
                             (somewhat conflicted)
                        Or, you do, you’re gonna be The 
                        Duke, you’re the worst guy of--
                             (noticing)
                        I’m sorry, why in the FUCK do you 
                        still have an erection?!

                                 BARRET
                        I don’t know!  I don’t know, it’s 
                        crazy, I can’t explain it but--

           DIXIE FIRES THE COOLED DOWN PISTOL, delivering a shot that 
           just misses Barret’s head. IT BLOWS UP THE GROUND beside him.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        ..... K, it’s gone now.

           Dixie holds the pistol to his forehead, and Barret just 
           cowers pitifully. She brings her finger to the trigger...

           But then lowers the gun in frustration.

                                 DIXIE
                        Fuck, you’re too pathetic, this is 
                        too easy!

                                 BARRET
                        ... Thanks--?
           She flips the gun around and CRACKS HIM OVER THE HEAD. WHAP!

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Miller comes to in a heavily wooded area and painfully 
           extracts himself from his still-smoking power suit.

           The particle rifle lies a few feet away, charred and no 
           longer functional. He checks the Time Watch on his wrist -- 
           it’s totally wrecked too.

           He grabs all his shit and trudges through the woods.

           EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

           He enters a seedy pawn shop.

           INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

           He drops his future scrap metal onto the counter. The CLERK 
           regards him skeptically.

                                 MILLER
                        I want to trade all this for a 2018 
                        gun.  It’s super valuable future 
                        tech.

                                 CLERK
                        ... How old are you?

                                 MILLER
                             (beat, clearly 16)

           The Clerk checks out all of Miller’s stuff. It does look 
           pretty fancy. He stares at Miller one last time, then shrugs.

                                 CLERK
                        Works for me, what are you looking 
                        for?

                                 MILLER
                        Something tight.

                                 CLERK
                        How bout an AR-15?
                                 MILLER
                             (smiles evilly)
                        Yeah.  I like the sound of that.

           I/E. BARRET’S G-WAGEN - TRAVELING - NEXT MORNING (PRESENT)

           Barret jolts awake in the passenger seat of his previously 
           wrecked G-Wagen. Dixie drives the beat up vehicle, now 
           wearing chic yet functional combat fatigues.

                                 BARRET
                        Wow.  Great outfit, you look like a 
                        gd snack--

           She grabs her particle pistol and STARTS TO KNOCK HIM OUT 
           AGAIN, but he ducks back against the passenger door.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Hey, whoa, you can’t knock me out 
                        twice, I’ll get brain damage!

                                 DIXIE
                        I already had to do it like five 
                        times while I was getting your dumb 
                        car out of the ditch and stealing 
                        these clothes.

                                 BARRET
                        ... I don’t remember any of that--

           She makes a smug face like: Exactly, brain damage. Barret 
           slumps back into his seat and looks out the window. They’re 
           on the highway, a few hours out of Atlanta. 

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Where are we going?

                                 DIXIE
                        You’ll see.

                                 BARRET
                        Mm, that’s fun and ominous, can’t 
                        wait.

           Dixie remains quiet, eyes fixed on the road.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        I have to use the bathroom.
                             (no response)
                        I have to take a shit.
                             (she side-eyes him)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, that’s right, I’m gonna 
                        doodoo right here in my G-Wagen, 
                        it’s gonna mush up my back and 
                        everything and there’s nothing you--

           She casually points the pistol at him. He tenses, but:

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t kill me before, why 
                        should I believe you’re gonna do it 
                        now?

                                 DIXIE
                        Oh, I’m gonna kill you.  What’s up 
                        for grabs is whether I shoot your 
                        dick off first.

                                 BARRET
                        Go ahead then, blow off my dick--!

                                 DIXIE
                        I fucking will, I’ll blow it off 
                        right now!

                                 BARRET
                        I hope when you shoot my dick off 
                        it fucking flies up in the air and 
                        puts your eye out--!

                                 DIXIE
                        I’m gonna catch it and shove it in 
                        your mouth--!

                                 BARRET
                        You’re gonna get my dick blood all 
                        in your bloodstream, I had 
                        gonorrhea recently too, welcome to 
                        the Bug Party sweetheart--!

           WHACK! DIXIE SLAMS ON THE BRAKES, throwing Barret’s skull 
           into the dashboard. She grins as he winces in pain.

                                 DIXIE
                        We’re almost there.  I’m gonna show 
                        you something that’ll make you 
                        understand why I have to do this.

                                 BARRET
                        Oh boy, I bet it’s the site of my 
                        “greatest atrocity” from when I 
                        become President and ruin the world 
                        cause I’m fucking Hitler.
                                 DIXIE
                             (beat)
                        You’re not Hitler.  You’re worse.

                                 BARRET
                        ..... C’mon, I’m not worse than 
                        Hitler.

                                 DIXIE
                        No, you definitely are.  After you, 
                        people stopped even using Hitler as 
                        a reference.

           For the first time, Barret actually seems affected.

           EXT. CHUCK E CHEESE - MORNING

           Barret and Dixie are parked in a strip mall, outside CHUCK E 
           CHEESE. Barret stares at the big grinning mouse on the door.

                                 BARRET
                        Chuck E Cheese is the site of my 
                        greatest atrocity?

           Dixie DRAGS HIM OUT OF THE CAR and throws him onto the 
           asphalt. She stands over him, growing emotional.

           Behind her, a HAPPY FAMILY pulls up with their kids.

                                 DIXIE
                        By the year 2060, you’d nuked every 
                        major American city except for your 
                        capital--

                                 BARRET
                        Where’s my capital?

                                 DIXIE
                        Panama City.

                                 BARRET
                        Awesome.  K, continue.

                                 DIXIE
                        Little towns were overrun by 
                        victims fleeing the radiation.  
                        Little towns like this one--
                                 BARRET
                        Wait, lemme guess: This gross strip 
                        mall got turned into an even 
                        grosser refugee camp, and that’s 
                        where you grew up, until me and my 
                        stormtroopers came and took you 
                        away from your parents and sold you 
                        into slavery, where you spent every 
                        waking moment for years and years 
                        thinking only about killing me?

           Beat. Dixie unholsters her pistol and points it at Barret.

                                 DIXIE
                        Nailed it.

           The Happy Family, seeing and hearing all this, gets back into 
           their van and drives away. 

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Any final words, Duke?

           Barret summons what little courage he has, trying to buck up.

                                 BARRET
                        My name is Barret.
                             (stands, looks around)
                        And this whole Chuck E Cheese 
                        reveal is kind of underwhelming, 
                        are you sure you aren’t just 
                        stalling cause you don’t actually 
                        want to do this?

                                 DIXIE
                        Oh you have no idea how bad I--

                                 BARRET
                        LOOK, “The Duke” may have done some 
                        questionable shit but I got nothing 
                        to apologize for... The only one 
                        here who’s ever murdered an 
                        innocent person is about to be you.

           She cocks the pistol.

                                 DIXIE
                        I can live with that.

           And poof, there goes the courage. BARRET DROPS TO HIS KNEES.
                                 BARRET
                        PLEASE DON’T KILL ME, holy shit 
                        just let me have like another hour, 
                        let me have a last meal like can we 
                        eat at Chuck E Cheese first?  
                        Please??  I got people I gotta say 
                        goodbye to, have some mercy, I 
                        swear to God I won’t outlaw dogs!

           Dixie watches him beg. She knows she should just kill him and 
           end this. The Duke’s words (”When the moment arrives, could 
           you really snuff out an innocent life?”) echo in her head...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHUCK E CHEESE - DAY

           SOME KIDS AND PARENTS celebrate a birthday, singing and 
           dancing along with Chuck E Cheese’ animatronic band. They’re 
           singing a cover of some early 2000s hit, probably “Iris” by 
           The Goo Goo Dolls, I fucking love that song.

           Barret and Dixie sit awkwardly in a booth, not speaking. He 
           stares at her, clearly pouting. Finally:

                                 DIXIE
                        What?

                                 BARRET
                        Nothing! -- I guess I just always 
                        thought my last meal would have a 
                        little more... conversation?

                                 DIXIE
                             (seething)
                        What do you want to talk about?

                                 BARRET
                        I donno, like -- What’s your name?

                                 DIXIE
                        Dixie.  There, conversation had, 
                        conversation over.  Now hurry up 
                        and order so I can get to killing 
                        you.

                                 BARRET
                        ... Wow, you really put the “dick” 
                        in “Dixie”, huh?

                                 DIXIE
                             (massive eye roll)
                        Good one.
           Then she realizes: That was the same dumb exchange she had 
           with The Duke in the future. Creepy.

                                 BARRET
                        So, Dixie, after you kill me, 
                        what’s your plan?

                                 DIXIE
                        Doesn’t matter.  I won’t be here.

                                 BARRET
                        Oh, so you’re gonna split.  Well 
                        look, in case you haven’t noticed, 
                        I’m super famous, I’m super rich, I 
                        have my own line at Urban which 
                        means people are gonna be looking 
                        for me--

                                 DIXIE
                             (gestures all around)
                        No -- like, I won’t be here.  Now.
                             (off his confusion)
                        If you die, you never become 
                        President, and The Duke doesn’t 
                        ruin the world, that means I never 
                        get orphaned, don’t become a slave--

                                 BARRET
                        Yeah yeah but what happens to the 
                        physical you, sitting right there?

           She clears her throat, knowing this sounds crazy.

                                 DIXIE
                        I’ll just... disappear, I guess.  
                        And wake up in the fixed timeline.

           Barret stares at her for a beat, then starts CRACKING UP.

                                 BARRET
                        Oh my God.  You actually believe 
                        it’s fucking Back To The Future 
                        rules.
                             (can’t stop laughing)
                        So lemme get this -- literally when 
                        you kill me, in the future all the 
                        grass just suddenly turns green 
                        again, the buildings rebuild, the 
                        robins start chirping, and all the 
                        dead people just magically come 
                        back to life?

           She looks down at the table, actually embarrassed.
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        And you just poof, dematerialize 
                        and reappear in utopia, with all 
                        the hurt in your heart healed?
                             (being a dick now)
                        I’m fucking serious, is that it?  
                        Will killing me heal the hurt in 
                        your heart??

           She absorbs all that. Then she looks up, eyes blazing.

                                 DIXIE
                        I don’t know, asshole.  What I do 
                        know is that in a few years, 
                        through a series of insane events, 
                        The Duke, you, take over... Jesus, 
                        the amount of stupid people that 
                        bought into your transparent 
                        bullshit... The very fact that 
                        someone like you could get elected 
                        President -- that was enough, 
                        society was fucked, and you bled us 
                        dry like the mosquito you are, 
                        until it was too late.
                             (beat)
                        You think I understand time travel?  
                        Fuck no I don’t, I’m a soldier not 
                        a scientist.  The only thing I 
                        understand is hope, cause that’s 
                        all that’s kept me alive.  When I 
                        kill you I hope the grass turns 
                        green, I hope the robins start 
                        chirping again.  I hope I 
                        disappear, and God I hope the hurt 
                        in my heart finally heals.  But 
                        most of all?  I hope you put that 
                        knife back on the table so I don’t 
                        have to blow your brains out the 
                        back of your skull in front of all 
                        these kids.

           Long beat... then Barret slowly puts the BUTTER KNIFE he’d 
           swiped back on the table. 

           The WAITER approaches. When he sees Barret, he FREAKS OUT.

                                 WAITER
                        Daaaamn, you host that Meme show, 
                        you’re the Dab guy!

           The Waiter DABS and Barret DABS back. Dixie gags.

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Yo is it cool if I get a picture?
                                 BARRET
                        Of course, anything for my fans, 
                        cause I’m a genuinely good person.

           Dixie watches Barret takes seflies with the thrilled wait 
           staff. THE BIRTHDAY PARENTS AND KIDS come over as well. He’s 
           kind and personable, making them all feel special. Dixie has 
           to admit: he does seem to truly care about his fans.

           She locks eyes with Barret, wondering for the first time if 
           maybe he actually is human. Barret, meanwhile, gets an idea.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Hey you know who else y’all should 
                        get a picture with?
                             (points to Dixie)
                        My girlfriend over there, she’s 
                        about to be famous too!

                                 DIXIE
                        What--?  No, I’m not--

                                 BARRET
                        Yeah she’s a SoundCloud rapper, Lil 
                        DiXXXie, with three Xs--

                                 WAITER
                        Oh shit, I’ve heard of you--!

           Kids and adults alike swarm Dixie and get her off her feet, 
           handing Barret their phones to take pictures.

                                 BARRET
                        Alright, all y’all dab for me...

           Everybody DABS except Dixie. She’s fuming.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        C’mon Dix, lemme see you dab!  I 
                        know it’s your favorite thing!

           An ADORABLE LITTLE GIRL tugs on Dixie’s sleeve, urging her to 
           join in. Dixie grits her teeth and does a half-assed DAB.

           Barret snaps a pic and everybody CHEERS. Dixie doesn’t know 
           what to think of this sort of attention, everybody being nice 
           and wanting to talk to her. She’s momentarily swept up...

           And that’s all the time Barret needs. He comes around her and 
           GRABS THE PARTICLE PISTOL out from the back of her pants. He 
           backs away, gun in one hand, cell phone in the other. He 
           levels the weapon at Dixie and all the kids.
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Yeah that’s right, I’m the Captain 
                        now, bitch!  I’m the Captain now!

                                 DIXIE
                        Filthy scum, you really are--

                                 BARRET
                        The worst, yeah yeah, I heard you 
                        the first thousand times!

           Dixie feigns toward him and he FIRES, blowing the animatronic 
           Chuck E Cheese’s head clean off. It keeps singing a grotesque 
           version of its already-bad song. The kids SCREAM AND CRY.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Now gimme my car keys! 
                             (she hesitates)
                        Don’t make me shoot another robot 
                        animal!

           Dixie is furious, but she has no choice. She tosses Barret 
           the keys. He misses catching them and awkwardly squats to 
           pick them up while keeping the gun on Dixie.

                                 DIXIE
                        Nice catch, dipshit.

                                 BARRET
                        My hands are full, dick!

           He stands back up and dials 911.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah, I have a big emergency, I’m 
                        at the Chuck E. Cheese and there’s 
                        a crazy woman here trying to kill 
                        me... No she doesn’t have a weapon, 
                        actually right now I have the gun -- 
                        I know, but trust me that’s not--

           Dixie makes her move. She jumps sideways onto a booth then 
           LEAPFROGS onto Barret. The kids and adults take cover as they 
           struggle for the particle pistol, BLASTING THE CHUCK E CHEESE 
           WITH LASER FIRE.

           Dixie slings Barret backward onto the WHACK-A-MOLE. He grabs 
           the mallet and CRACKS HER OVER THE HEAD, then turns and 
           SHOOTS OUT THE RESTAURANT’S GLASS WINDOW. He fires blindly as 
           Dixie gives chase, inadvertently BLASTING OPEN THE BALL PIT.
           We go SLOW-MOTION (perhaps needlessly but fuck it) as Barret 
           DIVES OUT OF the shattered window and Dixie is swallowed by 
           an AVALANCHE OF COLORFUL PLASTIC BALLS.

           (FYI the sequence we’re watching right now will also get 
           nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Fight, but it’s not 
           the one that wins.)

           PARKING LOT

           Barret jumps into the G-Wagen and fumbles with the ignition.

           CHUCK E CHEESE

           DIXIE’S HEAD POPS OUT OF THE BALLS. She’s bleeding from the 
           Whack-A-Mole hammer strike, and looks angrier than ever.

           PARKING LOT

           Barret throws the G-Wagen into reverse and guns it across the 
           parking lot. He checks his rearview and SEES:

           DIXIE, sprinting after the SUV like the fucking T-1000. She 
           makes a CATLIKE LEAP onto the back. Barret SCREAMS and 
           SWERVES, throwing her off-balance.

           Dixie, realizing this is untenable, BACKFLIPS off the G-Wagen 
           into the bed of a passing PICKUP. She SWINGS AROUND THE SIDE 
           OF THE TRUCK, hanging on like a frog, and addresses the OLD 
           REDNECK DRIVER through his window:

                                 DIXIE
                        I’m gonna drive.

           ACCESS STREET

           Barret skids onto the access street, heading for the 
           interstate. Moments later the pickup, driven by Dixie (with 
           the old guy now in the passenger seat, seemingly unfazed), 
           flies out of the parking lot in hot pursuit.

                                 BARRET
                        Oh shit oh shit oh shit--

           Barret approaches the interstate overpass. He waits until the 
           last second and CUTS IT onto the entry ramp. Dixie doesn’t 
           have the time or maneuverability to turn, and BLOWS PAST HIM.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        FUCK YES, The Duke escapes!!

           PICKUP TRUCK
           Undaunted, Dixie continues across the overpass and TURNS ONTO 
           THE EXIT RAMP, DODGING A HEAD-ON COLLISION. She looks at the 
           old man, whose casual blank expression has not changed.

                                 DIXIE
                        You cool with this?

                                 OLD MAN
                        Mm-hmm.

           INTERSTATE / PICKUP / G-WAGEN

           Barret rips down the freeway. He actually breathes a sigh of 
           relief... until he looks at the other side of the highway and 
           sees DIXIE’S PICKUP TRUCK WEAVING BETWEEN ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

                                 BARRET
                        ohshitohshitOHSHIT--

           Dixie accelerates, TEARING ACROSS THE GRASSY DIVIDE and onto 
           Barret’s side of the highway. She comes around the right side 
           of his SUV and RAMS THE PASSENGER DOOR.

           Barret redlines it, pushing the G-Wagen as fast as it’ll go. 
           He fumbles for the PARTICLE PISTOL in the passenger seat -- 
           but when he finally finds it and POINTS IT AT THE TRUCK--

           Dixie is gone, and the old man is driving again, like nothing 
           ever happened.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        What the hell--??

           DIXIE SOMERSAULTS OFF THE TOP OF THE MOVING PICKUP, CRASHING 
           THROUGH THE SUNROOF OF THE G-WAGEN. There’s a moment of 
           absolute WTF as Dixie lands in the passenger seat...

           THEN BARRET PROJECTILE PUKES ONTO THE WINDSHIELD.

                                 DIXIE
                        EW what the fuck!

           The G-Wagen veers across three lanes as they fight over the 
           particle pistol. Dixie finally wrests the gun from Barret and 
           points it at him--

           But he SWERVES THE CAR VIOLENTLY, FIRST SHARP TO THE LEFT, 
           across the grassy divide, then SHARP TO THE RIGHT, so that 
           now he’s the one dodging oncoming traffic. 

           The second swerve FLINGS DIXIE INTO THE PASSENGER DOOR -- 
           it’s KNOCKED OPEN and is CLIPPED OFF BY A PASSING CAR--
           They continue their fight for the gun -- Barret overpowers 
           Dixie and FIRES at the passenger dashboard, DEPLOYING ITS 
           AIRBAG AND KNOCKING HER THE FUCK OUT.

           She slumps over and FALLS BACKWARD, OVER HALF HER BODY NOW 
           HANGING OUT OF THE MOVING CAR. 

           Barret looks at Dixie -- she’s SLIDING FURTHER AND FURTHER 
           OUT, and an ONCOMING SEMI-TRUCK is seconds away from 
           PULVERIZING HER -- HONK! HONK!

           She comes to but it’s too late -- She’s sliding... SLIDING...

           HONK! Dixie’s eyes meet Barret’s: THIS IS IT...

           BARRET REACHES OVER AND GRABS HER LEG AT THE LAST SECOND. HE 
           SWERVES BACK TO THE LEFT, OFF THE INTERSTATE, SHOOTING DIXIE 
           BACK INTO THE G-WAGEN SO HER LEGS ARE LYING ACROSS HIM.

           G-WAGEN / FIELD

           They burst through an old FENCE and speed across a field. 
           Barret and Dixie hold each other’s gaze until--

           DIXIE KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, dazing him. Realizing a crash is 
           imminent, she TUCKS AND ROLLS out the passenger side opening.

           It’s a rough landing, but she survives. She watches, barely 
           able to move, as the G-Wagen CAREENS INTO A WROUGHT IRON GATE 
           and finally comes to a smoking, violent stop next to a LAKE.

           She stares at the car, then at her hands, then back at the 
           car, then back at her hands.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Please disappear, please disappear, 
                        please disappear...

           She’s not disappearing. 

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit!!

           G-WAGEN

           Barret regains consciousness. He shakes off the cobwebs, 
           shocked to be alive. The particle pistol is nowhere to be 
           found, but he does notice something in the back seat of the 
           G-Wagen:

           The Time Travel Backpack.
           FIELD

           Dixie, still on her hands and knees, sees Barret fall out of 
           the driver’s side door, HOLDING THE TIME BACKPACK.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        no... NO...

           Barret turns and sees Dixie CRAWLING TOWARD HIM, thirty yards 
           away. He crawls too, frantically trying to work the Backpack.

                                 BARRET
                        Back in time, what’s a good date, 
                        what’s a good date, what’s a good -- 
                        okay fuck it.

           He finally settles on a date and punches it in, but--

                                 DIXIE
                        Drop it.

           Dixie stands by the wrecked G-Wagen, AIMING THE PARTICLE 
           PISTOL RIGHT AT HIM.

           He has no choice but to oblige. Dixie staggers over and grabs 
           the Backpack. She reads the date he chose: June 6, 1969.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ, 6-9-69?  Seriously?

           He holds up his hands, too weak to crack a joke in response. 
           Dixie stares at him.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Why did you save me??

                                 BARRET
                        ... I don’t know.

                                 DIXIE
                        Why??

                                 BARRET
                        I don’t know... clearly it was one 
                        of my trademark bad decisions.

           Exhausted and delirious, Dixie is growing emotional.

                                 DIXIE
                        I don’t want to do this, okay??
                             (beat)
                        But I have to.
           Barret doesn’t say anything. There are POLICE SIRENS in the 
           distance. Dixie takes his SMASHED CELL PHONE from her pocket 
           and tosses it to him. It still works.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        You said you had people to say 
                        goodbye to.  So say goodbye.
                             (then)
                        I’m sorry, it’s the best I can do.

           Barret hesitates. The sirens are getting closer. DIXIE COCKS 
           THE PARTICLE PISTOL -- she won’t wait forever.

           He opens Twitter and starts typing:

           “What up to all the fans, and even to the haters, I

           He stops. Throws down the phone.

                                 BARRET
                        Fuck it, it’s fucking bullshit.  I 
                        don’t have anyone.

           The sirens are right on top of them. Barret’s eyes well up, 
           but he wipes away the tears, determined not to cry.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Just go ahead and kill me.

           Dixie shakes her head. So he is human.

           Police lights are visible behind her. This is her absolute 
           last chance to kill Barret and right the timeline...

           Instead, she throws the particle pistol and the Time Backpack 
           INTO THE LAKE. She puts her hands in the air, and looks at 
           Barret.

                                 DIXIE
                        Don’t run for President.

           MOS: THE COPS arrive and surround them, guns drawn. They 
           DRIVE DIXIE INTO THE GROUND and handcuff her. When they see 
           Barret, a few of them lower their weapons and DAB.

           INT. POLICE STATION LOBBY - DAY

           MOS: Barret answers some questions for the police, but really 
           they just want to take selfies with him. 

           He catches a glimpse of Dixie, now in an orange jumpsuit, 
           being led back toward the holding cell. She turns and they 
           lock eyes... and then she’s gone.
           Satisfied with Barret’s answers, the cops give him back his 
           keys. He’s free to go.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

           MOS: The G-Wagen is out front, beat to shit but still 
           drivable. Barret gets in, looks back at the police station, 
           then pulls away.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY

           MOS: Dixie sits alone in the communal jail cell. Various 
           white trash female CONVICTS encroach with makeshift weapons, 
           vultures circling the fresh meat. Dixie is defenseless.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           MOS: Barret fishes the Time Backpack and the particle pistol 
           out of the lake. He looks at them, conflicted.

           I/E. BARRET’S G-WAGEN - TRAVELING - DAY

           Barret drives back to Atlanta. He doesn’t seem that pumped to 
           be alive. In the wake of the last day’s excitement, he looks 
           almost, well, bored. 

           He takes out his cell phone and fires up Instagram Live:

                                 BARRET
                        Sup fam, it’s ya boi, just being 
                        tight per usual.  Wanted to let 
                        y’all know I’m all good, some wild 
                        shit went down but nobody got hurt, 
                        I’m heading back to ATL now.
                             (beat)
                        That chick who shot up my house was 
                        crazy, wasn’t she?  I mean like, 
                        total batshit, psycho stalker. 
                             (beat)
                        But she was kinda hot too though.  
                        Crazy... but hot.  Super hot.
                             (longer beat, surprisingly 
                              honest and heartfelt)
                        And kinda cool, too.

           Barret stares into the phone camera.
           INT. POLICE STATION / HOLDING CELL - DAY

           A DEPUTY rounds the corner and opens the holding cell door:

           Inside, Dixie has KNOCKED OUT most of the other prisoners, 
           and has a crude shiv to the leader’s throat. The deputy 
           laughs and whistles for another DEPUTY to come check it out.

                                 DEPUTY
                        What’d I say?  She did the Jason 
                        Statham thing!  Now pay up.

           The other Deputy shakes his head and gives her a five. Dixie 
           has no idea what’s going on.

                                 DIXIE
                        .... Sorry, the Jason what?

                                 DEPUTY
                        The Jason Statham thing!  Where 
                        you’re surrounded by a buncha 
                        hardasses and it looks like they’re 
                        gonna fuck you up, but then when we 
                        come back in you fucked all them 
                        up.  Won me five bucks, thanks!
                             (then)
                        Also somebody posted your bail, get 
                        the fuck out of here.

           INT. POLICE STATION LOBBY - DAY

           Dixie emerges into the lobby, back in her combat outfit. 
           She’s shocked to find Barret waiting for her.

                                 BARRET
                        Daaaamn there she is, there’s my 
                        crazy sexy cool girlfriend!  We 
                        sure got ‘em good, right?

           Dixie has no idea what the fuck he’s talking about. Barret 
           makes a face like Just go with it!

                                 DIXIE
                        ... Right?

           Barret turns to the blank-faced SHERIFF.
                                 SHERIFF
                        I just wanna, one more time, to be 
                        clear -- you’re bailing out a woman 
                        you posted a video of destroying 
                        your home, called 911 to say was 
                        trying to murder you, and led on a 
                        dangerous high speed chase -- all 
                        because she’s actually your 
                        girlfriend, and it was just one 
                        big... “prank”?

                                 BARRET
                        Yep.

                                 SHERIFF
                        A prank on who?

                                 BARRET
                             (beat)
                        The whole entire world.
                             (then)
                        My masterpiece...
                             (re: Dixie)
                        Our masterpiece.

                                 SHERIFF
                             (unsatisfied, but)
                        Well -- if you’re not pressin’ 
                        charges, and neither is the Chuck E 
                        Cheese...

                                 BARRET
                        I signed a buncha autographs, I’m 
                        paying for all the repairs, and I 
                        gave the manager my Brazzers 
                        password.  We’re all good, my dude!

           Barret DABS at the Sheriff, who pauses, then finally does a 
           HALF-DAB back. Dixie turns to the Deputy.

                                 DIXIE
                        Are you sure I can’t go back to 
                        jail?  Like, forever?

           I/E. BARRET’S G-WAGEN - TRAVELING (I-85) - EVENING

           Barret drives; Dixie rides shotgun. They both have that WTF 
           are we doing? look from the end of The Graduate. 

           Barret grabs the Time Backpack from the backseat and hands it 
           to her, then rambles through a somewhat-rehearsed speech:
                                 BARRET
                        Look, I know this is crazy.  This 
                        is like that moment when I 
                        heroically saved your life by 
                        pulling you back into the car, but 
                        even more heroic honestly.  We may 
                        have gotten off on the wrong foot, 
                        what with you trying to kill me and 
                        all, but I do think that, over 
                        time, we’ve gained a mutual respect 
                        for one another.  And even though 
                        you’re a psychotic warrior who 
                        hates me with a fiery, Biblical 
                        passion, I sorta enjoyed hanging 
                        out, and I thought that maybe we 
                        could, I donno, keep hanging out, 
                        in the absence of the whole you 
                        having to murder me thing.  Like I 
                        could help you get on your feet and 
                        start a new life here in 2018.
                             (beat)
                        Or, if not, you can take the Time 
                        Backpack and go live with the 
                        dinosaurs or something.  Up to you.

           He looks over. REVEAL that Dixie is sound asleep, for the 
           first time in God knows how long. Barret smiles a little.

           EXT. BARRET’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           They pull up to Barret’s house. He delicately taps Dixie to 
           wake her, but she JUMPS with a violent start.

                                 DIXIE
                        Ahhhhh--!
                             (catches her breath)
                        Sorry.  Bad dream.

                                 BARRET
                        ... Was it--

                                 DIXIE
                        About you in the future doing 
                        something horrible?

                                 BARRET
                        Right, was it that?

                                 DIXIE
                        Yeah, man.  It’s always that.
                                 BARRET
                        Damn.  
                             (then)
                        So you dream about me every night?

                                 DIXIE
                             (correcting)
                        I nightmare about you ever night.

                                 BARRET
                        Hey, I’ll take it.

           We can’t help but notice that things are a little more 
           playful and easygoing between them.

           INT. BARRET’S HOUSE - FOYER/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           They enter the house together. Barret steps forward and 
           ALMOST FALLS INTO THE HOLE WHERE MILLER JETPACKED UP FROM THE 
           BASEMENT--

           But Dixie catches his hand and pulls him back, toward her. 
           Their eyes meet. She gestures toward the hole.

                                 DIXIE
                        That wasn’t me.  That was the other 
                        guy.

           Barret looks back at the shattered French doors to the deck.

                                 BARRET
                        What about the doors?

                                 DIXIE
                        Ehh, hard to say.  Heat of battle, 
                        that sort of thing.

                                 BARRET
                        Right, right.

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Barret hands Dixie a pillow and another blanket with his face 
           on it from the closet. 

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        The guest bedroom’s at the other 
                        end of the hall.

                                 DIXIE
                        Jesus, how many of these blankets 
                        do you have?
                                 BARRET
                        Oh man, I forgot you were wearing 
                        one earlier.  After you were naked.

                                 DIXIE
                        God.  I forgot I was naked.

                                 BARRET
                        Yeah about that, is that just like 
                        standard time travel procedure, or 
                        did you put in a special request to 
                        come through fully nude? 
                             (she stares at him)
                        Kidding, obviously.  Why would you 
                        want to time travel naked, it would 
                        probably burn your, y’know, vagina--
                             (digging a ditch)
                        K well ANYWAY what a day it’s been, 
                        I’m pooped, goodnight!

           He turns and enters his bedroom, making a You Fucking Idiot! 
           face to himself. Dixie lingers for a moment, then turns and 
           disappears into the guest room.

           BARRET’S BEDROOM

           Barret lies in bed. He tosses and turns, unable to sleep.

           GUEST BEDROOM

           Dixie also tosses and turns.

           BARRET’S BEDROOM

           Barret rewatches his Instagram Story, just so he can see 
           Dixie kicking Miller’s ass in the Barret blanket. He keeps 
           rewinding, screenshotting, and zooming in, trying to catch a 
           nipple slip or something. His efforts are unsuccessful.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Damnit.

           GUEST BEDROOM

           Dixie turns on the light and picks up a framed photo on the 
           nightstand: A picture of Barret as a younger guy, not yet 
           playing the character of The Duke. Just smiling. Happy.

           And yeah. Pretty hot.

           BARRET’S BEDROOM

           Barret sits on the edge of the bed, tapping his leg, suddenly 
           a ball of nervous energy.
           GUEST BEDROOM

           Dixie paces back and forth. Finally she says a mental Fuck it 
           and opens the door.

           UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           Barret and Dixie come out of their rooms at the same time.

           They stare at one another from across the hallway. It’s 
           awkward. And cute. Finally:

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Were you coming to kill me in my 
                        sleep?  Cause I’m not asleep yet.

                                 DIXIE
                             (hesitating)
                        No, I was, um--
                             (sees the PHONE in his 
                              hand)
                        Coming to tell you -- That you need 
                        to formally announce you’re not 
                        running for President.  On your 
                        phone video thing.

                                 BARRET
                             (beat, disappointed)
                        Oh.  Word.  Yeah, I guess I should, 
                        uh, do that.  To save the future.

                                 DIXIE
                        Right, to save the future.  And all 
                        of humanity.

                                 BARRET
                        Totally.  I love humanity.
                             (pause)
                        Do you wanna film it, or should it 
                        be a selfie or--

                                 DIXIE
                        Yeah I can do it, just show me--

           He brings up Instagram Live and shows her how to use it. 
           Their hands brush one another, but they quickly pull away.

                                 BARRET
                        And you just press “Start Live 
                        Video” when you want to--

                                 DIXIE
                        Got it, got it.  Cool.
           Barret backs away. Dixie holds up the phone, but doesn’t 
           start recording yet. A moment passes.

                                 BARRET
                        So I’m gonna say this and you’re--
                             (snaps his fingers)
                        Just gone, immediately disappeared.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... yeah I mean I don’t know how 
                        it’ll look, maybe it’ll be instant--

                                 BARRET
                        I wonder if you’ll glow, do you 
                        think that’s part of it?

                                 DIXIE
                        I donno, I honestly don’t know.

           Another moment passes. They’re both clearly stalling.

                                 BARRET
                        Well then I guess this is goodbye.

                                 DIXIE
                             (beat)
                        ... Yeah.  Guess so.

           The tension between them is fucking crackling. Each wants to 
           say more... but they don’t. Finally:

                                 BARRET
                        Alright fire it up, let’s get this 
                        over with.
                             (to phone camera, deadpan)
                        Sup y’all, it’s ya boi, just wanted 
                        to formally announce that I am not 
                        running for President.  Repeat, I 
                        am not running for President.  
                        Presidents are dumb and I don’t 
                        want to be one.  So, yeah.  Peace.

           He drops out of character and stares at her. Nothing’s 
           happening.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        You aren’t glowing.  You’re not 
                        disappearing.

                                 DIXIE
                                 BARRET
                        Did you press the button to start 
                        the video?

                                 DIXIE
                             (beat)
                        No.

                                 BARRET
                             (beat)
                        Why not?

                                 DIXIE
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know.

                                 BARRET
                             (beat)
                        Do you want me to show you how, 
                        again--?

                                 DIXIE
                        No.

           They both step forward and--

           She kisses him.

           He kisses her back. 

           Finally!

           Dixie wraps her legs around Barret and he presses her against 
           the wall. It’s clear where this making out is headed...

           EXT. BARRET’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Outside, MILLER emerges from the dark treeline, decked out in 
           camo paint like Arnold in Predator. He now wields an AR-15.

           He sees lights on inside and just knows Dixie must be in 
           there, preparing to kill The Duke. 

                                 MILLER
                        Don’t worry, Duke.  I’m coming for 
                        you.

           He climbs a tree on the side of the house and draws his 
           weapon, ready for battle. But when he looks into the bedroom 
           he SEES:

           Barret and Dixie fucking. We’re talking passionate, CTB-lit 
           80s movie-style lovemaking, a la Top Gun or Terminator.
           MILLER SLIPS AND FALLS OUT OF THE TREE, gagging, shocked and 
           disturbed. The Duke sleeping with the rebel scum sent to kill 
           him? Miller’s whole world has been turned upside down.

           EXT. STREETS OF ATLANTA - NIGHT

           Miller, face paint wiped off, wanders through the city, 
           hopelessly lost. He drops the AR-15 into a trash can and 
           stumbles into a public library.

           INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

           He sits down at one of the public-use computers and stares at 
           Google. Finally he searches:

           “Community for lonely, purposeless, politically-minded, gun 
           and freedom-loving, high-testosterone young men

           He thinks, then adds:

           who also HATE WOMEN!”

           CLOSE ON HIS FACE as he reads the results. He clicks, and we 
           see that he’s discovered 4CHAN. His eyes light up.

                                 MILLER
                        Whoa.

           INT. BARRET’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           For the first time in a long time, Dixie doesn’t wake with a 
           nightmarish jolt. Instead she wakes to the smell of something 
           delicious cooking downstairs.

           Barret is gone, but on the edge of his bed is a pile of his 
           old clothes and a note that reads:

           “Vintage, Worn By The Duke™ Himself!”

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Dixie comes downstairs in sweatpants and a Garth Brooks 
           concert tee. Barret cooks breakfast. She marvels at the food.

                                 BARRET
                        What do you usually have for 
                        breakfast in the future?
                                 DIXIE
                        We don’t really eat it.  One time 
                        on Christmas morning we sucked on 
                        the heads of dead rats.

                                 BARRET
                             (appalled)
                        Cool, this is bacon and eggs.

           AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE

           They eat in morning-after-sex silence. Finally:

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        You’re on the pill, right?

                                 DIXIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 BARRET
                        I figured yes, since you sorta 
                        aggressively took the wheel last 
                        night--

                                 DIXIE
                        Wait, aren’t you on the pill?

           Barret stares at her blankly.

                                 BARRET
                        I can’t tell if you’re 
                        kidding -- the pill is for women.

                                 DIXIE
                        No, where I’m from there’s only a 
                        pill for men because someone banned 
                        female birth control.

                                 BARRET
                        Well here the pill for guys hasn’t 
                        been invented yet.  I do love that 
                        idea though, you can’t trust girls 
                        to take that shit responsibly.
                             (then, realizing)
                        Oh.  That “someone” was me, huh?

           Dixie glares at Barret. He clears his throat.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        It would’ve been good to have a 
                        fuller grasp of this situation 
                        before--
                                 DIXIE
                        Before you fucked me without a 
                        contraceptive?  Yeah, no shit!

                                 BARRET
                        Oh right, cause everything’s my 
                        fault--

                                 DIXIE
                        Yes!  Literally everything’s your 
                        fault!  Including now me 
                        potentially being knocked up with 
                        The fucking Duke’s kid--!

                                 BARRET
                        Oh boo hoo at least The Duke is 
                        rich, and famous, you’d be lucky to 
                        have his demon seed in you--

                                 DIXIE
                        SICK!  Don’t say seed!

                                 BARRET
                        Seed!  Seed seed seed--!

                                 DIXIE
                        Oh fuck this!

           SHE GRABS HER FORK AND MAKES LIKE A CAT ACROSS THE TABLE, 
           knocking over their plates. SHE THRUSTS THE FORK AT BARRET 
           but he CATCHES HER WRIST. They struggle--

                                 BARRET
                        You don’t get to just casually 
                        remember that your mission is to 
                        kill me every time I piss you off!

           He tries to overpower her but SHE FLIPS FORWARD, landing so 
           she’s straddling him on his chair. She has the fork pointed 
           centimeters from his eyeball. Both are breathing hard.

                                 DIXIE
                        Sorry, you were telling me what I 
                        can and can’t do?

                                 BARRET
                        Go ahead then, do it!  Kill the 
                        father of your unborn devil child--

                                 DIXIE
                        Don’t fucking tempt me--!

           HE KISSES HER HARD, AND SHE KISSES HIM EVEN HARDER BACK. They 
           fall onto the table and tear each other’s clothes off.
                                 BARRET
                        Do you want me to get a condom or 
                        something--

                                 DIXIE
                        No fuck it give me your demon seed--

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Barret and Dixie are wrapped in each other’s arms downstairs 
           on the pool table. They’ve been going at it all day. She 
           closes her eyes and presses her forehead against his.

                                 BARRET
                        What is it?  Were you just 
                        remembering something horrible I 
                        did in the future?

                                 DIXIE
                        No, I was remembering something 
                        horrible you did five minutes ago.

                                 BARRET
                        Oh yeah.  Not apologizing for that, 
                        either.
                             (they grin, then)
                        There’s something else though.

           Dixie sits up. Sighs. She puts her hand on his cheek.

                                 DIXIE
                        You still need to announce that 
                        you’re not running for President.

                                 BARRET
                        Why?  I feel like everybody already 
                        thinks that was a joke--

                                 DIXIE
                        But it’s not a joke.  And it must 
                        still happen, because...

                                 BARRET
                        You’re still here.

           Beat.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        What if we just -- held off?  For a 
                        little while longer?
                                 DIXIE
                        Barret...

                                 BARRET
                        I mean if I did do it, and you 
                        disappeared -- would you even 
                        remember any of this?  Of us?

           She stares at him, unsure.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Dixie, you’ve spent all this time 
                        worrying about fixing the past to 
                        save the future... But wouldn’t it 
                        be nice to just, for once, enjoy 
                        the present?
                             (pleased with himself)
                        Wow, that was a good line.

           Dixie can’t help but laugh.

                                 DIXIE
                        One more day.

                                 BARRET
                        One more day.

           They kiss again, and this time it’s as emotional as it is 
           physical -- the kind of kiss that happens when two people 
           might be falling for each other. And off that we...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT (A FEW MONTHS LATER)

           We’re in the future -- the “a few months later” future.

           MEDIUM SHOT of Barret and Dixie outside a nice restaurant, 
           both scrolling Instagram on their phones. Time has passed -- 
           Dixie is all cleaned up now, her style contemporary and hip.

                                 DIXIE
                        Did you see the one of the honey 
                        badger dancing to the rap song?

                                 BARRET
                        Yeah, that’s pretty old content.

                                 DIXIE
                             (mocking him)
                        “That’s pretty old content.”
                                 BARRET
                             (re: his phone)
                        What the fuck is this dude doing?

                                 DIXIE
                        Do not be a dick to him, you’re 
                        always so mean to these guys--

           An UBER pulls up on the curb and finally we REVEAL:

           Dixie is fucking pregnant! At least 4 months along.

           Barret starts to get in. Then he remembers and holds the door 
           open for Dixie. She feigns flattery. He rolls his eyes.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        My goodness, what a gentleman!

           I/E. UBER - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           They ride in the back, listening to their cowboy UBER 
           DRIVER’s country music cover of Migos’ “Bad and Boujee”. 
           Dixie acts interested; Barret wants to die.

                                 DIXIE
                        This is so good.

                                 BARRET
                        COUGH-ultural appropriation--

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Thank ya ma’am, I got a whole 
                        Instagram where I do these country 
                        covers of rap songs--

                                 BARRET
                        Here we go...

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Hey man, think maybe you could 
                        shout me out sometime?  Would be 
                        great exposure--

                                 BARRET
                        Nope--

                                 DIXIE
                        He’d be happy to.

           She glares at Barret. They argue with their faces until she 
           takes his hand and puts it on her pregnant belly. Checkmate.
                                 BARRET
                        ... What’s your username?

           INT. BARRET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Barret and Dixie lie in bed, facing each other.

                                 DIXIE
                        I gotta tell you, it’s so nice to 
                        have a normal, boring life.  No 
                        more running, no more fighting, and 
                        especially no more time 
                        traveling...

                                 BARRET
                             (not quite convincing)
                        Totally.

           He goes in for a steamy kiss, clearly trying to initiate 
           sex... but then she accidentally BURPS in his face.

                                 DIXIE
                        Sorry, your demon seed is giving me 
                        gas, can you go get the Pepto?

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Barret trudges into the kitchen and goes to grab the Pepto.

                                 DIXIE (O.S.)
                             (from upstairs)
                        Can you bring up some toilet paper 
                        too?

                                 BARRET
                             (dead inside)
                        Hell yeah!

           His gaze drifts to the half-open basement door.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Downstairs in the (fully repaired) basement, we see various 
           photos from Barret and Dixie’s relationship: amusement parks, 
           sporting events, camping trips, etc. On the wall hangs a new 
           Bitmoji portrait, this one of Barret and Dixie kissing.

           It seems like they have a genuinely happy life together, 
           except...
           Right now Barret is in the dark closet, stealthily digging 
           through some boxes. Finally he finds what he’s looking for.

           MOMENTS LATER

           He’s stripped naked and is putting on the TIME BACKPACK. He 
           sets the date to June 6, 1969, and, with the confidence of 
           somebody who’s done this before, ACTIVATES IT.

           WHOOSH!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EMPTY FIELD - EVENING (1969)

           Barret drops onto the empty plot of land where his house will 
           be built decades from now. He gets up, dusts his naked body 
           off, and starts walking.

           SIDE OF THE ROAD

           He’s walking along a dirt road when a VW BUS pulls up. 
           HIPPIES adorned in flowers and tie-dye stick their heads out 
           the windows, unfazed by Barret’s nudity.

                                 HIPPIE
                        Hey man, need a ride?

                                 BARRET
                             (shrugs)
                        Sure.

           EXT. WOODSTOCK MUSIC FESTIVAL - DAY

           Barret is in the crowd at Woodstock, beard grown out and a 
           crown of flowers on his head. He’s dancing to Jimi Hendrix, 
           out of his mind on acid.

           He’s offered a joint but somebody bumps into him, knocking 
           the J onto the ground. Barret WILDLY THROWS A PUNCH, starting 
           a fight that turns into a VIOLENT HIPPIE MOSH PIT.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           He drops back onto the floor in the present.
                                 BARRET
                        God I love time travel.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BARRET’S TIME TRAVEL ADVENTURES

           QUICK GLIMPSES of Barret going on adventures through time, 
           each populated with fun, unexpected cameos:

           FORD THEATER, 1865

           Everybody else is watching the play, but Barret’s eyes are 
           focused on the balcony box where ABE LINCOLN is sitting.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (to the MAN next to him)
                        ohshitohshitohshit here it comes--

                                 MAN
                        Sir, I’m trying to watch the--

           JOHN WILKES BOOTH APPEARS BEHIND LINCOLN AND SHOOTS HIM IN 
           THE BACK OF THE HEAD, KILLING HIM. EVERYBODY SCREAMS!

                                 BARRET
                        OH, FUCK!  Oh shit, Fuck!  DAMN!

           MOVIE THEATER, 1976

           A long line of people are out front of a multiplex, waiting 
           to see Star Wars on opening night. Barret walks up and yells 
           into a megaphone:

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Vader is Luke’s dad!

           He gives the DX crotch chop to the crowd and runs off into 
           the night, cackling like a hyena. Nobody in line even knows 
           what he meant (yet).

           THE CHATEAU MARMONT, 80s

           Barret does a fuck ton of coke with seedy Hollywood-types at 
           the Chateau. He’s strung out and rambling incoherently as he 
           chops lines with a BOWIE KNIFE.

           A SUIT tries to do some of the coke and Barret PUTS THE KNIFE 
           to his throat. His hands are shaking with intensity.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        You wanna fuckin die, right here, 
                        right now?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Barret reenters the bedroom and tosses Dixie a roll of toilet 
           paper.

                                 DIXIE
                        Did you bring the Pepto?

                                 BARRET
                        Shit, I forgot.

           He walks back out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           70s DANCE CLUB

           Barret leads the club in a spectacular choreographed disco 
           dance straight out of Boogie Nights.

           MIDCENTURY SUBURBAN HOME, 1962

           Barret is at a Mad Men-style dinner party, dressed like a 
           well-to-do midcentury dad. He sips scotch and smokes 
           cigarettes while his friends and neighbors crowd around the 
           TV, distraught over the Cuban Missile Crisis.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (arrogantly)
                        It’s nothing to worry about.  
                        You’re all getting worked up for no 
                        reason.

           JANE, one of the women, turns back, tears on her cheeks.

                                 JANE
                        But how can you know for sure, 
                        Barret?

                                 BARRET
                             (casually)
                        Because, Jane.  I have a great mind 
                        for geo-political conflict.

           The rest of the guests murmurs their agreement.
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Also: Tom’s sleeping with Martha, 
                        Deke’s sleeping with Lois, and 
                        Jane, I’m sorry to reveal, is 
                        dicking down with the mail man. 

           Barret coolly lights another cigarette as the dinner party 
           devolves into a HUGE, EMOTIONAL, VIOLENT FIGHT.

           ARMY RECRUITMENT CENTER, DECEMBER 1941

           Barret enters a recruitment center. We watch through the 
           glass window as he sits down and speaks to an officer.

           BOOT CAMP, 1942

           He’s getting his ass kicked in boot camp. He collapses during 
           drills, but RANDY, a good-natured goober and fellow recruit, 
           lifts him up off the ground--

                                 RANDY
                        I got you, man.

           NIGHTCLUB, 1943

           Barret and Randy, now best pals, wearing their dapper formal 
           uniforms, dance and twirl some beautiful girls at the club.

           DOT, the most beautiful of them all, falls into Barret’s 
           arms. They should kiss here, but...

                                 BARRET
                        Lousy luck for you, sweetheart -- I 
                        got a girl waiting for me back 
                        home.
                             (points to Randy)
                        But my pal Randy there, on the 
                        other hand...

           HE TWIRLS DOT TOWARD RANDY, AND THEY KISS. Barret grins.

           DEPLOYMENT, 1944

           Barret and Randy are about to ship out. Randy shares a 
           tearful goodbye with his now-wife DOT and their young 
           DAUGHTER. When they finally pull away, Dot hollers at Barret:

                                 DOT
                        You take care of him, Barret!

                                 BARRET
                             (a tip of the cap)
                        I got you, ma’am.
           Barret and Randy do the double high-five that Maverick and 
           Goose do in Top Gun.

           D-DAY, 1944

           Barret and Randy are in a plane over France, about to 
           parachute into the D-Day battle. Barret loses his nerve and 
           backs away from the door, but Randy grabs him.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        ... I donno -- I donno if I can...

                                 RANDY
                        I got you, man.

           Randy takes Barret’s hand. Galvanized by his friend’s 
           courage, Barret steels himself and they leap out of the 
           plane, together.

           FOREST, 1944

           Barret and Randy trudge through a dark forest. A Nazi steps 
           out from behind a tree and aims at Barret--

           But Randy pushes Barret out of the way and TAKES A BULLET TO 
           THE HEAD, DYING INSTANTLY!

                                 BARRET
                        RANDY, NOOOO--!!!

           Barret rips the bloody dog tags off his dead friend’s neck 
           and stares into his lifeless eyes.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        ... I got you, man.

           TRENCH, 1945

           Barret shivers in a snowy trench, mortars EXPLODING all 
           around him. He clutches Randy’s dog tags to his chest.

           TRAIN (NEW YORK CITY), 1946

           Barret, finally back home, rides the train out of New York 
           City. He stares blankly out the window at the Statue of 
           Liberty.

           RANDY AND DOT’S HOUSE, 1946

           Dot cries gently as Barret presents her with Randy’s dog 
           tags. He kneels down to address their toddler DAUGHTER.
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Permission to shake the hand of the 
                        daughter... of the bravest man I’ve 
                        ever met.

           She shakes his hand... then he just starts CRACKING UP, 
           crying laughing, it’s the funniest thing in the world to him.

                                 DOT
                             (so goddamn confused)
                        Why are you -- what’s funny...?

                                 BARRET
                             (through laughter)
                        It’s the line!  The line from the 
                        end of Armageddon, with the guy, 
                        and Bruce Willis’ daughter--!
                             (can’t even catch his 
                              breath)
                        I did the whole thing just to tee 
                        up that one moment and it worked 
                        out perfectly, holy shit...

           He falls onto his ass and just keeps laughing. Dot and her 
           daughter back slowly into their house, both scarred for life.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        It’s such a specific bit, I know, 
                        but I swear to God it’s hilarious--

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRET’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Barret once again reenters, this time holding the Pepto 
           Bismol. He gives it to Dixie and gets under the covers.

                                 DIXIE
                        Goodnight.

           But he’s already asleep. Dixie looks at him, suspicious.

           INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

           Dixie tries to make breakfast but, still not understanding 
           modern cooking, pours half a bottle of oil on a hot pan and 
           starts a grease fire.

           Barret comes downstairs as she’s putting it out with a towel. 
                                 BARRET
                        Smells delicious.
                             (kisses her cheek)
                        I’ll grab something at the office.

           He starts out. She hesitates, then:

                                 DIXIE
                        Hey.

                                 BARRET
                             (turns)
                        Yeah?

                                 DIXIE
                        Did you go on an epic time travel 
                        adventure last night when you went 
                        down to get me Pepto Bismol?

                                 BARRET
                             (beat)
                        Psh, no... why?

                                 DIXIE
                        I donno, you look more tired than 
                        normal.

                                 BARRET
                        Probably stress?  We are having a 
                        baby.

                                 DIXIE
                             (skeptical)
                        Yeah... I just know it was a 
                        problem for you, early on, and it 
                        is addicting, but it’s really not 
                        something I’m okay with--

                                 BARRET
                        Dix, if you’re so worried about it, 
                        why do you keep that thing in the 
                        house?

                                 DIXIE
                        You know why.  If it ever fell into 
                        the wrong hands--

                                 BARRET
                             (holds up his hands)
                        Um, The Duke here.  Aren’t these 
                        literally the worst hands?
                                 DIXIE
                             (starting to feel bad)
                        I hope not, not anymore.

                                 BARRET
                        Well.  I’ve been trying.  I haven’t 
                        tweeted at Lena Dunham in months, 
                        so... not sure what else I can do 
                        to prove it to you.

                                 DIXIE
                             (beat)
                        You’re right.  Have a good day.

           They trade smiles and he exits. Dixie stares at the door, 
           feeling guilty, missing the asshole already.

           INT. THE MEMEING OF LIFE TV STUDIO - DAY

           Barret is on the hipster-chic boardroom set of his reality 
           show, The Memeing Of Life. Cameras roll as he talks tough to 
           the collection of millennial contestants.

                                 BARRET
                        Some okay stuff in today’s 
                        challenge.  Dogs Humping To Trap 
                        Music and Sad Mister Rogers in 
                        particular could be real viral 
                        sensations.  But there was a lot of 
                        crap, too, and now, one of you 
                        losers is going home.

           He pauses for dramatic effect, then points at DUSTIN, a surf 
           bro wearing a Mason Ramsey (the yodeling cowboy) tank-top.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Dustin, you’re unfollowed!  Get the 
                        fuck outta here!

           An intense and upsetting laser show plays as Barret air-jerks 
           and dabs at Dustin, who cries when he leaves the stage. 

           INT. BARRET’S PRODUCTION OFFICE - DAY

           Barret reclines on his couch, watching a YouTube video of 
           ANDERSON COOPER INTERVIEWING LENA DUNHAM.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER (INTERVIEW)
                        What would you say finally settled 
                        the feud?
                                 LENA DUNHAM (INTERVIEW)
                        I’d like to think he did some much-
                        needed self-reflection, and 
                        realized he was being a jerk.

           This does not sit well with Barret.

                                 BARRET
                        Bull shit, it’s just cause Dixie 
                        made me!

                                 ANDERSON COOPER (INTERVIEW)
                        Did he reach out privately to 
                        apologize?

                                 LENA DUNHAM (INTERVIEW)
                        Oh no, no way.  He just stopped 
                        tweeting at me to eat his -- Can 
                        you say it on CNN?

                                 ANDERSON COOPER (INTERVIEW)
                             (sighs)
                        It’s permissible in a journalistic 
                        context, yes.

                                 LENA DUNHAM (INTERVIEW)
                             (straight into camera)
                        “Eat my ass.”  Wow, that felt good.

           Barret slams his laptop shut, beyond frustrated. His 
           ASSISTANT pokes her head into the office:

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Mr. Dukes, somebody’s here for you.

                                 BARRET
                        I want to respond with a joke but 
                        I’m too pissed off to think of one, 
                        who is it?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        He says he’s your campaign manager?

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Barret emerges into the lobby. There waiting for him is...

           MILLER, wearing a PEPE THE FROG t-shirt. He DABS at Barret.

                                 MILLER
                        Lord Duke -- I’ve come to save you.
           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Barret HAULS ASS out of the building and across the parking 
           lot, trying to get away. But Miller is hot on his heels.

                                 MILLER
                        2018 isn’t all that bad!

                                 BARRET
                        Don’t care--

                                 MILLER
                        Clearly immigration and women’s 
                        rights are still problems but I’ve 
                        made a fortune off Crypto--

                                 BARRET
                        Stop talking to me--!

                                 MILLER
                        And online communities like 4Chan 
                        have been incredibly welcoming -- I 
                        actually just got promoted to mod, 
                        everybody there loves you by the 
                        way, I think their support will be 
                        very influential in The Duke’s 
                        election--

           Barret reaches his G-Wagen and spins to face Miller.

                                 BARRET
                        Look, Miller, I appreciate your 
                        rabid fandom but you need to split.  
                        The Duke is evil, and I’m--

                                 MILLER
                        The Duke.

           Beat. Barret has no choice but to absorb that.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Seducing the shrew sent to kill you 
                        was a brilliant chess move--

                                 BARRET
                             (reluctantly)
                        Thanks, I agree with you there--

                                 MILLER
                        But the fun is over -- she can no 
                        longer stand in our way.  History 
                        tells us your feud with Lena Dunham 
                        is the catalyst for your election.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILLER (CONT'D)
                        If that conflict truly dies, 
                        everything is at risk.

           Barret runs his hands through his hair, super stressed out. 

                                 BARRET
                        Dude.  If Dixie finds out you’re 
                        here she’s gonna be furious, and--

                                 MILLER
                        So she’s made a cuck of you.

                                 BARRET
                        ... What?  No--

                                 MILLER
                        The Duke, my childhood hero, is a 
                        blue pill, soy boy cuck!

                                 BARRET
                        Dude, I’m NOT a cuck--

           Miller makes like a chicken, pecking and squawking.

                                 MILLER
                        Cuck-a-doodle-doo!

                                 BARRET
                        Okay, fuck you, goodbye.

           He gets in his G-Wagen.

                                 MILLER
                        Did she tell you what happens to 
                        The Duke?

           Beat. Barret doesn’t shut his door.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Your future... Did she tell you how 
                        you die?

           Barret turns back to Miller. Now he’s listening.

           EXT. BARRET’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Barret pulls into his driveway later that evening. From the 
           dark look on his face, we can tell something has changed.
           INT. BARRET’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Barret enters a seemingly empty home. All the lights are off, 
           save for a soft glow coming from the basement. He heads down.

           BASEMENT

           Waiting for him by the couch, surrounded by candles, in the 
           exact spot where she first appeared, is Dixie.

           She wears a Barret’s face blanket, the Time Backpack, and 
           NOTHING ELSE.

                                 DIXIE
                        Hi.

                                 BARRET
                             (beat)
                        Why are you wearing the Backpack?

                                 DIXIE
                        I wanted to recreate the night we 
                        met.  Minus the whole me strangling 
                        you bit.
                             (playfully)
                        Unless you want me to strangle you 
                        a little.

           He steps into the room so they’re face to face. Orange 
           candlelight flickers between them.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        I thought about, um, everything.  
                        And I’m sorry for accusing you of 
                        using the Backpack, I shouldn’t -- 
                        because you have changed, and -- I 
                        know we never say it, I set the 
                        tone, I think the first thing I 
                        ever said to you was “I hate you” 
                        but... I don’t.
                             (beat)
                        I--

           He cuts her off before she can say, “I love you.”

                                 BARRET
                        Did you kill me, Dixie?

           Beat. She holds his stare. Barret waits for an answer. Things 
           intensify quickly from here.

                                 DIXIE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.
                                 BARRET
                        Before you came here, in the 
                        future, right in this basement.  
                        November 30, 2076.

                                 DIXIE
                        Where is this coming from--?

                                 BARRET
                        Tell me you didn’t stab me in the 
                        neck like at the end of Gladiator--

                                 DIXIE
                        Don’t reference movies I haven’t 
                        seen because I’m from the future, 
                        you know I hate that--

                                 BARRET
                        Well I hate being told that my 
                        girlfriend murdered me before we 
                        even met!

           Beat.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... Told by who?

                                 BARRET
                        Remember that kid, “Miller”?  With 
                        the jetpack?  He stopped by the 
                        office today--

                                 DIXIE
                        Oh, God, I thought for sure he was 
                        dead -- Barret, he worships The 
                        Duke, he’s dangerous, he’s evil!

                                 BARRET
                        Yeah, you made your feelings 
                        abundantly clear when you set him 
                        on fire--

                                 DIXIE
                        Because he was trying to--

                                 BARRET
                        Protect me from you!

           Frustrated, Dixie starts up the stairs.

                                 DIXIE
                        Just let me put some fucking 
                        clothes on and then we can talk--
           Barret follows her up.

                                 BARRET
                        I need to see it--

                                 DIXIE
                        No, it doesn’t matter--

                                 BARRET
                        It does to me--!

           He grabs the Backpack and they struggle over it. Finally 
           Dixie loses her cool and THROWS HIM DOWN THE STAIRS AND 
           AGAINST THE WALL, ripping their Bitmoji portrait in half.

                                 DIXIE
                        Don’t fuck with me, Barret.

           Barret looks at her from the floor, furious and humiliated.

                                 BARRET
                        I did use the Backpack last night.  
                        I do it all the time, it’s like 
                        porn but better because it’s time 
                        travel.
                             (beat)
                        I go back and just troll the past, 
                        I get fucked up, I’m a dick to 
                        people and then I leave.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... Why?

                                 BARRET
                        The same reason I told Lena Dunham 
                        to eat my ass, because it’s fucking 
                        hilarious!  Because I’m bored!  I 
                        haven’t changed, are you kidding?  
                        No matter how much we play house, 
                        no matter how much you make me 
                        pretend to be good, I like being an 
                        asshole.
                             (then)
                        But at least I didn’t kill you and 
                        keep it a secret.  So tell me, 
                        Dixie, who’s really the worst 
                        person in this relationship??

           Beat. Dixie rips off the Backpack and throws it at him.

                                 DIXIE
                        You wanna watch?  Go ahead.

           He looks at the Backpack, surprised she relented.
                                 BARRET
                        ... What’s the best vantage point? 

                                 DIXIE
                        Seriously??

                                 BARRET
                        I mean you were there!

           She grits her teeth and points to the door leading outside. 
           Barret walks over there and takes his shirt off.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Can you turn around?

           Dixie complies, seeing red. Once he’s undressed, Barret puts 
           on the Time Backpack and steps outside. Dixie walks over and 
           stands on the other side of the door. They look at each other 
           for a moment, then...

           WHOOSH! Barret disappears. 

           Dixie just stands there, trying to hold it together.

           EXT. BARRET’S HOUSE - NIGHT (FUTURE)

           Barret appears outside his bombed out house. He JUMPS at the 
           sight of a radioactive armadillo foraging through trash. But 
           then his attention is drawn to a window--

           Inside, the CEILING COLLAPSES AND DIXIE FALLS THROUGH, ON TOP 
           OF THE DUKE, AND DRIVES HER PARTICLE DAGGER INTO HIS THROAT. 

           BLOOD SPRAYS EVERYWHERE AS SHE STABS HIM REPEATEDLY, really 
           fucking going for it.

           Outside, Barret’s skin goes ghost white. His mouth opens wide 
           and he activates the Time Backpack, DISAPPEARING--

           I/E. BARRET’S HOUSE - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           BARRET REAPPEARS OUTSIDE AND PUKES ALL OVER THE DOOR. 

           Dixie bursts through, leaping over his vomit, and tries to go 
           to him. But Barret BACKS AWAY from her, toward the pool. He’s 
           legitimately terrified. As he puts his boxers back on--

                                 BARRET
                        Stay away!  God it was ten thousand 
                        times worse than I thought it’d be, 
                        Jesus Christ, holy fucking shit I 
                        just watched myself die!
                                 DIXIE
                        Barret...

           Dixie doesn’t know what to say. Barret pulls on his jeans 
           and, in his panic and fury, an idea, a cruel, horrible idea, 
           comes into his mind. He takes out his phone.

                                 BARRET
                        I could announce right now I’m not 
                        running for President, and you’d...

           He doesn’t say it, but he doesn’t need to. Dixie would 
           disappear -- and so would their unborn child. 

           Absolutely gutted, Dixie’s trembling hand instinctively goes 
           to her pregnant belly. That’s enough to melt Barret and snap 
           him out of it. He puts down the phone, crumbling.

           DIXIE HOWLS AND RUSHES HIM. She delivers a violent UPPERCUT 
           to the jaw and rips the phone out of his hand. Using strength 
           we didn’t even know she had, she literally BREAKS THE PHONE 
           IN HALF, THEN ROUNDHOUSE KICKS BARRET INTO THE POOL.

           Dixie stands there by the pool, shattered. Finally Barret 
           surfaces, blood pouring from his mouth. Neither can believe 
           what’s just happened.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (reeling)
                        I’m never gonna apologize for all 
                        that shit I didn’t do.  And you’re 
                        never gonna forgive me for it, not 
                        really.  So what the hell are we 
                        doing, Dixie?

           Beat. She puts on the Time Backpack and adjusts the date. She 
           stands, turns to leave, then looks back at him one last time.

           WHOOSH! Dixie disappears.

           Barret treads water, waiting for her to return.

           But she doesn’t come back. And she isn’t going to.

           INT. BARRET’S HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT / MORNING

           Barret wanders around his empty house until sunrise, finally 
           landing in the basement. He stares at the torn Bitmoji 
           portrait of he and Dixie, a painful realization dawning on 
           him.

           He opens up 4Chan on his phone. He surfs for a little bit, 
           visibly distraught by what he sees.
           INT. THE MALL - DAY

           Barret comes down the escalator at the mall. Waiting for him 
           at the bottom, wearing a shirt depicting Morpheus holding out 
           the red pill, is MILLER.

           They see each other and DAB. Miller goes to Barret.

                                 MILLER
                        Did you--

                                 BARRET
                        Shh, I’m in charge now.  I kicked 
                        that raggedy ass future bitch right 
                        the fuck out of my life.  I am no 
                        longer a cuck, got it?

                                 MILLER
                             (so proud)
                        Got it.

                                 BARRET
                        It’s time to 69 America, with me on 
                        top.  The Duke’s ascent starts 
                        today.

                                 MILLER
                        How do you want to announce your 
                        candidacy?

           Barret gives Miller his phone.

                                 BARRET
                        Film me coming down the escalator 
                        there, looking tight.

           Barret turns and heads back up, his back to Miller. Despite 
           his bluster, the conflicted look on his face makes you wonder 
           whether he actually believes in any of this bullshit.

           Alan Parsons’ Project’s “Time” begins and plays over the 
           following sequence:

           NEWS FOOTAGE

           Barret comes down the escalator, DABBING at the camera. 

           Headlines read: “BARRET DUKES RESIGNS FROM REALITY SHOW, 
           ANNOUNCES 2020 PRESIDENTIAL BID”.

                                 BARRET
                        Lena Dunham can eat my Presidential 
                        ass!  Let’s fucking go!
           EXT. PREHISTORIC JUNGLE - DAY (65,000,000 BC)

           Dixie walks through a prehistoric jungle, naked, pregnant, 
           and exhausted. She emerges into a clearing and looks across 
           the lake at a family of DINOSAURS. She trudges on, alone.

           INT. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY

           Barret and Miller unbox tacky red, white, and blue hats and 
           shirts featuring The Duke’s campaign slogan:

           DAB - “Damn, America’s Badass!”

           They high-five, loving how clever they are.

           EXT. PREHISTORIC JUNGLE - NIGHT (65,000,000 BC)

           Time has passed. Dixie, her bump growing larger, SPRINTS 
           THROUGH THE JUNGLE, being hunted by a pack of VELOCIRAPTORS. 
           She leads them toward her cave shelter...

           REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER 

           Barret and Lena Dunham argue during a round table discussion.

                                 LENA DUNHAM
                        ... I think your rhetoric is 
                        divisive, and gross--

                                 BARRET
                        How bout this?

           HE RIPS A LOUD FART into his microphone.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        What if you ate my ass after that, 
                        would that be gross--?

                                 LENA DUNHAM
                        Okay you know what that’s fucking 
                        ridiculous, you’re a piece of--

           BILL MAHER has to get between them. Miller watches from the 
           audience, hooting and hollering, egging it on.

           I/E. DIXIE’S CAVE - NIGHT (65,000,000 BC)

           Dixie grabs a makeshift spear and shield and brilliantly 
           fights off the raptors, earning their respect. The biggest 
           one approaches her and she gently touches its snout.
           VARIOUS PRESIDENTIAL RALLIES

           Barret holds a series of rallies, and each time the venue and 
           crowd has doubled in size. Behind him is a mural of a bald 
           eagle in Oakleys dabbing.

           An older Duke SUPPORTER is interviewed by local news:

                                 SUPPORTER
                        I like him cause he’s a straight 
                        shooter.  And he’s gonna surround 
                        himself with great people.

           A picture of Lena Dunham is shown and the crowd loses its 
           mind. They start a rabid chant: Eat His Ass! Eat His Ass!

           EXT. CLEARING - DAY (65,000,000 BC)

           Dixie, now queen of the dinosaurs, rides on the back of a 
           sprinting velociraptor. They come up alongside a pack of 
           triceratops and Dixie HURLS her spear, taking one down.

           She lets loose a primal cry and the raptors echo her call.

           INT. AIRPLANE - SUNSET

           Barret travels first class. Miller leans back and shows him a 
           New York Times headline: “BARRET ‘THE DUKE’ DUKES: LOVE HIM 
           OR HATE HIM, HE COULD BE YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT”

           Barret nods his acknowledgement and looks out the window at 
           the beautiful sunset. There’s an empty seat beside him.

           EXT. CLIFFSIDE - SUNSET (65,000,000 BC)

           The sun sets over a spectacular prehistoric vista. Dixie, her 
           belly huge now, watches alone. She sets the Time Backpack on 
           an empty rock beside her.

           CNN INTERVIEW

           Barret sits across from Anderson Cooper, just as he did when 
           we first met him. But now he’s wearing a suit and tie, 
           actually trying to look Presidential.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        People say you’re a real threat to 
                        actually win the Presidency.  How 
                        do you feel about that?
                                 BARRET
                        I’d say I’m a real threat to make 
                        people say, like they used to, in 
                        the old days: “Damn, America’s 
                        Badass!”

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        A year ago you sat there and told 
                        me you weren’t running for 
                        President.  What changed your mind?

                                 BARRET
                             (considers this, then)
                        I saw an opportunity to make a 
                        difference.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                             (digging deeper)
                        So that’s why “The Duke” is 
                        running -- to make a difference?

           Barret takes a beat. He looks Anderson Cooper in the eyes and 
           answers, truthfully:

                                 BARRET
                        The Duke is running because he has 
                        to.

           END MUSIC, END SEQUENCE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. UBER BLACK SUV - TRAVELING - DAY

           Barret and Miller are in the backseat of an Uber Black, on 
           their way to The Duke’s biggest rally so far. Barret reads 
           the speech Miller has written for him.

                                 BARRET
                             (finishes reading)
                        Damn.  Do I really need to go out 
                        of my way to say Native Americans 
                        “had it coming?”

                                 MILLER
                        I think that’s exactly what The 
                        Duke would say.

           Their UBER DRIVER weighs in.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        I always like it when politicians 
                        tell a personal story, something--
                                 MILLER
                             (cold)
                        What do you do?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        ... Huh?

                                 MILLER
                        You had a note on my speech, you 
                        wanted a personal story.  Perhaps 
                        it could be a personal story about 
                        you.  What’s your vocation, sir?

           Barret just watches all this play out, curious. He’s never 
           seen someone else go at it with an Uber driver. 

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Well, I’m actually a musician--

                                 MILLER
                        What kind of musician?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        All kinds, I played in Jimmy 
                        Buffet’s band for a while, 
                        actually--

                                 MILLER
                             (losing his patience)
                        What do you now, what kind of music 
                        do you play now?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Now I mostly do scoring for films--

                                 MILLER
                        Oh, like for Star Wars?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        No, that’s John Williams, he’s the--

                                 MILLER
                        So where would we have heard your 
                        work?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                             (becoming embarrassed)
                        ... Well I haven’t actually done 
                        anything that--

                                 MILLER
                        So you’re not actually a film 
                        composer--
                                 UBER DRIVER
                        It depends on your definition of--

           Even Barret is growing uncomfortable with this.

                                 BARRET
                        How bout we just ride in awkward 
                        silence the rest of the way--?

                                 MILLER
                             (won’t let it go)
                        My definition of a film composer is 
                        a person who composes music for 
                        film for money, is that your job?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                             (finally breaking)
                        No, I guess--

                                 MILLER
                        And do you play music at all for 
                        money?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        I used to but not anymore--

                                 MILLER
                        Then I ask again: What Do You Do?

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        ......... I drive Uber.

                                 MILLER
                             (exploding)
                        THEN DON’T FUCKING TELL ME HOW TO 
                        WRITE MY SPEECHES.

           Long beat. The Uber Driver is devastated.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        It’s up here on the right.

           Barret and Miller get out at the stadium, where fans are 
           already beginning to line up. Barret watches the Uber pull 
           away, disturbed.

                                 BARRET
                        Hey, that was pretty--

                                 MILLER
                        Awesome, right?  I studied how much 
                        you used to hate Uber Drivers and 
                        would bully them.  It was a real 
                        inspiration.
           CLOSE ON Barret, realizing he created this monster, and, 
           looking at all his fans, probably a whole lot more of them.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        No apologies, Duke.  Remember?

           Barret reluctantly waves to the crowd and follows Miller 
           inside, unsure.

                                 BARRET
                        ... Yeah.  No apologies.

           INT. STADIUM - DAY

           The stadium doors aren’t open yet. On stage, KID ROCK 
           rehearses for his rendition of the National Anthem. Barret 
           and Miller watch from the wings.

                                 BARRET
                        I can’t believe we had to get Kid 
                        Rock for the National Anthem, this 
                        guy fucking licks!  What happened 
                        to Taylor Swift?

                                 MILLER
                        Well, I inquired but it turns out 
                        Lena Dunham is in her squad.  She 
                        said you can “fuck off and die.”

           Barret frowns and turns away, bummed -- and runs right into a 
           BLACK OPS-STYLE SQUADRON OF EVIL-LOOKING MERCENARY SOLDIERS.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        This should cheer you up -- our 
                        very first Blood Grunts!

                                 BARRET
                             (a little put off)
                        Who are they?

                                 MILLER
                        Basically all the guys who have 
                        been kicked out of various 
                        militaries for killing innocent 
                        children.  Your protection for the 
                        evening.

           The Blood Grunts DAB in salute to The Duke. Miller ushers 
           them over to a merch table.

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get you guys into some Duke 
                        merch!
                                 BARRET
                        ... Protection from what?

                                 MILLER
                        After tonight, you take the lead in 
                        the polls and never look back.  If 
                        there was ever a time for her to 
                        return and try to finish her 
                        mission...

                                 BARRET
                             (definitive)
                        She’s not coming back.
                             (then)
                        But -- if she does -- you tell them 
                        she’s not to be harmed.

                                 MILLER
                        Of course, Lord Duke.

           Barret turns and listens to the end of Kid Rock’s National 
           Anthem. Kid Rock holds the last note forever, it just keeps 
           going and going.

           Miller turns to one of the Blood Captains and nods evilly.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY (65,000,000 BC)

           Dixie trots through a field on her velociraptor, flanked by 
           other raptors. She’s cloaked in armor made of thick scaly 
           dinosaur hide, and adorned with a triceratops skull crown. 

           She rests her hand on her now-huge baby bump. Things are 
           quiet, peaceful until...

           AN ALBERTOSAURUS (basically a smaller T-Rex) bursts through 
           the tree line and DEVOURS two of her raptors. She unsheathes 
           a bow and LAUNCHES ARROWS at the giant lizard, but all that 
           does is piss it off.

           The Albertosaurus turns and GIVES CHASE to Dixie. She kicks 
           her raptor, urging it to run faster, but the Albertosaurus is 
           gaining... GAINING...

           ROAR! A FUCKING TYRANNOSAURUS-REX CRASHES OUT OF THE JUNGLE 
           AND LUNGES AT THE ALBERTOSAURUS’ NECK, KILLING IT WITH ONE 
           BRUTAL SNAP OF THE JAWS.

           Dixie and her raptor keep running, not looking back to see 
           what happened, but then:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        DIXIE!
           She stops. That voice... it can’t be. She turns and sees, 
           wearing a Time Backpack and riding atop the T-Rex that saved 
           her...

           The Duke.

           (That’s right -- The Duke that she killed way back at the 
           beginning of our story.)

                                 THE DUKE
                        Hey Dixie, it’s me, The Duke!  AKA 
                        Barret!

                                 DIXIE
                        .......... What the fuck?

           EXT. LAKE - SUNSET (65,000,000 BC)

           Dixie and The Duke let their dinosaurs drink from the lake 
           like horses while they talk.

                                 DIXIE
                        I don’t understand -- I killed you.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Yeah, floor collapses then knife to 
                        the throat as soon as I get back, 
                        right?  Tight.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... When -- how...?

                                 THE DUKE
                        Wouldn’t a convoluted sci-fi 
                        explanation of how I got here just 
                        be a lame disappointment and sorta 
                        ruin our magical reunion?

                                 DIXIE
                        What reunion?  You just met me -- 
                        and how did you know how I kill--
                             (realizes)
                        Oh, God.

           Dixie hunches over, suddenly dizzy. The Duke confirms her 
           suspicion:

                                 THE DUKE
                        Yep, this has all happened before.  
                        Time is an infinite loop, blah 
                        blah, et cetera et cetera.
                                 DIXIE
                        ... I don’t feel well...

                                 THE DUKE
                        On the one hand, knowing that 
                        everything is premeditated means 
                        existence is pointless and 
                        horrifying.  On the other hand, 
                        wasn’t it already?

           Dixie falls into a seated position. The Duke clangs over with 
           his four metal legs and kneels down beside her.

                                 THE DUKE (CONT’D)
                        Two years before I ran for 
                        President, you appeared in my 
                        basement and tried to kill me.  
                        Well, not you -- my version of 
                        Dixie.  We fought, I ran, I made 
                        hilarious jokes that warmed her icy 
                        heart, I saved her life, she kept 
                        checking out my ass--  

                                 DIXIE
                        I -- she did not, she had no 
                        interest in your ass--

                                 THE DUKE
                        Oh if I remember correctly which I 
                        DO she had a lot of interest in my 
                        ass... And then things were good 
                        for a while.
                             (he looks at Dixie’s 
                              pregnant belly)
                        Until it all got fucked up.

           Dixie looks at him.

                                 DIXIE
                        You mean you fucked it all up.

                                 THE DUKE
                        No, I was just being polite 
                        actually, pretty sure you fucked it 
                        up--

                                 DIXIE
                        Oh my God even now you still can’t 
                        take any blame for -- y’know what, 
                        no.  I’m not doing this anymore.

           Dixie stands and grabs her velociraptor to leave.
                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        You need to leave and go get killed 
                        by me before I kill you here and 
                        really fuck up the timeline.

                                 THE DUKE
                             (laughs)
                        The fucking “timeline”...
                             (she turns, he holds up 
                              the Time Backpack)
                        The moment I got elected President, 
                        I started developing this 
                        technology.  It’s all I thought 
                        about for 56 years.

                                 DIXIE
                        Why?  So you could go stand-up 69 
                        Cleopatra?

                                 THE DUKE
                        No -- although that is a good 
                        idea...
                             (becoming serious)
                        It was so I could go find my Dixie.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... And did you?

           The Duke stares at her, the younger version of the woman he 
           fell for, his heart breaking.

                                 THE DUKE
                        No.  I lost her across time.  She’s 
                        probably off on some grand 
                        adventure, the sort of thing people 
                        make sequels about.
                             (choking up)
                        But I never got to tell her--

                                 DIXIE
                        Don’t.

           She stops him before he can say, “I love you.”

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not her.

           He nods, understanding. He starts to reach for her belly but 
           stops, asking permission with his eyes. She hesitates, then 
           nods. And for the first time in over half a century, The Duke 
           touches his child -- their child.
                                 THE DUKE
                             (hand still on her belly)
                        I didn’t want this, Dixie.  Every 
                        speech I ever gave, I kept looking 
                        at the door, hoping you’d appear 
                        and stop me.  But I just thought, 
                        if I didn’t go through with it...

           INT. STADIUM - BACKSTAGE - DAY (PRESENT)

           MOS: Our Barret watches Kid Rock, who is improbably still 
           singing the last note of the National Anthem. An immense and 
           painful burden glistens in his eyes.

                                 THE DUKE (V.O.)
                        ... If I didn’t become The Duke, 
                        and the timeline didn’t play out 
                        exactly as it was supposed to...

           EXT. LAKE - SUNSET (65,000,000 BC)

           Now The Duke and Dixie are face to face, looking right into 
           each other’s eyes.

                                 THE DUKE
                        ... Then I never would’ve met you, 
                        and our baby--

                                 DIXIE
                        Wouldn’t exist.

           He nods. Their foreheads are nearly touching.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        So The Duke’s reign, the literal 
                        apocalypse -- is all my fault?

                                 THE DUKE
                        In the most romantic way 
                        possible... yes.

           THEY KISS, long and good. It’s a kiss that could easily 
           become more, but Dixie tears herself away. They talk quickly 
           to cover up the awkwardness.

                                 DIXIE
                        You should go--

                                 THE DUKE
                        You’re sure you don’t wanna--?
                                 DIXIE
                        No, I know we’re the same people 
                        but it feels like cheating--

                                 THE DUKE
                        Yeah, it does sorta I guess--

                                 DIXIE
                             (re: his cyborg torso)
                        Also I mean do you even have a dick 
                        anymore--?

                                 THE DUKE
                        Oh yeah, it’s a giant metal robot 
                        dick, you’d love it.

           She bursts out laughing. She sounds, in a way, relieved.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... You’re still Barret.

           He adjusts the Time Backpack and backs slowly away from her.

                                 THE DUKE
                        I always was.
                             (then)
                        This is like the end of Ghost.

                                 DIXIE
                        I haven’t seen it.

                                 THE DUKE
                        Just trust me, it is.
                             (beat)
                        See ya.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... See ya.

                                 BARRET
                        ... Now just say “bye” and it’ll be 
                        exactly like--

                                 DIXIE
                        Nope, not doing it.

                                 BARRET
                        K, peace.

           FWOOSH! He disappears in a flash of blue light, leaving Dixie 
           there alone with the raptors and the T-Rex.
           EXT. CLIFFSIDE - NIGHT (65,000,000 BC)

           That night, Dixie sits around a fire with the dinosaurs. Her 
           raptor, the biggest one, approaches and they have a COUGH-
           TALK conversation (translated from dinosaur in SUBTITLES):

                                 RAPTOR
                        What are you going to do?

                                 DIXIE
                        Every other version of me has done 
                        nothing.

                                 RAPTOR
                        But you’re the only you.  And you 
                        have a choice.
                             (beat)
                        In our culture, we have a saying: 
                        “Sometimes you have to break a few 
                        eggs to protect the pack.”

                                 DIXIE
                        You’re saying I should go back and 
                        kill Barret--
                             (re: her belly)
                        And basically time-abort our baby?  
                        To save all of humanity?

                                 RAPTOR
                        That’s certainly one choice.  
                        Depends on who you consider your 
                        pack.
                             (then)
                        Why do you care for him so?

           Dixie considers the question, maybe for the very first time. 
           Finally:

                                 DIX
                        He makes me laugh.

           Beat. The raptor nods toward The Duke’s abandoned T-Rex, who 
           is off eating alone. She COUGH-WHISPERS:

                                 RAPTOR
                        I’m gonna fuck the T-Rex.

                                 DIXIE
                        Oh, girl, you totally should.

                                 RAPTOR
                        I know I shouldn’t, I know it 
                        doesn’t make sense, but I don’t 
                        give a shit.  I want him.
           Dixie watches as her friend starts flirting with the T-Rex, 
           thinking about Barret.

           Then she feels a kick in her belly. She stares up at the 
           stars, her heart and mind racing toward a decision.

           We hear PRE-LAP THUNDEROUS FEET STOMPING AND APPLAUSE....

           EXT. STADIUM - SUNSET (PRESENT)

           Barret’s followers cheer and stomp their feet outside as they 
           wait to be let into the stadium. There’s an almost carnival-
           like atmosphere in line -- The Duke has inspired a movement! 

           INT. STADIUM - SUNSET (PRESENT)

           Barret stands at the podium, pantomiming waving and dabbing. 
           Then he begins to run through his speech:

                                 BARRET
                        If you’re here tonight, it’s 
                        because, like me, you’re sick of 
                        being governed by pussies.

           His words echo in the silent arena.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        You want your President to be a 
                        tough, rich guy who clangs and 
                        bangs in the gym, beds beautiful 
                        babes, and most of all, loves guns.
                             (really milks the moment)
                        You want The Duke.

           Miller, watching from the wings, claps like an idiot.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Tonight, I’m going to lay out my 
                        Presidential vision.  So unless 
                        somebody wants to try to stop me...

           He stops and looks down the middle aisle, holding for an 
           extended beat, hoping, we know, that Dixie will appear and 
           stop him. But finally he accepts it: She ain’t coming.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought.
           EXT. STADIUM - LOADING AREA - SUNSET

           Three BLACK OPS GUYS (AKA two BLOOD GRUNTS and their BLOOD 
           CAPTAIN) stand guard at an underground entrance to the 
           stadium. They tote assault rifles and wear The Duke t-shirts 
           with dabbing bald eagles on them.

                                 BLOOD GRUNT 1
                        Is your shirt kinda itchy?

                                 BLOOD GRUNT 2
                        Yeah, it’s just the shitty regular 
                        material.

                                 BLOOD GRUNT 1
                        I hate that, I don’t know why 
                        everybody doesn’t do tri-blend--

           The Blood Captain BARKS at them:

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN
                        Y’all shut the fuck up!  You’re 
                        mercenaries, you don’t have to have 
                        humanizing bit conversations.  Just 
                        do what the kid said: If you see 
                        that pregnant bitch, kill h--

           THUMP! DIXIE, wearing the coolest tactical maternity fatigues 
           you’ve ever seen, backflips down in front of them. 

           The Grunts all raise their guns. The Blood Captain smirks.

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe the bitch actually 
                        showed...

           THEY FIRE but Dixie CARTWHEELS OUT OF THE WAY, sprinting 
           toward the Captain and GRABBING THE PISTOL from his holster. 

           She FIRES at the two Grunts, killing them point-blank, then 
           SNAPS the Captain’s leg and BLASTS A ROUND through his gut.

           She GRABS HIS HEAD from behind and pulls him close:

                                 DIXIE
                        Believe it.
                             (then)
                        Did you hear that?

           The life is draining from his eyes, but he nods.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck yes, such a good line!
           CRACK! She snaps his neck.

           She starts into the stadium, then feels something. She takes 
           the Time Backpack off and sees that it CAUGHT A BULLET. It’s 
           destroyed -- there’s no going back now.

           She drops it and keeps going.

           INT. STADIUM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Dixie walks steadily down the corridor, now armed with 
           pistols and an assault rifle. Two GRUNTS see her but it’s too 
           late -- BAM! BAM! They fall over, dead. 

           Dixie never slows down.

           She emerges into a larger hallway crawling with Blood Grunts. 
           They try to attack but it’s useless, she’s too fast. Some are 
           cut down with bullets, others with knives, others with her 
           bare hands. 

           At one point Kid Rock comes around a corner holding a coffee 
           and BAM! He gets shot in the face too.

           Dixie is fucking superhuman, it’s the coolest action sequence 
           you can possibly imagine, it’s like John Wick but even 
           tighter cause she’s pregnant!

           (Which is why this is the scene that wins the MTV Movie Award 
           for Best Fight.)

           BENEATH THE STADIUM

           Dixie finds herself in a wide open atrium. From out of 
           nowhere, TWO DOZEN GRUNTS AND CAPTAINS appear and surround 
           her. She’s never been this outnumbered.

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN
                        Now what are you gonna do?

                                 DIXIE
                             (without hesitation)
                        The Jason Statham thing.

                                 BLOOD CAPTAIN
                        ... What’s that?

           Dixie just grins.

           INT. STADIUM - MAIN ARENA - EVENING

           Barret is building toward his rehearsal’s grand finale.
                                 BARRET
                        ... And if you ask me, the Native 
                        Americans had it coming!

           Miller laughs his ass off. Barret sighs to himself.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        America is the tightest country in 
                        the world... and I’m the tightest 
                        guy in America.  And neither one of 
                        us should ever have to apologize 
                        for that!

           A bald eagle “Damn, America’s Badass” graphic appears on the 
           giant video screen behind him. But when Barret glances 
           backstage, he sees Miller checking his earpiece, a sudden 
           look of concern dawning on his face.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (hesitates)
                        ... So in closing, I guess there’s 
                        only one thing left to say--

           A VOICE SPEAKS UP FROM THE BACK OF THE STADIUM:

                                 DIXIE (O.S.)
                        I forgive you.

           DIXIE staggers down the center aisle like Nicole Kidman at 
           the end of Moulin Rouge, bloodstained but, somehow, upright. 

           Barret stares at her as she comes closer.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        For everything.  Everything you 
                        did, and everything you will do.  I 
                        forgive you.  

           Barret melts a little. Miller charges onstage, panicked.

                                 MILLER
                        Don’t listen to her, Duke -- the 
                        timeline, you have to preserve the 
                        timeline--

                                 DIXIE
                        Fuck the timeline and fuck you too, 
                        you little piece of shit.  Why do 
                        we all just assume we can go back 
                        and actually change the future by 
                        “fixing the past”?  Cause that’s 
                        how it worked in some stupid movie?  
                        No.  It’s dumb, I call bullshit.  
                        Nobody’s disappearing.
                                 (MORE)
                                 DIXIE (CONT'D)
                             (holds her hand out to 
                              Barret)
                        You don’t have to become The Duke 
                        to save our family.  You just have 
                        to come with me.

           Miller grabs Barret’s arm, actually raising his voice:

                                 MILLER
                        You have a responsibility, a 
                        destiny--!

           Barret turns toward Miller, who cowers beneath his glare.

                                 BARRET
                        Dixie, how many guys did you have 
                        to kill to get in here?

                                 DIXIE
                        Like at least 75.  Probably closer 
                        to 100 by the end.

                                 BARRET
                             (to Miller)
                        I told you she wasn’t to be harmed.

           Miller backs away, suddenly very afraid of Barret. Barret 
           reaches out and GRABS HIM BY THE THROAT, fire in his eyes.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        The Duke would kill your ass right 
                        here...

           He finally decides.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        ... But I’m not The Duke.

           Miller meets Barret’s gaze. His hero... his idol...

                                 MILLER
                        ... You’re right.  You’re not.

           BAM! BAM! Miller fires two rounds from a PARTICLE PISTOL into 
           Barret’s gut.

                                 DIXIE
                        NO!

           Barret tumbles backward, off the stage. Dixie goes to him and 
           applies pressure to the gushing wound. Barret looks up at 
           Miller, shocked.
                                 BARRET
                        What’d you do, go through my closet 
                        and steal that gun?

                                 MILLER
                        Oh I went through all your closets, 
                        I wore all your shit too!

                                 BARRET
                        So... fucking... creepy--!

           Miller studies his arms. He grins evilly at Dixie.

                                 MILLER
                        I’m not disappearing so I guess 
                        you’re right -- he doesn’t have to 
                        become The Duke.
                             (working it out in his 
                              head)
                        But if we’re both still here, that 
                        means somebody does...
                             (realizing)
                        Somebody like me.

           Dixie rises and clenches her fists.

                                 DIXIE
                        Oh, you’re gonna disappear--

           She goes to leap on the stage--

           But instead SHE LURCHES FORWARD IN PAIN.

           She stumbles and FALLS ONTO HER ASS, holding her lower belly.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                             (struggling to breathe)
                        The baby... I think the baby’s 
                        coming...

                                 BARRET
                             (also struggling to 
                              breathe)
                        Holy shit, this is not good 
                        timing...

           Miller LAUGHS at their predicament. Then he feigns an earth-
           shattering epiphany:

                                 MILLER
                        Oh my God -- do you know what I 
                        just realized?  She’s pregnant with 
                        your baby -- and I was an orphan... 
                        so do you think that means...?
                                 BARRET
                             (mind blown)
                        ... You’re our kid??

           Miller grins and shrugs.

                                 MILLER
                        Let’s find out!

           HE SHOOTS DIXIE IN THE CHEST. She crumples, mortally wounded, 
           dying even quicker than Barret.

                                 BARRET
                        WHAT THE FUCK, DUDE!?!?  

           Miller preens across the stage, loving it. This is the worst 
           guy of all time.

                                 MILLER
                        You may not be my father, 
                        “Barret”... But you made me who I 
                        am.

           That hurts.

           Barret crawls to Dixie, leaving a trail of blood behind him. 
           He lies beside her and squeezes her hand. She’s fading fast.

                                 DIXIE
                             (somehow manages a smile)
                        I came to kill you... and I finally 
                        did.

                                 BARRET
                        No you didn’t... you saved me.

           Miller jumps down from the stage and stands over Barret. He 
           cocks the particle pistol.

                                 MILLER
                        Any last words?

           Barret looks at Dixie, the love of his life, as they both 
           bleed out. And finally, with tears in his eyes, he says it:

                                 BARRET
                        I’m sorry.

           When he utters the words, a small, invisible TIMEWAVE 
           radiates outward, causing Miller to lose his footing.
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        I’m so, so sorry Dixie... I’m sorry 
                        for all the shit I did that ruined 
                        everything, for fucking up the 
                        world and fucking up us and causing 
                        all the hurt in your heart...

           A BIGGER TIMEWAVE BLASTS MILLER CLEAN OFF HIS FEET.

           Barret and Dixie both realize what’s happening. With what 
           little strength she has left, she grabs his phone from his 
           pocket and puts it in his hand. 

           He turns over onto his back and GOES LIVE ON INSTAGRAM. 

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                             (into camera)
                        Sup y’all, it’s ya boi...

           EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the stadium, all of Barret’s supporters in line open 
           their phones and watch his livestream. 

                                 BARRET (V.O.)
                        Giving it like a second so y’all 
                        can all get your phones out -- okay 
                        cool, so...

           INT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Miller gets back up and points the gun at Barret--

                                 BARRET
                        I just wanna say right now, to all 
                        of you, all across the world:

                        I’m Sorry.

           ANOTHER TIMEWAVE knocks the gun out of Miller’s hand.

                                 MILLER
                        WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING--??

           Barret keeps going, and as he does, TIMEWAVES continue to 
           thwart Miller.

                                 BARRET
                        I’m sorry for fucking, everything.  
                        I’m sorry to all the people I was a 
                        jerk to, God I was an arrogant, 
                        ignorant bully... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BARRET (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry to Tami, my old 
                        babysitter, for the time I peed on 
                        the kitchen floor, it wasn’t an 
                        accident I did it on purpose just 
                        to be a dick...

           INT. TAMI’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           TAMI, now a middle-aged mother, watches the livestream from 
           her kitchen.

                                 TAMI
                        Yep, knew it. 

           INT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

                                 BARRET
                        I’m sorry to all the people I 
                        offended and made fun of on 
                        Twitter, if you have to act tough 
                        online you’re actually a pussy and 
                        I am, I’m a huge pussy, any time I 
                        was tweeting I was just doing it 
                        cause I was bored and so alone...

           The Timewaves keep Miller at bay, but Dixie’s breaths are 
           becoming more and more shallow. She’s running out of time.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry for running for President 
                        because I’m not -- you don’t want 
                        me to be President, I’m too 
                        selfish, I’m too insecure, I just 
                        wanted people to like me and so I 
                        started playing this character and 
                        never knew how to stop...
                             (his voice breaks)
                        I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry...

           The Timewaves are gradually getting smaller and less 
           effective. Miller crawls toward the particle pistol.

           Barret looks to Dixie, not knowing what else to say. She is 
           close to death, but whispers:

                                 DIXIE
                        ... the Uber drivers...
                                 BARRET
                        Oh fuck, yes, the Uber drivers -- 
                        I’m especially sorry to y’all, I 
                        was always an asshole to you and I 
                        don’t even know why, I mean I guess 
                        it’s cause I was paying for the 
                        service and you intruded on my 
                        personal -- anyway I’m sorry!

           Miller manages to grab the gun. Barret looks at him.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry to you, Miller -- I 
                        shouldn’t have been your hero, or 
                        anybody’s, I’m not a role model.  
                        I’m a bad guy.  I’m the worst.

           There’s a final Timewave, but Miller shrugs this one off. He 
           levels the pistol at Barret...

           Barret takes Dixie’s hand and closes his eyes.

           Miller pulls the trigger...

           At the very last second Barret yells into his phone:

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        And Lena Dunham I’m sorry for 
                        telling you to eat my ass!

           BAM! MILLER FIRES -- BUT THE PARTICLE BLAST JUST FREEZES IN 
           MID-AIR, INCHES FROM BARRET’S HEAD...

           THEN DISAPPEARS ENTIRELY.

           Barret, Dixie, and Miller can’t believe it.

           Our triumphant John Williams score begins...

           EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           After the Lena Dunham apology, everybody in line says fuck 
           this and leaves the stadium.

           INT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Miller drops the pistol and begins to tremble. He knows 
           what’s happening.

                                 MILLER
                        NO... NO NO NO!!
           The trembling becomes VIOLENT SHAKING. His body glows blue.

           Barret looks at his stomach. His wound heals itself, as if it 
           never happened.

           MILLER’S FEET DISAPPEAR, THEN HIS LEGS...

                                 MILLER (CONT’D)
                        Oh God I’m disappearing, it’s 
                        happening, it’s fucking ha--

           BAM! A HOLE IS BLOWN IN MILLER’S HEAD.

           What’s left of him slumps over, then DISAPPEARS TOO.

           Dixie sits up beside Barret, holding the smoking particle 
           pistol, her wound also healed. The scar over her eye has 
           disappeared as well.

                                 DIXIE
                        Was that excessive?

                                 BARRET
                        I mean he was already disappearing 
                        from existence.

           THEY EMBRACE. He looks into her eyes and places her hands on 
           her stomach, feeling the light inside her.

           INT. BENEATH THE STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           The 75 to 100 of Blood Grunts who died violently by Dixie’s 
           hand come back to life. Heads and limbs reattach to bodies. 
           Even Kid Rock is revived.

           EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Outside, the destroyed Time Travel Backpack glows blue and 
           DISAPPEARS. 

           EXT. ATLANTA - CONTINUOUS (2076)

           Post-apocalyptic Atlanta miraculously heals itself, just how 
           Barret joked about at Chuck E Cheese:

           The dead grass turns green.

           The destroyed buildings are rebuilt.

           The robins start chirping.
           And the streets fill with living, happy people.

           INT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Barret and Dixie stand. She begins to glow blue, and they 
           both understand what’s coming. He takes her head in his 
           hands. She’s crying.

                                 DIXIE
                        ... You healed the hurt in my 
                        heart.

           They laugh through the tears and he hugs her tight, the 
           greatest hug in the history of cinema, then he looks her in 
           the eyes and finally says what he should’ve said a long time 
           ago:

                                 BARRET
                        Dixie, I l--

           BUT HER HEAD DISAPPEARS FIRST, FOLLOWED BY THE REST OF HER 
           BODY. 

           Our music abruptly ends.

           Dixie is gone.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        --ove you....?

           Barret is left there alone, arms outstretched where Dixie was 
           seconds before. He looks around, shocked. 

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?  WHAT THE ACTUAL 
                        FUCK??  When does somebody’s HEAD 
                        disappear first!?  THAT’S NOT HOW 
                        THIS SHIT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK!  
                        THAT’S NOT HOW IT WORKS IN THE 
                        MOVIES, THE HEAD DOES NOT GO FIRST!  
                        FUCK!!!

           He just stands there, not knowing what to do. 

           Finally his eyes drift to his phone on the ground.

           EXT. STADIUM - NIGHT

           Barret walks across the now-empty stadium parking lot. AN 
           UBER pulls up to the curb. The driver rolls down the window.
                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Hey, for Barret?

           I/E. UBER - TRAVELING - NIGHT

           Barret rides in the back of the Uber. The driver, a nice guy 
           around Barret’s age, isn’t talking.

           WE HOLD ON BARRET for a long beat.

           Then, without warning, he starts to really, truly, cry.

           He cries hard, weeping, wracked with grief and joy and 
           exhaustion and heartbreak all at once.

           After a moment the driver looks back.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Hey man, you okay?

           But Barret can’t even speak. The driver pulls over and puts 
           his hand back on Barret’s knee. Barret leans over and hugs 
           his arm, sobbing.

           The driver touches his head with gentle, honest compassion.

                                 UBER DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        It’s alright, man.  It’s gonna be 
                        alright.

           Barret cries and cries.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           OVERHEAD SHOT of a large political rally being held in 
           Central Park. A familiar voice booms over the PA:

                                 BARRET (O.S.)
                        Not sure if y’all remember but five 
                        years ago, I was running for 
                        President.  God, can you imagine? 
                        Coulda been the end of the world.

           The crowd LAUGHS.

           ON STAGE

           Barret, four years older and considerably more “adult” 
           looking, speaks at the podium.
                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        In fact, it was such a bad idea 
                        that a woman was sent back from the 
                        future to kill me and stop me from 
                        getting elected!

           HUGE LAUGH. The truth plays like a great joke. Barret smiles. 

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Seriously though, I was a bad guy, 
                        and I don’t care what anybody tells 
                        you, bad guys make bad leaders. 

           He looks out at the crowd.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        But y’know what?  I turned it 
                        around.  I’m not perfect but I’m a 
                        little less bad, and I’m trying 
                        hard to be a little bit better 
                        every day.  So what changed?

           Pause.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Somebody taught me how to say I’m 
                        sorry.  I learned that apologizing 
                        doesn’t make you weak, it makes you 
                        strong.  It makes you human.  It 
                        makes a difference -- bigger than 
                        anybody can really know.

           APPLAUSE.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        And I’m proud to say that all 
                        started when I apologized to my now 
                        good friend, and the next President 
                        of the United States... ladies and 
                        gentlemen, Lena Dunham!

           The crowd erupts! Barret welcomes LENA DUNHAM to the stage 
           and they embrace like the close friends they’ve become.

           MOS: Lena Dunham begins her speech. WE HOLD ON BARRET off to 
           the side, watching and listening. He’s smiling, proud of who 
           he’s become.

           EXT. BARRET’S HOUSE - DAY

           Barret gets out of an Uber back from the Atlanta airport. He 
           turns and waves to his driver. He’s holding their HEADSHOT. 
                                 BARRET
                        Thanks for the headshot, I’ll 
                        totally pass it along to, um, 
                        famous people!

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Thank you so much, I really 
                        appreciate it.

                                 BARRET
                        No problem.  Five stars.

                                 UBER DRIVER
                        Five stars for you, too!  You’re a 
                        good guy.

           The Uber drives off. Barret watches it disappear, taking 
           those words to heart.

           INT. BARRET’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           Barret comes down into his basement. The social media totems 
           have been replaced with various framed articles and awards 
           commemorating his philanthropic work.

           He loosens his tie and plops down on the couch. It’s clear he 
           still lives alone. He glances across the room, where the 
           repaired Barret and Dixie Bitmjoi portrait hangs.

           He gives it a little smile, as if he were smiling at Dixie.

           After a few moments of boredom, he opens PornHub on his 
           phone. As he scrolls through the various options...

           FWHOOSH! The room flashes blue.

           And someone appears behind him.

           Heart suddenly pounding, Barret sets down his phone and 
           stands. He turns.

           Dixie is there.

           She’s naked, and wearing what looks like a HUGE TIME TRAVEL 
           CHAIN NECKLACE. Five years older herself. Beautiful as ever.

           Barret looks at her, and she looks at him. It is absolutely 
           the happiest moment of either of their lives.

                                 BARRET
                        ... Dixie?
                                 DIXIE
                             (beat, re: his erection)
                        You have another, um-- 

                                 BARRET
                             (looking down)
                        Oh -- shit, sorry--

                                 DIXIE
                        Is that cause of me or the porn you 
                        were about to watch?

           They both LAUGH.

                                 BARRET
                        ... If I’m being honest -- which I 
                        pretty much always am now, or at 
                        least I try -- it’s from both.  But 
                        obviously the longer I’m looking at 
                        you, the higher the percentage of 
                        my erection is for--

           She takes a step toward him. He comes around the couch.

                                 BARRET (CONT’D)
                        Is that a... time travel chain?
                             (she nods)
                        Still can’t send you back with 
                        clothes on, huh?

                                 DIXIE
                        No, it can.
                             (beat)
                        This was a personal choice.

           They smile. 

                                 BARRET
                        ... How?  How are you -- how can--

                                 DIXIE
                        Do you want to meet your daughter?

                                 BARRET
                        ..... I have -- we have -- we have 
                        a daughter?

                                 DIXIE
                        We have a daughter.

                                 BARRET
                        ...... Is she...?
                                 DIXIE
                        Evil?

           He nods.

                                 DIXIE (CONT’D)
                        No.  Not yet at least.

           They laugh. Dixie lifts the Time Travel Chain and places it 
           over Barret’s neck too. He pulls her close.

                                 BARRET
                        We’re not gonna like, appear right 
                        in front of her, right?  I just 
                        don’t want to--

                                 DIXIE
                        No, Barret, I’m not gonna let our 
                        kid see me naked.

                                 BARRET
                        Good, right, totally.  That’s 
                        ideal, I can meet her after and--
                             (overwhelmed)
                        I knew you’d come back -- I don’t 
                        know how I knew, but I knew.

            She looks around the basement, at his many accomplishments.

                                 DIXIE
                        I’m so proud of you.
                             (then)
                        Are you ready?

           He still can’t wrap his head around all this.

                                 BARRET
                        God, time travel is so stupid.  I 
                        mean, none of this makes any sense. 
                        It’s just one big giant plot hole, 
                        there’s no actual rules, nothing 
                        tracks logically-- 

                                 DIXIE
                        Kinda like falling in love.

           Beat. That’s a good enough explanation for him.

                                 BARRET
                        That night -- what I said as you 
                        disappeared...

                                 DIXIE
                        I heard it.
                                 BARRET
                             (brightening, beginning to 
                              cry)
                        You heard it across time?

                                 DIXIE
                             (also beginning to cry)
                        I heard it -- I felt it across 
                        time.
                             (then)
                        Say it again.

                                 BARRET
                        I love you.

                                 DIXIE
                        I love you too.

           They kiss, a kiss for the ages, a kiss for all time.

           Norah Jones’ cover of “Unchained Melody” begins.

           The Time Travel Chain activates...

           FWOOSH!

           ... And they disappear in a blue flash, traveling across 
           time, together.

           Forever.

                                         The End
