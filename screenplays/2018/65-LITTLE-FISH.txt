                             Based on the Short Story by

                                      Aja Gabel
                                      Then/Now
           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Violent waves crash against the shore. 

           Seagulls fly against wind, moving neither forward or back.

           In the sand - loose leaf papers litter the beach. Washing in 
           and out as the ocean sighs. 

           The papers have writing on them. Little curls of letters 
           blotted into swirling ink-stains from the salt water.

           A YOUNG WOMAN sits in the sand. Bundled up against the winter 
           air, she’s on her knees, looking out to the grey horizon. 

           This is EMMA. There are a dozen words to describe her, but 
           right now, only one will really do: exhausted. 

           Silent tears stream down her cheeks. Her face is red, her 
           knuckles are bloody.

           Breathing in and out with the sound of the waves, she closes 
           her eyes- as if meditating.

           Breathe in.

           Breathe out. 

           Breathe in.

           Breathe out. 

           Breathe -- 

           An old HOUND DOG interrupts Emma’s solace- intrusively 
           nuzzling his face into her neck. Her eyes blink open. 

           She smiles, her demeanor completely shifting- as if a weight 
           has been lifted from her. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey. Who are you?

           Out of the corner of her eye, she sees a YOUNG MAN come into 
           focus in the distance. He’s walking towards her, slowly, 
           looking all around the beach as if he’s lost. 

           A small film camera hangs on a strap around his neck.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           He looks to her. 
                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Is this your dog?

           The Young Man breaks out into a jog to bridge the distance 
           between them. Emma rises, holding onto the dog’s leash. 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Is this your dog?

           Suddenly up close. Their eyes meet. For the first time. 

           The Young Man’s eyes light up upon seeing her. He sheepishly 
           gives her a dazed smile. This is JUDE.

           Kind of taken by his awkwardness, Emma smiles. Which makes 
           Jude smile more. Which makes Emma smile more. Which makes-

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JUDE
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        You’re smiling.

                                 JUDE
                        I just uh... I didn’t expect your 
                        voice to be... That- I mean, your 
                        accent. 

                                 EMMA
                        What’s wrong with it?

           He’s beaming now.

                                 JUDE
                        Nothing.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I was so sad the day I met you.

           Waves CRASH into-- 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Dogs are barking outside. They yip and howl and sound like 
           wolves.
           Emma lies awake next to Jude in bed. They are both in the 
           fetal position, curled towards each other. 

           A moment, then Emma carefully extracts herself from the bed. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NOW

           Snap. 

           A desk lamp clicks on, giving a soft glow to the small yellow-
           walled apartment. 

           Wearing a t-shirt five sizes too big for her, Emma sits at 
           the desk and pulls out a notebook from a drawer.

           She furrows her brow. An EMPTY FISH TANK sits in the corner.

           On the wall in front of her are DOZENS of photos, scotch 
           taped to the wall. Photos of their life together. 

           A photo with another couple on a board walk. A photo of Jude 
           holding their hound dog. A photo of the two of them in the 
           back seat of a car- selfie on film. Emma holding her ring 
           finger to the camera, showing off her wedding ring. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Dear Jude. I’m going to try to 
                        write things down again. I don’t 
                        know why. Maybe just to feel like 
                        I’m actually doing something.

           She takes a moment, thinking.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I can’t quite shake the bad 
                        feeling. You keep telling me I’m 
                        being silly, but I think you feel 
                        it too... 

           Details. The floral pattern on the bed spread. A single dried 
           rose in a glass jar. A plastic army man connected to a paper 
           parachute hanging from the ceiling. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        All these little pieces. 

           She stares at one photo of the two of them, barely in focus- 
           a bright SPARKLER shoved towards the camera. All smiles.
           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT - THEN

           A 4th of July party. A dozen twenty-somethings sit outside, 
           centered around a sparking camp fire. 

           Moments. 

           Emma sits on Jude’s lap, laughing, watching one of their 
           friends play tug-of-war with their DOG.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        This was early on. Before we were 
                        married. Before everything started 
                        to fall apart.

           Pop. Pop.

           A GUY WITH THICK GLASSES plays a guitar exuberantly. Everyone 
           sings along happy as can be, howling into the night. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        That smoke-smell in your hair while 
                        Ben plays the guitar. What was the 
                        song? Was it ‘Love Me Do’ or ‘Don’t 
                        Let Me Down?’ 

           The sound drowns out as the two possible songs mix in the 
           memory...

           As the image goes blurry, everyone uses the campfire to light 
           their SPARKLERS. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I can’t remember anymore.

           TOTAL BLUR-OUT before the image come back into focus-- 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Ben was the first person we knew to 
                        get sick... I’ve been thinking 
                        about him a lot lately.

           BEN - THE GUY WITH THICK GLASSES, comes into focus, playing 
           in front of the open fire pit. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        We say “get sick” but it’s not the 
                        right way to describe it... You 
                        either snap, or you fade away. I’m 
                        still not sure which one is worse. 
                        For Ben... He faded...
           INT. BEN’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON - THEN

           Jude has headphones, a laptop, a microphone set up- pointed 
           at Ben and his guitar. Emma lies on the couch, watching Jude 
           and Ben work together. 

           Ben nervously adjusts his fingers on the frets. 

                                 JUDE
                        You’re over-thinking it. Just... 
                        Just go. It’s okay. We’ve got all 
                        day.

           Gone is the confidence from the campfire. Ben begins to strum 
           a few chords- this time to an original song. He gets a few 
           right- 

           Emma watches with cautious optimism- 

           The chords fall apart in Ben’s hands. It’s like he’s just 
           learning to play. 

                                 BEN
                        Fuck.

                                 JUDE
                        It’s okay. Let’s try it again.

           HOLD on Emma- Ben and Jude out of focus in the foreground, as 
           Ben stands up and throws the guitar towards the wall. It hits 
           the ground with a twangy thunk.

           Emma flinches, but doesn’t move out of the way. She watches 
           as Jude wraps himself around Ben- the two men struggling, out 
           of focus. 

                                 BEN
                        Fuck, fuck! FUCK!

                                 JUDE
                        Hey, hey, hey- it’s okay! It’s 
                        okay!

           Ben is crying- sobbing. A tear slips out of the corner of 
           Emma’s eyes. She watches the two men hug. 

                                 EMMA
                        Should I call Sam?

                                 JUDE
                        Can you get us some water?

           She stands and walks towards the 
           KITCHEN, listening to Jude calm Ben down. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        We went with him to get his first 
                        tattoo that day. We said it would 
                        be an adventure. 

           INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY - THEN

           Jude sits with Ben as a Tattoo Artist inks in his arm. 

           The top of Ben’s wrist has the letters E A D G B E with six 
           lines dropping from each letter.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        He tried so hard not to seem 
                        scared. I guess we all did.

           Ben smiles sadly, then begins wiggling his eyebrows, trying 
           to lighten the mood. 

           Emma walks along the tattoo parlor, looking at the framed 
           designs mounted on the walls. 

           Her eyes drift to a posted sign by the door:

                                     MEMORY DISCOUNT 

                                 80% OFF TEXT BASED TATTOOS 

                         ADDRESSES PHONE NUMBERS NAMES NO PORTRAITS

           She looks at the sign then turns- something catching her eye-- 
           a design of a small GOLDFISH. She smiles sadly.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        But we were. 

           INT. BEN’S APARTMENT - EVENING - THEN

           CLOSE on Emma’s ankle- her shoes and socks are off, a piece 
           of clear cellophane is wrapped around her ankle which now 
           sports a brand new FISH TATTOO. 

           She wags her feet in time with the guitar playing. 
                                 BEN
                        We need to be doing this by a 
                        campfire. 

                                 JUDE
                        You need to focus on that 
                        fingering, dude. 

           Jude holds a handheld microphone up to Ben, who plays- 
           slowly, but with gaining confidence. Every so often he 
           glances as his arm, which displays the fret patterns of the 
           guitar, reminding himself of the chords. He sings a folk 
           song, finally reaching the end. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Back then it was easy to feel like 
                        it was going to be okay.

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma looks down at her journal. Her loopy handwriting ends 
           with the sentence- 

           “Then it was easy to feel like it was going to be okay.”

           She stares at the writing for a beat, then up to the 
           photographs on the wall. Out of focus with sparklers. 

           She looks over at Jude. He’s still asleep in bed. She resumes 
           her writing.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I’m rambling all over the place and 
                        that’s upsetting because there’s so 
                        much to cover. So much I could 
                        lose. But then I think how is that 
                        any different from any other day 
                        and then I can’t fucking tell if 
                        I’m even making sense... 

           She’s got tears in her eyes. She takes a breath and puts the 
           pen down, calming herself. Her handwriting has graduated from 
           a curl to a scrawl.

           Her eyes go to the ceiling... The little plastic army man 
           hanging from his taped up parachute. Another deep breath.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Focus on the important things...
           EXT. JUDE’S OFFICE - NIGHT - THEN - LITTLE MOMENTS

           Emma crosses the street towards a skyscraper lobby. She looks 
           down to her phone, checking the address. As she looks up, her 
           eye goes to a PLASTIC ARMY MAN parachuting onto the sidewalk 
           in front of her. 

           Her eyes go to the sky. More plastic army men are sailing 
           down to the street from the skyscraper above. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        The first time you kissed me was 
                        the week after we met.

           INT. JUDE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Elevator doors open and Emma steps out into a crowded open 
           office. Music is playing and several dozen 20-30 something’s 
           mingle with drinks in their hands. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        One of those awful office parties 
                        that you love and I hate that you 
                        love.

           Stepping out into the office, Emma’s dwarfed by the size of 
           the crowd. Her jeans and sweater stick out among the chic 
           business casual. 

           She weaves through the crowd until she finally spots:

           Jude. Standing among a group of friends, drink in his hand, 
           laughing hard. Emma smiles at the sight, catching Jude’s eye. 

           EXT. OFFICE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           Downtown San Francisco glows all around them. Emma, Jude, and 
           a handful of coworkers lean over the edge of the building, 
           dropping their plastic army men. 

           Jude and Emma stand shoulder to shoulder, brushing against 
           each other. They drop an army man. Smiling, Emma turns and 
           looks at Jude. 

           He leans forward and kisses her. 

           The army man sails down, down, down. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        But the first kiss is impossible to 
                        forget... 
           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - NIGHT - THEN 

           Seemingly moments later- now Emma and Jude kiss on the street 
           in front of his building. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        And the second. 

           EXT. BART PLATFORM - NIGHT - THEN 

           Emma and Jude are making out on the platform. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Until you lose count. How many 
                        times have I kissed you now? Have I 
                        given you a hundred thousand 
                        kisses? 

           She looks at him, and he at her. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma is still staring at the hanging army man. She hasn’t 
           written any of it down. She looks back over to Jude. A solid 
           beat. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        But when was the first time you 
                        made me laugh? Not just me throwing 
                        you a laugh because I thought you 
                        were cute... When was the first 
                        time you really got me?

           Hold on Emma as she thinks. 

                                 JUDE (PRE-LAP)
                        Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh. I got that beat. I 
                        got that beat... Wait. I can’t 
                        believe I’m trying to tell you 
                        this. Naw. Never mind. 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO WATERFRONT - SUNSET - THEN 

           The sky is shifting yellow, red, blue and purple as the sun 
           sets over the pacific. Jude and Emma sit on a bench by the 
           waterfront, sharing a stick of cotton candy. 

                                 EMMA
                        No, come on! I told you about 
                        periods during communions, what’s 
                        worse than that?
                                 JUDE
                        There’s so much worse than that 
                        communion periods, trust me. 

                                 EMMA
                        Well- like what? Come on, spit it 
                        out. 

           Jude blinks - he can’t believe he’s about to say it.

                                 JUDE
                        Okay. You asked. So, in sixth grade 
                        we did natures classroom and-

                                 EMMA
                        Nature what?

                                 JUDE
                        Nature’s classroom, it’s like a 
                        camping field trip. Anyway, it’s 
                        literally just a bunch of kids in 
                        the middle of the woods, so they 
                        teach you to, you know, go to the 
                        bathroom in a hole that you dig, 
                        and then you bury it, right?

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, no. 

                                 JUDE
                        But wait- there’s more. So we all 
                        do it, and it’s fine. So a few 
                        weeks later we’re doing 
                        construction on my parents house 
                        and I didn’t know they were redoing 
                        the plumbing, so the toilet is out. 

                                 EMMA
                        No, no. 

           She’s giggling now. 

                                 JUDE
                        So I find out, and I... I need to 
                        stop telling you this. 

                                 EMMA
                        NO, keep going, this is so good. 

                                 JUDE
                        You’re never going to have sex with 
                        me if I tell you this story. 

           She’s cackling now.
                                 EMMA
                        I’m never going to have sex with 
                        you if you don’t tell it. Keep 
                        going!

                                 JUDE
                        So I go outside, I... You know- 

                                 EMMA
                        You poo. 

                                 JUDE
                        And I bury it, just like in natures 
                        classroom... And no one saw me, and 
                        it wasn’t gonna be a big deal. 

                                 EMMA
                        But it was...

                                 JUDE
                        Because the dog dug it up.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh nooooooo. 

                                 JUDE
                        And is eating it- 

                                 EMMA
                        Nooooooo. 

                                 JUDE
                        And my mother is running around 
                        screaming “my dog’s eating human 
                        shit!” And she never even thought 
                        it could be from her son, she just 
                        assumed it was these poor guys 
                        working on the house-

                                 EMMA
                        She didn’t-

                                 JUDE
                        She totally accused them of 
                        shitting in her back yard.

           Emma is in stitches- she’s got tears rolling down her face as 
           she laughs. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        And I just kept my mouth shut and 
                        let her chew these poor dudes out. 
                        “Who shit in my lawn! I know what a 
                        human shit looks like!” 
                                 EMMA
                        I can’t breathe- I can’t breathe. 

           She almost drops the cotton candy, which Jude catches adeptly 
           with one hand.

                                 JUDE
                        I can’t believe I just told you 
                        that. Man. 

           Calming herself, Emma is able to get some words out. 

                                 EMMA
                        Did you ever admit it to her? 

                                 JUDE
                        No, I never did... Never got the 
                        chance to. 

           That shifts the mood slightly. Emma leans into Jude and 
           kisses his neck. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        That was the first time you really 
                        earned my laughter.

                                 JUDE (PRE-LAP)
                        Em?

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma snaps out of it as she looks over to see Jude- craning 
           his head out of bed, half asleep.

                                 JUDE
                        Whatchu doing?

                                 EMMA
                        Just writing some things down... I 
                        couldn’t sleep. 

           He raises his arm and beckons for her to come back to bed. 
           She switches off the light on her desk and joins him. Jude is 
           almost completely asleep by the time she gets back into bed. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

                                 JUDE
                        Mmm. Don’tforge... Call mymom. 
                        Innamorning. Mmm. 

           She watches him sleep. 
                                 EMMA
                        Shh. I’ll call her.

           That sits with her for a moment. Sad. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Jude Andrew Williams. He’s 26. His 
                        favorite color is purple. We were 
                        married on October 17th, 2018. A 
                        Wednesday. His mother was Dawn and 
                        she died before I ever got to meet 
                        her. His father is Gerald, his 
                        sister is Amelia. And these are 
                        fractions of things that make him 
                        who he is. Could I forget you? 
                        Could you forget me?

           Emma closes her eyes. 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN - NOW

           The sun begins to rise. The tallest buildings reflect the 
           sunlight down into the dispersing fog below. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW

           Jude, wearing a t-shirt and boxers, prepares the kettle as 
           Emma packs up her lunch. 

                                 JUDE
                        Tea, coffee or hot chocolate today?

                                 EMMA
                        Ooo. It’s a hot chocolate kind of 
                        day I think. 

                                 JUDE
                        Yessss. 

           Jude begins the morning ritual of preparing her beverage.

                                 EMMA
                        You said something weird last night 
                        in your sleep.

                                 JUDE
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        You told me not to forget to call 
                        your mother. 
           Jude blinks at that. A beat.

                                 JUDE
                        Huh.

           Jude hands her the hot chocolate mug then makes his way 
           towards a ladder fastened to a nearby wall.

                                 EMMA
                        Going to the roof? 

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah, want to come?

                                 EMMA
                        You go ahead, I’ll say bye before I 
                        leave.

           Jude scales up the ladder, opening a trap door in their 
           ceiling, leaving Emma alone. 

           EXT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - DAWN - NOW

           Jude sits on a lawn chair positioned on the flat roof- a 
           whole surplus of supplies- cooler, umbrella, a few blankets- 
           suggest this is his spot. He’s got a down blanket wrapped 
           around his body. His bare ankles reveal a FISH TATTOO 
           matching Emma’s. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Jude!

           Jude turns towards the trap door in the roof that leads down 
           to their apartment- he sees Emma at the base.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I’m going now.

                                 JUDE
                        Okay.

                                 EMMA
                        You good?

                                 JUDE
                        I’m great. Just waking up.

                                 EMMA
                        I love you. See you tonight?

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah. 
           A beat.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Wait, hey! Hey!

           Emma comes back into view.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, what was your name again?

           Emma freezes. And then- 

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t do that! You’re such a little 
                        fuck. 

           Jude starts laughing. In spite of herself, Emma laughs too. 

                                 JUDE
                        “A little fuck?”

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, you’re the biggest little 
                        fuck ever. 

           Jude’s cracking up.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        That’s NOT funny. It’s not!

                                 JUDE
                        Hey, go to work. I love you. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m going! Fuck you. I love you 
                        too. Christ. 

           She leaves. Jude remains on the rooftop, watching the sun 
           rise. Holding on him, his smile slowly fades. 

           He takes a breath. A deep inhale. A deep exhale. Inhale. 

           The world BLURS around him as-- 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - DUSK - THEN

           Jude walks down the street carrying a case of beer. He’s got 
           his film camera hanging over his shoulder. He approaches a 
           HOUSE, there’s noise coming from the back yard. A guitar 
           twang, lots of laughing, yelling voices. A party.

           Jude gets to the front door and knocks with his elbow. A long 
           beat. Then:
           SAMANTHA (26) opens the door. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Heyyyyy Juuuuuuuude don’t make it 
                        baaaaaaaad. 

           Jude stares at her blankly. 

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah, no one’s definitely ever done 
                        that.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m Samantha. Come in, come in!

           Jude enters. 

           INT. SMALL HOUSE - DUSK - THEN

           The house is empty, the party is going on in the back yard. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Just put those anywhere.

                                 JUDE
                        Fridge?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Anywhere.

           Jude drops the case on the table and looks around. There’s a 
           smattering of mismatched furniture and art that comes from 
           roommate living. 

                                 JUDE
                        Nice house.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Thanks, yeah. I mean, it’s fine, I 
                        share it with three other girls so, 
                        you know, whatever. 

           His eyes go to the back yard. He sees EMMA chasing a small 
           dog around a picnic table. 

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Emma said you’re like a movie guy?
                                 JUDE
                        Oh, no. I work for Squix? You know, 
                        they do like little recap videos of 
                        the news, little viral videos, you 
                        know all the stuff you skip in your 
                        timeline?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        She said you were funny. You met 
                        recently, right?

                                 JUDE
                        Ish.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        “Ish.” Are you going steady?

           Jude smirks, put a little on the spot. 

                                 JUDE
                        Uh... What does she say?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        She calls you “gorgeous creature.” 
                        But don’t tell her I told you that. 
                        Come on. She’s back here. 

           Samantha leads him towards the back door. 

           EXT. BACK YARD - DUSK - THEN

           Ben plays on the guitar. Jude steps out to a group of 
           fifteen. 

           The grill is going, hot dogs and burgers. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hey everyone, this is Jude. Jude, 
                        everyone!

                                 SEVERAL WITTY FUCKERS
                        HEYYYYY JUUUUUUUDE!

           Ben instantly starts playing the opening chords to Hey Jude. 
           Jude sheepishly makes his way to Emma, who is sitting on a 
           picnic table with a beer in each hand. She hands one to him. 

           They stare at each other for a beat, neither one speaking. 
           Then:

                                 JUDE
                        I fuckin’ hate the Beatles.
           Emma laughs at that.

                                 EMMA
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah. I mean. Thanks for inviting 
                        me.

                                 EMMA
                        Do you want to like... Meet my 
                        people?

           Jude looks around.

                                 JUDE
                        Are these them?

                                 EMMA
                        No, they’re all hiding in an 
                        upstairs bedroom.

                                 JUDE
                        Oh, good. I’m much more down with 
                        the upstairs bedroom. 

           Emma smiles. He leans in and kisses her shoulder in a way no 
           one else would notice.  

           But she notices.

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT - FRAGMENTED MOMENTS - THEN

           The SOUNDS of the PARTY bleed through in real time AS:

           Emma leads Jude through the crowd of friends, introducing him 
           to a few of them. 

           Jude and Ben talk back and forth, engaged in a deep 
           philosophical conversation peppered with laughter. 

           As they work together to make a camp fire. Their dialogue is 
           out of sync- disembodied, almost a voice over as the memory 
           fragments. 

                                 JUDE
                        You gotta make sure it has room to 
                        breathe-

                                 BEN
                        Dude, I got it. 
                                 JUDE
                        Alright! Just saying. 

           Jude takes the guitar from Ben. Ben records him with his 
           phone. Emma watches. 

           FLASH!

           Jude takes a photo. 

           The circle of fifteen all stand around the grill, 
           simultaneously lighting their SPARKLERS. As they light, 
           everyone backs up, making big circles, writing their names, 
           outlining sparkling dicks between their legs. 

           The laughter and far-off guitar twanging is infectious. 

           The party moves inside- 

           Emma leads Jude by the hand through the living room, around 
           the corner, and up the stairs-

           At the top of the stairs, she pulls him close. She kisses 
           him. The darkness seems to envelop them as they disappear 
           into each other. 

           INT. EMMA’S ROOM - NIGHT - THEN

           Jude and Emma lay in bed together. The room is lit by 
           Christmas tree lights strung along the ceiling and walls. 

           Jude’s eyes pass over Emma’s room. There’s a MAP on the wall 
           staring back at him. It’s got a dozen little pins tacked into 
           different locations. 

                                 JUDE
                        Places you’ve been?

                                 EMMA
                        Uh-huh.

                                 JUDE
                        Where did you start?

                                 EMMA
                        England. Can’t you tell?

                                 JUDE
                        That’s like me saying I’m from 
                        America. I mean where are you from.  

                                 EMMA
                        Oldham. 
                                 JUDE
                        Where is it?

           Emma sits up and leans towards the map. She points to the 
           only yellow pin in England. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        You miss it?

           She thinks about it for a moment.

                                 EMMA
                        I miss the people. I miss some of 
                        my friends. My mum... But she’s not 
                        there anymore either. She off with 
                        some... Guy. I don’t know... Oldham 
                        it’s not a place where things 
                        happen. It’s not where someone goes 
                        to have their dreams come true. 

                                 JUDE
                        What are your dreams?

           She smiles at him, calculating if she’s going to divulge any 
           of that on this night. 

                                 EMMA
                        Are you for real?

                                 JUDE
                        What do you mean?

                                 EMMA
                        Use that line on all the girls?

                                 JUDE
                        What do you think?

           The world blurs in and out of focus, melding Emma and Jude’s 
           bodies into one. With the image so out of focus, their words 
           almost feel like voice over. 

                                 EMMA
                        Do you um... 

           She lets out a little laugh.

                                 JUDE
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        I’m embarrassed. 
                                 JUDE
                        Why? What up girl?

           Slowly, the image starts to come back into focus. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not good at this part. 

                                 JUDE
                        Girl you’re making me nervous. What 
                        is up? You’re not about to tell me 
                        that you’re married or something, 
                        are you?

                                 EMMA
                        What? No! You think that?

                                 JUDE
                        What are you trying to ask?

           A beat.

                                 EMMA
                        Do you want to have sex?

           Back in focus, Emma’s face clearly has a sudden look of 
           bracing for rejection. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        That was so awkward- Why- don’t 
                        laugh at me!

                                 JUDE
                        Why are you being so weird!

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t know, I just- you know... I 
                        fucking like you. 

                                 JUDE
                        I fucking like you too!

           Again, the image rolls out of focus. In and out, like a deep 
           breath in. 

                                 EMMA
                        So I don’t want to-

           Jude leans in and kisses her. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to ruin it. 
                                 JUDE
                        I like that. 

           She kisses him back. 

           Out of focus, their bodies start to slink out of their 
           clothes. Jude whispers something inaudible into Emma’s ear 
           and she starts giggling.

           The blur of focus gets deeper, darker until:

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT - THEN

           Everything bleeds in and out of focus. 

           Most of the party has made their way to the backyard again. 
           Distant pop and cracks! Echo across the neighborhood. 

           Up in the sky, far away, fireworks. 

           The sky becomes harder to see- hazy, bleary. 

           Friends, singles, couples all stand in the yard in a moment 
           of happiness. In slow motion, Emma leads Jude by the hand. 
           She looks back to him. Her eyes glowing with happiness.

           This is the best it’s ever been. 

           The sounds are echoing into the distance, getting further 
           away...

           DING! Ding. Bzzzz. DING. 

           Everyone’s phone is going off. Jude’s phone goes off. Emma’s. 

           They dig into their pockets and take out their phones. 

           On the screen:
                                         BREAKING

                            INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS GROUNDED DUE TO

           Ring  ring.

           EXT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - ROOFTOP - MORNING - NOW

           Jude is still sitting in his lawn chair. Dawn has broken 
           definitively into morning.
           He blinks, coming out of a daze. His phone is ringing. He 
           hits answer. 

                                 JUDE
                        Hello?

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Are you okay?

                                 JUDE
                        Em?

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        I got a call from Stephen, he said 
                        you weren’t at work?

                                 JUDE
                        No, no I’m okay, just... Running a 
                        few minutes late.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        ... Jude, it’s noon. 

           Jude looks around. Sure enough, the sky is blue and the sun 
           is high above him. 

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah, I’ll uh- I’ll talk to you 
                        soon. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Jude are-

           He hangs up and stands quickly. He looks around, orienting 
           himself. 

           INT. RESCUE OFFICE - BACK ROOM - DAY - NOW

           Emma puts her phone down on her desk. Pensive. 

           EXT. RESCUE OFFICE - BACK - DAY - NOW

           Emma reaches into a bush and pulls out a hidden pack of 
           smokes sealed in a zip-lock bag. She takes out a cigarette 
           and lights it.  

           A VAN rolls up the long alley leading up to the back. Emma 
           watches it come. 

           A DRIVER gets out. 
                                 DRIVER
                        Hey.

                                 EMMA
                        Hey. 

           He goes to the back and opens it. The sound of yipping and 
           whining can be heard. 

           Emma stubs out her cigarette and goes to the back of the van. 
           A dozen crates filled with small and medium sized dogs line 
           the inside. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Any collars?

                                 DRIVER
                        Two. 

           Emma leans and unlatches one of the crates. She reaches into 
           her pocket and pulls out a treat. She offers it to one of the 
           smaller dogs. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey you. Come on. Come on. 

           The dog slowly comes out to her. 

           INT. RESCUE SHELTER - DAY - NOW

           Emma and the Driver move the stray dogs from the back of the 
           van to the crates inside the shelter.

           Little white boards are fixed to the bars of each kennel for 
           medical and feeding notes. Emma makes markings on them. 

           She writes 5 in the corner of the white boards on many of the 
           kennels. 

           Reaching a BLACK LAB with a collar, she writes 14 on his 
           white board. 

           She kneels down and calls the Lab over. He obediently comes.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        You good?

                                 EMMA
                        All set. Thanks Frank. 

           At the end of the hall, the Driver blinks, taken aback that 
           she knows his name. 
                                 DRIVER
                        Sure. Uh... Say, what’s your name 
                        again?

           Emma looks over to him. 

                                 EMMA
                        Emma. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Emma. Right. Nice to meet you. 

           Emma looks like she’s about to say something else, then nods 
           sadly. As Frank the Driver leaves, Emma turns her attention 
           back to the Dog. She reaches for his collar. 

                                 EMMA
                        Alright you. Let’s see if we can’t 
                        find your family. 

           INT. RESCUE OFFICE - DAY - NOW

           Emma sits at the phone, the dog collar in her hand. She dials 
           the number engraved on the tag. The phone rings. And rings. 
           And rings. 

           INT. JUDE’S OFFICE - DAY - NOW

           Clutching his back pack, Jude rushes past row after row of 
           brightly colored cubicles. A CO-WORKER pops their head out 
           from their desk.

                                 CUBICLE CO-WORKER
                        Dude, you’re so late!

                                 JUDE
                        I know, I know!

           Jude keeps going, racing to the end of the room and cascading 
           down a 

           HALLWAY

           Filled with all sorts of people, men and women of different 
           races, ages, looks and types. He ducks into a nearby door. 

           INT. JUDE’S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - NOW

           Jude meets two CO-WORKERS who stand around a camera on a 
           tripod. 
                                 CO-WORKER 1
                        Where have you been?

                                 CO-WORKER 2
                        We started without you. 

                                 JUDE
                        I know, sorry, sorry. I just uh, 
                        weird morning. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        How many have we done?

                                 CO-WORKER 2
                        Five. 

                                 JUDE
                        Great, let’s just keep at it. Bring 
                        in the next, please?

           INT. JUDE’S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NOW

           An AWKWARD DUDE sits in front of a bright blue wall. His 
           yellow shirt is a stark contrast.

                                 AWKWARD DUDE 
                        Just uh... Ha. Go? 

                                 JUDE (O.C.)
                        Yeah, just say the first thing you 
                        think. 

                                 AWKWARD DUDE
                        Um... Okay. Love is... 

           The image switches, same background, but now an OLDER WOMAN 
           sits in front of the wall. 

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Being able to make mistakes and 
                        finding a way to laugh about them. 
                        Even the serious ones. 

           The images switches again, to a TEENAGE GIRL

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Complete trust. Like knowing he’s 
                        not going to fuck some whore. 

                                 JUDE (O.C.)
                        You can’t say fuck. 
                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Ooh. Sorry. Like knowing he’s not 
                        going to sleep with some whore. 

                                 CO-WORKER 2 (O.C.)
                        She- she can’t say whore either. 

           Now an ATTRACTIVE JOCK. 

                                 ATTRACTIVE JOCK
                        I think love is being able to just 
                        be 100% real all the time, and 
                        sometimes that means being a dick. 

           A beat. 

                                 ATTRACTIVE JOCK (CONT’D)
                        What?

           An Older Man sits in the hot seat. 

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Love... Oh my. I’ll tell you what 
                        love is...

           He opens his mouth to speak.

           INT. RESCUE SHELTER - LATER - NOW 

           Emma walks down the hallway. She marks each white board. 

           5 becomes 4. 

           12 becomes 11. 

           Countdowns. This is death row. 

           She gets to the end of the row of crates and finds herself 
           before a whiteboard with a big 1 on it. She erases it. She 
           looks at the contents of the crate. 

           A little mutt with saucer moon eyes is staring back at her. 

           She kneels down to its level. 

           INT. RESCUE SHELTER - BACK ROOM - LATER - NOW

           Emma plugs her phone into a set of speakers. 

           THE BALLAD OF EMMA AND JUDE starts to play - a song that will 
           be heard again. A man’s voice sings it. 
           Emma hums along. She knows the tune well, it’s about her. She 
           preps a syringe. The mutt lies on the table, following her 
           with its big eyes. 

           She strokes the mutt behind the ears, continuing her lullaby. 

           It’s eyes start to close. She keeps on singing. 

           The dog’s eyes close all the way. 

           EXT. RESCUE SHELTER - BACK - AFTERNOON - NOW

           Emma smokes another cigarette. She’s got tears in her eyes. 
           She takes out her phone and hits call. 

                                 MOM (O.C.)
                        Hi love!

           She’s got a thick British accent to match Emma’s. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hi Mum. 

                                 MOM
                        How is it then?

                                 EMMA
                        Fine... How’s Germany?

                                 MOM
                        Oh, didn’t I tell you? I’m in 
                        France now. We’ve gone to Henry’s 
                        nephew’s chateau. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’re back with Henry again? What 
                        happened to Paul?

                                 MOM
                        Paul? Love, that was ages ago. Oh I 
                        do hope they’ll lift this flight 
                        ban and you can come visit soon. 
                        And Jude of course.

                                 EMMA
                        Me too Mum. 

                                 MOM
                        Well how are things? Are you happy 
                        over there?
                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, things are good. They’re all 
                        quiet over here for once. 

                                 MOM
                        What about your friend Samantha, 
                        how is she?

           Emma falters for a moment.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, she’s good. 

                                 MOM
                        Well we’re just about to pop in for 
                        a bite so I thought I’d give you a 
                        call. 

                                 EMMA
                        Kay. 

                                 MOM
                        Say hi to David for me. 

                                 EMMA
                        Jude. 

                                 MOM
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Jude. 

                                 MOM
                        Oh God, what did I say? David? 
                        Paul, Henry, David, Jude, look at 
                        us, I guess it doesn’t matter as 
                        long as they’re all handsome!

           That makes Emma laugh. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll tell Jude you said that-

                                 MOM
                        Don’t you DARE!

           EXT. CITY STREETS - MARKET - EVENING - NOW

           Emma walks through a small outdoor market, her head phones 
           over her ears. She notices a group of PEOPLE hanging up a 
           small sign with a ladder above an empty shop. 
           The sign reads MEDICAL. It’s folded over in the midst of its 
           hanging. She can’t see the rest of it. She waits there for a 
           moment, staring. 

           She doesn’t notice Jude approaching and stopping next to her. 

                                 JUDE
                        I mean the relieving part-

           Emma JUMPS at his voice. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        -Is that you get all blank stare in 
                        times other than when we have sex. 

           Smiling, she pushes him, then kisses him.

                                 EMMA
                        Jerk! Hi. 

                                 JUDE
                        Good day?

                                 EMMA
                        Mmm. Fine. 

           She gets close to him and starts to slow dance. An onslaught 
           of pedestrians begin to cross the street, coming directly 
           towards them. 

                                 JUDE
                        Oh we’re dancing now?

                                 EMMA
                        We’re dancing now. 

                                 JUDE
                        Why?

                                 EMMA
                        Because I feel like it. 

           The crowd reaches them, and suddenly they’re like a rock in a 
           running river as people part to make room for the slow-
           dancing couple in the middle of foot traffic. 

                                 JUDE
                        Sushi tonight?

           Emma scrunches her face, falling into their playful banter.

                                 EMMA
                        I was thinking something less 
                        disgusting.
                                 JUDE
                        One day you’re gonna discover raw 
                        fish and it’s gonna blow your mind. 

                                 EMMA
                        Why don’t we pick up from Grateful 
                        Duck?

                                 JUDE
                        You’re not gonna cave on the sushi?

                                 EMMA
                        Are you gonna pick a fight about 
                        it?

                                 JUDE
                        I’m just saying, I could-

           Emma suddenly breaks away, a big smile on her face and shouts 
           to the nearby pedestrians:

                                 EMMA
                        I DON’T EVEN KNOW YOU, GO AWAY!

           Wide eyed, Jude grabs her hand and starts to move as some 
           people stare at them.

                                 JUDE
                        Shh! Okay, damn, Grateful Duck, you 
                        win- 

           He looks up to the handful of people watching them.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        She’s joking. That’s my wife!

           Jude and Emma sit on the floor in the living room, their 
           coffee table serving as their dining table for the take out 
           in front of them. 

           Blue longingly stares at Jude, hoping for a handout.

                                 JUDE
                        You think the dogs are forgetting? 
                        Or just their owners?

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t know.

           Jude frowns. He looks over at BLUE, sitting on the couch. 
                                 JUDE
                        Don’t forget me, Blue! 

           A beat. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        It’s too bad we can’t take some of 
                        them. The dogs, I mean. 

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JUDE
                        I mean... We’ve got room. We could 
                        take on a puppy or something, 
                        right?

           A sudden hush. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        ... You said we couldn’t. 

                                 JUDE
                        What?

           Emma grows quiet. 

                                 EMMA
                        Last week Jude. We had a huge fight 
                        about this last week. I wanted to 
                        bring home a corgi and we fought so 
                        much you slept on the couch. 

           A heavy silence sets in between them. Jude lets out a 
           defeated exhale. 

                                 JUDE
                        I don’t remember that. 

           He rubs his face. No more hiding it. 

                                 EMMA
                        ... Oh my god, Jude. 

                                 JUDE
                        I just didn’t want you to worry. 

                                 EMMA
                        Well color me fucking worried.  

           The moment lingers between the two of them. 
                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Jude ... I don’t... I don’t know 
                        what to say right now. 

           She swallows. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        ... What’s it like?

           Jude shifts.

                                 JUDE
                        Don’t know... It’s like... Just 
                        hazy. 

                                 EMMA
                        Everything?

                                 JUDE
                        No, no. Just... Little pieces. I 
                        don’t think I’m missing anything 
                        big yet.

                                 EMMA
                        “Yet.” 

                                 JUDE
                        I can remember 10th grade math. And 
                        I sat behind Liz Claremont and 
                        Bobby Supercino was next to me. But 
                        I can’t remember my teachers name.

                                 EMMA
                        That... That doesn’t sound so bad.

                                 JUDE
                        The more I try to remember this 
                        teacher... I can’t remember if it 
                        was a man or a woman... Tall or 
                        fat... Or... The more I focus on 
                        it, the more it goes away.

           The two sit across from each other. Eyes locked. Pained. 
           She’s got tears in her eyes. 

                                 EMMA
                        This is going to be like Ben, isn’t 
                        it?

                                 JUDE
                        That’s not going to happen. 

                                 EMMA
                        How do you know?
                                 JUDE
                        Remember what you told me? You 
                        can’t forget feelings. 

           He points to his temple. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        They don’t live up here. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma sits at her desk, writing in her journal. Jude is on the 
           bed, his face lit up by the screen of his phone. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I’m not sure what’s harder. The 
                        fact that we may be going through 
                        this... Or that fact that we’re far 
                        from alone... Not unique, not 
                        warranting anything more than 
                        passing sympathy. When your 
                        disaster is everyone’s disaster... 
                        How do you grieve?

           She hesitates. She sneaks a glance at Jude, completely 
           absorbed in his cell phone.  A LONG silence as she slips into 
           her memories. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I keep going back to the start. 

           EXT. DOCKS - MORNING - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           A LOBSTERMAN (60s) hauls wooden crates onto the back of his 
           fishing boat. It’s a misty morning- heavenly almost. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Then it felt so far away... 

           He starts the boat, it slips into the fog...

           EXT. OCEAN - MORNING - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           The Fisherman trolls through the calm ocean water. The sun 
           fights to pierce the morning fog. 

           He squints- seeing a shape out of the haze. He brings his 
           fishing boat to a slow. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        You’d hear stories from somewhere 
                        like the coast of Maryland or 
                        Florida. 

           A LOST MAN in a life jacket is bobbing in the ocean water. 
           With sudden urgency, the Fisherman steers his vessel around 
           to rescue the Lost Man. 

           The Fisherman pulls the Lost Man up to safety. The Man has a 
           strange expression on his face- completely calm, almost half 
           asleep. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        The story of the man stranded in 
                        the ocean picked up by a fishing 
                        boat. It turned out he was another 
                        fisherman. His boat washed up to 
                        shore four days later. He said he 
                        couldn’t remember how to steer it, 
                        so he decided to swim home. 

           The Fisherman regards the Lost Man with uncertainty; fear. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           A WOMAN wearing running clothes with a number pinned to her 
           back jogs along the highway. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        The woman running in the marathon 
                        who forgot to stop running... 

           A NEWS VAN pulls up beside her, shining a light on her face. 

           INT. EMMA’S ROOM - NIGHT - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           Emma watches the sight of the jogging woman on the 
           television. The banner below reads NIA becoming rampant in 
           midwest. 

                                 EMMA
                        What is happening?

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           PEOPLE pass each other wearing medical masks. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        There was something beautiful to 
                        these stories at first. 
                                 (MORE)

                        People whose lives had been whisked 
                        away from them. With their 
                        memories, the pain of their life 
                        went away too. 

           A YOUNG GIRL stands in front of a wall of televisions, 
           watching the NEWSCASTERS talk- Doctors on some screens, suits 
           on some others. The Young Girl drinks the images in.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Those stories became more frequent, 
                        and then a scarier narrative began 
                        to unfold. 

           MAPS, SCIENTISTS, VIDEOS OF MALLS, AIRPORTS, STREETS with 
           pedestrians covering their faces. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Like the avian flu and SARS before 
                        it. Vague symptoms and casually 
                        concerned experts. An outbreak in 
                        Philadelphia. A rash of cases in 
                        Detroit. 

           Images of SCIENTISTS wearing MASKS in white LABS, dropping 
           liquids into PETRI DISHES.  

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        They call in NIA. The 
                        Neuroinflammatory affliction.

           The block letters BLAZE across the news images- the images 
           begin to show burned fuselages and headlines: Another Crash 
           Makes 4 Since September.

           INT. JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           Jude and Emma lie in bed together. They both scroll their 
           phones, looking at photos of the wreckages. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Then the flights were grounded and 
                        we couldn’t pretend it was just in 
                        some other part of the world.

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           The airport is COMPLETELY EMPTY. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        It was everywhere. 

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - MORNING - THEN - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           Emma sits at the front desk, her ear to the phone. A number 
           of PATIENTS wait with their animals in the lobby. 

           In the corner, a television plays the news. A GOVERNMENT 
           OFFICIAL speaks to the camera. 

                                 GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
                        Until we, at the very least, can 
                        screen for the NIA, we can’t risk 
                        another plane crash. I will tell 
                        you that we are all working 
                        tirelessly. 

           Emma watches the television, clearly not consoled. 

           INT. JUDE’S OFFICE - DAY - THEN  - MONTAGE MOMENTS

           Jude sits behind a computer editing footage in his cubicle. 
           He watches the OLDER MAN wax poetic on love. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        But the world keeps moving. People 
                        show up for school, for work. It’s 
                        not the end of the world is it? 
                        These things happen. Don’t they?

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma stops writing in her journal. She scans over the last 
           few lines. She looks over to Jude, who is now passed out on 
           the bed. 

           Blue the Dog begins to whimper by the door. Emma sighs. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - MARKET -  NIGHT - NOW

           Led by Blue on his leash, Emma walks down the city streets, 
           weaving her way through a market. 

           It’s eerily unpopulated- two dozen people at most. 

                                 EMMA
                        Come on, Blue. 
           She suddenly stops. Frozen for a moment at the sight of a 
           crowd of PEOPLE. Everyone is lined up, crowding around a 
           storefront. 

           A sign hangs above the door and now she can read the whole 
           thing. 

                            MEDICAL TRIALS [NIA] INQUIRE WITHIN

           Emma walks towards the crowd as if in a daze. She weaves 
           through people, pushing into the doorway. 

           She speaks to no one in particular.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

           A RANDOM WOMAN responds.

                                 RANDOM WOMAN
                        Lottery. 

                                 EMMA
                        For what?

                                 RANDOM WOMAN
                        For the trials, what do you think?

                                 EMMA
                        Does it work?

                                 RANDOM WOMAN
                        Honey it’s called a trial.  

           Emma looks around. Money changes hands. People fill out 
           forms. People walk out with tickets in hand. 

           She pushes deeper into the crowd. She arrives at a desk. 
           There’s a CLINICIAN taking notes.

                                 CLINICIAN
                        You have money?

                        How much?

                                 CLINICIAN
                        $300 for a ticket. 

                                 EMMA
                        And that gets me into the trials?
                                 CLINICIAN
                        No, it gets you a lottery ticket 
                        for the chance to be in the trials, 
                        it’s a lottery.

           Emma hesitates for a moment. She regards the people around 
           her. A LOT of tickets have gone out. 

                                 EMMA
                        When’s the drawing?

                                 CLINICIAN
                        Tomorrow.

           The Clinician hands her a clipboard with a form. 

                                 CLINICIAN (CONT’D)
                        Fill this out, bring it back when 
                        you’re done. 

           Emma takes it and goes to a corner. She begins to fill out 
           the document. 

           Name: J-U-D-E 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        Why do you love me?

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What do you mean?

           She keeps filling out the forms. Birthdays. SS number. Eye 
           color. Height. Weight. Medical history. She knows it all. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        The pessimists say love is just... 
                        Synapsis in the brain and that this 
                        is all chemical. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        And what do you say?

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        I asked you first. Why do you love 
                        me? 

           Emma finishes filling out the forms. She takes them back to 
           the front. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        There isn’t just one reason.
                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        Give me your favorite one. Give me 
                        the one that’s your favorite today.

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma steps out of the pop up shop and weaves away from the 
           crowd. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I’ve never been able to picture 
                        more than a year or two ahead with 
                        another person. But with you I can 
                        see next year, and the year after, 
                        and the year after that... I can 
                        see our thirties... And our 
                        forties...

           Her words begins to fade out as the world blurs around her. 
           The sound of a guitar, twanging out of the echoes of 
           oblivion.

           INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON - THEN

           BEN’s hands play the guitar-- here he has no tattoos. 

           Emma and Samantha are lying on the floor, sharing a joint. 

           Jude sits opposite Ben, headphones jacked into his laptop, 
           monitoring the open audio editing program. 

                                 BEN
                        The ballad of Emma and Jude. Take 
                        one. 

           Emma bursts out laughing. 

                                 JUDE
                        Shh!

                                 EMMA
                        I’m so sorry. 

                                 BEN
                        You’re not going to laugh when you 
                        fucking love it and I play it at 
                        your god damn wedding. Okay, take 
                        one. Go. 

                                 JUDE
                        I cut.
                                 BEN
                        Why?

                                 JUDE
                        You’re not playing anything!

                                 BEN
                        Well roll it- The ballad of Emma 
                        and Jude. Take one.

                                 JUDE
                        Take two.

           Emma and Samantha repress their giggles in the corner. Ben 
           closes his eyes- taking stage- then begins to play a Dylan-
           esq ballad.

           As he does, Emma and Jude look over to each other. 

           Quick cuts 

           As Ben sings through his ballad-- little moments, hinted at 
           in the lyrics of the song.  

           Emma and Jude sliding down a slide in a WATER PARK

           Sparklers in the back yard

           Emma takes a photo of Jude, who cradles Blue the Dog. 

           Jude and Emma in a pet store- Jude talks animatedly to a 
           parrot. Emma is red in the face with laughter. The parrot 
           spreads its wings- trying to escape the two. 

           The couple is in the middle of the audience at a concert. 
           People dance and jump around them- but they are still- 
           foreheads pressed against each other, caught in a slow dance, 
           out of time, out of place. 

           Ben finishes his ballad. Emma looks to Jude. She lets out a 
           small giggle- covering her mouth to choke it, right as he 
           plays his final chord. 

           INT. EMMA’S ROOM - DAY - THEN

           Jude sits on Emma’s bed, laptop opened. Emma’s giggle plays 
           over and over and over. Jude scrubs over the soundwave. 

           Emma lies near the foot of the bed, a remote control in her 
           hand. 

           The NEWS IMAGES on the TV flip to CARTOONS, and then to a 
           sitcom, and then a movie. 
                                 JUDE
                        I can’t get rid of your laugh.

                                 EMMA
                        So leave it in.

                                 JUDE
                        Hm.

           The thought hadn’t occurred to Jude. He extends the clip. He 
           lets it play. Ben’s final chord plays, and the sound of 
           giggling erupts. It’s kind of lovely. 

           Emma’s focus is on the television: back to the NEWS. 

                                 EMMA
                        Do you ever worry about it?

                                 JUDE
                        About the memory-obliterating 
                        epidemic sweeping across the world 
                        with no cure? Girl, naw. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m serious. 

           Sex noises come through the wall. Emma and Jude glance at 
           each other. 

                                 JUDE
                        I’m more worried about the noises 
                        coming through that wall.

                                 EMMA
                        We should record them and put it on 
                        his album. 

                                 JUDE
                        Bonus track. “The Ben Bang-a-Rang.”

                                 EMMA
                        Grosssss.

           Jude closes the laptop, blinking.

                                 JUDE
                        That- is awful. Are you just so 
                        desensitized to that that-

           A loud, guttural grunting comes through now- Jude and Emma 
           can’t contain their smiles. 
                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Man, sounds like Sam is having sex 
                        with a wild boar in there. How 
                        often does this happen to you?

                                 EMMA
                        What? It’s not that bad. What about 
                        the sounds you make?

                                 JUDE
                        What sounds I make?

           Emma centers herself, then makes a goofy eye rolling face and 
           lets out a groan that sounds like Chewbacca’s sad cousin. 
           Jude starts laughing. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I do not do that.

                                 EMMA
                        I swear, you’ve done it. In fact it 
                        sounds just like that. 

           The grunts from next door get louder.

                                 JUDE
                        This is awful.

           Jude rolls over, hitting the tv remote with his back. The 
           channel flips back to a NEWS STATION. A news reporter is 
           chattering in the background now. 

           The chyron describes a rise in suicides across the country.

                                 EMMA
                        ... Holy shit. 

           Jude follows Emma’s gaze, back to the television.  

           A FEMALE DOCTOR is on the screen, standing in front of a 
           podium. Half a dozen microphones with different news logos 
           point at her. A BREAKING banner flies across the bottom: ROAD 
           TO A CURE. 

                                 FEMALE DOCTOR
                        -have identified the cause of the 
                        neuroinflammatory affliction, NIA. 
                        We’ve been able to identify an 
                        absent enzyme in more than 60% of 
                        NIA cases. At this time...

           Jude and Emma are glued to the screen.
                                 JUDE
                        Did they cure it?

                                 EMMA
                        Shh. 

                                 FEMALE DOCTOR 
                        We still have a long way to go. But 
                        today is a sure sign of progress. 
                        If we can identify, that means we 
                        can isolate. If we can isolate, we 
                        can treat it. Given our recent 
                        discovery, we believe that real 
                        steps have been taken towards 
                        immunization. 

           Jude and Emma look at each other. Slowly, smiles come over 
           their faces. 

                                 JUDE
                        That’s good right?

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah. That’s good. That’s a 
                        really... Good sign. 

           Jude flops back on the bed. There’s quiet for a moment. Then 
           another loud GRUNT from Ben on the other side of the wall and 
           the couple erupts into laughter. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW 

           A CELL PHONE is ringing loudly as Emma VAULTS straight up. 
           Jude is asleep in bed next to her. 

           She looks at the screen- a new number. She picks up the 
           phone. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hello?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Mr. Williams, please. 

                                 EMMA
                        This is his wife, who is calling?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        I’m Janet Dormer, I’m with the San 
                        Francisco Medical Research and 
                        Development Opportunities 
                        Initiative?
           Emma glances over at Jude-- still asleep, then quietly slinks 
           out of bed and shifts to the next room.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 EMMA
                        No, I’m here. Hi, Ms. Dormer. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Doctor. 

                                 EMMA
                        Doctor, sorry. Um- what’s this-

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        I was calling to let you know your 
                        husband has been selected for 
                        clinical trials on an NIA 
                        suppressant study set to begin at 
                        the end of this week-

           Emma is shaking. Tears well up in her eyes.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        I see from the forms that were 
                        filled out that he’s exhibiting NIA 
                        signs, correct? Hello?

                                 EMMA
                        Yes. Yes. I’m here. I’m here.

           Emma’s voice breaks. She starts crying. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           A beat.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        It’s alright. Now... When you’re 
                        ready, I’d like to ask some follow 
                        up questions about your husband’s 
                        current condition. If selected, 
                        we’d ideally like to be getting him 
                        in the trial this week. 

           Emma’s eyes go to the corner of the room. The empty fish tank 
           sits against the window. 
           INT. EMMA’S ROOM - DAY - THEN - MOMENTS 

           Emma and Jude work together to box up her belongings. Books, 
           photographs, hard drives, clothes, they all get packed up. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON - THEN

           Jude piles the last box into the bed of a rented pick up 
           truck. Emma gets into the passengers seat. 

           She looks out the rear window and waves goodbye to SAM, who 
           stands on the sidewalk. Sam waves back as Jude puts the truck 
           into drive and it starts down the road. 

           INT. JUDE’S APARTMENT - DAY - THEN - MOMENTS

           Boxes get piled in the apartment. 

           Furniture gets moved every which way- a couch pushed to one 
           wall, then another, then another, before it finally goes back 
           to where it once was. 

           Jude’s full mattress is replaced by a queen mattress. And 
           thus, Jude’s apartment officially becomes:

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - THEN 

           The apartment walls have gone from BLUE to YELLOW. Paint cans 
           on the floor and plastic is strewn over some of the 
           furniture. 

           Emma sits in bed, typing on her computer. Jude comes out of 
           nowhere, FLOPPING on the bed. 

                                 EMMA
                        Tired?

                                 JUDE
                        Yyyyyup. 

                                 EMMA
                        Good work. 

           Jude looks around the room. 

                                 JUDE
                        Girl, I don’t know. Yellow?

                                 EMMA
                        I like it. 
           Jude’s turns over and yanks his phone out of his pocket.

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah, we’ll see how it looks in the 
                        sunlight, but I’m pretty sure 
                        you’re... Gonna... 

           His phone captivates his attention. Emma notices, a smile on 
           her face.

                                 EMMA
                        You gonna finish that sentence? 
                        Or...

           He swallows, concern on his face. Emma registers.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           Jude shows Emma his phone. She looks at it. A headline glares 
           at her: 

                        SCIENTIST ON PATH TO CURE SUCCUMBS TO NIA. 

           Emma begins to scroll through the article. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        The minds that were trying to break 
                        ground with the NIA were snapping 
                        under the pressure. Every few weeks  
                        a new team would get on the air and  
                        give us hope... 

           Jude stands up. He walks to the other side of the room. He 
           turns off the lights and sits in a chair for a moment. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Only to fall apart a few weeks 
                        later. We all took to calling them 
                        the “cure of the week.” To remind 
                        us not to get our hopes up and-

                                 JUDE
                        Let’s tell each other all our 
                        important memories now.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JUDE
                        Let’s tell each other everything. 
                        All of it. Let’s record as much as 
                        we can, about ourselves, about our 
                        relationship... In case we lose it. 
           Emma stares at him, taken aback by his fear.

                                 EMMA
                        Turn on the lights. 

           He stands up, turning the lights back on, and returns to the 
           bed. He takes his phone from her and switches it to the 
           camera app. He hits RECORD. 

                                 JUDE
                        When I was nine, I walked in on my 
                        parents having sex. I didn’t know 
                        what was happening. All I knew was 
                        my dad told me it was all right. I 
                        hadn’t done anything wrong, but it 
                        felt like I was.

                                 EMMA
                        Jude this isn’t-

                                 JUDE
                        I was the only one in the room when 
                        my mother died. I saw it happen. I 
                        didn’t do anything. I didn’t get my 
                        dad. I didn’t call a nurse. I just 
                        sat there with her. And she died.  

           Emma pauses.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JUDE
                        Now you. Just... Start anywhere. 

           She thinks for a moment. She looks down at the camera. 

                                 EMMA
                        I was so sad the day I met you. 

           A beat. She rests in the sadness for a second, but then 
           smiles suddenly.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        But for the life of me I can’t 
                        remember why. I can remember the 
                        water. I can remember the cold air.  
                        I can remember the sound of 
                        splashing. But when I think of that 
                        day, it’s not a memory anymore. 
                        It’s a feeling. 

           She picks up the camera and turns it off.
                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we’ll get NIA. Maybe we’ll... 
                        Maybe we’ll forget what each others 
                        favorite color is or who bought the 
                        fridge or how we met our friends... 
                        But we won’t forget how we feel 
                        about each other.

           A beat.

                                 JUDE
                        How do you know?

                                 EMMA
                        Because feelings aren’t memories. I 
                        can’t describe how I feel about you 
                        in any real way.  I can’t write it 
                        down or take a picture of it. And I 
                        can’t say recite some words in a 
                        way that will remind me how to feel 
                        about you if I forget a memory. 
                        Feelings don’t live here. 

           She puts her hand against his head. Kisses him. Her hand goes 
           down to his chest. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I could never forget how I feel 
                        about you.

           Jude takes this in.

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW 

           Emma and Jude sit across from each other at the kitchen table 
           in silence. He reaches over and squeezes her hand. 

                                 JUDE
                        Okay. Let’s go talk to them.

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY - NOW

           Jude holds his camera to his face and frames up a photo of 
           the towering skyscraper. 

           CLICK.
           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY - NOW

           Elevator doors open. Emma and Jude get out and are met with a 
           flood of PEOPLE sitting and standing in the waiting room. 
           Every single one of them is wearing a face mask.

           A folding table is set up in front of the elevator. A FEMALE 
           CLINICIAN (30s) wearing rubber gloves and a face mask greets 
           them with what is probably a smile.

                                 FEMALE CLINICIAN 
                        Good morning. Last name?

                                 JUDE
                        Williams. 

           The Female Clinician looks pages through a chart, then 
           crosses off Jude’s name.

                                 FEMALE CLINICIAN
                        Juuuuude. Hey, Jude. Got you. 
                        And... You?

                                 EMMA
                        I’m Emma. His wife. I’m just here 
                        for- 

                                 FEMALE CLINICIAN
                        You’re not participating in the 
                        study?

                                 EMMA
                        No. 

                                 FEMALE CLINICIAN
                        You’ll have to wait downstairs. 

           A beat. Emma nods, kisses Jude on the cheek. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s okay. 

           She returns to the elevator and presses the down button. Jude 
           watches her for a moment. 

                                 FEMALE CLINICIAN
                        Wear one of these. 

           She offers Jude a face mask. 

                                 JUDE
                        I thought it wasn’t airborne. 
                                 FEMALE CLINICIAN
                        Go ahead and have a seat-- while 
                        you’re waiting you can fill out 
                        these consent forms. 

           Jude takes the face mask and straps it on before walking into 
           the waiting room. Emma watches as the elevator doors close on 
           them. 

           Jude looks down at the clipboard in his hands. He reads the 
           verbiage. 

           I understand that my insurance may not cover any unintended 
           side effects which may be incurred from this clinical trial.

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY - NOW

           Emma sits outside by a corporate fountain. Water splashes 
           into the sky. She takes out her phone and hits call. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hi Mum.

                                 MOM (O.C.)
                        Hiiii Love. Are you on your way 
                        home?

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 MOM
                        It’s almost six, you’re usually 
                        back home by now. 

           Emma swallows, taking in her mothers words. 

                                 EMMA
                        Mum... I don’t live with you 
                        anymore.

           Silence. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you remember that? Can... Can 
                        you tell me you remember that?

           A sigh on the other end of the phone.

                                 MOM
                        Of course I do. I... I’m sorry, I 
                        don’t know what I was thinking. 
                        You’re right. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOM (CONT'D)
                        I knew to dial your American 
                        number, I must’ve just been having 
                        a moment or-

                                 EMMA
                        This isn’t the first time... 

           Emma holds her emotion in, trying to be helpful.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Mum, have you told anyone that 
                        you’re starting to forget? Mum?

                                 MOM
                        I can’t remember. 

           Emma nods. Of course not. 

                                 EMMA
                        Mum, you’re going to have to start 
                        being careful. You’re going to have 
                        to write things down. Go see Aunt 
                        Claire and tell her what’s going on 
                        so that-

                                 MOM
                        I’ve got to go. 

           The line goes dead suddenly. 

           Emma freezes. She puts her hands in her head and smushes her 
           face with them, taking a deep breath, trying to reconcile. 
           Unwittingly, she makes a fist and begins to grind her 
           knuckles against the brick she sits on. 

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY - NOW

           Jude sits awkwardly in a folding chair. He’s alone. This 
           isn’t a doctor’s office. Everything about it is temporary.

           DR. DORMER (50s) enters with an ASSISTANT.

                                 DR. DORMER
                        Jude Williams?

                                 JUDE
                        Hi.

                                 DR. DORMER
                        I’m Dr. Dormer, I think I spoke to 
                        your wife on the phone?
                                 JUDE
                        Yeah. 

                                 DR. DORMER
                        So, how long would you say you’ve 
                        been experiencing the effects of 
                        NIA?

                                 JUDE
                        I’m not sure the day-

                                 DR. DORMER
                        Approximately. Weeks? Months? 

                                 JUDE
                        Maybe a month. 

                                 DR. DORMER
                        Any gaping holes?

                                 JUDE
                        Uh... Sorry?

                                 DR. DORMER
                        Any big holes in your memory you’ve 
                        discovered in the initial loss? 
                        Maybe a distant relative’s name, or 
                        the street you live on...

                                 JUDE
                        I keep forgetting my dog. It’s 
                        like... Foggy. You know? I can 
                        remember parts of things, but I’m 
                        starting to lose details.

                                 DR. DORMER
                        On specific memories, or overall. 

                                 JUDE
                        Overall. Like... 

           A quick cut to a

           BODY OF WATER

           Jude’s eyes rest just above the surface. He stares straight 
           ahead at EMMA- whose eyes are also just above the surface. 

           It’s an image not seen before...

                                 JUDE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I can remember being with people... 
                        And who they are... But I don’t 
                        remember where we were. 
           And like that-- the image is gone. 

           Jude blinks, coming out of the memory.

           Dormer’s assistant furiously jots down notes. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        So is it like a... Pill, or a-

                                 DR. DORMER
                        We’ll be doing an oral CP to let-

                                 JUDE
                        Sorry. Oral... CP?

                                 DR. DORMER
                        A oral cranial puncture. 

           Jude swallows. 

                                 JUDE
                        You’re talking like a... Spinal 
                        tap?

                                 DR. DORMER
                        It’s a... Cousin of the lumbar 
                        puncture, yes. Gretchen?

           The Assistant hands Dr. Dormer a metal straw and a plastic 
           skull. Dr. Dormer pops the back of the plastic skull open, 
           revealing smaller plastic pieces packed together. 

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Now, your brain lives inside your 
                        skull and is connected to four 
                        interconnected ventricles. This is 
                        where cerebrospinal fluid is 
                        produced, which helps cushion your 
                        brain and provide it with basic 
                        protection.

           Holding on Jude, Dr. Dormer’s words start to fade away and 
           are replaced with a ringing in his ears. The ringing grows.

           He watches as she slides the metal straw into the mouth of 
           the skull, pushing it into a hole in the roof of the mouth. 
           She turns the skull around to demonstrate where in the brain 
           the probe is hitting. 

           Jude closes his eyes. The sound CUTS back in.

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?
           He swallows.

                                 JUDE
                        What are the risks?

           Dr. Dormer nods, making eye contact with him. Ready to 
           deliver the answer. 

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY - NOW

           Emma stares down into the rippling water of the fountain. 
           Orange FISH undulate below the surface. 

           She looks at her phone. MUM is ringing. She doesn’t pick up. 
           Emma tucks her phone into her pocket just in time to see- 

           SAMANTHA walking past her, bundled up in a coat, her hair 
           shorter. Emma stands, alert. She hasn’t been noticed yet.

                                 EMMA
                        Sam?

           She steps after her.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Samantha!

           Samantha turns, shocked out of her daze. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Hey. Em. Good to see you.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s been a minute. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah, I know. I’m just here for the 
                        day, you know um... Running 
                        errands.

                                 EMMA
                        Right. Right. God, it’s good to see 
                        you. Are you-

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m good. I’m good. Really. What 
                        about you?

                                 EMMA
                        Well, Jude’s got into a clinical 
                        trial of some potential cure, so... 
                        Fingers crossed.
           Samantha nods. She’s fighting back tears.

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Oh... I’m... Yeah. That’s great. I 
                        hope it works on him. 

           Emma hugs her. They stand by the fountain for a moment. Just 
           a moment-- then Samantha breaks away.

                                 SAMANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Tell Jude I say hi. It was 
                        great to see you. I just- it’s 
                        tough.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Okay.

                                 EMMA
                        Let’s catch up for real soon, okay?

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Yeah.

           Samantha smiles. Nods. Emma watches as Samantha walks away 
           from her, blending into the crowd of pedestrians crossing the 
           street.

                                 JUDE (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Jude is right behind her. He’s carrying an armful of thick 
           binders. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey-- how’d that go?

                                 JUDE
                        Breezy. No problem... You okay?

                                 EMMA
                        I’m good. Come on. Let’s get out of 
                        here.

           She takes his arm and starts to move.

           INT. MOVING BART - LATE AFTERNOON - NOW

           Jude and Emma sit nestled into the corner of the BART- 
           leaning into each other like they’re one organism. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        To identify a neural inflammation, 
                        begin by asking basic questions. 

           He twirls her hair with his fingers. They both stare out the 
           window to the setting sun. 

           Jude’s eyes go down to Emma’s knuckles. They’re raw and cut 
           opened. He looks at them sadly, but doesn’t say anything.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What’s your name? How old are you? 
                        Your favorite color?

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        Jude Andrew Williams. I’m 26. My 
                        favorite color is purple. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - DAY - NOW

           Emma opens THE BINDER. 

           It’s professionally organized. Pages laminated. Full of 
           charts, statistic, diagrams and flowcharts. 

           A set of questions followed by if/then statements. (Ask if 
           the patient remembers their birthday. If yes, move to 
           question two. If no, ask them if they can recall a party with 
           a cake.) 

           Diagrams show maps of the brain with helpful explanations of 
           which part of the brain does what. 

           A whole page with a cartoon piece of smiling broccoli says 
           BRAIN FOOD! 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Who am I? How old am I? What’s my 
                        favorite color?

                                 EMMA
                        This is it? This is what they gave 
                        you? Brain teasers? I thought there 
                        was some sort of procedure.

           She flips the binder over. A pamphlet falls out. Jude sits by 
           the window, looking out at the street as Emma opens up the 
           pamphlet. 

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah. It’s brain teasers and a 
                        surgery.
                                 EMMA
                        Surgery?

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah they uh... They take a... Like 
                        a metal straw and... 

           Jude swallows.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to do it, Em. 

                                 EMMA
                        What did the doctor say?

                                 JUDE
                        They don’t even know if it’s going 
                        to work. You know. It’s a TRIAL. 
                        It’s a... “See and find out.” Let’s 
                        poke around in some dude’s spine 
                        and hope we don’t cripple him or 
                        make him go fuckin blind!

           He takes a breath, calming himself.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not doing it. I’m... I could 
                        just wind up with no memory, and... 
                        And no legs and no eyes. If I’m 
                        gonna forget who I am, I’d like to 
                        be able to see where I’m going. 

           Emma stares at him, taking in his fear. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’ve made up your mind then? 

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah.

           She’s quiet.

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t I get a vote here?

                                 JUDE
                        Emma... You can’t ask me to-

                                 EMMA
                        But I am asking you. I have to ask 
                        you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        You don’t want to be blind or in a 
                        wheelchair I get that, but if 
                        there’s a chance we can stop 
                        this... I don’t understand why you 
                        won’t try for me.

           Silence.

                                 JUDE
                        ... What happened to not being 
                        scared because we can’t forget 
                        feelings?

                                 EMMA
                        It’s fucking different now.

           Tears are welling in her eyes. It pains Jude to see. 

                                 JUDE
                        Emma-

                                 EMMA
                        Who am I? How old am I? What’s my 
                        favorite color.

                                 JUDE
                        Can-

                                 EMMA
                        Who am I? How old am I? What’s my 
                        favorite color.

           Jude closes his eyes.

                                 JUDE 
                        You’re my wife. Emma Veda Ryerson 
                        Williams. You’re 25. Your favorite 
                        color is- 

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - THEN

           Emma runs a paint roller across a wall-- painting the room 
           yellow. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        -yellow.

           Her overalls are stained with paint- she’s got a dab on her 
           cheek. She’s having fun. 

           Jude watches her from the bed covered in plastic. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Now describe a specific memory that 
                        took place in the room you are in. 

           Emma catches Jude’s eye. Face flushed red from laughing, she 
           runs over to him, paint roller still in her hand. She jumps 
           on the bed-

           -silently laughing- he tries to get away from her. She rolls 
           his shirt with yellow paint. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        You didn’t like the blue walls in 
                        here. You said it reminded you of 
                        rainy days back home. So you 
                        painted it yellow. 

           Emma pins Jude down and starts painting on his face. She then 
           leans forward and kisses him. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        You chased me with the roller and 
                        painted half my face yellow. Ruined 
                        my favorite shirt, too. Then you 
                        kissed me. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What time of year was it?

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - SAME MOMENTS - THEN

           Jude’s face is half covered in paint. He sits at the edge of 
           the bed, looking out the window. 

           It’s snowing outside. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        ...Winter...

           He blinks. 

           It’s a gorgeous summer day outside. Green leaves blow in the 
           wind. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        No... Summer. 

           Jude looks around. Things start to get fuzzy. Emma stands on 
           the other side of the room- dissolving into an 
           indistinguishable blob- bleeding into the yellow wall. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        The shirt I ruined. Your favorite. 
                        What color was it?

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY - THEN

           A DRIER DOOR opens. Jude pulls clothes out of the drier and 
           into a laundry basked. 

           He looks down at shirt splattered in faded yellow paint. The 
           shirt is blue.

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        Blue... 

           He stares at. 

           The shirt starts to change color right before his eyes. Blue 
           shifts to green. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        No... Green. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        You’re not sure?

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        I’m not sure. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Do you remember something else 
                        about the shirt? Separate from that 
                        time. You said it was your favorite 
                        shirt-- why?

           Jude runs. He wears a white shirt. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        I like the way it felt. 

           Details of the shirt. It clutches his arms but not his torso. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        Good cut. Nice fabric. It had that 
                        print on it. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What is the print?

           Jude turns- facing front. A cartoon MOUSE giving the middle 
           finger. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        The Fuck You Mouse. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Do you remember when you bought the 
                        shirt?

           INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY - THEN

           Jude rifles through racks of clothing. He stops and stares at 
           the print of the Fuck You Mouse. 

           BEN, sans tattoos rifles through the wrack next to him. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        I was with Ben. 

           Ben shows Jude a shirt with Fuck You Turtle on it. The shirt 
           is green. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What color is the shirt?

           Jude looks back to the Fuck You Mouse. It’s ORANGE. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        Orange.

           Jude piles his laundry in the basket. His Orange Fuck You

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - DAY - THEN

           Jude lies in the bed covered in plastic. Emma stands over 
           him, paint roller dripping paint. His Orange shirt is smeared 
           with wet yellow. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        The shirt is orange. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Were we dating, engaged, or 
                        married?

           The world around them starts to blur intensely, until Emma 
           and Jude become an indistinguishable blob. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW

           Jude’s eyes snap open. Emma is sitting across from him. He 
           blinks, trying to remember. 

                                 EMMA
                        Jude?

                                 JUDE
                        ... I... 

                                 EMMA
                        When I moved in with you. Were we 
                        dating, engaged, or married?

           He’s quiet. 

                                 JUDE
                        We were... Dating?

           Emma closes her eyes. 

                                 EMMA
                        Jude. 

                                 JUDE
                        We were married.

                                 EMMA
                        Do you remember the fish?
           Jude blinks. He clearly doesn’t. 

           INT. MOVING BART - DAY - THEN

           The couple sits on the BART together, curled up in the back, 
           clutching onto each others hands. She leans over and kisses 
           him gently on his neck.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - AFTERNOON - THEN

           Sun low in the sky, Emma and Jude round the corner, arm in 
           arm. Making their way dow the sidewalk, Jude releases Emma 
           and freezes. 

           He’s right in front of a PET SHOP.

                                 JUDE
                        Yo. Can we go in here?

           She blinks.

           INT. PET SHOP - AFTERNOON - THEN

           Squawks and chirps greet them as they enter the shop. Exotic 
           birds hang in cages on a nearby wall. 

           Jude wanders ahead. Emma lets him gain some distance before 
           she enters- taking in the sights. Parrots, red, blue and 
           yellow stare back at her. 

           She rounds a corner to the reptiles. Frogs and snakes roast 
           under sun lights. 

           Slowly, she makes her way to the tropical fish. 

           A calming blue light bathes the long row of tanks. Emma 
           watches multi-colored fish dart around the little tank. 

           At the end of a long row, she sees Jude with his face pressed 
           up against the glass of a particularly colorful tank. 

           She reaches him, putting a hand on his back. 

                                 EMMA
                        What’s going on with you?

                                 JUDE
                        Look at this dude. 

           He points to a little yellow fish with an absurdly long nose. 
                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Dude has no idea what’s going on in 
                        the world. He doesn’t know about 
                        AIDS or the Crusades or nuclear 
                        proliferation. He’s just swimming 
                        around and feeling good. 

                                 EMMA
                        Mmm. We should be so lucky. 

                                 JUDE
                        Aren’t we? I’m in that kind of 
                        happy zone when I’m with you. Look 
                        at his face- doesn’t he look like 
                        me?

           She laughs.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah I guess he does.

                                 JUDE
                        Let’s get married.

           She eyes him up and down, smiling, not missing a beat.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. 

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah, but I’m not joking. 

                                 EMMA
                        Neither am I. 

           He falters- it’s almost like he didn’t expect it go quite 
           that smoothly.

                                 JUDE
                        I just-

                                 EMMA
                        Shut up, Jude.

           Emma grabs him by his shirt and pulls him close into a kiss. 
           They clutch onto each other in the tightest embrace ever, 
           surrounded by little fish tanks.

                                 JUDE
                        Shit. 

                                 EMMA
                        What?
                                 JUDE
                        I... I don’t have a ring. I mean- I 
                        got one, but... Not on me.

           Emma smiles.

                                 EMMA
                        Then buy me a fish.

           Jude smiles back. He keeps talking but the sound drowns out. 
           Slowly, the image begins to BLUR, first in the periphery, 
           until Jude and Emma become indistinguishable among the blue 
           haze of fish tanks. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        “You’re gonna have to move in now. 
                        Who the hell gets engaged and 
                        doesn’t live together.”

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW

           Emma and Jude sitting across from each other. Emma tries to 
           hold back her emotion. Jude looks over to the EMPTY FISH TANK 
           in the corner of the apartment. 

                                 EMMA
                        Jude we were engaged. We were 
                        engaged and that’s why we moved in 
                        together... And you don’t remember 
                        that at all. 

           Jude is looking down in shame. She reaches over and takes his 
           hand.

                                 JUDE
                        I’m sorry.

           He makes eye contact with her. Nods.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Em. I’ll do it.

           In the distance, THE BALLAD OF EMMA AND JUDE begins to play. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - DAY - MOMENTS -  NOW

           Jude scrolls through vibrant photos on his laptop, pouring 
           over images from his past- not just his relationship with 
           Emma, photos of his family, of his mother...

           Jude, Emma and Blue walk down the street together.

           As the song continues to play, Jude and Emma sit in the 
           examination room, listening to DR. DORMER explain more about 
           the procedure. 

           They fill out paper work together. Sign release forms. 

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE - EXAMINATION - DAY - MOMENTS - NOW

           Jude is now dressed in a johnny. He lies on his back as the 
           metal slab he’s on slides into the MRI machine. 

           INSIDE THE MRI SCANNER - Jude stares up. Little green dots of 
           light are pointed at his head. They blink on and off.

           INT. JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MOMENTS - NOW

           Jude and Emma lie in bed together. She’s curled up against 
           him, he lies flat on his back, looking up at the ceiling. 

           Speakers next to the bed are playing their ballad. 

                                 EMMA
                        What are you thinking?

                                 JUDE
                        I’m trying to memorize what 
                        everything looks like. In case I 
                        don’t see it again. 

           Emma sits up, looking deep into his eyes. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’ll see me again.

           Jude nods, unsure. He looks over to the wall. An empty fish 
           tank in the corner. 

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY - NOW

           Jude lies on the operating table, awake. An anesthesiologist 
           inserts an IV into his arm. He watches in discomfort. 
                                 DR. DORMER
                        We’re going to be administering a 
                        general anesthetic so that you 
                        won’t be able to move... And a 
                        local cranial anesthetic.

           Dr. Dormer and a group of medical ASSISTANTS move around the 
           room, out of focus. Sounds of metal on metal, a high pitched 
           drill, and an EKG monitor are heard. 

           The world blurs in and out of focus. 

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Try to relax.

                        work?

           She looks down at him, her face losing focus to Jude’s eye. A 
           comforting smile. Comforting voice. 

                                 DR. DORMER
                        We’re going to do our best for you.

           Jude nods. Dormer raises a small metal CONTRAPTION. 

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, open your mouth. 

           Jude does so. She fits the contraption in his mouth- suddenly 
           making it so that Jude’s jaw is spread wide opened. Stuck.

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Okay... Little pinch. 

           A needle appears. An assistant guides the needle into Jude’s 
           mouth. He closes his eyes, bracing for the feeling. 

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Deep breath. Don’t forget to 
                        breathe. 

           Tears spill out of Jude’s closed eyes as the needle makes 
           contact with the roof of his mouth. The syringe goes in 
           deeper than expected. He chokes a little. 
           The needle comes back out, but he’s given no reprieve, his 
           jaw forced open. Jude takes a long breath, calming himself.

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Gretchen, ready?

           One of the assistants comes over. 

                                 DR. DORMER (CONT’D)
                        Okay Mr. Williams. Close your eyes 
                        for me and keep breathing.

           Jude takes another deep breath, closing his eyes. The high 
           pitched ringing of a medical drill shrieks out. Jude moans in 
           discomfort, tears still spilling out from under his eyelids. 

           The DRILL cranes towards his mouth, the metal tip already 
           spinning. Jude squeezes his eyes shut and tight as he can as 
           the drill goes into his mouth, that high pitched ringing 
           piercing all other sound as it makes contact with his skin- 

           EXT. CORPORATE OFFICE - DAY - NOW

           Large goldfish swim below the surface of rippling water. 
           Calm. Serene. A complete exhale. 

           Emma sits on the edge of the fountain, looking at her phone. 
           On the screen- she’s calling MUM. It’s on speaker, ringing. 
           Ringing. Ringing. 

           Emma hangs up, shifting uncomfortably. She notices a COUPLE 
           coming out of the doors of the office, the woman is in her 
           40s, in a wheelchair. She’s got medical patches over her 
           eyes. 

                                 JUDE (O.S.)
                        Em- 

           She jumps. 

           Jude stands next to her. He’s got tears steaming down his 
           face. He extends his hand to her. A little shocked, she takes  
           it and stands. He wraps his arms around her. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do it. I can’t do it. I 
                        can’t fucking do it. 

           Emma starts to cry.

           They stand in the middle of the courtyard, wrapped around 
           each other. Crying like that. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        If I could take your place, I 
                        would. Don’t you know that?

           It feels eternal.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - AFTERNOON

           Emma and Jude walk hand in hand. As they walk down the street 
           together, they drop each others hands and walk separately.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Do I believe you won’t forget how 
                        you feel about me? I used to... But 
                        then we saw what happened to Ben. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT - THEN

           Emma and Jude jog hand in hand hurriedly down the street 
           together. 

           They approach EMMA’S OLD HOUSE. All of the lights are on. 

           As they walk up the steps- the sound of glass SMASHING is 
           head. Then: SCREAMING. 

           Jude doesn’t hesitate, and right away he bolts into--

           INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - THEN

           The screaming is coming from upstairs. Jude races up the 
           stairs followed closely by Emma-

                                 EMMA
                        Sam? Samantha!

                                 SAMANTHA
                        I’m here!

           Emma catches Samantha running halfway down the stairs. She’s 
           in hysterics. 

                                 EMMA
                        What’s happened?

           SMASH! 
                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        GET OUT! GET THE FUCK OUT!

           Emma guides Sam to the bottom of the stairs-

                                 SAMANTHA
                        He- he- he... He doesn’t know who I 
                        am. He doesn’t know who I am 
                        anymore. 

           Jude and Emma trade glances from the top of the stairs to the 
           bottom. 

           Jude proceeds to walk-- 

           DOWN THE HALLWAY

           The bedroom door at the end of the hall is slightly ajar. 
           Light spills into the dark hallway. A lamp sits on its side 
           in the doorway. 

           Jude goes to the door and knocks on it. 

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        GO AWAY!

                                 JUDE
                        Ben? 

           A beat.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        ... Jude?

           Jude pushes the door open, revealing

           SAMANTHA’S BEDROOM 

           A desk is turned over, pictures torn off the wall, frames 
           smashed. Ben’s hand is bleeding- probably from when he put 
           his fist through the television. 

           Compared to the last time we saw him-- Ben has a dozen 
           tattoos.  He is absolutely COVERED in ink. 

                                 JUDE
                        Hey Ben. 

                                 BEN
                        ... Hey Jude. 

           Jude kneels down in the doorway. 
                                 JUDE
                        What are you up to, pal?

           Ben looks around, frantic.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know- I don’t know... Where 
                        I am. Or-- or who that fucking 
                        bitch down there is!

           Jude puts up a hand-

                                 JUDE
                        Calm down. Ben. That’s Sam. 
                        Samantha. You’ve been together for 
                        years. You’ve known her longer than 
                        you’ve known me. 

                                 BEN
                        I have?

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah... Ben... You’ve got the NIA. 
                        You’ve had it for a while and we’ve 
                        all been helping you deal with it. 
                        Look at your body, Ben. 

           Ben looks down. His guitar string tattoos. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Look at your hand.

           Ben looks down. He’s got an address tattooed on the back of 
           his hand. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Unbutton your shirt. 

                                 BEN
                        Why?

           A tense beat. Ben does as he’s asked. His torso reveals a 
           plethora of tattoos. He looks down at them. 

           Names, license plates, numbers, addresses. Over his heart, 
           upside down so he can read it- is SAMANTHA inside of a 
           cartoon heart. 

           Ben collapses at the sight. He cries. Jude shuffles close to 
           him and wraps his arms around him. 
           INT. HOUSE - SAME MOMENTS - THEN 

           Samantha and Emma hold each other at the bottom of the 
           stairs. 

                                 EMMA
                        Look at me, look at me, love. It’s 
                        gonna be okay. It’s gonna be okay. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        No it’s not- he’s fucking gone!

                                 EMMA
                        No he’s not. Look at me. We’ll 
                        figure this out. We’ll all figure 
                        it out together. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Emma. He doesn’t remember any of 
                        it. It’s. All. Gone. He’s snapped.

           Emma takes this in. 

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT - THEN

           A blurry Ben plays the guitar, was it ‘Love Me Do’ or ‘Don’t 
           Let Me Down?’ I can’t remember. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Ben Richards was from Nashua, New 
                        Hampshire. And whenever anyone 
                        talked about Ben, two things always 
                        came up. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - AFTERNOON - THEN - QUICK MOMENTS

           Emma and Samantha eat ice cream by the pier together. 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        His tinder profile just says 
                        “guitar and campfires.” Is it 
                        stupid that I think that’s kind of 
                        hot?

           INT. JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - THEN - QUICK MOMENTS

           Jude and Ben record music together, Jude on the microphone, 
           both wear headphones. 

           Ben slides his headphones off. 
                                 BEN 
                        The ambience is wrong- it’s wrong-

                                 JUDE
                        What’s so wrong?

                                 BEN
                        We should be recording this by a 
                        fucking camp fire. 

           Jude lets out an exasperated sigh. 

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT - THEN - QUICK MOMENTS

           Extension cords run out of open windows of the house and into 
           the back yard. Jude records Ben as he plays his guitar next 
           to a campfire. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        His mother was Fiona and his father 
                        was Barry. You would know Ben for 
                        years and only if you asked him 
                        would he admit he has an older 
                        sister. 

           INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY - THEN

           Ben sits in a the chair as he gets a tattoo on his chest. 
           Samantha over the cartoon heart.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        When Ben started to lose his 
                        memory, he kept it a secret. Just 
                        like everyone did back then. That’s 
                        when the tattoos started.

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT - FRAGMENTED MOMENTS - THEN

           Ben plays his guitar by the fire. Tears streak down his face. 
           He blurs in and out of focus. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Ben Richards always smelled like 
                        charcoal and he had chronic bad 
                        breath and he ate more pasta than 
                        anyone I’d ever met yet never put 
                        on weight. Ben could turn any room 
                        into a concert, and he was inclined 
                        to. A casual get together with four 
                        friends would evolve into a night 
                        of live music. That was his gift. 
           Ben stops playing. He stares straight ahead. All that is left 
           are the pops and crackles of the fire. 

           Darkness encroaches him on all sides. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        This is who we all remembered. Who 
                        we were clutching on to. 

           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING - THEN 

           Samantha lies in bed. She opens her eyes, waking. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        No tattoo, calls from friends, late 
                        nights crying, guitar lessons or 
                        campfires could bring Ben back. 

           The spot next to her is empty. 

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT - THEN

           Emma sits at the bottom of the stairs, wrapped around a 
           sobbing SAMANTHA.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I promised my best friend it would 
                        be okay. I didn’t know I was lying. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - MORNING - THEN

           In the foggy San Fran morning, Samantha runs out of the house- 
           the front door already open. 

           She gets to the middle of the street and shouts Ben’s name. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        We don’t know what happened to him. 
                        We don’t know if he’s alive or if 
                        he’s dead. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING - THEN

           Ben walks down a street, shrouded in fog. He’s only seen from 
           the back, walking away. 

           He disappears into the fog. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        He just... Went away.
           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Jude unlocks the door. Blue greets them as the couple walks 
           in together. They shrug off their jackets. Emma can’t quite 
           get hers off, so she starts to wrestle with it. 

           Her arm gets caught in the sleeve and then she’s yanking at 
           the shoulder-

                                 JUDE
                        Em- 

           She lets out a little cry as she RIPS the sleeve open. In a 
           sudden spat of fury, she kicks a nearby chair, sending it 
           head on with the wall. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re upset-

                                 EMMA
                        I’M NOT FUCKING UPSET!

           Her volume surprises even her. She dials it back down. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I’m just heartbroken.

           A beat. Tears roll down her face. 

                                 JUDE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 EMMA
                        My mum’s starting to fade. 

           This is news to Jude. 

                                 JUDE
                        Why didn’t you-

           Emma laughs at the absurdity of it all.

                                 EMMA
                        Because I can’t do anything for 
                        her. I’m stuck over here and I 
                        can’t get on a plane and I can’t be 
                        there for her. But I can be there 
                        for you. And I’m not losing my mum 
                        and my husband in the same breath. 
                        So I need you to explain to me why 
                        you won’t try. I’m asking you to 
                        try and it’s like you don’t care. 
                        Why are you being like this? Can 
                        you explain it to me? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        I’m asking you, seriously. Can you 
                        explain it? Can you? CAN YOU?

           Jude stands in the middle of the room, bleary eyed. He 
           suddenly goes to his desk and awakens his computer. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 JUDE
                        Come here. 

           She stays in place. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Come here. 

           She joins him as Jude pulls up a VIDEO on the screen. It’s 
           familiar. Interviews about love. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t want to watch one of your 
                        fucking videos, I want you to talk 
                        to me-

                                 JUDE
                        Just... Please... Hold on. 

           He scrolls through the video until he arrives at an OLDER MAN 
           occupying the screen. 

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Love... Oh my. I’ll tell you what 
                        love is... Love is being sent to 
                        the opposite side of the world. To 
                        fight for what’s right. It’s to 
                        leave a beautiful woman. It’s to be 
                        gone, with no promise of ever 
                        returning... 

           The double meaning of the words aren’t lost on Emma. 

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        ... Only to come back. Changed? 
                        Yes. But... And, I’m, I’m rambling 
                        now, you said I only had 30 
                        seconds. But I’ll tell you. Love is 
                        when two people hang onto each 
                        other, across the world. Across 
                        time. Across the wars outside, and 
                        in, and against all of the odds... 
                        They never let go of each other. 
                        And it could be... Another person.

                        Or a war. Or even death... Nothing 
                        will truly get between them.

           The Older Man shifts his focus back to the off-camera Jude. 

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        Was that okay?

           The video freezes. Emma and Jude stand in silence. Then:

                                 JUDE
                        I know this is just some old man 
                        saying some shit on an internet 
                        video... But I... Fuck. 

           He takes a breath. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to let this get 
                        between us. Even if I forget my 
                        name, our past, everything... I’m 
                        gonna look at you and fall in love 
                        all the fuck over again. Because 
                        you can’t forget how you feel. 

           That sits. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma and Jude lie in bed together. They are back to back- no 
           longer facing. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW

           Emma opens her eyes. She’s now facing Jude, and he’s facing 
           her. She kisses his forehead. He stirs. 

                                 JUDE
                        Hey. 

                                 EMMA
                        Remember me?

           Jude opens one eye. 

                                 JUDE
                        I still remember you. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m sorry about yesterday. 
                                 JUDE
                        Me too. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m scared, Jude. 

                                 JUDE
                        Me too. 

                                 EMMA
                        Do you believe what you said to me?

                                 JUDE
                        I do. 

           She nods and makes herself smile.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay.

           She sits up and begins to climb out of bed. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to have a day with me?

                                 JUDE
                        You don’t have to go in?

                                 EMMA
                        Later. Just popping in to lock up.

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah... Let’s have a day.

           INT. MOVING BART - DAY - NOW

           Emma and Jude lean against each other on the Bart. They talk 
           animatedly, Emma coaxing laughter out of Jude. 

           It’s like everything is back to normal.

           EXT. TICKET BOOTH - DAY - NOW

           The two approach a ticket booth.

                                 TICKETER
                        Good morning.

                                 JUDE
                        Hi. How are you?
                                 TICKETER
                        I’m great. Just two adults?

                                 EMMA
                        No, uh, one adult one child please?

           The Ticketer blinks, looking at them both.

                                 TICKETER
                        Can I... See some I.D.?

                                 EMMA
                        Me? Oh, no. I’m the adult, he’s the 
                        child. He just looks really old for 
                        my age. 

           Jude is grinning behind his glasses now.

                                 TICKETER
                        How old are you?

                                 JUDE
                        Uh... Fifteen.

           In the distance-- Emma notices a small pack of stray dogs 
           wandering around. 

                                 TICKETER
                        When’s your birthday?

                                 JUDE
                        199... 200, uh.. 2003? Is that 
                        right?

           She laughs, printing out two tickets. 

                                 TICKETER
                        $40 flat. 

           Jude concedes, pulling out his wallet. 

                                 EMMA
                        Age is just a number, you know. 

           Ding.

           Both of their phones chime. As Emma pays, Jude looks at his 
           phone. She turns back to him and sees his focus. She grabs a 
           peek at his screen. 

                  POTENTIAL CURE ISOLATED IN ENZYME LINKED TO ALGAE BLOOM. 
                 BENEFICIAL SIDE EFFECTS MAY BE FOUND IN FISH CONSUMPTION.

                        Come on. Let’s go in.

           Emma takes his hand and leads him into the large dome of an

           AQUARIUM. 

           INT. AQUARIUM - DAY - NOW

           A blue void. 

           Out of the blue, a yellow fish cuts across the screen.

           Tens, hundreds of fish suddenly flood vision- 

           Emma and Jude watch the fish undulate in a giant room-sized 
           tank. Their glances shift over to other Aquarium-goers. 
           They’re all on their phones. 

                                 NEWS REPORTER (O.C.)
                        An enzyme scientists are calling GR-
                        14E found in a bloom of pacific 
                        algae has been highlighted as the 
                        key element in a promising new NIA 
                        antidote- 

           Emma’s eyes go to a television in the aquarium gift shop. A 
           SCIENTIST occupies the screen. A DOZEN PEOPLE are 
           conglomerating around the television. 

                                 TV SCIENTIST
                        We’ve seen this in a couple of 
                        places around the world where the 
                        ocean temperature has risen about 
                        two degrees above average- now that 
                        may not seem like a lot, but two 
                        degrees is night and day in 
                        ecological terms. Now this 
                        particular algae bloom is then 
                        consumed by fish, and the fish 
                        process it so-

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        There may be a cure in the fish. 

           Minnows avoid sharks, manta rays swirl clouds of sand beneath 
           their fins, turtles coast around the edges- circling for an 
           eternity. 

           The crowd around the television starts stirring. It’s now 
           most of the aquarium. She turns to Jude- 
           He’s moved away from here, now moved to the TURTLES. Everyone 
           else is focused on the television or on their phones. He’s 
           now the only person looking at the exhibits. 

                                 EMMA
                        This is kind of bizarre, isn’t it?

                                 JUDE
                        Look at this dude. Look how happy 
                        he is. Dude don’t know anything 
                        about NIA or taxes or dead parents. 
                        He just lives in a happy zone. 

           Emma blinks. 

                                 EMMA
                        ... What did you just say?

                                 JUDE
                        What?

           Emma’s gaze shifts behind her. There’s a group of people 
           flocking to get out of the aquarium. A sudden momentum to the 
           crowds, unsettling- dangerous.

           She sees that an AQUARIUM EMPLOYEE trying to calm an IRATE 
           CUSTOMER.

                                 EMMA
                        Jude...

                                 JUDE
                        Yo- 

           She looks back to Jude. His gaze is up. She follows it-

                                 EMMA
                        Oh my G-

           SPLASH!

           A MAN is suddenly IN the giant sea tank- struggling against 
           his clothes to force his way to the bottom- air ballooning 
           out of his mouth. 

           Fish scatter violently around him.

           Jude and Emma are on their feet- backing away. 

           The MAN in the tank swims all the way to the bottom. He 
           manages to get his hands on a slow-moving fish. He starts to 
           BITE into it. 
           Blood spills into the tank- rust colored swirling around the 
           moving currents. 

           The fish start to go crazy- swarming around the Man and the 
           cloud of blood- unable to make sense of the chaos. 

                                 INTERCOM
                        Attention please- the Aquarium of 
                        the Bay is now closed. Please 
                        calmly make your way to the nearest 
                        exit. We apologize for this 
                        inconvenience-

           Jude and Emma clutch each others hands and start to head 
           towards the exit with the majority of the aquarium guests as 
           the employees deal with the asshole in the tank. 

           EXT. BOARD WALK - DAY - NOW

           DOZENS of people are wading around the underbelly of the 
           boardwalk. 

           Some of them have fishing polls. 

           Others have nets.

           And others beyond that carry plastic shovels, plastic bins, 
           trying to chip off the green algae hanging off the submerged 
           boardwalk wood.

                        We’re still not sure what changed 
                        in is. If our biology has somehow 
                        rendered a component of what 
                        prevented NIA in the past useless, 
                        or if NIA is newly formed. In any 
                        event- we can say that multiple 
                        studies in Switzerland, Houston and 
                        Tokyo have yielded promising 
                        results. 

           Amidst all this, a MIDDLE AGED WOMAN sits on a bench feeding 
           seagulls popcorn. She has a sign next to her that reads: 

                                 I HAVE NIA BUT I AM A-OK!

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY - NOW

           Emma and Jude walk hurriedly together. There’s panic in the 
           streets. 

           People are rushing in and out of grocery stores. 
                                 NEWS REPORTER  (V.O.)
                        A CNN report earlier today about an 
                        algae enzyme has created an 
                        unprecedented run on grocery stores 
                        and fish markets in areas close to 
                        these so called “algae blooms.”

           This is a level of chaos that hasn’t been seen before. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY - NOW

           Glass coolers with ice racks are completely empty. A few 
           spare lemons and leaves of lettuce where rows of fish used to 
           sit on display.

           A handmade sign reads YES! OUR FISH EAT THE SPECIAL ALGAE! 

           A TV in the corner displays a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL SPEAKING to 
           the camera. 

                                 GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
                        We’ve increased police presence in 
                        lieu of the looting and we ask that 
                        everyone not give in to media 
                        sensationalism. We’ve all seen 
                        these “cures of the week” and ask 
                        people remain calm. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON - NOW

           Jude watches the television. A MEDIA ANALYST is on screen.

                                 MEDIA ANALYST 
                        Well it’s because everyone can eat 
                        fish. Past cures were, you know, 
                        scientists creating polio vaccines, 
                        you’d have to wait for the FDA. 
                        We’re seeing this crazy run on fish 
                        for the same reasons people buy 
                        lottery tickets when the jackpot 
                        goes up. People are desperate. It’s 
                        really a great sociological study!

           Emma pulls her bag over her shoulders. 

                                 JUDE
                        What- you’re going?

                                 EMMA
                        Just for two hours.
                                 JUDE
                        It’s a fucking madhouse out there. 

                                 EMMA
                        I have to-

                                 JUDE
                        Emma, they’re dogs, it doesn’t 
                        matter!

                                 EMMA
                        Jules isn’t picking up her phone. I 
                        don’t think she went in today... 
                        It’ll take just a few minutes.

           He frowns. 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DUSK - NOW

           Dogs bark in the distance. The sounds of people shouting 
           around corners. It’s not full on apocalypse-- but there’s a 
           definitive absence of civilization. 

           Emma and Jude walk hand in hand down the dark streets. 

                                 JUDE
                        Wait- wait, wait. 

           A FIGURE can be seen passing by a street light at the end of 
           the road. 

           Jude squeezes her hand. 

           A moment, then the figures moves along. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        This is some fuckin... Zombie 
                        apocalypse shit. 

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - EVENING - NOW 

           Emma steps into the office. Jude follows. The barking from 
           the back is at an all-time high. 

                                 EMMA
                        What the hell-

           She frowns and looks to Jude. 

           Some of the crates are opened. There are dogs running around 
           the front office. 
                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Hi. How’d you get in here? Hi. 

           She scoops the dog up and looks down death row. 

                                 JUDE
                        You gotta kill some dogs right now, 
                        don’t you?

           She nods. Jude tisks and takes a seat in one of the waiting 
           room chairs. 

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK ROOM - EVENING - NOW

           Emma walks along the rows of crates.  Most of the crates have 
           two dogs in them. Almost all of the white boards against the 
           crates have a circle with a slash through them.

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK ROOM - EVENING - NOW

           An AUX cable plugs into a phone. 

           The Ballad of Emma and Jude starts to play.

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - EVENING - NOW

           The sound of the song bleeds into the waiting room. Jude 
           looks up. He smirks at the sound. 

           He looks back down at his phone. 

           On his phone in the video of the OLD MAN he interviewed, 
           talking about love. 

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK ROOM - EVENING - NOW 

           Emma sings to a Golden Retriever that lies on a metal table. 
           She sticks it with a syringe as she rubs behind its ears. 

           The song plays. She sings along with it. 

           Her thumb rests on the plunger of the syringe. She doesn’t 
           press it down. Instead she keeps on singing along to the 
           ballad. 

           She removes the syringe from the Golden.
           EXT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK ROOM - EVENING - NOW

           Emma sits by herself.

           Jude knocks on the door.

                                 JUDE
                        How many times are you going to 
                        listen to that song?

                                 EMMA
                        It’s what I listen to. 

                                 JUDE
                        You listen to our ballad when you 
                        kill dogs? You have to see on some 
                        level that you are definitely 
                        deranged. 

           She smirks, but is unwavering. 

                                 EMMA
                        It makes me happy. It’s the 
                        counterweight. 

           The song ends. Emma and Samantha’s giggles can be heard. It 
           then starts again. 

                                 JUDE
                        Did you uh... 

           Jude’s eyes go to the back door. It’s ajar. There are no dead 
           dogs in the room tonight. 

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, you know there weren’t any 
                        dogs when we got here. They must 
                        have all been taken care of on the 
                        last shift. 

           Emma shrugs innocently. Jude smiles and starts to sing along 
           with Ben’s recording. He comes close to her and takes her in 
           his arms. They start to dance. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember when we recorded 
                        this?

                                 JUDE
                        With Ben.

                                 EMMA
                        But do you remember?
                                 JUDE
                        I remember.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m so scared you’re going to 
                        forget. 

                                 JUDE
                        You can’t forget feelings. 

           They slow dance together as the song keeps playing.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        You’re pretty good. You know that, 
                        right?

                                 EMMA
                        You too.

           The sun rises over the city as the Ballad continues.

           INT. JUDE’S OFFICE - DAY - MOMENTS - NOW

           Jude edits on a computer. He notices people gathering in the 
           common area. He slides his headphones off and begins walking 
           towards them. 

           On the television, a news report with the titles: NIA RELATED 
           SUICIDES IN THE MILLIONS. 

           Jude frowns.

           EXT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK - MOMENTS - NOW

           Emma sits in the back, smoking a cigarette. She stares down 
           at her phone as her call to MOM rings over and over again. 

           Now she frowns. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What’s your name?

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        I’m tired of doing this, Em. 
           EXT. CITY STREETS - EVENING - MOMENTS - NOW

           Emma and Jude walk Blue down the street. They pass a man 
           wearing a FACE MASK and carrying a BASEBALL BAT. He doesn’t 
           take any notice of them. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        We said we’d do it every night. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        For how long?

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Jude is looking out the window. Emma is sitting at the 
           kitchen table, looking exhausted. The memory exercise binder 
           sits in front of her. 

                                 EMMA
                        The doctor said to keep doing it.

                                 JUDE
                        We’ve done every night for a month.

                                 EMMA
                        Jude.

           He sighs. She’s not giving up.

                        March 11, 1992.

                        When were we married?

                                 JUDE
                        April uh... 

           Emma’s ears perk up. She looks to Jude. 
                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. Uh... August, uh-

                        When were we married Jude?

                                 JUDE 
                        Wednesday... A Wednesday in... 
                        April?

           Emma looks forlorn. Jude looks panicked. 

           She makes a note on the piece of paper- a flowchart directing 
           her to sets of questions. 

                                 EMMA
                        Do you remember the year?

                                 JUDE

                                 EMMA
                        What year is it now?

                                 JUDE

                                 EMMA
                        Tell me about our wedding. 

           It’s clear that he’s struggling. Tears well up in Emma’s 
           eyes. She moves on:

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Just start with the details. A 
                        memory has dozens of threads to 
                        other memories... Was it in a 
                        church?

                                 JUDE
                        I don’t know.

                                 EMMA
                        Was it a big wedding?

           She smiles hopefully at the prompt.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What color was the dress?

           Jude answers with what is seen. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        White. 

           The IMAGE BLURS COMPLETELY OUT. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           A tear drips down Emma’s cheek. She wipes it away, 
           controlling her composure. 

                                 EMMA
                        It was blue. 

           Jude frowns. Getting worried. Emma sniffs. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s move on-
                                 JUDE
                        Em-

                                 EMMA
                        Let’s just keep going... Please?

           She flips a few pages of her memory prompts. She sits up. 
           Resets. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Do you remember meeting me? 

                                 JUDE
                        As clear as day. 

                                 EMMA
                        Describe it. 

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           A WATER SLIDE

           One of the covered ones- like a tube flushing a person-- Jude 
           goes sliding down, down, down. 

           SPLASH!

           Jude lingers UNDERWATER for a moment. It looks like he’s 
           unconscious. Then- he stirs to life and 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        It was August. Cold. End of August.

           BREAKS THE SURFACE to 

           EXT. WATER PARK - DAY - THEN

           He pops up, nose just above the water. 

           Turning in place- he sees her. 

           EMMA. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        We were the oldest people there. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        We were the oldest people there at 
                        the end of summer. 

           Her eyes linger just above the surface- half her face hidden 
           by the water. It’s a recognizable image.
                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        I just thought of something funny. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        What?

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           EXT. WATER PARK - QUICK MOMENTS - THEN 

           Little moments. 

           Jude at the top of the water slide, looking down into it.

           OPPOSITE:

           Emma at the top of another water slide, about to go down. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        At the top of the slide we didn’t 
                        know each other. 

           They both jump. 

           IN THE SLIDE

           He slides down. 

           She slides down. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        It’s like we went from our old 
                        lives... 

           In SLOW MOTION - they both hit the surface of the water and 
           plunge into the blue. 

           They’re both submerged under water. They rise. 

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        To our new ones. Is that stupid?

           They turn above the surface-- just feet away from each other. 
           Their eyes lock. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        No. That’s not stupid. 

           Jude wades towards the shallow water. Emma wades towards the 
           shallow on the opposite side. They both get out on opposite 
           ends of the pool and start walking. They keep their eyes on 
           each other. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I was so sad the day I met you.

                                 JUDE (V.O.)
                        Why?

           Emma and Jude both stop walking. They stare at each other 
           across the pool. Jude smiles. Emma smiles back. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I can’t remember. I just know after 
                        I saw you I wasn’t sad anymore. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Still teary eyed, Emma closes the prompt binder. She smiles 
           sadly.

                                 EMMA
                        We got married October 17th of last 
                        year. We didn’t have a wedding. We 
                        went right to the court house. 
                        We... We tried on a Saturday but... 
                        Their offices were closed. 

           Jude nods. 

                                 JUDE
                        I’m sorry I don’t remember.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s not your fault. 

           She reaches out and squeezes his hand. 

                                 JUDE
                        I haven’t forgotten I love you.

           She smiles, taking some consolation in the fact.

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW

           Emma lies asleep next to Jude. 

           Jude is awake, staring at his wall of photos. They blur in 
           and out of focus. 

           The FACES in the photos feel like they subtly melt away.

           The faint sound of dogs yipping in the background can be 
           heard out the cracked window. 
           He sits up, careful not to wake her. He passes Blue. 

           Carefully, he creeps over to Emma’s desk. He takes out a pen. 
           He uncaps it.  

           A beat. 

           He pulls a photo off the wall. He writes on the back of it.

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW

           The Ballad of Emma and Jude plays. 

           Emma opens her eyes. Jude is stuffing a backpack. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey... 

           He looks at her. Bright eyed and smiling. 

                                 JUDE
                        Good moooooorning. 

           She blinks. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey. Did you forget me yet?

                                 JUDE
                        Not yet.

                                 EMMA
                        Good.

           Emma flops her head back onto her pillow- she grabs her phone 
           and begins scrolling through. 

                                 JUDE
                        They ungrounded flights between 
                        America and Mexico.

                                 EMMA
                        Mmmhm- I see. I wish we’d all just 
                        make up our minds on if we’re going 
                        full-on apocalypse or not. One day 
                        it’s total lock down, the next day 
                        there’s shooting in the streets, 
                        the next day we’re having a parade 
                        and planning trips to Cabo.

                                 JUDE
                        Aquarium’s still closed.
                                 EMMA
                        I want a bloody refund. 

           Jude laughs and crawls across the bed to her. Emma sees the 
           look in his eyes. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What’s got into you?

                                 JUDE
                        Let’s get out of town.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JUDE
                        Let’s leave. Just for the night.  
                        We’ll take a car, get Blue in the 
                        back seat. Have a road trip. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’re cheery!

           Jude kisses her and springs off of the bed- switching gears. 

                                 JUDE
                        You in or out?

                                 EMMA
                        Mmmmm..... IN. 

                                 JUDE
                        Ok, get packed. 

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY - NOW

           A RENTAL CAR speeds across the Golden Gate bridge, away from 
           the city. 

           Blue stares out the back. 

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY - NOW

           The car reaches the end of the bridge and slows. There’s a 
           POLICE CHECK POINT that has been set up. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, no... They aren’t turning us 
                        around, are they?
                                 JUDE
                        I looked it up, they said the 
                        bridge was opened... Hold on...

           Jude rolls down his window. A COP approaches. 

                                 COP
                        I.D.’s please. 

                                 JUDE
                        Are you turning us around?

                                 COP
                        Just need your I.D.’s. 

           He scans them. His handheld monitor lights up green. 

                                 COP (CONT’D)
                        Okay, go on through. 

           He hands them back their I.D.’s and they are off. 

           INT. MOVING CAR - DAY - NOW

           Emma looks down at her phone- concerned. Jude drives. 

                                 JUDE
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        I can’t get hold of my Mum.

                                 JUDE
                        Since when?

                                 EMMA
                        It’s just been a few weeks. I tried 
                        my aunt too. No one’s picking up. 

           Jude frowns, nods sympathetically. He offers Emma his hand. 

                                 JUDE
                        Maybe they’re just forgetting to, 
                        and that’s the worst it has to be.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah. I hope so.

           EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY - NOW

           The car winds through mountainous roads-- carving through the 
           forest- getting smaller along the horizon. 
           INT. MOVING CAR - AFTERNOON - NOW

           The radio plays soft music. Emma holds up Jude’s camera and 
           takes a photo of him. 

           The world around her blurs in and out of focus. 

           EXT. CABIN - AFTERNOON - NOW

           The car pulls up to a small cabin nestled in the woods. 

           The couple gets out. Jude pops the trunk and dances in the 
           mud with Blue. 

           Blue starts to howl. Jude joins him. Emma watches them both- 
           struck by his happiness.

                                 EMMA
                        Do we have a key to this place?

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah, the guy I was emailing said 
                        it would be in the mailbox. 

           Emma looks around. There’s a mailbox next to the door. She 
           goes to it and opens it. 

           Empty. 

                                 EMMA
                        Shit... 

           She looks at the back of the mailbox, around the ground. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Juuuuuude. 

           Jude’s still playing with the dog. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        No key. 

                                 JUDE
                        Come on! Come on! Let’s go sort out 
                        your momma! Come on. 

           Jude and Blue run up to the porch. He checks the mailbox. Yup- 
           still no key. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Ooooo...Kay.
           He checks above the door frame. He check a plant on the 
           window sill. He checks underneath the welcome mat. 

           There’s the key. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Got it. 

           He smiles.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        He probably just forgot. 

           Jude puts the key into the door. It opens.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I’m going to try to write things 
                        down again. I don’t know why. Maybe 
                        just to feel like I’m actually 
                        doing something... 

           INT. CABIN - EVENING - NOW

           Jude is working on starting a fire. Blue is asleep on a 
           couch. Emma is in the corner, writing loopy letters in her 
           journal. 

           The cabin is small- quaint. Like a rustic studio apartment. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I keep waiting for the world to 
                        end. Some days there is violence in 
                        the streets. Other days it’s like 
                        nothings happening. I keep 
                        picturing it like a pot on a 
                        stove... About to boil over, until 
                        it hits the wooden spoon. Are we 
                        the pot, the water, or the spoon? I 
                        don’t-

                                 JUDE
                        I need to say something to you. 

           She looks up. The fire is roaring. Jude is sitting in front 
           of her. 

                                 EMMA
                        ...Okay.

           Jude is holding a piece of paper in his hands. 
                                 JUDE
                        I uh... I wanted to write it down. 
                        So I don’t... Get jumbled. 

           Emma stares at him- pensive. What is this?

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I’m forgetting things, Em. More and 
                        more every day. It’s just the 
                        reality.

           Jude unfolds the paper. And starts to read. 

           The world starts to blur around them. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Dear Emma. I wanted to write this 
                        to you... I wanted to say this to 
                        you while I still have as much of 
                        me as I do. It started with little 
                        details. Telephone numbers or old 
                        teachers names... But every morning 
                        I wake up and have to check a note 
                        pad I keep in the drawer to remind 
                        me what our dog’s name is. The 
                        surgery didn’t work. It’s getting 
                        worse. I can’t remember our 
                        wedding. I can’t remember my Dad’s 
                        name. And I’m starting to forget 
                        you. It’s getting to the point that 
                        I can feel it.

           Emma sits, still as a statue, listening to her husbands 
           words. He falls in and out of focus. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        The world is moving fast. 
                        There’s... Chaos around us. People 
                        freaking out. Looking for cures. 
                        Flights grounded. Borders sealed. 
                        People getting lost on their own 
                        streets. And in the middle of it, 
                        there’s just us. Doing the best we 
                        can. I wanted to pump the brakes. I 
                        wanted to come here and have a 
                        moment of stillness. Of some quiet. 
                        So I can look you in the eye, in 
                        case... 

           He swallows.
                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Before I’m all gone. So that I can 
                        tell you that you are the love of 
                        my life. In no uncertain terms. I 
                        love you. We always ask each other 
                        why we love one another, but we 
                        never give the real answer... The 
                        real answer isn’t that I make you 
                        laugh or that you make my life 
                        worth living, although those things 
                        are true... 

           He takes a breath. Fighting the emotion. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        The real answer is that I love you 
                        because you’re the person who makes 
                        me feel like I’m not alone. If 
                        things were normal, you’d be the 
                        person who makes it feel okay that 
                        I’m going to die someday, because, 
                        at least... At least I’ll be with 
                        you. But things aren’t normal. So 
                        instead, I love you because you’re 
                        here with me. Because you get me 
                        through each day, and I hope I’ve 
                        been able to do that for you. 
                        Because it’s like we’re the middle 
                        of the sea. During a hurricane. And 
                        all we can hold onto is each other. 
                        And no matter what, we’re going to 
                        forget. And if we don’t forget, 
                        we’re going to die. But at least 
                        I’ve got you. At least you’ve got 
                        me. I love you. I love you. I love 
                        you.

           He puts the letter down. Emma is in stunned silence.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I... I just needed to say that. I 
                        think we’ve got to be real. I can 
                        feel myself slipping now. And I 
                        don’t... 

           He stops. Nods. That’s all. 

           An eternity between them. The fire crackles. The dog yawns. 
           Emma has tears streaming down her face. 

           She leans forward and kisses him. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        If-
           She kisses him harder. She grabs him close, suddenly 
           straddling him. 

           There’s silence. Just the sounds of the fire cracking and 
           their breathing. 

           She pulls his shirt off. He yanks at her pants. They’re both 
           half naked, wrestling at the fabric to get to each other. 

           The world blurs out completely around them. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT - NOW

           The fire is embers now. 

           Emma and Jude lie next to each other, a makeshift bed pulled 
           together on the floor of blankets and couch pillows. 

                                 EMMA
                        What are you thinking?

                                 JUDE
                        I’m thinking about what you said to 
                        me when you found out I was 
                        slipping. When I said I wanted to 
                        tell each other everything.

           She blinks. 

                                 EMMA
                        What did I say?

           He smiles.

                                 JUDE
                        You said you can’t forget feelings. 

           He looks at her. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Do you still think that’s true?

           She considers for a moment. Rather than answer, she begins to 
           hum the tune to the Ballad of Emma and Jude. 

           After a moment, Jude joins her with the lyrics. 

                                                              FADE OUT.
           INT. CABIN - MORNING - NOW

           Emma opens her eyes. She looks around. Jude is gone. Blue is 
           gone. 

           Barking outside. 

           Emma pulls on a shirt and sits up. 

           EXT. CABIN - MORNING - NOW

           Poking her head outside, Emma finds Jude and Blue playing tug-
           o-war with a stick. Jude playfuly goads the dog, who gives a 
           gutteral grunt in response as he wrangles the wood. 

                                 JUDE
                        Youcan’tgetthatstick. 
                        Youcan’tgetit! Noyoucan’t. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey. 

           He’s beaming. She can’t help but giggle at his energy. 

                                 JUDE
                        This dog’s great! 

           He returns his attention to Blue. Emma blinks at that. Then:

                                 EMMA
                        His name’s Blue. 

           Jude smiles, taking the new information like a stranger just 
           meeting the dog for the first time. 

                                 JUDE
                        HI BLUUUUUUEEEE. 

           Emma takes this in. A soft smile. This is okay.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        He looks the same. He looks like 
                        the same person I’ve shared my life 
                        with for three years. But I can’t 
                        see in his head. What does he 
                        remember? What does he forget?

                        Jude Andrew Williams is 26. His 
                        favorite color is purple. He was 
                        married on October 17th, 2018. A 
                        Wednesday. He is the love of my 
                        life. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - DAY - NOW

           Emma, alone, looks at the wall of Jude’s photos. She notices 
           the scotch tape has failed- one of them has fallen to the 
           ground. 

           A photo of Emma rests at her feet. She picks it up. On the 
           back, the words EMMA (WIFE) are written on it. 

           Jude enters behind her. 

           She smiles sadly. He blinks- sees the photo in her hand. 
           She’s discovered his coping mechanism. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - DAY - NOW

           Jude and Emma stand in front of his photo wall. It’s peppered 
           with photos- some old, some new. 

           Emma writes on post-it notes and begins sticking them on the 
           wall. Jude watches. 

                                 EMMA
                        This can work.

                        For some people NIA is a slow drip. 
                        For others it’s all at once. For 
                        you it’s the slow fade...

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma and Jude are stuffed into the bathtub together. Emma’s 
           foot rests on the edge of the tub, displaying her fish 
           tattoo. 

                                 JUDE
                        When did you get that?
                                 EMMA
                        I got it with you.

                                 JUDE
                        Really?

           He looks at it analytically. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t really like it. 

           She laughs. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        What?

           She laughs that silent can’t-catch-your-breath laugh and 
           claps. It’s just tooooooo good. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        What? Tell me the joke!

           She reaches down into the tubs and pulls out his leg- he’s 
           got the same tattoo on the same place.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Nooooooo. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Do I know you better than you know 
                        yourself? A love story. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           The pair lies in bed together. 

                                 JUDE
                        Why fish?

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JUDE
                        Why did we tattoo fish?

                        It’s not true what they say. About 
                        fish and their memory.

                                 JUDE
                        What? That they have none?

                                 EMMA
                        They can remember longer than 
                        people think. They’ll forget 
                        someday. But not right away. 

                                 JUDE
                        Huh. 

           He thinks about this. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Think about all they get to 
                        rediscover.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Dear Jude. I’m going to try to 
                        write things down now. I don’t know 
                        why. Maybe to just feel like I’m 
                        doing something. Maybe for you. 

           The Ballad of Emma and Jude begins to play. 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY - NOW - LITTLE MOMENTS

           Emma and Jude walk together through markets- street corners 
           we’ve seen before. He points things out, taking photos. 

           Emma frozen, swinging off a lamp post like Singin’ in the 
           Rain. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        There’s no order to how the 
                        memories were lost. You can 
                        remember your high school 
                        graduation, but you can’t remember 
                        our address. 

           Jude looks around.

                                 JUDE
                        Have we been here before?

           Emma looks to the shop in front of them. It’s the PET STORE. 
                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Every day we rediscover the city, 
                        places we had known in special ways 
                        were strange again. 

                                 EMMA
                        No. No we haven’t. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW 

           Jude stands in front of a stove, cooking eggs. His eyes go to 
           the window. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Some things are easy. 

           Emma comes rushing in. 

                                 EMMA
                        JUDE!

           He looks back to the stove. The skillet is literally ON FIRE. 
           The smoke alarm starts going off. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - NOW

           Emma writes in her journal. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Other things are harder. 

           A knock at the door.

           Emma goes to it and opens it. Jude stands in the doorway, 
           panic in his eyes. 

                                 EMMA
                        Jude?

           He hugs her. 

                                 JUDE
                        Thank fuck. Oh, man. 

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 JUDE
                        I couldn’t remember which apartment 
                        we were. I tried all the doors 
                        downstairs. 
           Emma winces. She reaches into his jacket, and pulls out a 
           small NOTEBOOK from his pocket. He looks at it.

           It’s filled with all the important details- spelled out, like 
           for a child. 

           Emma (Wife) Number, Home Address, Email address, BART station 
           all in a row. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        I guess I forgot it was there...

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY - NOW

           Jude frames up a photo of the Golden Gate bridge. 

                                 JUDE
                        Wow. Look how beautiful it is! Have 
                        you seen this?

                                 EMMA
                        Yes Jude, I’ve seen it!

                                 JUDE
                        Get in the picture, get in there!

           Emma watches him take in the wonder of the bridge.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        Maybe we really were like the fish. 
                        Slowly forgetting to discover all 
                        over again. 

           Jude lowers his face from the camera. All smiles.

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK ROOM - DAY - NOW

           Emma sits over a dead dog. She covers it in plastic. 

           A bell rings. 

                                 EMMA
                        Coming!

           She rises and goes towards the back. 

           EXT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK - DAY

           The white DOGCATCHER’S VAN pulls up. Emma helps guide it as 
           it reverses down the alley. It slows to a stop and shuts off. 
           Emma opens up the back to greet half a dozen dogs. 

           A NEW DRIVER comes around the corner. It’s a woman in her 
           50s. 

                                 NEW DRIVER
                        Heya. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hi. 

           She looks at the New Driver, a little perplexed. Shrugs it 
           off. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        How many today?

                                 NEW DRIVER
                        Just five. 

                                 EMMA
                        Any collars?

                                 NEW DRIVER
                        One.

                                 EMMA
                        We’re on a low streak right now. 

                                 NEW DRIVER
                        Maybe people are finally 
                        remembering to close their gates. 

           Emma and the New Driver begin to shepherd the dogs into the 
           vets. 

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK ROOM - DAY 

           The final dog gets locked in the final crate. Emma writes a 
           big 10 on the white board fastened to the bars. 

                                 NEW DRIVER
                        Here you go.

           The New Driver hands her a paper attached to a clipboard. 
           Emma looks at the bottom and signs it. She detaches the paper 
           and returns the clipboard. 

                                 NEW DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        Alright, see you in a bit. 

           Emma watches the New Driver go. 
                                 EMMA
                        Um- sorry. Do you know where Frank 
                        is?

           The New Driver turns and looks at her.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        There’s usually a driver named 
                        Frank. If he’s sick he usually just 
                        reschedules. 

                                 NEW DRIVER
                        ... Frank’s been gone for weeks, 
                        dear. I’m Annie... Do you not 
                        remember me?

           Emma freezes.

                                 EMMA
                        No of course, Annie. I was just 
                        wondering if you’ve... Heard 
                        anything about Frank. 

                                 NEW DRIVER
                        No, haven’t. I think he’s with some 
                        family up in Oregon. See ya soon. 

           Annie, the not-so New Driver leaves. Emma blinks. Frozen like 
           a statue for a moment. Then-

           INT. VET’S OFFICE - DAY - NOW

           Emma rifles through desk drawers until she gets to a binder 
           of papers. 

           She opens the binder and begins to turn through the pages. 

           It’s delivery receipts. At the bottom- a signature. She looks 
           at the signature. Loopy A’s that look like ANNIE.  Next to 
           Annie’s signature is Emma’s signature. 

           She pages back further. Weeks back. They’re all ANNIE’s 
           signature. Weeks back. Emma’s signature next to each one. 

           Emma sits down. She breathes. She closes her eyes- as if 
           meditating.

           Breathe in.

           Breathe out. 

           Breathe in. 
           EXT. VET’S OFFICE - BACK - EVENING - NOW

           Emma looks at her phone. She stares down at a number. It says 
           MOM. She hits call. 

           As soon as she does, the line disconnects. 

                                 ROBOT
                        We’re sorry. The number you have 
                        dialed is no longer in service. 
                        Please check your service provider-

           She hangs up. 

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - EVENING - NOW

           Emma walks up the streets by herself. There’s an emptiness 
           you don’t often feel in major cities. People walk around in 
           the far background, few and far between. 

           INT. EMMA AND JUDE’S APARTMENT - MORNING - NOW

           Emma opens her eyes. Jude is fidgeting with his phone, 
           frustrated. He smacks it. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hey.

                                 JUDE
                        Hey- can you fix this? I can’t get 
                        this- this- this- this-

                                 EMMA
                        Phone?

                                 JUDE
                        Yeah. I can’t get that phone to 
                        turn on. 

           Emma looks at it. No response. She reaches over Jude and 
           grabs his charger. She plugs it in. It begins to pinwheel to 
           life. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s just out of battery.

                                 JUDE
                        Huh. They should really make 
                        versions of these that last. 

           He sits up and starts to get dressed. 
                                 EMMA
                        Where are you going?

                                 JUDE
                        To the beach!

                                 EMMA
                        What?

           He blinks at her. 

                                 JUDE
                        I asked and you said we could go to 
                        the beach last night.

           She thinks about it.

                                 EMMA
                        You’re right. I did. I didn’t think 
                        you’d remember. 

           He tisks, chipperly loading his camera with film. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Why do you want to go to the beach? 
                        It’s winter. 

                                 JUDE
                        ... To see what it’s like. 

           INT. MOVING BART - DAY - NOW

           Emma and Jude sit on the Bart together. She’s got her 
           backpack in her lap, journal and pen in hand. Blue sits by 
           their feet on a leash. Emma’s attention goes from the window 
           to the middle of the cabin. 

                                 JUDE
                        What do you always write in there?

                                 EMMA
                        Things. 

                                 JUDE
                        About me?

           She playfully yanks the journal towards her. 

                                 EMMA
                        Never. 

           She sees the same WOMAN with FRIZZY HAIR from their Aquarium 
           day sitting at the opposite end. She doesn’t say anything. 
           EXT. BEACH - DAY - NOW 

           Emma, Jude and Blue walk along the beach. Fascinated, Jude 
           runs around, taking as many photos as he can. 

           Seagulls push against the wind, moving neither forward nor 
           back. 

           Foam catches the sand and shivers in the cold air. 

           Waves sigh in a constant inhale/exhale. 

                                 JUDE
                        Come over here! 

           Jude begins to frame up a photo of Emma, hair blowing in the 
           wind. She closes her eyes. 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Open your eyes. 

                                 EMMA
                        Jude I can’t- this wind. 

                                 JUDE
                        Just try?

           Emma squints in the wind. She closes her eyes, bracing. She 
           turns away from it, laughing, her hood flying over her head. 

                                 EMMA
                        No I’m sorry, it’s too much, I-

           She looks up. 

           Jude isn’t there anymore. 

           She turns. 

           He’s twenty feet away, ambling down the beach with Blue. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Jude? 

           She gives chase, pushing to catch up to him. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Jude! 

           Bridging the gap between them, he turns. He blinks at her, a 
           pleasant smile on his face- totally at ease. 

                                 JUDE
                        Hi?
                                 EMMA
                        Hi?

           A beat. 

                                 JUDE
                        ... Um... Okay. Well. Sorry?

           He turns and keeps moving. Emma’s eyes widen. It dawns on 
           her.

                                 EMMA
                        Jude. Jude, Jude, Jude. 

           She grabs his hand. 

                                 JUDE
                        Hey!

                                 EMMA
                        Jude, Jude. Look at me. Look at me. 

                                 JUDE
                        What? 

                                 EMMA
                        Who am I? Jude? Who am I?

                                 JUDE
                        I don’t know! Fuck off! 

           She doubles down- she grabs onto the front of his jacket.

                                 EMMA
                        EMMA! Emma! I’m Emma, Jude! I’m 
                        your wife! Look at me- 

                                 JUDE
                        Let go of me-

           He pushes her back. A space between them. He drops Blue’s 
           leash. Clearly a little freaked out, Jude puts a hand up in 
           defense.

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Look- I don’t know you. We don’t 
                        know each other. I’m just having a 
                        walk here. Okay! 

           He leans forward- 

                                 JUDE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I think you’re just confused- 
                                 EMMA
                        I’m not confused-

                                 JUDE
                        Don’t follow me. Okay? You 
                        understand? I’ve got my own- my own 
                        personal space here- you’re really 
                        getting up in my shit right now, 
                        and I think you’re freaking out. So- 
                        just let’s leave it at that. 

           He backs up. 

           Desperate, she grabs onto him again.

                                 EMMA
                        No- Jude- 

           WHUMP. 

           He pushes her. She falls backwards into the sand. A little 
           surprised at what he’s done, Jude backs up. Wincing, Emma 
           sits back up. 

                                 JUDE
                        I’m-- I’m sorry. Just... Just go!

           Hold. Their eyes locked. Emma gulps. 

           She begins to hum the tune of the Ballad of Emma and Jude. 

           Jude looks at her- a hint of recognition?

           She begins to sing the lyrics. Tears run down her face. She 
           belts them out, finally getting to the chorus. He breaks the 
           eye contact. He turns. He begins to walk away. 

           Step. After step. After step. 

           Emma puts her hands to her mouth, completely mortified. 

                                 EMMA
                        Oh no. No! Jude. 

           She completely loses all composure. She watches as Jude walks 
           further away. In the distance, Blue romps happily by himself. 

           Emma rocks back and fourth. Curling towards her knees- total 
           fetal position. 

           In an eruption of anger, she begins to hit the sand. She 
           punches the sand until her knuckles start to bleed. Her 
           wraith continues- turning to her backpack. She starts to rip 
           at it, tearing at the cloth.
           Her notebook spills out. Fluttering open. 

           She begins tearing at the pages. The wind takes them with it. 
           Paper spills out into the air and onto the beach. 

           Emma stands, in a final act of raw emotion, and launches her 
           backpack into the sea. 

           And then she’s done. 

           She falls to her knees in the sand. All emotion drained in 
           her face. Eyes bleary, cheeks flushed. Knuckles bleeding. 

           Violent waves crash against the shore. Seagulls fly against 
           wind, moving neither forward or back.

           In the sand - loose leaf papers litter the beach. Washing in 
           and out as the ocean breathes. 

           The papers have writing on them. Little curls of letters 
           blotted into swirling ink-stains from the salt water.

           Glimpses of those papers show what they say-- 

           I’m going to start writing things down now. 

           They all start the same way. In fact, every page contains the 
           same entry. The same thought, written over, and over and over 
           again. 

           There are a dozen words to describe Emma, but right now, only 
           one will really do: exhausted. 

           Silent tears stream down her face.

           Breathing, in and out with the sound of the waves, she closes 
           her eyes- as if meditating.

           Her eyes begin to blink- rapidly, as if caught in REM sleep. 

           Breathe in.

           Breathe out. 

           Breathe in.

           Breathe -- 

           BLUE interrupts Emma’s solace- intrusively nuzzling its face 
           into her neck. Her eyes blink open. She smiles, and suddenly 
           it’s as if a whole new person is sitting on the beach.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Who are you?
           Out of the corner of her eye, she sees a YOUNG MAN come into 
           focus in the distance. He’s walking towards her, slowly, 
           looking all around the beach as if he’s lost. 

           He’s got a small film camera hanging around his neck.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Is this your dog?

           The Young Man breaks out into a jog to bridge the distance 
           between them. Emma rises, holding onto the dog’s leash. 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Is this your dog?

           Up close their eyes meet for the first time. He sheepishly 
           gives her a dazed smile. This is JUDE. Emma smiles. Which 
           makes Jude smile more. Which makes Emma-

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JUDE
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        You’re smiling.

                                 JUDE
                        I just uh... I didn’t expect your 
                        voice to be... That- I mean, your 
                        accent. 

                                 EMMA
                        What’s wrong with it?

                                 JUDE
                        Nothing.

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I was so sad the day I met you.

           Waves CRASH into-- 

           BLACK. 

                                 EMMA (V.O.)
                        I can’t remember why. 

           In the darkness, THE BALLAD OF EMMA AND JUDE begins.
