           EXT. SUN DEVIL STADIUM - FIELD - DAY

           Inside an empty football stadium, PAT TILLMAN, 21, strapping
           with shoulder-length hair, begins scaling the steps of a
           thirty-story light pole in jeans and flip flops. As he does,
           we intercut archive footage through his career.

                                 PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Mr. Pat Tillman. Raising hell again.

           Pat throws the OREGON QUARTERBACK down for a sack, long mane
           flopping under his Arizona State helmet.

                                 COLOR COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
                        He's a 3.8 student. And obviously he
                        spends more time in the library than
                        he ever did in the barbershop.

           Ten feet below Pat on the ground, a PHOTOGRAPHER watches
           with trepidation. Pat looks down. You coming or what? Fuck
           it. The photographer climbs up after him.

           A mob of ASU STUDENTS surround Pat on the field after an
           upset victory. He lets loose into a REPORTER'S mike--

                                 TILLMAN
                        We never lose at home! We kicked the
                        shit out of them, baby!

           The reporter lowers his mike -- you can't say that on TV!

           While Pat breezes up the pole, the photographer takes slow,
           deliberate steps -- inch by inch through paralyzing fear.

           Surrounded by rabid fans, the same reporter interviews Pat
           after another thrilling victory--

                                 SPORTS REPORTER
                        What about that defensive stand here
                        on that last overtime drive?

           Pat puts an arm around him, smiles, can't help himself--

                                 PAT
                        Once again... we kicked the shit out
                        of 'em!

           The reporter and fans cackle. What'd you expect from Pat?

           Now halfway to the top of the light pole, Pat takes in the
           Tempe Salt River as small boats drift along its current.
           The crowd is sparse at the end of the NFL Draft. All that
           remain: diehards and drunks. The Deputy Commissioner stands
           at the podium announcing the latest selection--

                                 DEPUTY COMMISSIONER
                        With the 226th pick in the 1998 NFL
                        Draft, the Arizona Cardinals
                        select... Pat Tillman, Linebacker.
                        Arizona State.

           Bracing himself against the pole, the photographer snaps
           photos as Pat summits the tower platform.

           Pat strolls up on a beach cruiser to the Cardinals' parking
           lot. He's shirtless in khaki cutoffs, duffel bag slung
           across his chest. He smiles, waves to the assembled media.

           The photographer finally joins Pat at the top. The payoff
           for this perilous climb: an unobstructed view of the serene
           desert in every direction.

           The SEAHAWKS QUARTERBACK scrambles to his right to pass.

                                 PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Foley rolls out of the pocket. Throws
                        far side.

           Out of nowhere, Pat steps in front of the pass--

                                 PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Intercepted by Tillman!

           --and sprints down the sideline for a Cardinals touchdown.

           The photographer snaps a photo of Pat lounging between the
           railings like a metal hammock. We freeze on the picture as
           it dissolves into an article in Sports Illustrated.

           "A Cut Above Pat Tillman, Arizona State's Height-Loving,
           Tree-Swinging, Book-Cracking Linebacker, Is The Best Player
           You've Never Heard Of."

           Pat watches a monsoon form as veins of lightning pulse on
           the horizon.

                                                         MATCH CUT:

           INT./EXT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Ominous clouds creep over a quaint one-story house as wind
           whips the lush elm leaves. A modest home elsewhere, but on
           the outskirts of Silicon Valley it fetches a cool million.
           SUPER: FALL 1979 - NEW ALMADEN, CALIFORNIA.

           DANNIE TILLMAN, 25, sleep deprived and overworked, pulls her
           dirty blonde hair into a bun as she glances out the window.

                                 DANNIE
                        Can't we have just one nice day?

           She returns to mixing a bowl of cookie dough while her
           MOTHER, 50s, plops two large balls onto a baking sheet.

                                 DANNIE
                        That's too much.

           She removes the balls. Rips them in half. Places them back.

                                 DANNIE'S MOTHER
                        Oh let them live a little.

                                 DANNIE
                        Easy to say. You'll be home when the
                        sugar kicks in. I'll be the one
                        dealing with those little devils.

           Speaking of, Dannie's eyes roll up to the ceiling, spidey
           sense tingling. She looks at her mother--

                                 DANNIE
                        It's too quiet.

                                 DANNIE'S MOTHER
                        Go.

           INT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - PAT'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dannie bursts into the room as KEVIN, 2, stands on tip-toes
           peering out an open window. He babbles in excitement--

                                 KEVIN
                               (pointing)
                        Pah-Pah!

           Dannie sticks her head out to see PAT, 3, toe-headed and
           carefree, clinging to the trunk of a eucalyptus tree. Pat
           notices his mother, beaming all the while--

                                 PAT
                        Here it comes!

           The wind kicks up, blowing Pat to and fro, delicate life in
           the hands of mother nature while his own watches in horror.
                                 DANNIE
                        Stay there, Pat. Don't move.

           Her mother enters the room to provide backup.

                                 DANNIE'S MOTHER
                        What's going on?

                                 DANNIE
                        Take Kevin.

           Dannie scoops him up -- hands him off.

           As Dannie climbs out the window, a cloud bursts overhead.
           She manages to sit on the roof, scooting her way through the
           downpour. Extends out to Pat. He's just out of grasp.

           A forceful gust of wind bends the tree, pushing Pat closer
           to Dannie. His grip begins to loosen. Dannie reaches for Pat
           just as he slips. Dannie catches him by the skin of his
           teeth. Pat's all smiles. Let's go again.

           INT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - PAT'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dannie climbs through the window with Pat clung to her hip
           like a baby Orangutan. Once her feet are planted safely, she
           sets him down. Takes a knee to discipline him eye-to-eye --
           Pat's chubby cheeks staring back at her.

                                 PAT
                               (frowning)
                        What's wrong?

                                 DANNIE
                        You could've hurt yourself.

           Ready to scold Pat, she decides to hug him instead.

                                 DANNIE
                        Don't ever scare mommy like that
                        again.

                                 PAT
                        I'm sorry.

           Dannie nods, tears beginning to well.

           Off Pat's precious almond eyes--

                                                    MATCH DISSOLVE:
           INT. CARDINALS CLUBHOUSE - GYM - EARLY MORNING

           Pat, now 25, grunts as he squats enough weight to qualify
           for the Olympic team. A Balbo beard hugs the lines of his
           chiseled jaw. We pull back to reveal he's all alone.

           After a few reps, a TRAINER enters through a side door. He
           picks up dirty, day old towels as he crosses.

                                 TRAINER
                        Till, I know we have the week off,
                        but you can still ask for a spotter.

                                 PAT
                               (as he racks the bar)
                        That's why I'm going easy.

           The trainer shakes his head. Fucking Till.

           INT. CARDINALS CLUBHOUSE - TRAINING ROOM - LATER

           Pat keeps his eyes closed as he soaks in an ice bath. His
           zen-like focus is broken by the trainer entering and making
           a bee-line for the TV.

                                 TRAINER
                               (flipping it on)
                        You see this shit?

           Live news footage loops of the WORLD TRADE CENTER ATTACKS as
           anchors attempt to explain the inexplicable.

           Pat lifts himself out of the tub -- speechless, spellbound.

           INT. CARDINALS CLUBHOUSE - FILM ROOM - DAY

           Fifty-three Arizona Cardinals PLAYERS are seated in the
           auditorium, all chattering about the attacks.  

           The side door swings open. COACH MCGINNIS, 50, sunburned
           face and polo shirt, walks to the front of the room.

                                 COACH MCGINNIS
                        'Preciate y'all coming in on your day
                        off. I'mma let you get back to your
                        families soon. Reason I called you in
                        is the league office wants every team
                        to vote on whether we want to play
                        this weekend. Figure I'll follow
                        whatever y'all decide. So by a show
                        of hands, who wants to play on
                        Sunday?
           Not a single hand up. Then, Pat raises his. Everyone stares.

                                 PAT
                               (standing)
                        Maybe I'm the only one here who feels
                        this way. But if going out on the
                        field allows someone to watch the
                        National Anthem and realize we're
                        moving forward as a country, even
                        with something as stupid as football,
                        it's progress. Bottom line: I wanna
                        play.

           He sits down. A beat.

                                 COACH MCGINNIS
                        Anyone else?

           DAVE BROWN, 31, more closely resembling an accountant than a
           backup NFL QB, stands up in the front row.

                                 DAVE BROWN
                        I'm pretty sure I'm the only one in
                        this room from New York. I have
                        friends and family who lost loved
                        ones in those towers. And for us to
                        go out and play a game after what
                        happened yesterday. It's
                        unconscionable in my mind. So for
                        that reason, I'm saying no.

                                 COACH MCGINNIS
                        Anyone want to change their vote?

           Crickets.

                                 COACH MCGINNIS
                        Alright. We'll see you next Monday.

           As the players shuffle out, Dave approaches Pat--

                                 DAVE BROWN
                        I hope you see where I'm coming from,
                        Till. I know how much you love playing
                        but some things in life are more
                        important than football.

           He walks out, leaving Pat to chew on his words.
           INT. MILITARY RECRUITMENT OFFICE - DAY

           From under the brim of his ball cap, Pat eyes inspirational
           military posters on the back wall -- more campy than kick-ass. 

           SUPER: SEVEN MONTHS LATER

           KEVIN TILLMAN, 24, honest features, roguish dimples, leans
           back in his chair.

                                 KEVIN
                        Would you recommend we enlist or go
                        in as officers?

           Across from him, a RECRUITER, 50s, crew cut and southern
           accent, tongues the chewing tobacco in his lower lip.

                                 RECRUITER
                        You go in as officers, you'll be sticking
                        pins in maps and thumbs in yer asses.
                               (then)
                        You boys really wanna make a
                        difference? Go in as grunts. You'll
                        be in the heart of the action.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yes, sir. That's the idea. We wanna
                        be Rangers.

                                 RECRUITER
                        Well, best speak to yer wife first.

           He nods to MARIE TILLMAN, 26, a warm blonde with ice blue eyes,
           who's been sitting silently next to Kevin the entire time.

                                 KEVIN
                        That's why she's here. To give her
                        support.

           He puts a reassuring hand on Marie's. She squeezes out a
           meager smile. The best she can do.

                                 RECRUITER
                        Well alright then. Soon as yer ready,
                        y'all can sign the contracts.

           He spits into a McDonald's cup, keeping his eyes fixed on
           Pat. There's a familiarity about him he can't quite place.

           EXT. MILITARY RECRUITMENT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Pat, Kevin, and Marie cross into the parking lot.
                                 MARIE
                        Still don’t understand why I couldn’t
                        play your sister or something.

                                 KEVIN
                        Because Pat's a weirdo and thinks
                        he's gonna get recognized.

                                 PAT
                        Or because the only way you're
                        getting married is by pretending.

           With some effort, Kevin pulls Pat's wedding band off.

                                 PAT
                        I know baseball players don't care
                        about staying in shape but damn you
                        got some fat fingers.

                                 KEVIN
                               (tossing ring at Pat)
                        You just have tiny hands.
                               (unlocking his truck)
                        And we all know what they say about
                        that. Right, Marie?

                                 MARIE
                        Oh please. You’ve seen your brother
                        naked more times than I have.

           Pat opens the passenger door.

                                 PAT
                               (whispering)
                        We can change that.

           He puckers up for a kiss.

                                 MARIE
                        Mm, not with that breath.

           Denied. She smiles -- climbs in the back of the crew cab.
           Off Pat, giving himself a breath check--

           EXT. HIKING TRAIL - EVENING

           Dannie, now 47, hair showing signs of gray from a divorce and
           three boys, fights gravity and father time as she easily
           strides up a trail incline.

           Fifty feet behind her, UNCLE MIKE, 44, sucks wind with hands
           interlocked atop his thinning hair.
                                 DANNIE
                               (turning back)
                        Come on, Mike. Almost there.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        You said this would be easy.

                                 DANNIE
                        You're the baby of the family.
                        Shouldn't you be lapping me?

           Mike flips her off -- seconds away from feeding the birds
           with his vomit.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        You got the hiking gene from mom, and
                        I got the lounging gene from dad.

           Dannie doubles back to give him a boost.

                                 DANNIE
                        Come on. A little bit more.

           She holds his arm as they climb up shoulder to shoulder.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        You know, most mothers prefer to be
                        waited on hand and foot today.

                                 DANNIE
                        When I retire, it won't be in a rocking
                        chair. I'm gonna be an active grandma.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        Might wanna pump the brakes, Dan. It's
                        been what, a week since the wedding?

                                 DANNIE
                        Let's hope Pat and Marie's marriage
                        lasts longer than mine.

           They reach a turnout just as the sun begins to set.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        Can't believe I almost died for this.

                                 DANNIE
                        Worth it.
           INT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           As Dannie stirs a sauce pan, Mike sits at the dinner table
           reading the paper.

           The cordless phone rings. Dannie wipes her hands -- checks
           the caller ID. Her eyes light up as she answers--

                                 DANNIE
                        Hey, Nub!

                                 KEVIN (V.O.)
                        Happy Mother’s Day!

                                 DANNIE
                        Aw. Thank you.

           She crosses into the dining room.

                                                          INTERCUT:

           INT. PHOENIX HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Kevin lounges on the couch in a modest McMansion, phone to
           his ear. A nearby UV light zaps any desert critter bold
           enough to meet its demise.

                                 KEVIN
                        You get the flowers we sent?

           She admires the 1-800-FLOWERS Mother's Day special on the table.

                                 DANNIE
                        Yes. They're beautiful. Thank you.
                               (then)
                        Uncle Mike and I were talking about
                        you earlier. Were your ears burning?

                                 KEVIN
                        Only because it was a hundred and
                        four today.
                               (then)
                        Is Uncle Mike there now?

                                 DANNIE
                        Yeah, he's staying for dinner.

                                 KEVIN
                        Alright. Well, uh--
                               (beat, deep breath)
                        --You know how I’ve talked off and on
                        about enlisting?
                                 DANNIE
                        Yeah...

                                 KEVIN
                        I signed up.

                                 DANNIE
                               (beat)
                        Kevin, have you really thought this--

                                 KEVIN
                        --You know I wouldn't rush into it.

                                 DANNIE
                        I know. I just-- what did Pat say?

           A long, pregnant pause.

                                 KEVIN
                        Mom... Pat’s joining, too.

           Dannie goes white. Looks over to Mike. Their eyes meet. He
           already knows.

                                 KEVIN
                        Here. I’m putting him on.

           Dannie nods as though Kevin can see her through the phone.

           Mike places a chair behind Dannie -- gently nudges her to
           sit before her knees buckle.

           Pat hops on the line, a tenderness in his voice--

                                 PAT
                        I’m sorry we had to tell you over the
                        phone, ma. We were gonna do it in
                        person after Marie and I got back from
                        our honeymoon, but we didn't want you
                        finding out from a newspaper.

                                 DANNIE
                        What about Marie? What did she say
                        about this?

                                 PAT
                        We've talked it through. A lot. She's
                        been a fucking rock star. And you
                        know Kevin and me. We did our
                        research. We drove out to Utah and
                        met with a special forces guy. He
                        answered all our questions.
                                 PAT (cont'd)
                               (beat)
                        You there?

                                 DANNIE
                        I don’t know what to say right now.

                                 PAT
                        We'll talk when we get back from Bora
                        Bora. OK?

                                 DANNIE
                        OK.

                                 PAT
                        Happy Mother's Day. I love you, ma.

                                 DANNIE
                        I love you too, Pat.

           Click.

           Off Dannie holding the phone and still trying to process--

           EXT. BEACH - BORA BORA - DAY

           Pat and Marie lay out on the beach reading books and soaking
           in skin cancer. Pat highlights a passage in Ralph Waldo
           Emerson's Self-Reliance while Marie turns the page on John
           Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven.

           Something in the distance captures Pat's attention.

                                 PAT
                        We should do that.

                                 MARIE
                               (eyes tilting up)
                        You are fucking crazy.

           ANGLE ON -- Kite surfers glide along the ocean waves.

                                 PAT
                        What?

                                 MARIE
                        That's all you.

                                 PAT
                        You wouldn't do it?

                                 MARIE
                        Hell no.
                                 PAT
                        What's life without adventure?

                                 MARIE
                        A safe one.

                                 PAT
                        What's fun about being safe?

                                 MARIE
                        What's fun about getting hurt?

                                 PAT
                        The world belongs to the energetic,
                        Mrs. Tillman.

                                 MARIE
                               (nodding to his book)
                        Emerson?
                               (re: his grin)
                        You're such a nerd.

                                 PAT
                        Whatever gets you going.

                                 MARIE
                        Well right now, what gets me going is
                        laying on the beach. I'm fine right here.

                                 PAT
                        You're fine wherever you are.

           He rolls over for a kiss. She lets him. Flawless execution.

           EXT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A tense cloud hangs over the Tillman and Ugenti families.
           They're gathered around a table, but this isn't a friendly
           dinner. It's an intervention.

           MARIE'S MOTHER, 52, voice as sweet as her cotton candy hair,
           starts off the cross-examination--

                                 MARIE’S MOTHER
                        I'm just curious where this is coming
                        from is all. I've never heard you
                        mention anything about the military.

                                 PAT
                        I didn't want anyone to panic before
                        I had my mind made up.
                                 PAT (cont'd)
                        I just felt it was important for me
                        to make a sacrifice for our country.

                                 MARIE’S MOTHER
                        And what about Marie? She's
                        sacrificed more for you than anyone
                        in this country. Your football
                        career, your long distance
                        relationship, your stint in juvie--

                                 MARIE
                               (gritting teeth)
                        --Mom.

                                 PAT
                        No. She's right. This is without a
                        doubt the biggest test of our
                        relationship. But I wouldn't be doing
                        this without her blessing.

           MARIE'S FATHER, 51, a gym teacher with a domineering
           presence, takes a more pragmatic approach--

                                 MARIE'S FATHER
                        Have you thought about the financial
                        implications? You're passing up
                        millions to make fifty grand a year.

                                 PAT
                        I know this sounds cliche, but money
                        isn't everything. If it was, I
                        would've signed with the Rams.

                                 MARIE'S FATHER
                        Which I still don't understand.

                                 MARIE
                        And you don't have to. It wasn't your
                        decision, dad.

                                 MARIE'S FATHER
                        All I'm saying is, the average NFL
                        career is less than three years, and
                        Pat's already played four. Can't this
                        wait until he retires?

                                 PAT
                        I can always go back. But if I tear
                        an ACL, I can forget about being in
                        the Rangers.
                                 MARIE'S FATHER
                        And if you tear an ACL in the military,
                        you can forget about nine million from
                        the Rams. You'd be lucky to get a
                        contract in the Canadian league.

           Dannie cuts in--

                                 DANNIE
                        Why are you still talking about
                        money? No one is talking about the
                        elephant in the room. War is not
                        sports. Forget injuries, the boys
                        could be killed.

           PATRICK SR., 49, bald power donut and chevron mustache,
           tries extinguishing Dannie's emotional flame--

                                 PATRICK
                        Dannie, just relax.

                                 DANNIE
                        I'm sorry Patrick but even if they
                        come back in one piece, they could
                        end up like Uncle Rich: living on the
                        streets with PTSD.
                               (turns to her sons)
                        What if something happens to one of
                        you? What happens to the one left
                        behind? Or everyone else who cares
                        about you?
                               (to Pat)
                        You just got married!

           Tears well in her eyes. Pat stands and wraps his python arms
           around Dannie to comfort her.

           INT. FRANK BAUER'S OFFICE - DAY

           Outside an office door, a stencil reads Sun West Sports
           Agency. FRANK BAUER, 54, a shark of an agent with slicked-
           back hair, reviews a contract at his desk. His phone beeps--

                                 FRANK'S ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                        Victoria Clarke. Line one.

                                 FRANK
                        Remind me who she is. 49ers?

                                 FRANK'S ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                        Pentagon.
           He glares at the blinking red light. The fuck?

                                 FRANK
                        Put her through.
                               (clicks over)
                        Frank Bauer speaking.

                                 VICTORIA CLARKE (V.O.)
                        Hi Mr. Bauer, this is Victoria
                        Clarke. I work in Public Affairs at
                        the Pentagon, and I'm calling on
                        behalf of Secretary of Defense Donald
                        Rumsfeld about your client--

                                 FRANK
                        --Gonna cut you off right there. I'mma
                        tell you the same thing I told every
                        reporter who's called. Patty's not
                        doing interviews or press. He wants to
                        be treated like everyone else.

                                 VICTORIA CLARKE (V.O.)
                        Oh, no. That's not the reason for my
                        calling. We think it's an admirable
                        thing that he's decided to enlist--

                                 FRANK
                        --Safe to assume we're both very busy
                        people. So let's cut to the chase.

                                 VICTORIA
                        Are you aware that the life expectancy
                        of a Special Forces soldier is seven
                        and a half minutes in battle?

                                 FRANK
                        I wasn't.

                                 VICTORIA CLARKE (V.O.)
                        I'm not here to talk Pat out of
                        joining. We just think his best
                        contribution as a Ranger would be
                        speaking to troops stationed around
                        the globe. To go from a seventh round
                        pick to one of the best safeties in
                        the NFL... it's quite inspiring.

                                 FRANK
                        Hey, you don't have to tell me about
                        it. Been with the kid long before
                        anyone thought he'd even make an NFL
                        roster.
                                 FRANK (cont'd)
                        And because I've known him so long,
                        I'm gonna tell you right now he won't
                        go for that.

                                 VICTORIA CLARKE (V.O.)
                        I trust your judgment, Mr. Bauer. But
                        we'd strongly encourage you to
                        present him the opportunity. It's in
                        everyone's best interest if Pat
                        remains unharmed. Including yours.

           INT. SFO - DEPARTURES - EVENING

           Pat's on the phone, seated at the terminal gate as the rest
           of the passengers board.

                                 PAT
                        I’m not prostituting myself, Frank.

           Kevin smirks as he plays "Snake" on his Nokia brick phone.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        And I'm not trying to pimp you. But
                        anywhere you've gone, you've always
                        said, 'I'll do whatever helps the team.'

                                 PAT
                        And that hasn't changed. But we both
                        know a Rose Bowl story means jack shit
                        to soldiers who've seen combat.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Football is about leadership and
                        teamwork and execution. It's the same
                        thing in the military.

                                 PAT
                        If you make a mistake in football,
                        you go home with a loss and some
                        bruises. If you make a mistake in
                        battle, you go home in a body bag.
                        I'm not going to insult their
                        intelligence like that.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Pentagon doesn't see it that way. They
                        think you can be more valuable without
                        putting your life on the line.

                                 PAT
                        Thousands of people put their lives
                        on the line every day, Frank.
                                 PAT (cont'd)
                        And who am I to think I'm above that?
                        I haven’t done shit.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
                        Attention passengers, last call for
                        Delta Flight 62 to Atlanta.

                                 PAT
                        I gotta go. You know my answer.

           He flips his phone shut.

           EXT. LA JOLLA BLVD - SAN DIEGO - DAY

           UNCLE RICH, 49, unkempt hair and untamed beard, speaks on one
           of the rare pay phones left. Given his hygiene and clothing,
           he's quite obviously homeless.

                                 UNCLE RICH
                        Military's no place for pro athletes.
                        It's filled with pettiness, jealousy.
                        I saw it first hand.

                                                          INTERCUT:

           EXT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Dannie paces around the room on the other end.

                                 DANNIE
                        Rich, things have changed since Vietnam.

                                 UNCLE RICH
                        Like hell it has. Human nature is
                        human nature.
                               (accusatory)
                        I can't believe you let them enlist.

                                 DANNIE
                        Let them? Mike and me and the whole
                        family tried to talk them out of it.

                                 UNCLE RICH
                        Hell of a job, Dan.

           On the mantle, Dannie eyes a black and white photo of her and
           Mike next to Rich in his Marine Dress Blues at USMC graduation.

                                 DANNIE
                        Well you're always welcome to join
                        the conversation, but you haven't
                        exactly been easy to reach lately.
                                 UNCLE RICH
                        Gonna have targets on their backs.
                        And I'm not talking about the enemy.

                                 DANNIE
                        What's that supposed to mean?

                                 UNCLE RICH
                        Society worships celebrity. The
                        military worships conformity. Kevin
                        and Pat are gonna get shit on by
                        every spiteful soldier they meet.

                                 DANNIE
                        You're not helping, Rich.

                                 UNCLE RICH
                        Yeah? Well you aren't, either.

           He slams the receiver down.

           INT. FORT BENNING - BARRACKS - NIGHT

           BOOT CAMP RECRUITS clean rifles, write letters, play cards.
           Pat, head now shaven, lies in bed reading The Book of Mormon.

           PFC. O'NEAL, 19, Tiny Tim with Dumbo ears, takes a seat in
           the adjacent bunk. Notices Pat's reading material. Perks up
           like a nerd invited to the cool kids' table.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        Oh wow. I didn't know you were Mormon, too.

                                 PAT
                        Oh, ah, I'm not. Atheist actually. But I
                        like to hear everyone's point of view.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        Got it. Right on.
                               (awkward beat)
                        Well, let me know if you have any
                        questions.

                                 PAT
                        I will. Thanks.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                        All-Star. You got mail.

           A DRILL INSTRUCTOR, 24, full Napoleonic complex, flings a
           letter in Pat's general direction. It lands on the floor.
                                 PAT
                        Hey, what the fuck?

           The instructor stops cold. Still staring straight ahead--

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                               (purposely loud)
                        I must be hearing things.

           A silence falls over the barracks. All eyes on them.

                                 PAT
                               (doubling down)
                        You didn't have to throw it. Coulda
                        handed it to me or put it on the bed.

           The instructor flashes a sadistic smile.

                                                            CUT TO:

           Pat does one-arm push-ups with his right hand, scrubbing the
           floor with a tooth brush in his left. Judging by the
           fatigue, he's done at least two hundred by now.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                        All the way down.

           He places a perfectly polished combat boot under Pat's chest.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                        Now let's see what was so goddamn
                        special about this letter that you
                        needed it hand delivered.

           He opens the envelope and pulls out a letter, as the rest of
           the recruits stand deadly quiet in formation.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                        'Dear Mr. Tillman, I heard that
                        you’re leaving the National Football
                        League to become an Army Ranger; it
                        is a proud and patriotic thing that
                        you are doing.'
                               (beat)
                        'With best wishes, Donald Rumsfeld.'
                               (looking around)
                        I never received a letter from the
                        Secretary of Defense when I enlisted.
                        Any of you?

           Not a peep. And if they did, no one would dare say so now.
           The instructor drops the letter to the floor.
                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                               (bending down to whisper)
                        Out in the real world, you might be
                        hot shit. But in boot camp, you are
                        are less than zero. You are dirt. And
                        you will scrub this floor to remind
                        yourself of that fact. Do you
                        understand me, All-Star?

           Pat grits through the pain, arm shaking--

                                 PAT
                        Yes. Drill. Ser. Geant.

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                               (turning head)
                        One more time. Left ear's my good one.

                                 PAT
                        YES DRILL SERGEANT!

                                 DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                               (calmly)
                        Fall out.

           Pat drops to the floor, lactic acid coursing through his
           muscles. As the recruits return to their bunks, Kevin walks
           over to give his brother a hand and some advice--

                                 KEVIN
                               (pulling Pat to his feet)
                        You can't do shit like that, man.

                                 PAT
                        Guy's an asshole.

                                 KEVIN
                        And he outranks you. So get used to
                        shoveling shit.

           He picks up the letter, holds it out for Pat.

                                 PAT
                        Keep it.

           EXT. VARIOUS - DAY/NIGHT

           A succession of quick images and moments take us through the
           intense preparation of--

           SUPER: RANGER INDOCTRINATION PROGRAM
           BENNING PHASE. Burpees. Buddy carries. Belly crawls. Lines of
           four soldiers carry rucksacks and rifles, balancing a giant
           log across their shoulders. Equal parts training and torture.

           Pat lunges left then right in unison with his team as
           they're sprayed with a hose. The freezing cold water washes
           away the dirt, sweat, and blood caked on their pained faces.

           MOUNTAIN PHASE. Steep climbs along rugged hills. Hunger.
           Stress. Sleep deprivation. A soldier nods off against a tree
           to rest. An instructor catches him, screams into a bullhorn
           to wake the poor bastard.

           As Pat battles exhaustion up a fifty foot climbing rope, he
           watches a recruit approach an instructor to quit. Witnessing
           this gives Pat a boost -- he surges on.

           FLORIDA PHASE. War games in jungle-like terrain. Soldiers
           paddle down swampy waters in an inflatable raft.

           Through a torrential downpour, Pat pulls himself across a
           rope bridge in waist-deep water. Wading five feet to his
           left, an alligator stares him down like an appetizer.

                                                         MATCH CUT:

           INT. BRET HARTE JUNIOR HIGH - DANNIE'S CLASSROOM - DAY

           A pet turtle snaps up a cricket inside a glass tank.

           Dannie is mid-lesson, drawing a diagram on the chalkboard.
           Though most students would be comatose in civics class,
           Dannie's passion keeps them engaged.

                                 DANNIE
                        The President is part of the
                        executive branch. And his job is to
                        approve or reject the laws passed by
                        the legislative branch. And the
                        judicial branch decides whether those
                        laws are allowed to be enforced. 

           LINDSAY, 12, teacher's pet, raises a hand in the front row.

                                 DANNIE
                               (pointing)
                        Yes?

                                 LINDSAY
                               (deadly serious)
                        My dad says President Bush can do
                        whatever he wants.
           The students laugh. Lindsay slinks a little in her chair.

                                 DANNIE
                        That's an interesting point, Lindsay.
                        I'm glad you brought it up. Because
                        even after declaring independence from
                        Great Britain, some of the founding
                        fathers wanted to install a monarchy in
                        America. Replacing one king with
                        another. So we could've had King George
                        Washington instead.
                               (re: shocked faces)
                        Surprising, right? Luckily, the founding
                        fathers decided on a system which
                        separates power and prevents any one
                        person from attaining too much of it. So
                        the judicial, legislative, and executive
                        branches act independently to keep the
                        others in check. Which is why we refer
                        to it as 'checks and balances.'

           Head nods from the students. Makes sense.

                                 DANNIE
                        And two hundred plus years later, that
                        same system is still in place today.

           EXT. FORT BENNING - HURLEY HILL - DAY

           Emerging through WHITE SMOKE, fresh RANGER GRADUATES, in
           fatigues and tan berets, march in formation.

           Sitting in the bleachers with the other families, the
           Tillmans search for Pat and Kevin. Nearly every soldier is
           indiscernible from the next -- just as the Army intended.

           They finally spot the Tillman brothers -- wave excitedly.

           EXT. FORT BENNING - HURLEY HILL - LATER

           The graduates greet family and friends after the ceremony, a
           mixture of smiles, hugs, and joyful tears.

           Pat and Marie spot each other through the crowd -- make a
           beeline for one another. Pat lifts her in the air as they
           kiss, knocking off his beret in the process.

                                 MARIE
                               (patting his buzz cut)
                        Oh my god. Your hair.
                                 PAT
                        I missed you, too.

                                 MARIE
                        I just need a moment to mourn the
                        loss. It was like ninety-percent of
                        your personality.

                                 PAT
                        What's the other ten percent?

                                 MARIE
                               (kisses him deeply)
                        That.

           He puts her back on the ground.

                                 PAT
                        Oh, before I forget.

           He reaches in his pocket. Hands her a folded sheet of paper.

                                 PAT
                        Had to sneak this out.

           She opens it. Reads. Realizes what it is.

                                 MARIE
                        Pat, I don’t want to think about this
                        right now...

                                 PAT
                        I know. But I need you to have a
                        copy. Just in case.

                                 DANNIE (O.S.)
                        Smile!

           They turn as Dannie snaps a photo of their now dour
           expressions. Perfect timing.

           OVER BLACK

                                 MARIE (V.O.)
                        Ready?

           EXT. TACOMA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Marie removes her hands from Pat and Kevin's eyes to reveal
           a cream-colored cottage decorated with Christmas lights.
                                 MARIE
                        Welcome home.

           Pat and Kevin take it in for a few beats.

                                 MARIE
                        So?

                                 KEVIN
                        Wow.

                                 PAT
                        It'll do.

                                 MARIE
                        It'll do?? I guess you prefer
                        sleeping outside tonight.

           She darts up the pathway. Pat chases after her. Marie opens
           the front door and locks it behind her. She smiles
           tauntingly through the front door window.

                                 PAT
                        Very funny. It's supposed to rain
                        tonight.

                                 MARIE
                        Isn't that what you trained for, Mr.
                        Big Bad Ranger?

                                 PAT
                        You're evil.

                                 MARIE
                        I know.

           Having had her fun, she finally unlocks the door.

                                 MARIE
                        I wouldn't have been able to sleep
                        listening to you cry all night.

                                 PAT
                        Who said anything about sleep?

           He drops his bag -- lifts her up, begins carrying her.

                                 PAT
                        Wait... where's the bedroom?

           Marie laughs, points the opposite direction. Pat changes
           course. Back on track.
           INT. TACOMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           The Tillman family is gathered around the Christmas tree,
           surrounded by shreds of wrapping paper and boxes.

           Pat, in a cheesy Christmas sweater, pulls a small gift out
           of his stocking. Unwraps it to find a black Moleskine
           notebook. Sorts through the blank pages.

                                 MARIE
                        Figured you could journal while
                        you're in Afghanistan.

                                 PAT
                               (kisses her)
                        Thanks, babe.
                               (then)
                        Assuming we deploy there, of course.

                                 DANNIE
                        Why, what are you hearing?

                                 PAT
                        Just reading the tea leaves.

                                 DANNIE
                        Iraq?

                                 PAT
                        Sixty-percent of Americans want to invade.

                                 DANNIE
                        Because sixty-percent of Americans
                        think Saddam was involved with 9/11.

                                 PAT
                        Bush isn't exactly helping to dispel
                        that myth.

           Kevin pulls a candy cane out of his mouth--

                                 KEVIN
                        I don't see it. No way we go into
                        Iraq with Bin Laden still out there.

                                                         SMASH CUT:

           INT./EXT. TALLIL AIRFIELD - NIGHT

           In the distance, explosions illuminate the sky courtesy of
           'shock and awe.'
           SUPER: 01 APRIL 2003. TALLIL AIRFIELD, IRAQ.

           Inside a billet (military tent), soldiers blast music, lift
           weights, and hold grappling contests. Anything to take their
           minds off the monotony.

           SPC. BAER (pronounced bear), 23, hazel eyes, bushy brows,
           hovers over Pat's bed, watching him write in his Moleskine.

                                 SPC. BAER
                        I wouldn't do that.

           Pat shuts his notebook startled by Baer's eavesdropping.

                                 PAT
                        What, reading and writing? You should
                        try it sometime.

                                 SPC. BAER
                        It's bad luck to write letters before
                        a mission.

           A few feet away, Kevin and STEVE WHITE, 33, Luke Wilson's
           ripped Navy SEAL doppelganger, lounge in camping chairs.

                                 KEVIN
                        Why what'd you hear?

                                 WHITE
                        That we had to wait for the PsyOps
                        camera crew.

                                 KEVIN
                        Bullshit.

                                 WHITE
                        Came straight from my team leader.

           Pat licks an envelope shut. Scrawls "MARIE" on the front.

                                 PAT
                               (to Kevin)
                        You sound surprised, Nub. Pretty
                        blonde damsel in distress? That's
                        ratings gold right there.

                                 KEVIN
                        You really believe that tin foil
                        fuckery?

                                 PAT
                        It's not tin foil if it's true.
                                 KEVIN
                        You'd have to be the world's biggest
                        cynic to believe they'd delay a rescue
                        op just to capture it on video.

                                 PAT
                        They lied about WMDS to justify the
                        invasion of a sovereign country, and
                        this is the detail you're hung up on?

           SGT. PARSONS, 24, blue collar, red neck, folds his poker
           hand to add his two-cents--

                                 SGT. PARSONS
                        Man, fuck WMDs. The Hajjis are better
                        off without Saddam. You see them
                        waving to us?

                                 PAT
                        Saddam is a piece of shit. But he's
                        just one turd in the world's toilet
                        bowl. Not our job to flush 'em all.

                                 SGT. PARSONS
                        Shit, you're something else, Till.
                        Never met an anti-war Ranger.

                                 PAT
                        I'm not anti-war. I'm anti-this war.
                        I signed up to fight in Afghanistan.

           LT. UTHLAUT, 25, a West Point Wunderkind with a crooked
           nose, pops into the tent to give an order--

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        Gear up, gentleman. Operation's a go.

                                 SGT. PARSONS
                        Lieutenant, we actually gonna fuck or
                        what? After last night, my dick can't
                        handle all this teasing.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        I'm sure I'm not the first one to
                        tell you this, but you'll have to
                        keep your dick in your pants tonight,
                        Parsons. We're on backup duty.

           Groans from the soldiers. Battlefield blue balls.
                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                               (to the platoon)
                        Hey, I don't make the orders. I just
                        relay 'em.

                                 SPC. BAER
                               (to Pat)
                        Told you that letter was bad luck.

           With the bad news delivered, Uthlaut turns to leave.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey L.T., why didn't we run rescue op
                        for Lynch last night?

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                               (turns around)
                        Because she's the star of the movie,
                        and they weren't ready for her closeup.

           White eyes Kevin. Believe me now?

           ARCHIVE FOOTAGE - VARIOUS

           News broadcasts from around the world play grainy night-
           vision footage of the JESSICA LYNCH RESCUE MISSION. For the
           past week, Americans have been enraptured by the Lynch
           story, the pretty brave soldier captured behind enemy lines.

           Inside a CHINOOK HELICOPTER, Lynch is secured to a gurney, a
           bunched up American flag resting on her chest.

           As medics tend to Lynch, a soldier off camera asks her to
           look into the camera and smile. She squeezes out one like a
           first grader on portrait day.

           Now safely home, Lynch wears her uniform in the back of a
           convertible in small town America -- on full display for the
           homegrown patriots snapping photos and waving flags.

           EXT. TACOMA HOUSE - DECK - EVENING

           The blood orange sky reflects off Puget Sound as Pat and
           agent Frank Bauer sip beers and watch the sun fall behind
           the Olympia Mountains.

                                 FRANK
                        Nothing like this over there.

           Pat lifts his beer -- he'll drink to that. So he does.
                                 FRANK
                        Sign with the Seahawks, and you could
                        come home to this every day.

                                 PAT
                        If they still want me next year.

                                 FRANK
                        I'm not talking about next year.

           Pat turns to him. He's got his undivided attention now.

                                 FRANK
                        Their GM found a loophole. Since you
                        volunteered and already served in
                        battle, you can get out. Right now.
                        No more Iraq. No more deployments. No
                        more bullshit.
                               (then)
                        You can join the team next month in
                        time for offseason workouts.

           A beat as he lets Pat mull over the offer.

                                 FRANK
                        It's what you wanted, isn't it?

                                 PAT
                        Yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        Then let me handle it. Just say the
                        word.

                                 PAT
                        I can't.

                                 FRANK
                        What do you mean, you can't? I just
                        sat here and listened to you bitch for
                        an hour about Iraq. I'm giving you an
                        out here, Patty.

           Marie ducks her head outside.

                                 MARIE
                        I need you to put the food on.

                                 PAT
                        Right now?

                                 MARIE
                        No. Ten minutes ago.
           She ducks back inside.

                                 FRANK
                               (re: Marie)
                        See, you're already derelict of duty.

                                 PAT
                               (stands; drains beer)
                        Regardless of my personal feelings on
                        our country's foreign policy, it
                        wouldn't be right to turn my back on
                        my platoon. None of them have the
                        option to leave early. I shouldn't be
                        treated any differently.

           He collects Frank's empty bottle. Heads in.

           EXT. TACOMA HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Pat rotates hot dogs on the grill as friends and family
           mingle and drink.

           RICHARD TILLMAN, 23, forehead bangs and lacking an internal
           filter, steps outside to loudly announce--

                                 RICHARD
                        Yo Pat, you got a plunger? Toilet's
                        clogged. There's shit water
                        everywhere.

                                 PAT
                        Goddamn it, Rich.

           Marie slams down a pitcher of lemonade. Marches inside. All
           take notice -- everyone suddenly on eggshells.

           INT. TACOMA HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Pat and Marie are mid-argument but keep their voices low.

                                 PAT
                        What's going on? You're acting like a
                        lunatic today.

                                 MARIE
                        I've been playing host for a fucking
                        week straight. Why can't they stay in a
                        hotel? I'll pay for it myself.

                                 PAT
                        They're my family. What do you want
                        me to do, tell them to fuck off?
                                 MARIE
                        No, that's not what I'm saying. I
                        wanted to spend time with you. Alone.
                        No Kevin, no parents, no one else.

                                 PAT
                        We'll make time. Everyone just wants
                        to see us before we deploy again.

                                 MARIE
                        Frank told me about the Seahawks.

           Pat nods. So that's what this is about.

                                 PAT
                        You know I can't just leave--

                                 MARIE
                        --I would never ask you to.
                               (beat)
                        But what's our plan once you're out?
                        Are we gonna move again? Do I have to
                        find a new job? Make new friends?
                        Some stability would be nice. I
                        actually like it here.

           Off Pat, weight of the world on his shoulders--

           EXT. TACOMA HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATER

           As the Tillmans clean up after dinner, Frank tosses empty
           beer bottles into a recycling bin.

                                 PAT (O.S.)
                        I wanna play football again--

           Frank turns to him, trying to hide his excitement.

                                 PAT
                        --After I finish this tour.

           Not the answer Frank was expecting to hear--

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. Sure.

                                 PAT
                        I know you're pissed at me right now,
                        but would you be up to represent me
                        when I'm back?
                                 FRANK
                        Patty, I've been a sports agent for
                        twenty-five years. I've never had a
                        client turn down millions of dollars
                        out of loyalty. If I left you now,
                        what does that say about me? Come on,
                        that's not even a question.

           He pulls Pat in for a hug.

           INT. TACOMA HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Marie enters the room in a towel, watching Pat sleep. She
           walks over and crawls under the covers, careful not to disturb
           him. As she lays her head on Pat's chest, he stirs awake--

                                 PAT
                        Mm. You're gonna be late.

                                 MARIE
                        I called in sick.

           He flips over and wraps his arms around her.

                                 PAT
                        Good. Fuck work.

           He nuzzles against her as they drift back to sleep.

           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRLINER - COACH - MOVING - NIGHT

           Dannie fidgets in the window seat, her body as restless as her
           mind. She turns finally to Uncle Mike next to her--

                                 DANNIE
                        When was the last time you heard from
                        Rich?

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                               (shrugging)
                        Sometime last year. Been a while.

                                 DANNIE
                        I don't know why he refuses to check in.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        I don't know why he does anything.

                                 DANNIE
                        I'm just worried that he could...

           She trails off, unable to complete the thought.
                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        He'll be fine, Dan. Always has.

                                 DANNIE
                        I want to keep him updated on what's
                        happening with the boys. He's still
                        part of the family.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        Yeah, when he wants to be.

           As she stares out the window watching the clouds pass--

                                                         MATCH CUT:

           We push through the night sky as moonlight bathes the snow-
           capped Hindu-Kush peaks which look straight out of an Aspen
           tourism video.

           SUPER: 20 APRIL 2004. KHOST PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN.

           INT. VILLAGE HOME - EVENING

           Pat and Kevin wield M4 rifles as they calmly toss the mud
           hut like prison guards searching a cell for contraband.

                                 PAT
                        I feel like mom when she thought I
                        was hiding a stash.

                                 KEVIN
                        Weed?

                                 PAT
                        Playboy.

                                 KEVIN
                        She ever find anything?

                                 PAT
                        If she did, she never told dad.

                                 KEVIN
                        How do you know?

                                 PAT
                        Because I’m still alive.

           Kevin purses his lips. Good point.
                                 PAT
                        You ever think these raids are just
                        one big self-licking ice cream cone?
                        It's like the drug war. The moment
                        the DEA seize a shipment, there's
                        five more waiting to replace it.

                                 KEVIN
                        I'll gladly keep taking their weapons
                        if it means we prevent an attack.

                                 PAT
                        But nine times out of ten we don't find
                        anything. We just piss 'em off and make
                        'em sympathetic to the Taliban.

           Kevin spots something underneath a pile of clothes. Peels
           them away to find a ceramic container. Twists off the lid.

                                 KEVIN
                               (sniffs)
                        Speak of the devil’s lettuce.

           He pulls out a marijuana bud the size of a pine cone.

                                 PAT
                        Just say no.

                        Only the kind that causes munchies.

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Alright, hat up. We're Oscar Mike.

           EXT. KHOST PROVINCE - MOVING - NIGHT

           A convoy of SEVEN HUMVEES and FOUR HILUX TRUCKS travel
           southbound on KANDAHAR HIGHWAY, the only paved road in a
           hundred mile radius.

           This is the BLACK SHEEP PLATOON of the 75TH RANGER REGIMENT.
           INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - SAME

           SPC. ALDERS, 22, a jittery Texan, chomps on a protein bar
           behind the driver seat.

                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        Look, Sarn’t. All I’m saying is I
                        ain't bust my ass through Ranger
                        School to raid Hajji houses.

           To his right, SPC. ELLIOT, 23, dark humor, corrects him.

                                 SPC. ELLIOT
                        Muj mansions. Hajjis are Iraqi.

                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        Man, whatever. Point is, we're just
                        running the same missions. It's feeling
                        like goddamn Groundhog Day out here.

           SGT. BAKER, 27, sturdy and composed, turns around from the
           passenger seat--

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        Is this about chest candy, again?

                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        One firefight. Is that too much to
                        fucking ask?

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        Alders, just buy the fucking badge.

                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        Nah, fuck that. I ain't gon' be no PX
                        Ranger. I earns my badges.

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        Then join the Boy Scouts. They have
                        plenty for you to earns.

           Driving is SGT. SAYRE, 24, a wiry strong wise-ass, and the
           only one with his Night-Vision Goggles (NVGs) flipped down--

                                 SGT. SAYRE
                        Don’t they have a policy against
                        letting gays in?

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        Yeah but he's already used to ‘don’t
                        ask, don’t tell.’
                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        Man, fuck you guys.

           SAYRE’S NIGHT-VISION POV

           BLACKOUT BRAKE LIGHTS FLASH on the Humvee ahead. In seconds
           the entire convoy grinds to a halt.

                                 SGT. SAYRE
                        Ah, shit.

           EXT. KANDAHAR HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Black Sheep Platoon, forty-five Rangers in all, hold a
           security perimeter around the parked vehicles.

           They're joined by 8 soldiers of the Afghan Military Forces
           (AMF). Bearded, in tiger stripe camo, and holding AK-47s,
           they're more Gomer Pyle than GI Joe.

           Lt. Uthlaut stands next to the cause of the stoppage: a
           broken down Humvee, hood up and smoke pouring out.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        How much longer you need?

           The PLATOON MECHANIC looks up from his work--

                                 PLATOON MECHANIC
                        Hour. Two Max.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        Fuck. That. Gonna have every Muj in a
                        ten mile radius on us. Hook it up.
                        We're towing the fucker.

           EXT. EASTERN CANYON - LATER

           A STRAP connects the bumpers of the disabled Humvee and the
           last vehicle in the platoon. The convoy slowly descends down
           a narrow canyon path created more for hiking than driving.

           EXT. BORDER CHECKPOINT 5 - MAIN OUTPOST - DAY

           An AMF outpost fortified by nets, boulders, Hesco barriers.

           SUPER: BORDER CHECKPOINT 5 - NEAR THE PAKISTAN BORDER

           Lt. Uthlaut and his RADIO OPERATOR approach the disabled
           Humvee and address the pair combat boots peeking out.
                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        What’s our status?

                                 PLATOON MECHANIC (O.S.)
                        Fuel pump's FUBAR.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        Fixable?

           The mechanic rolls out from the undercarriage.

                                 PLATOON MECHANIC
                        That’s a negative, Ghost Rider. Need
                        a replacement.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        Shit.
                               (
                                to radio operator)
                        Get TOC on the line and have them
                        send out a pump--

           He stops mid-sentence watching a group of Rangers attempt to
           corner a MOUNTAIN GOAT.

                                 PLATOON MECHANIC
                        Hey, when in Rome...

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        Does that mean they're going to eat
                        it or fuck it?

           Pat carries the frightened animal as it thrashes in his arms.

           EXT. BORDER CHECKPOINT 5 - FIRE PIT - LATER

           FRESH GOAT MEAT rotates on a jerry-rigged spit-roast.

           Pat slices the leg off with his bush knife. Tears a chunk
           out with his teeth. Chews. Passes the rest on.

           PRE-LAP: Squishes and guttural grunts.

           EXT. BORDER CHECKPOINT 5 - FIELD - MIDNIGHT

           Under cover of darkness, Pat, Kevin, and Baer squat in a
           ditch, pants around their ankles. Somehow this scene never
           makes it into recruitment ads.

                                 SPC. BAER
                        It’s 'ram’s revenge.' Black Sheep
                        aren’t supposed to eat our own kind.
                                 PAT
                        Baer, you do realize goats and sheep
                        are different species, right?

                                 KEVIN
                               (
                                groans
                                      )
                        AGHH. Fuck. Feels like I'm exorcising
                        rectal demons.

                                 PAT
                        Maybe that's why they always portray
                        Lucifer as a goat.

           All three burst into laughter. This only increases the pain.

           OUT OF NOWHERE, a CHINOOK SOARS OVERHEAD before hovering
           above the outpost -- lowering cargo pallets by rope.

           EXT. BORDER CHECKPOINT 5 - FIELD - MORNING

           Perched up in the branches of a Kashmir elm tree, Pat
           journals in his Moleskine. Pfc. O'Neal walks up to inquire--

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        Hey Till, mind throwing for us?

           He points to Rangers and AMF soldiers taking turns shot
           putting a chunk of limestone.

                                 PAT
                               (continuing to write)
                        Yeah, gimme a minute.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        Writing the next great American novel?

                                 PAT
                        Just some thoughts on the war.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        You should publish it when you're out.
                        I’m sure more than a few people would love
                        to get inside the mind of Mr. Pat Tillman.

           He makes his back toward the rock throwing contest.

                                 PAT
                               (after him)
                        I'm not who they think I am.
                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                               (turning back)
                        Even more reason to do it.

           EXT. BORDER CHECKPOINT 5 - FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Pat stands behind FARHAD, 24, unibrow and beard, who hurls the
           hefty rock for the AMF team. It lands a foot beyond the stick
           marking first place. The AMF clap in excitement. Farhad smiles.
           A new leader has emerged.

           Pfc. O'Neal retrieves the rock. Drops it behind the starting
           line. Pat's turn. He picks it up. Takes a few steps back.
           Generates forward momentum, and with an effortless heave,
           launches the rock TWENTY FEET BEYOND Farhad's lead. THUD.

           Off Farhad, floored by Pat's feat of superhuman strength--

           EXT. BORDER CHECKPOINT 5 - MAIN OUTPOST - LATER

           The mechanic ratchets a new fuel pump in place. Hops in the
           cab. Turns the key. Nothing. He punches the steering wheel.

           INT. DANNIE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Dannie merges onto the 5 Freeway in her Honda Accord. A road
           sign reads: SAN DIEGO - 415 MILES.

           EXT. MAGARAH - ROAD - MOVING - DAY

           The black sheep convoy is back on the move.

           Kevin mans an MK19 grenade launcher in the turret of the
           last Humvee in the convoy. Behind him, the disabled Humvee
           is once again connected to each bumper.

           CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. RRRRRKKKKKK!

           Kevin whips around to see the FRONT BUMPER YANKED OFF, skipping
           along the road as it's dragged behind. Now untethered, the
           disabled Humvee begins veering off the road.

           INT. FOB SALERNO - TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER - LATER

           Inside a cramped billet, an American flag waves in the
           breeze of an oscillating fan.

           SUPER: FOB SALERNO - TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER.
           Flat screens display maps and live imagery from various
           battlefields as UNIFORMED OFFICERS work on tough book laptops.

           CAPT. SAUNDERS, 25, a yes-man covered in freckles, approaches
           one of these men. He swallows, almost afraid to ask--

                                 CAPT. SAUNDERS
                        Major Hodne, what would you like me
                        to tell Lieutenant Uth--

           MAJ. HODNE, 33, short temper and narrow eyes, spins around--

                                 MAJ. HODNE
                        --Tell Utlaut further mission delays are
                        un-fucking-acceptable. I'm not getting
                        passed up for colonel because he can't
                        handle a busted vehicle. Got it?

           Off Saunders, message received--

           EXT. MAGARAH - SIDE OF THE ROAD - LATER

           As the platoon holds a security perimeter, LOCAL ONLOOKERS
           begin assembling, curious about the sudden military presence.

           Lt. Uthlaut speaks into a SAT PHONE with a terrain map
           splayed on the hood of his Humvee.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        I don't understand why a wrecker
                        can't meet us and tow it.

                                                          INTERCUT:

           INT. FOB SALERNO - TOC - SAME

           Capt. Saunders is at his desk on the other line--

                                 CAPT. SAUNDERS
                        The roads are too rough beyond the
                        rendezvous point.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        Correct. That's why I first requested
                        a helo extraction. We tried towing it
                        and now this piece of shit doesn't
                        have a front bumper.

           Channeling his inner-Hodne, Saunders lays down the law--
                                 CAPT. SAUNDERS
                        Listen, Iraq is daddy's favorite, and
                        Afghanistan is the red-headed step-
                        child. So I don't have a bird to
                        give. But we're Rangers. We make due.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        Hooah.

           EXT. MAGARAH - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Lt. Uthlaut briefs his squad leaders. Based on their body
           language, they are not happy with the news.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                        If it was up to me, we’d just stick
                        some fucking C4 on it and celebrate
                        Fourth of July early. But it isn't,
                        so we're gonna follow orders.

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Why can't the whole platoon drop the
                        Humvee off?

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                               (drawing a long breath)
                        Because we won’t meet TOC's mission
                        timeline.

           Head shakes and grumbles. This is fucked.

           SGT. JACKSON, 25, black with a burgeoning porn 'stache,
           musters the courage to say what no one else will--

                                 SGT. JACKSON
                        So we gotta divide our manpower just
                        so a mustang in an air conditioned
                        tent can check off boxes and get his
                        gold star?

           SGT. GODEC, 24, straight-laced, cleft chin, turns to him--

                                 SGT. GODEC
                        We're all eating the soup sandwich,
                        Jackson. Take a bite. And smile.

           EXT. LA JOLLA - STREET - DAY

           A SERIES OF SHOTS as Dannie places flyers reading "RICH,
           PLEASE CALL ME" on every available telephone pole, electric
           box, and newspaper stand in the bourgeoisie beach community.
           From the corner of her eye, she spots a HOMELESS MAN pushing a
           grocery cart in the opposite direction. She jogs toward him.

                                 DANNIE
                        Rich. Hey, Rich!

           The man turns his head at a crosswalk. Dannie stops. Not him.

           EXT. MAGARAH - COURTYARD - LATER

           The front end of the disabled Humvee is chained to the
           flatbed of a brightly decorated JINGA (picture a Mack truck
           bedazzled by the Grateful Dead).

           An AFGHAN DRIVER stands before Lt. Uthlaut as $20 BILLS are
           counted into his outstretched palm. The driver mumbles in
           Pashto. Uthlaut turns to the AMF INTERPRETER for clarification.

                                 AMF INTERPRETER
                        Says his daughter is very ill.

           Uthlaut shakes his head. It’s probably bullshit, but he
           riffles off another bill because it’s easier than arguing.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT

                        We good?

           The driver gives a thumbs up. Right then, an AFGHAN BOY, 8,
           runs up and hands Uthlaut a note. Points to a VILLAGE ELDER
           sitting on the stoop of his hut.

           EXT. MAGARAH - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Sgt. Godec reads the note as Lt. Uthlaut waits for a verdict.

           The driver and AMF interpreter belt off-key lyrics and at
           the top of their lungs. Seated behind them, Sgt. Jackson
           looks as if he'd prefer an ice pick in his eardrums.

                        How'd he go? Overdose? Suicide?

           He pantomimes a knife to his throat--

           EXT. CANYON FORK - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           The convoy splits at the CANYON FORK. Serial one heads left.
           Serial two, led by the jinga, heads right.

           INT./EXT. JINGA TRUCK - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Serial two creeps along the steep canyon path, one untimely
           sneeze from death.

           The driver STOPS the jinga. Puts it in park. Cuts the engine.

                                 SGT. JACKSON

                        Why are we stopping?

           As they climb, the four hillside hikers are revealed as
           ARMED INSURGENTS carrying AK-47s and RPGs.

           EXT. CANYON FORK - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           The serial two convoy arrives back at the fork to follow the
           same path as serial one into the western canyon.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - WADI PATH - SAME

           On the outskirts of MANAH, serial one vehicles drive by an
           elevated HAMLET dotted with a dozen mud huts.

           The insurgents reach the summit, only to witness serial one exit
           the canyon -- just out of striking distance.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Serial two navigates through the same narrow canyon walls as
           serial one only minutes prior.

           As Kevin’s Humvee winds around a bend--
           EEEEEEEEERRTTT

                        O’Neal, with me!

           He tugs at O'Neal's arm then darts up the hill. Though he
           would struggle to make a JV team, O’Neal manages to keep
           pace with a former NFL star.

           In the midst of the action, all of the AMF soldiers remain in
           the canyon mouth apathetic and unwilling to help. Except one.

           We narrow on the eyes of Farhad, the only one with balls in
           the bunch, as he clocks Pat and O'Neal's climb.

           INT./EXT. JINGA TRUCK - MOVING - SAME

           AK-47 ROUNDS RICOCHET around the jinga as it drives through
           the western canyon. Though in peril, the UNEVEN TERRAIN
           forces serial two to drive no faster than ten miles an hour.

                                 SGT. BAKER
                               (
                                spotting muzzle flashes
                                                       )
                        Tangos -- three o’clock.

           He BUSTS OUT the passenger window with the butt of his M4.
           Glass sprays. The driver curses at Baker in Pashto.

                                 SGT. BAKER
                               (over his shoulder)
                        Just drive. We'll pay for it later!

           Baker returns fire. His team follows suit and unleashes a
           HELLACIOUS BARRAGE from the Humvee following the jinga.

           SPC. ASHPOLE, 23, GI glasses and an itchy trigger finger,
           mans the .50 CAL TURRET firing ammunition belts faster than
           can be fed.

           BRRRT! BRRRT! BRRRT!

           M2 Browning shells cascade onto the roof like a brass waterfall.
           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - BERM - MOMENTS LATER

           Halfway up the berm, the pace of the Rangers slows from the
           steep incline and weight of their gear. Spc. Baer struggles
           more than anyone else, lagging far behind the pack.

                                 PAT
                               (

                                ahead to Weeks, panting
                        Sarge, permission to drop body armor?
                        I can get up quicker without it.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - MOVING - SAME

           SSHHBOOM! A THIRD EXPLOSION followed by more SMALL ARMS FIRE.
           The jinga driver STOPS -- once again blocking the wadi path.

           Inside the trailing Humvee, Baker's team panics.

                                 SGT. SAYRE
                        The fuck’s he doing?

           He lays on the pathetic sounding horn. Beep. Beep. Beeeeeep.

                                 SGT. SAYRE
                        Fucking move!

                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        This is a goddamn death trap.

           Spc. Elliot stops firing his M240--

                                 SPC. ELLIOT
                               (to Alders)
                        Least you can get your badge now.

                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        It'll look great on my fucking corpse.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - BERM - SAME

           Sgt. Weeks and his team arrive at the top of the berm. A
           hundred feet below, Pat and O’Neal take cover behind two
           boulders. Pat spots ENEMIES on the southern ridgeline.

                                 PAT
                               (to O'Neal)
                        Follow my tracers.

           Pat fires his SQUAD AUTOMATIC WEAPON (S.A.W.) as O’Neal does
           the same with his M4.

           In close proximity to them, we hear a TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT.
           Pat whips his head around to the sound of an AK-47. Finds
           Farhad also firing at the southern ridgeline. Their eyes
           meet. Pat nods -- mutual respect between soldiers.

                                 PAT
                        I'll be back. Keep firing!

           He keeps low and scrambles up to Sgt. Weeks’ position.

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        See anything?

                                dropping down
                        Three tangos, two o'clock.

                        Tangos -- two o'clock!
                               (to Pat)
                        You guys squared away?

                                 PAT
                        Yeah. We're taking cover and engaging.

           Weeks tilts up to check Pat's homework. Spots O'Neal and Farhad.

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Alright. Get back to your team.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - HAMLET - SAME

           As the firefight rages on, Lt. Uthlaut and the radio
           operator take cover behind a hut in the middle of the hamlet
           and unpack their gear.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - BERM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sgt. Weeks’ radio crackles to life with FRENETIC CHATTER.

                        Stop stepping on the comms!

           Spc. Baer finally turns up to Weeks’ position.

                                 SPC. BAER
                               (winded)
                        Sorry... I'm dragging ass, Sarge--

           THWACK! THWACK! CRACKS OF GUNFIRE interrupt his apology.

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Get the fuck down!

           As he yanks Baer to the ground--

           KRRRPPPPHH! An EXPLOSION fifty feet to their right. A CLOUD
           OF DUST obscures visibility.

                                 RANGER (O.S.)
                        Indirect!

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Anyone hit?!

           KRRRPPPPHH! A SECOND EXPLOSION in the same vicinity. All but
           Weeks and Baer RETURN FIRE out of instinct.

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                               (shouting)

           They stop.

                        Stop wasting ammo! Ain’t gonna hit
                        shit from here.

           PEEEEEEW!

           A THIRD PROJECTILE whizzes over their heads.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - HAMLET - SAME

           Lt. Uthlaut types on his tough book, with his radio operator
           kneeling to establish a sat phone connection.

           KRRRBOOOOM!

           An EXPLOSION between huts. The SHOCK WAVE knocks them both down.
           As Uthlaut gains his bearings, BLOOD GUSHES from his face.
                                 RADIO OPERATOR
                        You OK?
                               (re: Uthlaut nodding)
                        You sure? You look pretty fucked up.

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                               (teeth coated red)
                        Am I?

                        Yeah. You didn’t feel that?

           Uthlaut touches the tips of his Nomex gloves to his mouth. 
           Surveys the damage. Shit.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - BERM - MOMENTS LATER

           As Farhad trains his fire on the southern ridgeline, a series
           of rounds strike him center mass. He drops. Lifeless.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - HAMLET - MOMENTS LATER

           LT. Uthlaut and the radio operator belly crawl between huts
           in an effort to escape STRAFING ROUNDS.

           SHHNK!

           A BULLET SHREDS the radio operator's knee.

                                 RADIO OPERATOR
                        AHHH! FUUUUCK! FUCK!

           Uthlaut crawls over, grabs the sat phone--

                                 LT. UTHLAUT
                               (shouting)

           At the lower boulders, Pfc. O’Neal lies FACE-DOWN in the dirt,
           covering his head for protection as rounds crack overhead.

           THHNK. THHNK.

           We hear a body hit the dirt.

           Amidst the sonic chaos of battle, the distinct sound of
           running water.
                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                               (eyes still covered)

           Sgt. Baker's Humvee rolls up and parks behind the serial one
           vehicles. With the firefight finally over, an eerie quiet
           fills the canyon.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - BERM - MOMENTS LATER

           In the twilight, Sgt. Weeks makes his way down the berm. We
           hear a lone, distressed voice in the darkness--

                                 PFC. O'NEAL (O.S.)
                        Oh my god! Oh my fucking god!

           Arriving at the boulders, Weeks' worst fears are realized. 

           Pfc. O’Neal, covered head-to-toe in blood, genuflects over
           PAT'S DEAD BODY. He looks up at Weeks--

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        He's fucking dead. They fucking
                        killed him.

           Weeks turns away from the scene to collect himself. Then--

           Kevin stands in the turret of his parked Humvee, oblivious
           to the radio transmission in Sgt. Godec's headset below--

                        Call sign: Tango. Over.

           Godec closes his eyes. Fuck.

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - WADI PATH - MOMENTS LATER

           Through the darkness, Sgt. Weeks approaches a group of
           serial two Rangers wearing NVGs and pulling security detail.
                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Parsons, you have any skedcos in your

                        Uhhh. Think so.

           Kevin overhears them, keeping an eye out from the Humvee turret--

                        Hey Sarge, who got hit?

                        Where would they be?

                        Check in back. Know they definitely
                        got some up there.

           He points to the serial one vehicles parked in the mouth.

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Thanks.

                                 SGT. PARSONS
                        Why?

           Weeks doesn't answer as he makes his way toward the serial
           one vehicles. Seconds later, SPC. AKER, 19, a doe-eyed
           booter, arrives and is careful to whisper his question--

                                 SPC. AKER
                        Hey Sergeant Parsons, do you have any

                        Alright, the fuck’s goin' on?

                                                            CUT TO:

           Parsons and Aker rummage through the back of Kevin's Humvee.

                                 KEVIN
                        Guys need any help?

                                         )
                        AMF?

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - WADI PATH - LATER

           Sgt. Parsons makes his way back to Kevin's Humvee--

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey, where’s Pat?

           --and pretends not to hear Kevin as he climbs inside.

           Parsons turns the ignition. Drives up and parks in the
           canyon mouth. As he exits, Kevin inquires once more--

                                 KEVIN
                        Sarge, where's Pat?

           Parsons continues walking.

                                 KEVIN
                        I asked you a question, Jason.

           Parsons stops. Contemplates for a beat. Walks back toward Kevin
           then makes his way up into the turret with him. A beat.
                                 SGT. PARSONS
                               (hushed)
                        I'm sorry, man. I didn’t wanna be the
                        one to have to tell you...
                               (beat)
                        Your brother's dead.

           Kevin shakes his head. No. Nope. That cannot be true.

                                 KEVIN
                        Why would you say that?

                                 SGT. PARSONS
                        I’m really sorry.

                                 KEVIN
                        Don’t fucking lie to me. Don't
                        fucking--

                                 SGT. PARSONS
                               (forceful)
                        --I'm not lying.

           Kevin glances around, hoping Pat will show up and let him in
           on a cruel practical joke. But no one is laughing. He jumps
           down from the turret with his M4. Begins pacing.

                                 KEVIN
                        Fuck. Fuck!
                               (slams helmet)
                        FUCK!

           Parsons gestures to the PLATOON MEDIC for help. He walks up
           to Kevin, a soothing tone in his voice--

                                 PLATOON MEDIC
                        Kevin...

                                 KEVIN
                        Not now, Doc.

                                 PLATOON MEDIC
                        I know you're upset. But I need your
                        weapon.

           He puts a hand on Kevin's shoulder.

                                 PLATOON MEDIC
                        I'm here for you. I don’t want
                        anything else to happen to you. OK?
                        Think about your family.
                                 KEVIN
                        My fucking family. My fucking family.

                                 PLATOON MEDIC
                        They need you home safe. OK?
                               (beat)
                        I need your weapon. Come on.

           A tense beat.

           Kevin nods.

           The medic slowly lifts the rifle over his head. Once secure, he
           hands it to Parsons, embraces Kevin with a much-needed hug.

           INT. CONSULTING FIRM - MARIE'S CUBICLE - EVENING

           The office has cleared out for the night. Marie packs her
           bag while her FEMALE COWORKER, 27, tatted but tamed by the
           corporate world, leans against her desk.

                                 FEMALE COWORKER
                        You know if you'd been with me, it
                        wouldn't have happened. So
                        technically this is all your fault.

                                 MARIE
                        Somehow I knew you'd blame me.

                                 FEMALE COWORKER
                        Bad things happen when I'm drunk. And
                        single. You know how it is.

                                 MARIE
                        Actually, I wouldn't know how it is.

                                 FEMALE COWORKER
                        Yeah. Yeah. High school sweethearts.
                        Soul mates. Blah, blah, blah. You're
                        so cute I want to vomit.

           A MALE COWORKER approaches them.

                                 MALE COWORKER
                        Um, Marie? There's some people here
                        to see you.

           INT. CONSULTING FIRM - BREAKOUT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie sits alone at a conference table looking out at the
           Space Needle in the Seattle skyline.
           The door swings open. An ARMY MASTER in a Class A uniform
           enters with a CHAPLAIN in tow. Marie gives them a once over.
           This is can't be good.

                                 ARMY MASTER
                        Mrs. Tillman?

                                 MARIE
                        What's going on?

           The chaplain reaches out for her hand.

                                 ARMY MASTER
                        I'm sorry to inform you--

           We dolly out, unable to hear him finish delivering the news.

           INT. FOB SALERNO - TOC - LATER

           Maj. Hodne sits across from a grief-stricken Kevin, hunched
           over in his chair.

                                 MAJ. HODNE
                        Did you see it happen?

           Kevin shakes his head.

                                 MAJ. HODNE
                        Could I get you some water, coffee,
                        food, anything?

           Another head shake.

                                 MAJ. HODNE
                        Alright, well, the chaplain's on his
                        way. I can send him by if you want.

           Kevin finally looks up at him--

                                 KEVIN
                        I need you to make me a promise.
                               (beat)
                        Promise me that we’ll get revenge on
                        the motherfuckers who did this.

                                 MAJ. HODNE
                               (tepid)
                        Of course.

           Good enough. Kevin exits.
           INT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

           Dannie's on the cordless as she puts away groceries.

                                 DANNIE
                        Hey, I just got home and heard your--

                                 MARIE’S BROTHER-IN-LAW (V.O.)
                        --Dannie, hang up and call Marie.

           Click. Uh oh. Dannie dials a number. Rings once before--

                                 MARIE (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 DANNIE
                        Hi, Marie. It’s Dannie. Alex told me
                        to call you. What’s up?
                               (silence)
                        Marie?
                               (still nothing)
                        Marie, what's going on? What’s wrong?

                                 MARIE
                               (
                                numbly
                                      )
                        He’s dead.

                                 DANNIE
                        Dead? Who’s dead?

                                 MARIE
                        Pat.

           Dannie reflexively drops the phone in shock. She staggers out
           to the living room. Grabs a FRAMED PHOTO of Pat. Clutches it
           to her chest. Makes her away outside, wandering aimlessly
           about the front yard.

           As an ELDERLY NEIGHBOR checks the mail, she takes notice--

                                 ELDERLY NEIGHBOR
                        Dannie, what's the matter?
                               (approaching)
                        Is everything alright?

                                 DANNIE
                               (now bawling)
                        My baby. My baby. My baby’s... dead.

           She drops to her knees, rocking back and forth as she
           chillingly repeats the refrain--
                                 DANNIE
                        April 22nd, 2004. April 22nd, 2004.
                        April 22nd, 2004. April 22nd, 2004.

                                                          FADE OUT.

                                                        FADE UP ON:

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - BERM - DAWN

           SGT. FULLER, 32, delicately scoops bits of flesh and skull
           off the boulder into an ammo can. Though his body is built
           for war, his mind can barely handle this gruesome task.

                                 CAPT. SAUNDERS (O.S.)
                        Which asshole assigned you to this?

                                 SGT. FULLER
                        I did.
                               (turning to Saunders)
                        Second platoon’s been through enough.
                        Couldn't make 'em do it.

                                 CAPT. SAUNDERS
                        Hear what happened?

                                 SGT. FULLER
                        Most of it.

                                 CAPT. SAUNDERS
                        Goddamn tragedy is what it is.

           We hear the blades of a helicopter approaching in the distance.

                                 SGT. FULLER
                        Heads are gonna roll.
                               (beat)
                        And shit rolls down hill.

           Off Saunders, suddenly realizing the implication--

           EXT. MANAH - LANDING ZONE - MOMENTS LATER 

           LT. COL. BAILEY, 42, the kind of guy who irons his socks,
           dismounts from a Chinook and is greeted by Capt. Saunders.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Shit.
                               (then)
                        Are you absolutely certain?

                        Affirmative. Every witness on the
                        scene confirmed. But I owe you the
                        details. Let me arrange the 15-6.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Let's hold off on an investigation
                        until I meet with the pope.

           every day: ribeye and scrambled eggs. This is the pope.

           Col. Nixon approaches his table. Before he can utter a word--

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Everyone in third platoon.
                               (beat, thinking)
                        And I imagine a few inside the wire.

           receding hairline fighting a multiple front war, as he pours
           a cup of coffee. Kauzlarich is a man dedicated to god,

                        Yes, sir. But Kevin Tillman said he

                        Well, sir, evidently he and his
                        brother were raised as atheists.

                        From what I understand. Yes.

           Between a row of bunks, Kevin kneels down to a locked trunk
           labeled “P. Tillman." He tries a combination. Tugs. Nothing.
           Another. Same result. Then a third. Click. He sorts through
           the trunk. But whatever he’s searching for isn’t there.

           EXT. FOB SALERNO - RUNWAY - NIGHT

           Kevin and Spc. Baer make their way to a waiting Chinook as
           Maj. Hodne stands by. They salute.

                               (over the blade noise)
                        Got everything?

                                 KEVIN
                        Almost.
                               (then)
                        My brother kept a journal in a small
                        notebook. It’s very important that
                        it’s returned to my family.

                                 MAJ. HODNE
                        We'll find it. Even if it means we
                        have to turn up the entire base.

                                 KEVIN
                        Thank you, sir.

                                 KEVIN
                        I will, sir. Thank you.

           He salutes Hodne again. Climbs aboard. Baer follows behind
           until Hodne places a hand out and stops him cold. He gives
           him a look as if to say, "Don't say a fucking word."

           In the pocket of Pat's cargo pants, he finds the Moleskine.

           Crowding the street, TV CREWS film live remote broadcasts.

           The curtains are pulled shut by Marie's mother. She takes a
           seat on the couch next to her nearly catatonic daughter.

                                 MARIE’S MOTHER
                        They have a word for this. It’s
                        called stalking. But apparently it's
                        not against the law if it's your job.

           RAP. RAP. RAP.

                        Lord Jesus, give me the strength--
           She springs for the door. Throws it open. An abrupt about-
           face... not who she expected.

           Three ARMY OFFICERS stand before her. Hats literally in hand.

                                 SGT. HIGH
                        Hello, ma’am. I’m very sorry to be
                        troubling you. We’re with the
                        Casualty Assistance Office at Fort
                        Lewis. Is Marie Tillman home?

           She turns to Marie who nods her tacit approval. As they
           enter, she gives a DEATH STARE to the media outside.

           Mountains of legal paperwork are stacked on the coffee
           table. As Marie initials here and signs there, her mother
           hands the officers cups of Earl Grey.

                                 SGT. HIGH
                        Thank you.

                                 MARIE
                        When will his body be returned?

                                 SGT. HIGH
                        I was told Kevin will accompany it
                        early next week. And of course you'll
                        have a chance to view him before the
                        military burial.

           Marie nods, but it doesn't quite sit right with her.

                                 MARIE
                        Wait a second, military burial? No,
                        that’s... that's not right. That’s not
                        what Pat wanted.

                                 SGT. HIGH
                               (forceful)
                        No, that is what Pat wanted. That’s
                        the way it’s done.

           Marie gets up, and we follow her to the bedroom. She opens a
           drawer. Rifles through. Finds the folded page Pat gave her
           at graduation. Walks out.

                                 MARIE
                               (handing it to Sgt. High)
                        Clearly it wasn't what he wanted.
           Sgt. High gives it a once over.

                                 MARIE’S MOTHER
                        Marie, what's going on?

                                 MARIE
                        Pat had to sneak out a copy of his
                        burial instructions because he was
                        afraid they'd go against his wishes.
                        That he'd be turned into some kind
                        of... publicity stunt.

           He hands the paper back to Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        I'd like for you to leave now.

                        Where’s the uniform?

                        That’s how we received him.

                                 DR. MALLAK
                        It wasn't with the body?

                        Did they send anything with him?

                        Kevlar are missing?

           The assistant shrugs. You're the one in charge.

           Kevin and Marie stand on the steps of what appears to be a
           dimly lit home. In the front yard, a posted sign reads:

           Dannie, Patrick, Richard, and Uncle Mike approach. Kevin
           greets Dannie first with a hug as they whisper--

                                 KEVIN
                        It's good to see you.

                        Thank you for bringing him home.

           He nods. They break. The rest of the family take turns
           greeting Kevin and Marie with hugs.

                                 KEVIN
                        Thanks for coming, Uncle Mike.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        'Course. Do anything for you boys.

           The MORTUARY DIRECTOR steps outside, greets Patrick first.

                                 MORTUARY DIRECTOR
                        If there’s anything I can do, please
                        don’t hesitate to ask.

                                 PATRICK
                        I’d like to see my son.

                                 MORTUARY DIRECTOR
                        Oh. Well, ah, his body just arrived.
                        I’d like to have some time to prepare--

                                 PATRICK
                        Right now please.

                                 MORTUARY DIRECTOR
                        Yeah. Sure. Ah, would anyone else...?
           He surveys -- Kevin and Marie both shake their heads.

                                 DANNIE
                        I would.

                        Dannie...

                                 DANNIE
                        If Pat was brave enough to risk his
                        life, I need to be brave enough to
                        see him.

           INT. MORTUARY - VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           As Dannie enters clutching Uncle Mike's arm, Patrick and
           Richard stand over Pat's half-opened casket.

           Patrick leans in to hug his son. Dannie turns away and takes
           a seat facing the door. This is proving to be more difficult
           than she imagined.

           Richard whispers a few words to Pat and kisses him on the nose.

           Kevin enters, careful not to look in Pat’s direction, and
           bends down to check on his mother--

                                 KEVIN
                        You OK?

                                 DANNIE
                        Yeah.

                                 KEVIN
                        Remember mom. That isn’t Pat in
                        there. The Pat we knew is gone.

           Dannie nods then stands and steels herself as she approaches.

           Inside the casket, Pat is dressed in a plain white shirt.
           The back of his head wrapped in gauze and plastic. His
           bloated, expressionless face is covered in a wax-like
           substance to conceal the entrance wounds on his forehead.

           Dannie stands over the casket and places a hand on his chest.

                                 DANNIE
                               (smiling weakly)

           Marie's zoned out behind her large sunglasses, no mental

                        I just don't want this to be

                        of the vehicles in Pat’s convoy could
                        not get off. He made the call; he
                        dismounted his troops, taking the
                        fight to the enemy, uphill, to seize
                        the tactical high ground. This gave
                        his brothers in the downed vehicle
                        time to move off that target. He
                        directly saved their lives with that
                        move. Pat sacrificed himself so his
                        brothers could live.

           EXT. MUNICIPAL ROSE GARDEN - LATER

           Dannie, Patrick, and Marie stand across from Spc. Baer and
           TWO SOLDIERS, each holding a tri-folded American flag.

           Baer avoids eye contact as he hands his to Dannie. Sensing
           his unease, she places a comforting hand atop his.

           INT. TACOMA HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An orange and white TABBY CAT purrs beside Marie as she
           tosses and turns in bed. Unable to settle, Marie throws the
           comforter off. Walks to her desk. Pushes papers aside.

           At the bottom of a stack of mail, she finds an ENVELOPE with
           "MARIE" written on the front. The same one Pat wrote before
           the Lynch rescue. She holds it in her hands for a beat,
           unsure whether to proceed.

           She takes a breath then slides her finger through. Removes the
           letter, smoothing the folds in her lap. The page is chock full
           of smudges, scribbles, crossed-out sentences.

                                 PAT (V.O.)
                        It’s difficult to summarize ten years
                        together, my love for you, my hopes
                        for your future, and pretend to be
                        dead all at the same time.

           Though macabre, Marie smiles at this line.

                                 PAT (V.O.)
                               (beat)
                        I simply cannot put all this into
                        words. I’m not ready, willing, or able.

           Her eyes continue scanning the page. Much of the message
           kept secret by Marie -- known only between husband and wife.
                                 PAT (V.O.)
                        Through the years I’ve asked a great
                        deal of you, therefore it should
                        surprise you little that I have
                        another favor to ask.
                               (beat)
                        I ask that you live.

           Marie's stoic facade crumbles. Tears stream down her cheeks, a
           private, cathartic release after holding it together in public.

           INT. BRET HARTE JUNIOR HIGH - DANNIE'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Students excitedly file out with school finally over.
           Lindsay stops by Dannie's desk to offer her solace-- 

                                 LINDSAY
                        I'm sorry about your son, Mrs.
                        Tillman.

                                 DANNIE
                        Thank you.

                                 LINDSAY
                        We're glad to have you back.

           She smiles, hoping it helps. It does.

                                 DANNIE
                        I'm glad to be back.

                                 LINDSAY
                        See you tomorrow.

                                 DANNIE
                        See you tomorrow.

           Off Dannie, watching her go--

           INT. BAER’S GRANDPARENTS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Spc. Baer lounges on the couch flipping through channels. Judging
           by his five o'clock shadow, he hasn't ventured far this week.

           His CELL BUZZES on the coffee table. He picks it up, stares
           at the screen. Six missed calls -- three messages. Punches
           in his voicemail pin. Puts it on speaker.

                                 SGT. MAJ. BIRCH (V.O.)
                        Specialist Baer, this is Sergeant

                        If you don't get your ass back to Fort

                        This is your last fucking warning.

           Baer's GRANDMOTHER, 70s, enters with a tray of sandwiches.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Who was that? He sounded upset.

                                 SPC. BAER
                        Wrong number.

           He flips his cell shut. Tosses it on the table.

           INT. FORT LEWIS - BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Kevin sweeps up behind the CQ desk on graveyard shift in the
           deserted lobby.

           SUPER: 22 MAY 2004. FORT LEWIS - TACOMA, WASHINGTON.

           The Black Sheep Platoon bursts through the door -- joking,
           laughing, ready to get laid after returning from deployment.

           But as soon as they spot Kevin, their enthusiasm wanes.
           Smiles suddenly become silent head nods.

           INT. CONSULTING FIRM - BULLPEN - MORNING

           Marie crosses to her cubicle feeling all attention on her.
           Those who dare make eye contact only give pity-filled stares.

           Laying across her keyboard, a full manila folder is marked
           "Condolences." She might as well be an emotional leper.

                                 FEMALE COWORKER
                        Figured I'd keep it all organized if
                        you ever want to look at that.
                                 MARIE
                        Thanks.

                                 FEMALE COWORKER
                        Come on. Let's grab a coffee.

           INT. FORT LEWIS - BARRACKS - DAY

           Kevin disassembles his M4 rifle as Rangers shoot the shit.

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey Bake, you got any lube?

                                 SGT. BAKER
                                points to rifle
                                               )
                               (
                        For that or--
                               (
                                points to crotch
                                                )
                        --for this?

                                 KEVIN
                        We both know your rifle's the only
                        thing getting action.

           Sgt. Baker snorts. He walks over, hands Kevin a bottle of
           gun lube. Without a hint of humor in his tone--

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        Shit, wish it didn't get action after
                        hitting that AMF.

                                 KEVIN
                        What?

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        On the hill.

           Kevin's still lost. Baker quickly changes the subject--

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        Just leave it on my locker when
                        you're done.

           Off Kevin nodding, still trying to decipher Baker's comment--

           INT. FORT LEWIS - GYM - LATER

           Lt. Col. Bailey runs on a treadmill, watching Spc. Alders
           and Kevin spot Spc. Elliott on bench press. Bailey hits the
           stop button -- dabs his sweaty forehead with a towel.

                                 COL. NIXON (PRE-LAP)
                        You need to keep them apart.
           INT. FORT LEWIS - BAILEY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lt. Col. Bailey's on the phone still in gym clothes.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        How can I separate him from the entire
                        battalion? There's six hundred Rangers.
                        Someone's gonna talk, Colonel.

                                 COL. NIXON (V.O.)
                        Then it's on you.

           INT. FORT LEWIS - FULLER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Across from Sgt. Fuller, Kevin leans forward, elbows on
           knees, racking his brain for some sort of explanation.

                                 KEVIN
                        I don't -- this doesn't make sense.

                                 SGT. FULLER
                        Colonel Bailey will give you all the
                        details tomorrow. But I thought you
                        should know what’s happening.

                                 KEVIN
                               (meekly)
                        Yeah.

                                 SGT. FULLER
                        And I'd hold off telling your family
                        until we have official word.

           Kevin nods.

           INT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Dannie places a letterbox full of student essays on the
           counter. Taps play on the answering machine. BEEP.

                                 BILLY HOUSE (V.O.)
                        Hi, this message is for Dannie
                        Tillman. This is Billy House of the
                        Arizona Republic. I was hoping you
                        could give me a call back.

           A curious expression spreads across her face. Dannie picks
           up the phone. Dials *69. Rings twice.

                                 BILLY HOUSE (V.O.)
                               (answering)
                        Hello?
                                 DANNIE
                        Hi Billy, this is Dannie Tillman
                        returning your call?

                                 BILLY HOUSE (V.O.)
                        Hey, Mrs Tillman. Sorry to bother you before
                        Memorial Day weekend. I just heard from one
                        of my military sources earlier today. And I
                        was calling to confirm the story and get
                        your thoughts on the news.

                                 DANNIE
                        On what news, exactly?

                                 BILLY HOUSE (V.O.)
                        The Army hasn’t told you?

                                 DANNIE
                        Told me what? What are you talking
                        about?

                                 BILLY HOUSE (V.O.)
                        That Pat may have been killed from
                        friendly fire.

           All of Dannie's emotional scars are ripped wide open.

                                 BILLY HOUSE (V.O.)
                               (a long silent beat)
                        Hello? Mrs. Tillman?

           INT. FORT BRAGG - PRESS ROOM - DAY

           Lt. Gen. Kensinger, from Pat's funeral, stands at a lectern
           in front of a sparse gathering of MEDIA. Dance recitals
           attract bigger crowds.

                                 LT. GEN. KENSINGER
                        Good morning. I would like to make a
                        brief statement on the events
                        surrounding the death of Corporal Pat
                        Tillman on the 22nd of April in
                        Afghanistan. I will not be taking
                        questions.
                               (then)
                        A military investigation by U.S.
                        Central Command into the circumstances
                        of the April 22nd death of Corporal
                        Patrick Tillman is complete.
                                 LT. GEN. KENSINGER (cont'd)
                        While there was no one specific finding
                        of fault, the investigation results
                        indicate that Corporal Tillman probably
                        died as a result of friendly fire while
                        his unit was engaged in combat with
                        enemy forces. We regret the loss of
                        life resulting from this tragic
                        accident. Our thoughts and our prayers
                        remain with the Tillman family. Thank
                        you all for being here this morning.

           He immediately exits stage right leaving a trail of
           unanswered questions in his wake.

           EXT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

           An economy rental pulls up and parks in the driveway. 

           Lt. Col. Bailey gets out driver-side, smoothing the creases
           of his Class A uniform. As Richard opens the passenger door,
           he's greeted by Dannie.

                                 DANNIE
                        Where's Kevin?

                                 RICHARD
                        He'll be here later. Wanted to stay
                        with dad for a bit.

           Bailey sticks out a hand for Dannie.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        You must be Mrs. Tillman. Richard
                        told me all about you on the ride
                        over. Lieutenant Colonel Bailey.

                                 DANNIE
                        Nice to meet you, Colonel. I just
                        wish it were under different
                        circumstances. Please come inside.

           INT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Lt. Col. Bailey is surrounded by Dannie, Marie, Richard, and
           Uncle Mike at the dining room table.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        First, I want to apologize for how you
                        all had to learn about this. That was
                        never the Army's intention.
                                 LT. COL. BAILEY (cont'd)
                        I visited the area the day after Pat's
                        death and was certain it was fratricide,
                        but no one wanted to say anything until
                        we conducted a thorough investigation.
                        So until that report is final, this is
                        an unofficial briefing.

                                 DANNIE
                        That's fine, Colonel. I just want
                        know to what happened to my son.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        Absolutely. 
                               (then)
                        Do you happen to have a piece of paper?

           Dannie gets up -- grabs a few sheets from the printer tray.
           Hands them to Bailey. He removes a pen from his shirt
           pocket. Clicks it. Draws a circle.

                                                         MATCH CUT:

           EXT. WESTERN CANYON - WADI PATH - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

           The wheels of the jinga slow to a stop beside the retaining
           wall of a terraced opium field. Seconds later, Baker's
           Humvee emerges out of the canyon and parks behind the truck.

           Sgt. Baker hops out of the jinga -- FIRES his M4 up the
           berm. His team exits the Humvee and follows his lead.

           Pat and Pfc. O'Neal take cover behind the boulders under a
           HAIL OF BULLETS -- coming from Baker and his team.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        They’re fucking shooting at us!

           Pat frantically waves his arm over his head--

                                 PAT
                        Hey! We’re friendly! Cease fire!
                        Cease fire!

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        Cease fire! Cease fire!

           The firing halts. Baker and his team fall back to their
           vehicle as they reload. The Humvee starts up, accelerates
           around the jinga and up the wadi path.

           On the berm, Farhad resumes firing at the southern ridgeline.
           INT. BAKER'S HUMVEE - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

           From the passenger seat, SGT. Baker brings an eye to his scope.
           Time slows as Farhad's MUZZLE FLASHES burst from his AK-47.

           TAT.     TAT.     TAT.

           Baker squeezes the trigger.

           POP.     POP.     POP.     POP.     POP.

           Back to real speed. Farhad collapses. Fatally wounded.

                                 SPC. ALDERS
                        Woo! Get some, Sarge!

           SPC. JOHNSON, 22, bullnecked, lobs a grenade from his M203.
           PHOONK. We track it up the berm as it EXPLODES, pinning down
           Sgt. Weeks' team.

                                 RANGER (O.S.)
                        Indirect!

                                 SGT. WEEKS
                        Anyone hit!?

           Johnson's second grenade EXPLODES nearby.

           Still driving, Baker's men orient their fire back on the
           boulders. Pat and Pfc. O’Neal lie prone as debris kicks up
           around them. Rounds CRACK overhead like the end of a whip.

           THWACK-THWACK-THWACK

           O’Neal throws his M4 down -- curls into the fetal position.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                        Dear God, please help us out of this
                        situation. I promise I will serve you
                        every day of my life.

                                 PAT
                        O’Neal, quit fucking praying and
                        focus! God can’t help you now. I
                        don’t need you going off into la la
                        land getting killed.

           He looks over at Farhad's body -- he has to do something.

           As chunks of boulder pelt him, Pat lifts a pouch on his
           tactical vest. Removes a METAL CANISTER. Yanks the pin.
           POW! A PURPLE STREAM BLASTS from the bottom of his smoke
           grenade. Pat props himself up -- launches it into the wadi
           path. A LAVENDER CLOUD BILLOWS in the wind.

           A beat.

           Firing halts.

                               (
                                        )
                                 PAT
                                relieved
                        Goddamn. What the fuck?

           Pat gets up on a knee to see what the hell went wrong. As he
           does, an S.A.W. UNLOADS on his position.

           SSSNK. SSSNK.

           Pat is DROPPED on his ass. He moans in pain -- inspects the
           damage. GREEN MARKINGS encircle TWO BULLET HOLES center
           mass. Stopped by his body armor.

                                 PAT
                        Thank you, Sergeant Weeks.
                               (groaning)
                        Son of a fucking bitch.

           Another pause in fire. Pat SITS UP on his haunches; pissed,
           hurt, and feeling helpless--

                                 PAT
                        The fuck are you shooting at!? I’m
                        Pat Tillman! I'M PAT FUCKING TILLMAN!

           PINK MIST SPRAYS out the back of his head from rounds striking
           his forehead. His legs cave instantly.

           Once more, we hear the sound of running water.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL (O.S.)
                        Did you just piss yourself, Till?

           O'Neal looks up to find BLOOD STREAMING down the boulder like
           rain from a gutter. He checks himself. Everything in place. We
           stay on O'Neal, finally seeing the carnage of Pat's dead body.

                                 PFC. O'NEAL
                               (screaming)
                        Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What the fuck. HELP!
                        HELP! HELP!
           INT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING (PRESENT)

           A stillness hangs over the Tillmans, now joined by Kevin.    
           Lt. Col. Bailey clicks his pen and tucks it in his pocket.

                                 DANNIE
                        Help me understand something,
                        Colonel. Why couldn’t they leave the
                        Humvee on the side of the road to be
                        picked up later?

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        Ma’am, they couldn’t leave the
                        vehicle. Locals could get on it and
                        take pictures. Then use those pictures
                        for propaganda. Which wouldn’t look
                        good for the military.

                                 DANNIE
                        So pictures on Humvees don't look good
                        but friendly fire does?

           Bailey says nothing. Point made.

                                 DANNIE
                        Why wasn't it airlifted? Or
                        destroyed? Kevin said a lot of the
                        Rangers wanted to blow it up.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        That goes against Army policy, ma’am.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        Why wouldn’t the officers at Salerno
                        listen to the lieutenant in the
                        field? It seems like he knew the
                        situation best.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        Well, as it turns out, Lieutenant
                        Uthlaut misunderstood the orders. He was
                        to have troops in the Manah by dawn. Not
                        dusk. The TOC commander didn’t realize
                        Uthlaut heard it that way.

                                 DANNIE
                        What about military time? Kevin and
                        Pat referred to military time when
                        they talked about, I don't know,
                        going to breakfast. Or to a movie.
                        Why weren't they using military time?
                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        I'm not sure, ma'am.

           Dannie leans back. One part anger, one part exasperation.

                                 MARIE
                        Colonel, what would you want your
                        wife to do if this happened to you?

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        I would hope she'd realize mistakes
                        happen in battle. In my view,
                        Lieutenant Uthlaut should have had more
                        control of the situation. And I'm
                        disgusted by Sergeant Baker, who in my
                        mind, is very much to blame. He was in
                        charge of that vehicle, and he allowed
                        his men to lose trigger discipline.
                               (then)
                        I will make sure the people responsible
                        for Pat’s death are punished. But a lot
                        of mistakes were made, and everyone in
                        the platoon bears responsibility for
                        what happened.

           Kevin looks hurt as though guilty by association.

                                 DANNIE
                               (re: Kevin's reaction)
                        Five vehicles of soldiers didn't
                        shoot at the men trying to help them.
                        How can the entire platoon be
                        responsible?

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                               (contrite)
                        Yes, ma’am.

           EXT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - EVENING

           As Lt. Col. Bailey's car reverses out of the driveway, the
           Tillmans are gathered around the fire pit deliberating.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        Anyone find it strange he was wearing
                        his uniform for an unofficial
                        briefing?
                                 RICHARD
                        I'll tell you what's more strange.
                        After listening to this bullshit at
                        dad’s, I told Bailey on the way over
                        here, ‘I don’t care what anyone says, I
                        think my brother was fucking murdered.’

           He takes a long drag from his cigarette.

                                 KEVIN
                        What’d he say?

                                 RICHARD
                               (exhaling)
                        He said, ‘You may be right.'

           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRLINER - COACH - DAY

           Dannie sits in the aisle seat beside Patrick and Uncle Mike.
           Across from her, a TODDLER pushes a toy plane on the seatback
           tray. A dead-ringer for a young Pat. He looks up at Dannie
           making airplane sound effects as he plays.

           INT. FORT LEWIS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           While Lt. Col. Bailey fires up a decades old projector, Col.
           Nixon hands out a stapled packet of PowerPoint slides to the
           Tillmans. Patrick flicks through the pages with skepticism--

                                 PATRICK
                        What's this? Where’s the official
                        narrative report?

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        It's, ah, not ready to be distributed
                        quite yet.

                                 PATRICK
                        When I requested it last month, I was
                        told it would be ready today.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        I do apologize for that.
                               (flips lights off)
                        Before we begin, I want to start by
                        saying I made some errors in the
                        briefings I gave you prior. So I'd
                        like to clarify a few points. First,
                        Sergeant Baker actually did not get
                        out of the vehicle. In fact, the
                        vehicle never stopped.
                                 LT. COL. BAILEY (cont'd)
                        Second, when the Humvee exited the
                        canyon, Baker saw the Afghan soldier
                        in prone position, not standing. And,
                        thinking he was the enemy, shot him.
                        The other soldiers, following their
                        squad leader, fired up the berm.
                        Wounding Lieutenant Uthlaut and
                        Specialist Lane and killing Corporal
                        Tillman. And lastly, visibility was
                        not as good as originally believed.

                                 PATRICK
                        Wait a second. You told me light
                        conditions were good because you
                        walked the site the day after.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        As I mentioned, there were some
                        errors in my initial debrief. The
                        soldiers who were present that day
                        stated visibility was poor.

           Off Dannie and Marie giving each other a sideways glance--

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           The final slide "Q&A" is pulled up behind Lt. Col. Bailey.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        What about the lull in fire? Pat
                        wouldn’t come out from behind the
                        rock while they were shooting.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        Turns out there was no lull in fire.

                                 DANNIE
                        You said they stopped shooting, so
                        they could reload.

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        Yes, that was also my error, ma’am.

                                 PATRICK
                        So they didn't see the purple smoke
                        grenade?

                                 LT. COL. BAILEY
                        We're told it was actually white
                        smoke. And the Rangers believed it
                        was dust stirred up from rounds
                        hitting the dirt.
                                 DANNIE
                        Wait, dust?? I’ve seen that smoke at
                        Pat and Kevin's graduation. It’s
                        nothing like dust. It's like movie
                        smoke. You can’t miss it.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        When the adrenaline kicks in, it's
                        easy to make those mistakes. There was
                        a lot of chaos happening that day.
                        Have you seen the opening scene in
                        Saving Private Ryan? It was like that.

                                 PATRICK
                               (cutting through the bullshit)
                        Pat didn’t earn the Silver Star.

           An awkward silence fills the room. Dannie shoots daggers
           into her ex-husband. Marie exits the room in disgust.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        I have several Silver Stars, Mr.
                        Tillman. And I can assure you, Pat
                        was far more heroic than I ever was.

                                 DANNIE
                        I think what he means to say, is that
                        you made it suspect giving it to Pat
                        knowing he may have been killed by
                        his own men. The Silver Star isn’t
                        usually given to victims of
                        fratricide is it, Colonel?

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Pat was very heroic out there.

           INT. FORT LEWIS - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The Tillmans huddle up at the end of the hall while Dannie
           and Col. Nixon hang back.

                                 UNCLE MIKE
                        If the vehicle never stopped, how the
                        hell did Baker leave the jinga and get
                        inside? It sounds like horse shit.

           Patrick lays prone on the ground.

                                 PATRICK
                        Tell me how someone on their stomach
                        gets shot in the chest eight times.
                        It's fucking impossible.
           Down the hall, Dannie and Nixon wrap up their chat.

                                 DANNIE
                        I know that's probably an unusual
                        request to make.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        No, not at all. We'll get it to you
                        as soon as possible.

                                 DANNIE
                        Thank you.

           He hands her a business card.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        If you need anything.

                                 DANNIE
                               (staring at the card)
                        Are you taking command?

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Already have. Bailey's been promoted.

           Off Dannie, processing this unexpected development--

           EXT. SUN DEVIL STADIUM - FIELD - DAY

           On the JUMBOTRON, a recorded tribute plays as President Bush
           reads from a teleprompter--

                                 BUSH
                        Pat Tillman loved the game of
                        football. Yet, as much as he loved
                        competing on the field, he loved
                        America even more. Courageous and
                        humble, a loving husband and son, a
                        devoted brother and a fierce defender
                        of liberty. Pat Tillman will always
                        be remembered.

           SUPER: 19 SEPTEMBER 2004. PHOENIX, ARIZONA.

           Arizona and New England fans cheer, wave flags, and hold signs
           like “ARIZONA'S MVP, AMERICA'S HERO” and "TRUE PATRIOT."

           In the upper deck, a group of fans remove a tarp covering a
           section of the Cardinals Ring Of Fame to reveal: 40 PAT TILLMAN.

           The CHEERING CRESCENDOS as photos of Pat dissolve on screen.
           Standing on the sideline, the Tillmans watch through forced
           smiles and bleary eyes. It’s a touching, bittersweet, and
           all-too-public way to mourn Pat's loss.

           INT. US SENATE OFFICE - PHOENIX - DAY

           In a nondescript government lobby, Dannie speaks to a
           SECRETARY behind the front desk.

                                 DANNIE
                        I know it's last minute. But I'm not
                        usually in the area. Figured I'd at
                        least swing by.

                                 SECRETARY
                        I understand, ma'am. But unless you
                        have an appointment--

                                 DANNIE
                        --Could you at least let him know I
                        stopped in?

                                 SECRETARY
                               (grabbing a Post-It note)
                        Sure. Name?

                                 DANNIE
                        Dannie Tillman.

                                 SECRETARY
                        I'll pass it along.

                                 DANNIE
                        Thank you.

           Dannie turns to leave then stops. Spins around.

                                 DANNIE
                        I'm really sorry to ask. Do you have
                        a bathroom I could use?

                                 SECRETARY
                        It's not really open to the public.

                                 DANNIE
                               (trying for levity)
                        Our taxes pay for it right?
                               (then)
                        I wouldn't normally ask. But I'm
                        having...
                               (leans in to whisper)
                        ...issues.
           The secretary nods. Say no more.

                                 SECRETARY
                               (handing her the key)
                        Third door on the left.

           Dannie walks past the secretary into the hallway. Stops at
           the bathroom. Peers over her shoulder -- sees the secretary
           answering the phone -- continues walking.

           INT. MCCAIN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           On the wall, at least twenty framed magazine covers
           featuring John McCain from his 2000 Presidential run.

           JOHN MCCAIN, 68, snow white comb-over, struggles to unbutton
           his navy jacket, arms damaged from years of torture in the
           Hanoi Hilton P.O.W. camp. He leaves it as is. Takes a seat.

                                 JOHN MCCAIN
                        It's too bad Velcro isn't more
                        socially acceptable.

           Across from him, Dannie sits in a leather Queen Anne chair.
           She's not really in the mood for jokes.

                                 DANNIE
                        No judgment.

                                 JOHN MCCAIN
                        I appreciate that. But something tells me
                        you're not here to give fashion advice.

                                 DANNIE
                        Afraid not.
                               (then)
                        I need a copy of Pat's autopsy.

                                 JOHN MCCAIN
                        And given that you're in my office,
                        I'm guessing you've already put in a
                        formal request.

                                 DANNIE
                        Five months ago. And four months ago.
                        And every week since.

                                 JOHN MCCAIN
                        Wow. I know things are slow in
                        Washington, but that seems
                        exceptionally long.
                                 DANNIE
                        I thought so too, but this is new
                        territory for me. I'm not trying to
                        be, but it seems that I've been a
                        thorn in their side.

                                 JOHN MCCAIN
                               (smiling)
                        I've made an entire career out of it.

           The secretary barges in.

                                 SECRETARY
                        I'm really sorry, Senator McCain. She
                        only asked to use the--

           McCain holds a hand up. It's fine. She leaves them be.

                                 JOHN MCCAIN
                               (to Dannie)
                        So what can I do to help?

           INT. BRET HARTE JUNIOR HIGH - FACULTY LOUNGE - MORNING

           While teachers drink coffee and gossip, Dannie opens a FedEx
           envelope and pulls out a packet.

           On the front cover:

           FINAL AUTOPSY EXAMINATION
           Report Name: Tillman, Patrick D.
           Date of Autopsy: 27 APR 2004
           Date of Report: 22 JUL 2004

           Her eyes dart between the dates. Odd. Further down the page--

           “chest contusion... consistent with defibrillation attempt.”

                                 DANNIE
                               (to herself, baffled)
                        Why would he be defibrillated? His
                        head was practically missing!

           Her coworkers stop chatting and stare. Should we go?

           INT. DOVER AFB - DR. MALLAK’S OFFICE - LATER

           Dr. Mallak's on the phone, a copy of Pat's autopsy on his desk.

                                 DR. MALLAK
                        Ma’am, we normally don’t fault people
                        for trying to save someone’s life.
                                                          INTERCUT:

           INT. BRET HARTE JUNIOR HIGH - DANNIE'S CLASSROOM - SAME

           Dannie's on her cell, flipping through the autopsy at her desk--

                                 DANNIE
                        I’m not faulting anyone, Dr. Mallak.
                        I'm just wondering why an attempt was
                        made when he was so clearly gone.

                                 DR. MALLAK
                        The abrasion shape on his chest was
                        interpreted as a mark from a
                        defibrillator. It's possible it wasn't.
                        It could've been from prolonged CPR or
                        other medical treatment.

                                 DANNIE
                        Alright. Thank you for clearing that
                        up for me. Just one last question.
                        Why is the report dated three months
                        after you conducted the autopsy?

                                 DR. MALLAK
                        To be honest ma'am, I didn’t believe
                        the information presented in the
                        casualty report.

                                 DANNIE
                        I'm sorry, what do you mean by that?

                                 DR. MALLAK
                        Well it said your son was killed by
                        enemy fire but enemy rounds don’t
                        cause the wounds your son had.

                                 DANNIE
                        So why didn't you say anything?

                                 DR. MALLAK
                        I did. I refused to sign the Silver
                        Star recommendation and called to
                        stop it.

           Off Dannie, blindsided by this bombshell--

           INT. FORT LEWIS - CORRIDOR - EVENING

           Nixon turns around.

                                 KEVIN
                        Wanted to talk to you about my

                        Make it quick.

           He continues on. Kevin keeps pace.

                        I don't think I can.

                        Go on deployment. Sir.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Why, you got some sort of health
                        condition?
                               (re: Kevin shaking head)
                        Muslim?

           Kevin doesn't entertain that with a response.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        How long do you have left on your
                        enlistment? A year?

                                 KEVIN
                        Eight months, sir.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Alright. I'll give you an honorable
                        discharge if that's what you want.

                                 KEVIN
                        No, I want to continue to serve.

                                 COL. NIXON
                        Then you can serve by going on your
                        deployment.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sir, I'm being asked to deploy with
                        guys who killed my brother. We're
                        supposed to have each other's backs.
                        Unconditionally. But I can't trust
                        them. And it would be irresponsible
                        to send us together.
           Nixon stops outside a conference room, turns to Kevin--

                                 COL. NIXON
                        So how do you propose I resolve this,
                        Corporal Tillman?

                                 KEVIN
                        Transfer me.

           EXT. FORT BRAGG - SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

           A round kicks up dirt ten feet wide of its intended target.
           Kevin lies prone, eye to the scope of his M24 sniper rifle.

           Beside him, a SPOTTER peers downrange through binoculars.

                                 SPOTTER
                        So why exactly did you become a sniper?
                        Clearly wasn't your shooting ability.

                                 KEVIN
                        Are you gonna help me? Or heckle me?

                                 SPOTTER
                        Someone had to get a shot in.

           Kevin stares him down. Funny.

                                 SPOTTER
                               (smiling)
                        Hold left-three, up-four.

           Through the scope, Kevin's target come into focus.

           CA-POW!

           Dust.

                                 KEVIN
                        Fuck.

           CAPT. SCOTT, 32, a rosy-cheeked Asian, waves Kevin over.
           Smart and soft-spoken, he's not your typical Ranger.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        C'mere a sec!

                                 KEVIN
                        Shit.
                                 SPOTTER
                        Bang up job, Tillman. Already managed
                        to piss off the new cap.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry, man.

                                 SPOTTER
                        Hey, I’m good. You’re the one who missed.

           Kevin leaps to his feet -- jogs over to Scott.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sorry, Captain. Shooting like dog
                        shit today.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I wouldn't say that. My dog shits
                        with better aim.
                               (then)
                        You squared away?

                                 KEVIN
                               (clearly not)
                        Yeah. Yeah.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        What’s going on?

                                 KEVIN
                        Ah, just some shit with my brother.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        You need some time off?

                                 KEVIN
                        No, it's just--

           Scott nods for them to walk and talk in private.

                                 KEVIN
                        --It's just that General Jones is
                        doing another investigation, and he
                        wants to question me. And to be
                        honest, I'm not sure what say.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Just tell him what you know.

                                 KEVIN
                        It's not that. I'm not sure how I'm
                        gonna keep my cool.
                                 KEVIN (cont'd)
                        I've seen guys get harsher punishment
                        returning an hour late from weekend
                        leave. And not one of the motherfuckers
                        who killed Pat has been so much as
                        court-martialed.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Hey man, I hear you. I suggested as
                        much at the end of my report.

           Kevin stops in his tracks--

                                 KEVIN
                        Your report?

           INT. FORT BRAGG - SCOTT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kevin scrolls through a PDF on a laptop.

                                 KEVIN
                        Why haven't I heard about this?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Because technically it doesn't exist.
                        I thought it was odd command asked me
                        to do a 15-6 in the first place.

                        Let's be honest, I’m an infantry
                        officer, not a forensics expert.

           INT. FOB SALERNO - BILLET - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Rapid jump cuts as Capt. Scott takes notes during interviews
           with the Black Sheep Platoon: Spc. O’Neal, Sgt. Baker,  
           Sgt. Sayre, Spc. Alders, etc.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (V.O.)
                        But the interviews pulled everything
                        together.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT (V.O.) (cont'd)

                        happened when everyone was saying the
                        same damn thing.

                        A couple days after I turned in my
                        report, I was told, 'You completed a
                        Battalion Level 15-6, but now we're
                        initiating a Regimental 15-6.’

           INT. FORT BRAGG - SCOTT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS (PRESENT)

           Kevin shuts the laptop screen and turns to Capt. Scott.

                                 KEVIN
                        I don't understand why they would
                        need to conduct two.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I figured it was because of how
                        serious the situation was. And the
                        recommendations I made.

                                 KEVIN
                        What were your recommendations?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        That certain leaders be investigated
                        because I felt there was negligence
                        on their part.

                                 KEVIN
                        So they didn't sign off.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I can't know that for sure. But I
                        don't have another explanation. After
                        I submitted my report, I was called
                        into Colonel Bailey's office. And the
                        reason he called me in was because
                        the NCOs changed their story. The
                        timing, the distance -- all of it.

                                 KEVIN
                        To cover their asses.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        They insinuated that my report wasn’t
                        accurate when I submitted it. So
                        instead of giving out punishment to
                        Baker and his team, I'm in there
                        saying, ‘No, this is accurate. They
                        signed the interviews they gave me.'
                        Baker did show gross negligence. And
                        he wasn't chaptered out of the Army.
                        Ashpole and Elliot were 'Released for
                        Standards' and given company grades
                        to serve in a different unit. So I
                        went through that whole process and
                        came to the conclusion that some
                        individuals demonstrated lack of
                        control and negligence. That they
                        should look into it. And, at the end
                        of it all, they didn’t get their due
                        punishment. They were put back into
                        the rank and file.

                                 KEVIN
                        When did you turn in your report?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                               (thinking)
                        I don't know. About a week after your
                        brother passed?

           INT. FORT BRAGG - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           GEN. JONES, 50, ash trim, rigid posture, sits to Kevin's
           left at the head of the table. A gold star on each of his
           shoulders glistens with intimidating authority. 

                                 GEN. JONES
                        And why do you believe the regimental
                        report to be inaccurate?

                                 KEVIN
                        Because I read Captain Scott's
                        battalion report. Yesterday.

                                 GEN. JONES
                               (clenches jaw)
                        Alright. Can you give a specific
                        examples of inaccuracies?
                                 KEVIN
                        Captain Scott stated based on
                        eyewitness testimony, that the
                        soldiers on the hill were waving
                        their hands and arms to signal a
                        cease fire. However, the soldiers in
                        the lead vehicle continued to shoot
                        into the village. It's clear those
                        soldiers were firing without being
                        fired upon.

                                 GEN. JONES
                        Correct me if I'm wrong, Corporal
                        Tillman, but that information is in
                        the regimental report.

                                 KEVIN
                        But the lead Humvee was commanded by
                        Sergeant Baker, information Colonel
                        Bailey gave us as fact when he came to
                        our house. Yet the final regimental
                        report says it's 'inconclusive' as to
                        who or what vehicle fired. Why say
                        it's inconclusive? It doesn't make
                        sense. Did the investigator not agree
                        with Scott's findings and all of the
                        witness testimony, or did someone have
                        a foot on his head to water it down?

           double as a military museum: antique pennants, medals, rifles.

                                 LT. COL. KAUZLARICH
                        These people have a hard time letting
                        go. And maybe it's because of their
                        religion, or, lack thereof.
                                 LT. COL. KAUZLARICH (cont'd)
                        I don’t know what they think to tell
                        you the truth.

                                                          INTERCUT:

           INT. MIKE FISH'S OFFICE - SAME 

           On the other end, MIKE FISH, 40s, takes notes on a laptop
           with an ESPN The Magazine sticker pasted on the back.

                                 MIKE FISH
                        So you think that’s the reason they
                        keep asking for new investigations?
                        Because of their religious beliefs?

                                 LT. COL. KAUZLARICH
                        I mean, I would think so. Doesn't seem
                        to be a whole lotta trust in the system.

           INT. MOFFETT FIELD - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           As Gen. Jones fires up the projector, a JAG OFFICER hands
           stapled packets to Dannie and Patrick seated at the
           conference table. This feels familiar.

           SUPER: 01 MARCH 2005. MOFFET FIELD - MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA.

           The first slide is titled "SCOPE OF INVESTIGATION."

                                 GEN. JONES
                        Before we begin, I want to note that
                        the primary goal of my investigation
                        was to determine whether your son's
                        death was a result of fratricide.

           Dannie and Patrick exchange a look. This is bullshit.

           INT. MOFFETT FIELD - ELEVATOR - LATER

           Patrick jams the lobby button, rage boiling over--

                                 PATRICK
                        They present us sham investigations.
                        They call Pat 'worm dirt.' Then they
                        have the nerve to say we can't get
                        over it? What do they expect from us?

                                 DANNIE
                        To play nice and go away.
                                 PATRICK
                        Good fucking luck. I'm done playing nice.

           Ding. The elevator doors part.

                                                         SMASH CUT:

           INT. PATRICK’S LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Cramped in between letter boxes and case files, Patrick
           furiously pecks away at a letter at least ten pages long. Of
           which we only hear the tail end--

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        The foundation of the ethical code at
                        West Point is found in the Academy's
                        motto, 'Duty, Honor, Country.' Cadets
                        also develop ethically by adhering to
                        the Cadet Honor Code, which states 'A
                        cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or
                        tolerate those who do.'

           Click. The printer spits out his literary tongue-lashing.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        You are a general. On paper, you
                        subscribe to this motto and honor
                        code. To say otherwise means it ends
                        on graduation day and is limited to
                        cadets. There is no way a man like
                        you, with your intelligence,
                        education, military experience, rank
                        and authority -- both apparent and
                        real -- believes the conclusions
                        reached in the briefing book. But
                        your signature is on it. I assume,
                        therefore, that you are part of this
                        shameless bullshit.

           He walks over, squares the pages, signs the final page.

           EXT. PATRICK’S LAW OFFICE - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Patrick crosses through a manicured lawn with manila
           envelope in hand. No time for walkways.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        The Rangers stand for something -- to
                        this day in my mind -- the best.
                                 PATRICK (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        None of the five soldiers on the ground,
                        nor anyone in a discretionary capacity
                        involved in this briefing book, deserve
                        to be affiliated with the Rangers. If
                        your uniforms are so decorated, you
                        should remove those badges.

           He opens a blue USPS collection box, drops the letter inside.

                                 PATRICK (V.O.)
                        In sum: fuck you. And yours.
                        Sincerely, Patrick K. Tillman.

           INT. TACOMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Half the room is packed away as Marie studies PAT'S FRAMED
           SILVER STAR. She reads the written Army citation underneath.
           Shakes her head. Places it in a box.

           She pulls Pat's dog-eared copy of Self-Reliance off the
           shelf. Flips through highlighted passages. Stops on one.

           EXT. TACOMA HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The bed of Kevin's truck is filled with boxes. As he loads
           his suitcase in, Marie approaches from behind--

                                 MARIE
                        Gonna miss having a Tillman boy around.

                                 KEVIN
                        My mom said the same thing when Richard
                        moved out. Lasted a week. Turns out we
                        can be a difficult bunch.

                                 MARIE
                               (
                                with a smile
                                            )
                        No idea what you're talking about.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        So what are you gonna do now that
                        you're a free man?

                                 KEVIN
                        Thought I'd do some traveling.

                                 MARIE
                        Haven't gotten your fill?

                                 KEVIN
                        Figure this time I’ll go where locals
                        prefer to pour shots, rather than
                        fire them.
                                 MARIE
                        Good place to start.

                                 KEVIN
                        What about you?

                                 MARIE
                        I'm still open to suggestions.

           She goes in for a hug. They embrace for a beat.

                                 MARIE
                        Keep in touch, OK?

           Kevin nods, trying best to stay composed.

           INT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dannie lies in bed watching All the President's Men. The
           phone rings. Sensing it a little late, she checks the alarm
           clock: 10:29 PM. Checks the caller ID. Unknown number.

                                 DANNIE
                               (answering)
                        Hello?

                                 DAWN HELLERMAN (V.O.)
                        Hi, is this Dannie Tillman?

                                 DANNIE
                        Yes... who's this?

                                 DAWN HELLERMAN
                        I’m sorry to call you so late. I just
                        found your number and--

                                 DANNIE
                        --It’s OK. May I ask who's calling?

                                 DAWN HELLERMAN (V.O.)
                        My name’s Dawn Hellerman. A friend of
                        mine sent me an article on your son. I
                        read about what you've all been going
                        through, and it was like de ja vu.

                                 DANNIE
                        I'm not sure I follow.

                                 DAWN HELLERMAN
                        My husband was Staff Sergeant Brian
                        Hellerman. He was killed in Iraq in
                                 DAWN HELLERMAN (cont'd)
                        The Army said it happened in an
                        ambush. But a few months later I got a
                        phone call from a soldier in his unit.
                        He told me it was friendly fire. At
                        first I didn't know what he was
                        talking about. He explained that
                        everyone felt horrible about it and
                        that it was an accident. He felt
                        guilty I hadn't been told the truth
                        and that he had to call.
                               (beat, voice breaking)
                        And hearing about Pat, it was like re-
                        living Brian's death all over again.

           EXT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MORNING

           A UPS driver unloads four cardboard boxes beside Dannie's
           welcome mat. Rings the doorbell.

           INT. BRET HARTE JUNIOR HIGH - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           The SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, 50s, picks up a crumpled piece of
           paper by a locker. Tosses it in the garbage.

           At the end of the hall, we hear the muffled sound of
           rambunctious students. He jogs over to investigate and peers
           through the window into Dannie's classroom.

           Inside, students are shouting, throwing paper airplanes, and
           creating mayhem. Without an authority figure present, Lord
           of the Flies has become more than required reading.

           INT. BRET HARTE JUNIOR HIGH - FACULTY LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Dannie's engrossed in a mountain of documents laid out on
           the table. The principal knocks as he pops his head in--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Hey, Dan. Ah, everything, alright?

                                 DANNIE
                        Yeah. Just catching up on some work.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Don't mean to interrupt but third
                        period started fifteen minutes ago.
                        Figured you might want to teach it.

           Dannie whips her head toward the wall clock. 1:15. Oh shit.
                                 DANNIE
                        I am so sorry. I totally lost track--

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        --It's OK.

           She frantically shuffles papers into some semblance of order.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I'll take care of it.

                                 DANNIE
                        Thank you.

           She practically sprints out of the room. The principal walks
           over to see what had Dannie so enraptured. Finds an
           assortment of case files from Pat's investigations.

           INT. TACOMA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           The house has been entirely emptied of all furniture,
           decorations, and signs of life.

           Marie stands in the foyer soaking in the memories one final
           time. As she locks the door, an image of Pat's face being
           locked out flashes before her. She can't help but smile.

           INT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dannie sits on the floor, surrounded by hundreds of unsorted
           pages. She cross-references a heavily redacted document against
           another. It's impossible to make heads or tails of all this.

           Dannie drops them in frustration, seconds away from a full-
           blown panic attack. She reaches for her laptop and out of
           total desperation, she Googles "what happened to pat tillman?"

           Over a million results. Even better. She skims the first
           page. Mouses over a link that catches her attention. Clicks.

                            TELLING TRANSFORMATIVE TALES

           Off Dannie, eyes narrowing with intrigue--

           INT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Dannie drops a set of heavy binders on the table in front of
           STAN GOFF, 56, a former Army Ranger with a kind smile and
           crazy eyes.
                                 STAN
                        That all ya got?

                                 DANNIE
                        In for a penny, in for a pound.
                               (then)
                        Oh wait.

           She disappears for a beat. Returns with another box.

                                 DANNIE
                        Almost forgot. Sworn testimonies.

                                 STAN
                        A little more than pound.

           He pulls out a binder and flips through the report pages. In
           addition to words covered by thick black bars, entire words
           have been replaced by DASHES. This is going to fucking ----.

                                 DANNIE
                        What hasn't been censored is written
                        like another language entirely.

                                 STAN
                        I call it vernacular homicide. Keeps
                        the riff-raff out. Hell, the entire
                        legal profession subsists on it.

                                 DANNIE
                        My ex-husband is a lawyer.

                                 STAN
                        Then you already know.

           Dannie cracks a smile. All too well.

                                 DANNIE
                        They tried to bury me in bullshit.

                                 STAN
                        Good thing I brought a shovel.

           He opens a tall can of Red Bull. Takes a sip.

                                 STAN
                        Doctor told me to stop drinking
                        coffee. Bad for the adrenal glands.
                                 DANNIE
                        The one thing I might've figured out
                        was how to link specific names to
                        each witness. That way we know who is
                        saying what.
                               (leans over; counts dashes)
                        Six, seven, eight.
                               (checks her answer key)
                        Saunders.

           She writes SAUNDERS above the dashes. An exact fit.

                                 STAN
                        That'll work.

                                 DANNIE
                        But not for everyone. Saunders is the
                        only one with eight letters, but
                        Baker and Hodne both have five.

                                 STAN
                        Context. We know Baker was on the
                        battlefield, and Hodne was at TOC. So
                        their statements will be from two
                        completely different perspectives.

                                 DANNIE
                        That'll work.
                               (then)
                        So where do we start?

                                 STAN
                        From the beginning.

           INT. DANNIE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           In front of Dannie and Stan, arrows, circles, and details are
           scrawled in red ink on the pages. They've been at it for days.

                                 DANNIE
                        Inconclusive my ass. Listen to this, Stan.
                               (reading)
                        'Why did you fire at the figures on
                        the ridgeline?'
                               (beat)
                        'I was excited. I saw muzzle flashes.'
                               (reading)
                        'Were you taking enemy fire?'
                               (beat)
                        'I couldn't tell. Others were firing,
                        and I wanted to stay in the firefight.'
                                 STAN
                        Absolutely no situational awareness.

                                 DANNIE
                        Listen to the squad automatic gunner.
                               (reading)
                        'Why did you fire at waving arms?'
                               (beat)
                        'I saw the arms waving, but I didn't
                        think that they were trying to signal
                        cease fire.'
                               (to Stan)
                        Isn't it against the rules of
                        engagement to shoot at the enemy if
                        he's waving his hands?

                                 STAN
                        Yes. And you must have positive
                        identification to use deadly force.
                        We were taught that in Ranger School.
                        Hell, we were taught that in basic.

                                 DANNIE
                        To think I had sympathy for them.
                        Having to live with this for the rest
                        of their lives. It doesn't sound like
                        they were scared or confused. It
                        sounds like they had a lust to fight.

           EXT. MARIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MANHATTAN - EVENING

           A CABBIE pulls luggage out of the trunk. Places it on the
           sidewalk next to Marie.

                                 CABBIE
                        Husband not here to take up your bags?

           Marie stares at him. How did you know? The cabbie nods to
           her wedding band. She shields it out of reflex.

                                 MARIE
                        No, I'm fine. Thank you.

           She hands him a few bills. Turns around to give the building
           a once over. Her new home.

           INT. DANNIE’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Dannie, Patrick, and Kevin are gathered at the table mid-
           conversation with SPECIAL AGENT GROSSMAN, 40, beady brown
           eyes, acting as investigator, educator, and mediator.
                                 DANNIE
                        I'm just trying to wrap my head
                        around all the changes in testimony.
                        None of it makes sense. It's like up
                        is down and white is zucchini. Either
                        everyone has collective amnesia, or
                        they're lying to cover their asses.

                                 PATRICK
                        Colonel Kauzlarich may not like that our
                        family isn't Christian but even we know
                        ‘thou shall not bear false witness’ is
                        one of the Ten Commandments.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT GROSSMAN
                        I'm sure he regrets doing that
                        interview. He said some things in
                        poor taste. It's possible he was
                        feeling sensitive because his
                        investigation was being scrutinized.
                        He probably wants to put it behind--

                                 DANNIE
                        --What do you mean his investigation?

                                 SPECIAL AGENT GROSSMAN
                        The regimental 15-6.
                               (beat)
                        Were you not aware that General
                        Kauzlarich conducted the report?

                                 DANNIE
                        I thought it was Major Hodne.

           She rummages through a box on the table. Pulls out a folder
           with a colored tab bearing Kauzlarich's name.

                                 DANNIE
                        This is from General Jones' interview.
                               (reading)
                        'It's getting to the point where he's
                        becoming a pain in the ass for 2nd
                        Battalion to train, deploy, fight,
                        and win.'
                               (then)
                        That pain in the ass he's referring
                        to is Kevin because he dared to ask
                        for a transfer. How can a man with so
                        much contempt for my family be put in
                        charge of Pat's investigation?
                                 SPECIAL AGENT GROSSMAN
                        I can't answer that because I
                        couldn't tell you. But regardless of
                        what happened before, if my office
                        uncovers anything that appears
                        criminal on anyone's part, we'll call
                        for an official investigation.

                                 PATRICK
                        And we're gonna wait what, another
                        year and a half to hear there was no
                        wrongdoing on anyone's part?

                                 DANNIE
                        No offense Special Agent Grossman, I
                        appreciate you visiting us in person,
                        but we've been through a few of these
                        now. And allowing the military to
                        investigate itself, even by the Army
                        Inspector General, is like allowing
                        my students to grade their own
                        papers. If I'm expecting unbiased
                        results, I'm only fooling myself.

                                 SPECIAL AGENT GROSSMAN
                        We take allegations of criminal
                        misconduct very seriously. After we
                        were received a copy of your Mr.
                        Tillman's letter, this became a
                        priority for us.

                                 KEVIN
                        Shit, if an angry letter was all it
                        took, my mom woulda told the Army to
                        go fuck itself years ago.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE STUDIOS - ESPN - DAY

           A buzz of activity at the worldwide leader of sports. In a
           festively decorated cubicle, Marie fills out a call sheet on
           her computer monitor.

           HANNAH, 40s, an alpha female with a spray tan and yoga
           membership, calls over from her office doorway--

                                 HANNAH
                        Marie, can I borrow you a sec?

           INT. HANNAH'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           We can't see what's on Hannah's computer screen, but gauging
           Marie's demeanor, it's something serious.
                                 HANNAH
                               (standing behind Marie)
                        Editorial forwarded it over. Figured
                        you should know.

                                 MARIE
                        How did they get these?

                                 HANNAH
                               (shrugging)
                        No clue. But they were gauging our
                        interest in buying.

           Marie leans back in disbelief.

                                 HANNAH
                        We're not, for the record. But I
                        can't speak for everyone else.
                        Definitely some blogs out there who
                        wouldn't be above publishing autopsy
                        photos for clicks.

           INT. TIMES SQUARE STUDIOS - ESPN - MOMENTS LATER

           Marie stares at her monitor, mind still on what she just
           witnessed. Her phone lights up with a text message.

           Joe: We still on for tomorrow night?

           Marie glares at the message, unsure how to respond.

           INT. COMMONWEALTH CLUB OF CALIFORNIA - STAGE - NIGHT

           On stage, a MODERATOR interviews GEN. WESLEY CLARK, 62, a
           silver fox with an equally silver tongue.

                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                        This country was taken over by a
                        group of people with a policy coup.
                        Wolfowitz and Cheney and Rumsfeld and
                        you could name a half dozen other
                        collaborators from the 'Project for
                        the New American Century.' They
                        wanted us to destabilize the Middle
                        East. Turn it upside down. Take it
                        under control.

           Dannie ducks down as she takes a seat in the back.
                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                        Now did anybody tell you that? Did
                        Senators and Congressmen stand up and
                        denounce this plan? Was there a full
                        fledged American debate on it?
                        Absolutely not. And there still
                        isn’t. They could hardly wait to
                        finish Iraq, so they could move on to
                        Syria. And it is imperative we have a
                        national dialogue on these issues.

           Claps from the assembled crowd.

                                 MODERATOR
                        Before we began tonight, we had the
                        audience submit some questions. We’ll
                        go through as many as we have time
                        for. First question--
                                reading
                               (
                                       )
                        'Do you plan to run for President?'

                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                               (laughs)
                        I think my wife might kill me if I
                        didn't speak to her about it first.

           He points to MRS. CLARKE, 63, in the front row. She gives a
           thumbs up to confirm his suspicion.

                                 MODERATOR
                        Well, as soon as you're ready, come
                        back and gives us the scoop. Second
                        question--
                               (reading)
                        'What do you think about everything
                        going on with our local hero, Pat
                        Tillman?'

                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                        Well... friendly fire happens. And
                        the military really does its best to
                        prevent those kinds of accidents. I
                        know some of the generals who are
                        being investigated. These are not the
                        type of men who would be involved in
                        a cover-up.

           Off Dannie, fuming--
           INT. MARIE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Marie models a bubblegum pink sweater in the mirror. It's
           bright. It's loud. It's exactly what she needs right now.

           As she smooths the front of the sweater, she fixates on her
           wedding ring in the reflection. A beat. She slides it off.
           Places it on the counter. Rubs the bare spot with her thumb,
           feeling suddenly naked without it.

           INT. DOKA SQUARE - LATER

           Overpriced Asian fusion on the Lower East Side. Marie sits
           across from JOE, 37, crooked smile and a wicked sense of humor.

                                 MARIE
                        It's definitely been an adjustment--

           She's trails off as SERVERS emerge from the kitchen BELTING
           "Happy Birthday" and holding a cupcake with a lit candle.
           They make their way straight toward Marie.

                                 MARIE
                               (whispering to Joe)
                        It's not my birthday.

           Joe grins -- joins in the singing. Marie's eyes says "fuck you"
           but her smile says "well played." They place the dessert down
           in front of her.

                                 JOE
                        Make a wish.

                                 MARIE
                        It won't be for a second date.
                               (then)
                        You're gonna pay for this.

           She blows out the candle. The entire restaurant claps.

           INT. COMMONWEALTH CLUB OF CALIFORNIA - STAGE - LATER

           As Gen. Clark greets the parting crowd, Dannie waits her turn.
           But she can't stay silent another second longer--

                                 DANNIE
                        Excuse me. Excuse me, General Clark?
                               (he turns to her)
                        I’m Pat Tillman’s mother.

           Clark nods, smiles, turns to the next attendee until her
           statement sinks in and snaps him out of autopilot--
                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                               (turning back to Dannie)
                        I'm sorry. Did you-- Did you just say
                        you’re Pat Tillman’s mother?

                                 DANNIE
                        Yes, sir. And I don’t mean to be
                        rude, but you know nothing of the
                        circumstances surrounding his death.
                        You shouldn’t be saying anything
                        unless you have the facts.

           All eyes on Clark as the moderator attempts to escort him
           around this political landmine.

                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                               (waving him off)
                        You know, you're absolutely right. I
                        was asked about your son at my
                        appearance last night as well. And
                        I’m afraid I responded the exact same
                        way. I'd like to know more about it.

                                 DANNIE
                        I can tell you General Kensinger was
                        at Pat’s memorial knowing full well
                        it was fratricide. And he allowed
                        Pat's friend to tell a fraudulent
                        story at the same memorial suggesting
                        he was killed by the enemy. The Army
                        could've easily said it was a special
                        ops mission, and there was no
                        information available. But they
                        didn't. They lied to the American
                        people, and they lied my family.

                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                               (to his wife; dismayed)
                        We’ve known Phil for years. I can’t
                        believe he would do that.

                                 DANNIE
                        And there's a lot more to it than
                        that. Are you serious about wanting
                        to know more?

                                 GEN. WESLEY CLARK
                        I am.

                                 DANNIE
                        Then you should take a look at these
                        reports. It's all in there.
           Dannie reaches into her purse and offers him a thumb drive.

                                 DANNIE
                        It's time to hold them accountable.

           EXT. MARIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

           Marie stands outside her building, arm interlocked with
           Joe's. The moment of truth after a promising first date.

                                 MARIE
                        When are you back from your trip?

                                 JOE
                        Two weeks.

                                 MARIE
                        Well, if you still want to see me in
                        two weeks--

           She faces him, moves in closer. Joe closes his eyes
           expecting a kiss.

                                 MARIE
                        --call me.

           She breaks away and walks up her building steps.

                                 JOE
                               (calling after her)
                        You're cruel.

                                 MARIE
                        I know.

           INT. MIKE HONDA'S OFFICE - DAY

           A portly Japanese man, 63, reads from an open binder. Beside a
           photo of him with the DALAI LAMA, a wooden nameplate reveals
           him as MICHAEL M. HONDA - U.S. House of Representatives. Honda
           is attentive and polite, a model player in a dirty game.

           Dannie sits across from him, filling the silence with her
           work under a microscope.

                                 DANNIE
                        We were a little limited because of
                        how much was redacted.

           A beat.

           Honda closes the binder.
                                 HONDA
                        Can I keep this?

                                 DANNIE
                        Please.

                                 HONDA
                               (removing his glasses)
                        Are you familiar with the 442nd?

           Dannie shakes her head.

                                 HONDA
                        It was the most decorated American
                        regiment in World War II. Every time
                        the 442nd was deployed, they were
                        deployed to the front lines. Fourteen
                        thousand men. Nine thousand purple
                        hearts. Five hundred and sixty Silver
                        Stars. Twenty-one medals of honor.
                        They had to be replaced entirely twice
                        over. They were cannon fodder, and
                        they knew it. But even after
                        displaying their fierceness in battle,
                        the military refused to send them to
                        the Pacific Theater. You see, the
                        442nd was comprised of second
                        generation Japanese. The Nisei. But
                        the Nisei never complained about their
                        lot in life. They were determined to
                        prove their loyalty. Even while their
                        family members, and a hundred thousand
                        other Japanese Americans were
                        imprisoned by their own country.
                               (beat)
                        I don't remember much about my
                        internment; I was only four years old
                        then. But I do remember cold nights
                        gathered around a fire, hearing the
                        heroic tales of the 442nd. They made
                        us proud. They gave us hope.

           Dannie is stilled by his personal story.

                                 HONDA
                               (tapping the binder)
                        And it appears to me that the brave
                        actions of soldiers, and the
                        continued mistreatment of those
                        soldiers' families, hasn't improved
                        much in sixty years.
                               (beat)
                        We have a duty to change that.
           INT. MIKE HONDA’S OFFICE - STUDY - DAY

           Now weeks later, HONDA’S ASSISTANT pulls binders out of a
           box and places them on the table in front of Dannie.

                                 HONDA’S ASSISTANT
                        Better late than never, right?

                                 DANNIE
                               (forcing a smile)
                        Yeah.

                                 HONDA’S ASSISTANT
                        Well we appreciate your work. You're
                        making the lives of the House
                        Committee a thousand times easier.

                                 DANNIE
                        And having the unredacted reports is
                        making my life a thousand times
                        easier.
                               (then)
                        OK if I come back to return these by
                        Friday?

                                 HONDA’S ASSISTANT
                        Oh. I thought you knew.
                               (beat)
                        They're not allowed to leave the
                        office.

                                 DANNIE
                        I see. Do you have a Xerox machine?
                        I'll pay for the copies.

                                 HONDA’S ASSISTANT
                               (pained)
                        Actually... you can't make copies,
                        either. The Pentagon only permitted
                        they be read here. I’m really sorry,
                        Mrs. Tillman.
                               (low to Dannie)
                        But there's nothing saying you can't
                        compare these to your own.

           Dannie nods. It's something.

                                 DANNIE
                        Thanks.

           A time-lapse as we watch Dannie manually transcribe THOUSANDS
           OF DETAILS from the unredacted reports onto her own.
           Days, nights, and weeks pass.

           Dannie copies and binds packets of information together on
           Pat's investigation. Her own version of CliffsNotes. Upon
           closer inspection, we see the envelopes she's stuffing are
           addressed to CONGRESSMEN on the House Oversight Committee.

           Running on empty, Dannie licks and seals the final one. Adds
           it to the stack. Takes a deep breath -- her work finally done.

           INT. RAYBURN BUILDING - HEARING ROOM - DAY

           CHAIRMAN WAXMAN, 68, bald, caterpillar mustache, sits at the
           head of the panel, surrounded by Honda and the other HOUSE
           OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MEMBERS. He swears in the witnesses-- 

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        Do you solemnly swear to tell the
                        truth, the whole truth, and nothing
                        but the truth, so help you God?

           Opposite him, Dannie, Kevin, and Jessica Lynch stand with
           right hands raised.

                                 ALL
                        I do.

           They take a seat behind their name cards on the table.

                                 KEVIN
                        I want to thank Congressman Waxman
                        for holding this hearing and the
                        members of the committee for
                        attending.

           FLASHES pop from the kneeling PHOTOGRAPHERS in front of him.

                                 KEVIN
                               (reading statement)
                        'Two days ago marked the third
                        anniversary of the death of my older
                        brother, Pat Tillman, in Afghanistan.
                        To our family and friends, it was a
                        devastating loss. To the nation, it
                        was a moment of disorientation. To
                        the military, it was a nightmare. But
                        to others in the government, it
                        appears to have been an opportunity.'

                                                            CUT TO:
           As Jessica Lynch addresses the committee, we intercut
           between her and Dannie's statements--

                                 JESSICA LYNCH
                        My parent’s home was under siege by
                        the media all repeating the story of
                        the little girl Rambo from the hills
                        who went down fighting. But it just
                        wasn't true.

                                 DANNIE
                        We have been asked over and over
                        again, 'What can we do for your
                        family? How can we appease you?' And
                        it makes me sick. It is not about our
                        family. Our family will never be
                        satisfied. We will never have Pat
                        back. But what is so outrageous is
                        that this isn’t just about Pat. This
                        is about what they did to a nation.

                                 JESSICA LYNCH
                        I have repeatedly said, when asked,
                        that if the stories about me helped
                        inspire our troops and rally a nation,
                        then perhaps there was some good.

                                 DANNIE
                        Pat died for this country, and he
                        believed it was a great country with
                        a system that worked. It's not
                        perfect. No one has ever said that.
                        But there is a system in place to
                        allow for it to work, and your job is
                        to find out what happened.

                                 JESSICA LYNCH
                        I am still confused as to why they
                        chose to lie and tried to make me a
                        legend when my fellow soldiers that
                        day were, in fact, legendary.

                                 DANNIE
                        By making up these false stories, you
                        are diminishing true heroism.

                                 JESSICA LYNCH
                        The American people are capable of
                        determining their own ideals for
                        heroes and they don’t need to be told
                        elaborate tales.
                                 DANNIE
                        It may not be pretty. It may not be
                        like a John Wayne movie. But that's
                        not what war is all about. It is
                        ugly. It is bloody. It is painful.

           Dannie sits on her couch surfing TV channels. For a brief
           moment, we catch a glimpse of Gen. Wesley Clark on Countdown
           with Keith Olbermann. She flips it back.

                        The truth on the Pat Tillman case is not
                        yet out. If there’s even a hint of
                        something like a homicide or a murder in
                        this case, it should’ve been fully
                        investigated and proved or disproved. But
                        we still don’t know how far up it goes.

                               (answering with a smile)
                        Hey. Just thinking about you. What
                        are your thoughts on getting Elvis to
                        renew our vows?

           INT. PENTAGON - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           Standing behind a lectern, ARMY SECRETARY GEREN, 55, glasses
           and cue ball head gleaming under the lights, delivers a
           statement to the assembled MEDIA.

                                 ARMY SECRETARY GEREN
                        General Wallace concluded that
                        Kensinger deceived investigators
                        about what he knew and when he knew
                        it. He made false official statements
                        but his deception played no role in
                        the key events, misunderstandings,
                        and misinformation immediately
                        following Corporal Tillman’s death.
                                 ARMY SECRETARY GEREN (cont'd)
                        Kensinger failed in his duty to
                        inform the family about the friendly
                        fire incident in a timely manner as
                        required by Army regulations.

           He calls on a REPORTER with a hand raised.

                                 REPORTER
                        You’ve described a litany of errors
                        over more than three years involving a
                        lot of people. Yet all the blame falls
                        on General Kensinger. He happens to be
                        retired. Are we to believe that's a
                        coincidence?

                                 ARMY SECRETARY GEREN
                        Had General Kensinger performed his
                        job properly, we wouldn’t be standing
                        here today. He was the captain of the
                        ship, and he ran that ship aground.

                        warn the Pentagon and White House not
                        to speak publicly about how Pat died.
                        A week after he was killed. We always
                        assumed their timeline was bullshit.
                        Now we have proof.

                                 DANNIE

                        that is.

           From the back, the Tillman family watch CONGRESSWOMAN MALONEY,
           61, white pearls and pantsuit, question Rumsfeld--

                                 CONGRESSWOMAN MALONEY
                        When Corporal Tillman enlisted, it
                        was acknowledged by many people. He
                        was a professional football player.
                        He was offered millions of dollars in
                        a contract that he turned down to
                        serve our country. And he captured
                        your attention after he enlisted when
                        you sent a high-priority email to
                        Thomas White -- then Secretary of the
                        Army. On June 25th, 2002, you wrote--
                               (reading)
                        ‘Here is an article on a fellow who
                        is apparently joining the Rangers. He
                        sounds like he is world class. We
                        might want to keep an eye on him.’
                               (beat)
                        When Corporal Tillman--

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        The gentlelady’s time has expired.

                                 CONGRESSWOMAN MALONEY
                        May I ask for an additional--

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        --Were you leading to a question?

                                 CONGRESSMAN MALONEY
                        Yes. I was.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        OK. Would you ask it quickly?
                                 CONGRESSMAN MALONEY
                        When Corporal Tillman was killed, was it
                        a blow to you when you heard the news?

           Though he attempts empathy, Rumsfeld's words ring hollow--

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Clearly it is a blow when you read of
                        a death of a young man or a young
                        woman who is serving our country in
                        uniform. It is always a heartbreaking
                        thing for anyone in a position of
                        responsibility to read about.

                                 CONGRESSMAN MALONEY
                        Thank you.

           Dannie turns to Patrick and whispers--

                                 DANNIE
                        That's all she's asking?

           CONGRESSMAN SHAYS, 61, fake teeth but a real asshole,
           delivers his remarks--

                                 CONGRESSMAN SHAYS
                        Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you
                        for rearranging your schedule to be
                        here today. I want to say that I had
                        chosen not to speak at the beginning
                        of this hearing. I think this whole
                        thing centers around two issues. Who
                        knew what when and who did they tell?
                        And those have been answered pretty
                        quickly. So it's kind of like, you
                        know, let’s get on with it. I am
                        hard-pressed to know how this is
                        going to save one American life. I am
                        hard-pressed to know how this is
                        going to help us achieve the results
                        we need in Iraq and Afghanistan. We
                        asked some of our best and brightest
                        to come and spend their time talking
                        about this. And as far as I am
                        concerned gentlemen, you answered
                        every question. And I am particularly
                        grateful, Mr. Rumsfeld, that you
                        called their bluff. Because what they
                        really wanted was for you not to show
                        up. And then they could continue
                        criticizing you.
           INT. RAYBURN BUILDING - HEARING ROOM - LATER

           The Tillmans remain in their seats as the hearing clears
           out. Rumsfeld and the generals are gathered around, smiling
           and slapping each other on the back. Another crisis averted.

           In deliberate view of a CAMERA CREW, Congressman Shays offers
           his hand to Patrick like a used car salesmen--

                                 CONGRESSMAN SHAYS
                        Just wanted to say I’m proud of you.
                        And America is proud of Pat.

                                 PATRICK
                        We'd like some privacy, please.

           He continues, oblivious or indifferent, to his polite request--

                                 CONGRESSMAN SHAYS
                        I’m sure it must be difficult losing
                        your son--

                                 PATRICK
                               (locking eyes now)
                        --Get out of here. Right now. Get
                        away from my family.

           Shays’ smile fades as he senses the curtain fall on this
           final act of political theater.

                        It seemed like no one thought it was
                        worth their time.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        I assure you that isn't the case,
                        Mrs. Tillman.

                                 DANNIE
                        Congressman Shays flat out said so.

                               (then)
                        They had every opportunity to put the
                        screws to them, and they weren't prepared
                        to cross-examine. I expected more.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        I promise the committee will be
                        better prepared at the next hearing.
                               (beat)
                        Should there be one.

           Off Dannie realizing there won't be another--

           INT./EXT. SUV - MOVING - LATER

           A YOUNG MARINE drives the Tillmans in a government-issued
           Yukon, a somber mood over the family. Kevin puts a hand on
           Dannie's shoulder, riding shotgun, and whispers--

                                 KEVIN
                        You did everything you could. Pat
                        would've been proud.

           Though Dannie nods, there is disappointment in her eyes.

                                 PAT TILLMAN (V.O.)
                        Times like this you stop and think,
                        not only how good we have it, but
                        what kind of system we live under.
                        What freedoms we’re allowed. And that
                        wasn't built over night. And the flag
                        is a symbol of that.

           Dannie stares out the window watching American flags lining
           the Pentagon vanish over the horizon.

           A documentary interview of Pat Tillman inside the Cardinals
           clubhouse a day after 9/11.

                                 PAT TILLMAN
                        My great-grandfather was at Pearl
                        Harbor. A lot of my family has gone
                        and fought in wars, and I really
                        haven’t done a damn thing as far as
                        laying myself on the line. So I have
                        a great deal of respect for those who
                        have and what the flag stands for.

           CARD #1: From 2004 to 2007, seven investigations were
           conducted into the death of Pat Tillman.
                                 PAT TILLMAN
                        You take it for granted. Especially
                        in the country we live in. We are
                        such a free society, and I’ve always
                        had a great deal of respect for the
                        flag. But even for someone who
                        considers themselves that way, you
                        don’t think about what it gives you.
                        You don’t think about how great a
                        life we have over here.

           Outside University of Phoenix Stadium, fans snap photos in
           front of a five-hundred pound bronze statue of Pat Tillman.

           CARD #2: To date, no one has faced court-martial for their
           role in the fratricide or the subsequent cover-up.

           On the ASU football field, fifteen-foot red balloons spell
           out "PAT'S RUN." Hundreds of runners, in identical shirts
           and race bibs, cross the finish line at the 42 yard-line.

           CARD #3: In 2005, friends and family started Pat's Run, an
           annual race to raise money for the Tillman Foundation.

           pieces together on screen.

           CARD #4: The Tillman Foundation has awarded over 450
           educational scholarships to soldiers and their spouses.

                                                           THE END.
