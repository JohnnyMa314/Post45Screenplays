           The sound of WATER, CALM WAVES LAPPING. A YOUNG GIRL with a 
           TRINIDADIAN ACCENT:

                                 GIRL (V.O.)
                        Love moves like water between the 
                        worlds. Like time and space, it has 
                        no permanent place, it is 
                        constantly moving, expanding, 
                        ebbing and flowing. It is itself 
                        shapeless, but can take on any 
                        shape. 

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS - AQUATIC CENTER - DAY

           WAVES LAPPING in a competitive swimming pool. RAUCOUS 
           CHEERING from SPECTATORS in surrounding bleachers. A row of 
           MALE SWIMMERS stand poised on diving blocks.

           Various banners read: UNO SWIM 2007-2008

           We land on a swimmer, BENNETT CARTER, 21, a white guy with 
           shy, handsome charm--but right now he's pure focus. His 
           briefs and cap say UNO.

           A BUZZER. The divers launch themselves into the water.

           Bennett freestyles with fury. Precision. A powerful stroke. 
           As his head goes under, WE GO UNDER with him--teal bubbles 
           and crashing water. As he comes up, WE COME UP with him--
           metal bleachers, screaming spectators, deep breaths.

           Water. Stroke, stroke, stroke. Air. Water. Stroke, stroke, 
           stroke. Air--

           Bleachers. DULCIE (Dull-see) PEARSON, 21, a gorgeous black 
           girl. Smart. No bullshit. We see her through the tint of 
           GOGGLES. She wears a DILLARD U t-shirt. She's watching him.

           Water. Stroke, stroke, stroke. Dulcie. Water. Stroke, stroke, 
           stroke. Dulcie...

           DULCIE'S POV: Bennett pulls into the lead. His body slides 
           through the water, graceful, strong. A couple laps now, it's 
           the last leg. Bennett finishes first by a millisecond. 
           Dillard in second, and so forth, until a BUZZER sounds.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Bennett Carter for UNO in first...

           The UNO COACH gives Bennett a hand climbing out of the pool. 
           They embrace in a celebratory hug.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS - AQUATIC CENTER - LATER

           The meet is over. People talk, linger, disperse. Bennett 
           emerges from the locker room rocking to EARBUDS. LAST RESORT 
           by PAPA ROACH blasts through them.

           He stops, removes his earbuds when he sees Dulcie, hanging 
           with her CREW from DILLARD (a nearby HBCU). He observes her, 
           considers leaving. But he's captivated.

           She catches his gaze. They connect for a beat. Just enough.

           He starts to walk over but second-guesses himself, pauses. 
           Shuffles awkwardly between Dulcie and the door. Dulcie 
           notices his hesitation and smiles. She's interested.

           Now her friends start to notice. The second place swimmer, 
           CLAY, nudges another girl, OLIVIA, who stifles a giggle. 
           Before Bennett can make up his mind--

           A STUDENT REF blows her WHISTLE at Dulcie's group.

                                 STUDENT REF
                        Clear out. Y'all can socialize 
                        tonight at Theta.

           Off the ref's words, Bennett gives Dulcie a long look--an 
           invitation in his eyes. Almost a plea. He turns and leaves.

           Dulcie pretends not to watch him go, laughs with Clay and 
           Olivia as they return to their conversation.

           EXT. THETA HOUSE - NIGHT

           Packed frat house decked out in HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS and 
           THETA FUNDRAISER SIGNS. MUSIC BLARES. STUDENTS IN COSTUMES 
           pile in and out, on the stairs, across the lawn.

           Bennett's costume is a SUPERMAN T-SHIRT and jeans. He pushes 
           through the crowd and into--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. THETA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           A dark, sprawling old mansion repurposed for Greek life. Co-
           eds grind against each other to the beat. Some are already 
           passed out--the party's been going for a while.

           Fundraising vendors line the walls: A KISSING BOOTH manned by 
           VAMPIRES--$5 for a love bite. CRYSTAL BALL FORTUNES, TAROT 
           READINGS, CAST YOUR OWN VOODOO SPELL, COSTUME CONTEST ENTRY, 
           WITCH DUNK TANK.

           Bennett scans the crowd. It's hard to make out faces. He 
           slides into the fray, pushing away a grabby BUNNY and NURSE 
           as he scours the room. He makes his way to the--

           DINING ROOM

           A massive space with three side by side banquet tables-- beer 
           pong, flip cup, and table tennis in the midst of a screaming 
           audience. Bennett pauses to watch a moment while casually 
           searching faces. Moves on to the--

           KITCHEN

           Empty and full BEER CANS AND BOTTLES everywhere, COOLERS full 
           to the brim with ice and more beer. Three CHARLIE'S ANGELS 
           dance on the island counter top, amid couples making out.

           Bennett keeps moving, heads for a wide STAIRCASE, when--
           FREDDIE MERCURY stops him.

                                 FREDDIE
                        Hey, you walked right past me!

           It's loud. They shout over the music.

                                 BENNETT
                        Excuse me?

                                 FREDDIE
                        At the door! Gotta pick your 
                        poison.

                                 BENNETT
                        Pick what??

                                 FREDDIE
                        Your poison! Your donation! It's a 
                        fundraiser. You want a fortune, 
                        tarot reading, vampire bite? Dunk 
                        the witch? Voodoo? Five bucks.

           Bennett glances around the room. Pulls out five dollars.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        Uh, costume contest?
                             (off Freddie's long, 
                              silent head-tilt)
                        I'm Superman.

           Freddie takes his money, gives him a red ticket--

                                 FREDDIE
                        Fortune reading.

           --and walks away to hunt down the next five bucks.

           Bennett looks to the TAROT BOOTH run by a WHITE-SHEET-WITH-
           EYE-HOLES GHOST. He respects the lack of effort, heads for 
           the booth and presents his ticket.

                                 GHOST GIRL
                             (bored, without looking 
                              up)
                        Red ticket's for the fortune 
                        teller.

           She nods toward the next booth, where a BUSTY BEER WENCH sits 
           before a CRYSTAL BALL.

                                 BENNETT
                        That guy--uh, Freddie Mercury told 
                        me Tarot reading.

           Ghost Girl looks up at him. A long beat.

                                 GHOST GIRL
                        Yeah. Okay. Have a seat.

           Bennett sits in a folding chair as Ghost Girl shuffles her 
           Tarot deck. She fans the cards across the table.

                                 GHOST GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Pick three. Don't look. Just pick.

           Bennett chooses the first three in line. She pauses, 
           bewildered, similar to Freddie. But she flips the cards--

           THE FOOL. DEATH. THE LOVERS.

           She looks up at him, fascinated. Their gaze locks, the energy 
           shifts... stretches into a long, intense moment. 

           Shifting focus back to the reading, she begins:
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 GHOST GIRL (CONT’D)
                        These are powerful cards. Um, 
                        you're on a journey, but repeating 
                        a cycle. Something is beginning... 
                        but something ended. The death of, 
                        possibly of a loved one, or a 
                        belief in something--maybe a belief 
                        in love? Whatever ended, it's got 
                        you stuck in this cycle. You're 
                        afraid of something...

           She glances up, now reading him. Then back at the cards.

                                 GHOST GIRL (CONT'D)
                        You're The Fool at the start of a 
                        journey. And there's love in your 
                        future. But Death is--is, somehow 
                        standing in your way.

           She finds his eyes, just as he averts her gaze. He’s 
           restless, laughs--too hard. Then without a word, he stands 
           and pushes through the crowd toward the exit.

           EXT. THETA HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett heads down the front steps, across the lawn. Ghost 
           Girl catches up at the sidewalk.

                                 GHOST GIRL
                        Hey, Superman!

           Bennett turns, surprised she followed him. She pulls off the 
           ghost sheet as she approaches--

           It's Dulcie, from the swim meet. Caught off guard, he doesn't 
           know what to say. They stand there a moment...

           A thick silence seems to swallow them. The tension, the 
           attraction, is palpable. They both look away. Timid. 
           Embarrassed by the intensity.

           But their eyes find each other again.

                          BENNETT
           Sorry I left so quick, I--
                                                         DULCIE
                                              Sorry if I hit a nerve back 
                                              there, I--

                                 BENNETT
                             (laughs, guarded)
                        It's fine. Not like that stuff is 
                        real.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           She nods, goes with it, ignoring how obviously he was 
           affected by the reading.

                                 BENNETT
                        Your costume took time, I see.

                                 DULCIE
                        Hours. Failed midterms putting this 
                        together. ...No, it was indeed very 
                        last minute. I--a friend asked for 
                        help here. So... I came to help.

           She smirks. She came to find Bennett. He watches her, grins.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        And I see you toiled over your 
                        Superman. We should probably get 
                        back inside, you might win best 
                        costume.

                                 BENNETT
                             (laughing)
                        Freddie Mercury wouldn't even let 
                        me enter.

                                 DULCIE
                        Seriously? Wowww. Well, who you 
                        here with? Frat crew? Their 
                        costumes as bad as yours?

           She's fishing... and he knows it.

                                 BENNETT
                        No frat crew. Frat's not for me.

                                 DULCIE
                        You're not frat-tastic?

           He shakes his head. She eyes him. He came alone. For her.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        I'm Dulcie, by the way. Pearson.

                                 BENNETT
                        Dulcie? Really?

                                 DULCIE
                        French-creole. ...More French.

           He laughs, wants to say something but refrains.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        What?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        Nothing.

                                 DULCIE
                        What?? Tell me.

                                 BENNETT
                        No--I was just--I was thinking--all 
                        the ways guys must use your name to 
                        hit on you.

                                 DULCIE
                        Line's usually something about 
                        sugar.

           Confidence building, he can't resist...

                                 BENNETT
                        Liiiiike: Dulcie. You must be made 
                        of sugar to look that sweet...?

           He's bashful in this leap of confidence. She stifles a grin, 
           gives him a "try harder" look. He accepts the challenge...

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                             (to a nearby partier)
                        'Scuse me! 'Scuse me! Can I get 
                        some sugar please? Wait, nevermind. 
                        Got plenty right here.

           He grabs her arm, pretends to take a few delicious bites. She 
           laughs. He takes her hand in his, shakes it.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Bennett Carter. Nice to meet you.

           A spark in their touch. But they both pull away. A long 
           silence while they observe the somewhat distant party.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Dulcie. Would you care to dance?

           She hesitates, but nods. They head back for the house.

           It's late-late. Party over. Music gone. A few stragglers are 
           passed out. Bennett and Dulcie lie side by side on the LAWN 
           on her sheet. He eats Halloween CANDY, empty wrappers on his 
           side only.

           Faces beaded with sweat, both smile giddy smiles, staring up 
           at the sky. Stars in their eyes. Bennett laughs. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        You like that first song?

                                 DULCIE
                        Love it. Never really danced to it.

                                 BENNETT
                        Then that’s our song.

                                 DULCIE
                             (a dismissive laugh)
                        Okay. ...So what is Mr. Cali Carter 
                        doing in 'Naawwwlins?

           A beat. His eyes search the sky. 

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett (18) slamming the FRONT DOOR of a 
           HOUSE, storming toward a CAR--PACKED, ready for a new start.

                                 BENNETT
                        Full swim scholarship.
                             (a beat, diverting)
                        Why doesn't sweet Ms. Pearson eat 
                        sugar?

                                 DULCIE
                        Mom wouldn't let me eat sweets as a 
                        child. So I lost my taste for sugar 
                        and it never came back.

                                 BENNETT
                        Damn, that's sad. Cupcakes?
                             (she shakes her head)
                        Ice cream?
                             (she shakes her head)
                        Plain chocolate??

                                 DULCIE
                        Allergic. It's a tragedy.

                                 BENNETT
                        Shit. That is tragic.
                             (a beat)
                        So why philosophy?

                                 DULCIE
                        Gonna be a lawyer like my daddy. 
                        God, can't believe it's senior year 
                        already... pretty damn soon I'll be 
                        off to Boston for law school.

           Bennett's face firms up. A cell phone RINGS. Dulcie scrambles 
           for her purse. Finds her BLACKBERRY. Her warmth fades.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Speak of the devil.
                             (answering)
                        Hi Daddy. ...Mmhmmm. I know, Dad. 
                        ...On my way right now. Ummm, with--
                        with...Clay. And Olivia... YESSS. 
                        Okay, love you too. Bye.
                             (hangs up the phone)
                        I gotta go.

           Dulcie stands and grabs her purse. Bennett tries not to be 
           offended by her white lie.

                                 BENNETT
                        Clay from the meet? So why does a 
                        21-year-old almost-lawyer have to--

                                 DULCIE
                        I have to go.

           She dials on her phone. Bennett scrambles to his feet.

                                 BENNETT
                        Where do you live? I'll--

           Dulcie is already on the phone again. She's suddenly cold.

                                 DULCIE
                        Hi, can I get a cab please? Near 
                        UNO campus outside Theta Xi frat 
                        house. Thank you.

           She hangs up and looks at Bennett, gives him a long hug. A 
           cab is already pulling up to the curb. She walks toward it.

                                 BENNETT
                        Wait. Dulcie. Uh, your number?

                                 DULCIE
                        ...I'm--I'm...focusing. On school 
                        right now. I don't have time...

                                 BENNET
                        Wha--Really?

           He speeds up after her as she opens the cab door.

                                 DULCIE
                             (to driver, getting in)
                        1120 Bourbon Street.

           Bennett stops her, momentarily taken aback by the prominent 
           address. She looks up at him.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        This would never work.

           A tense beat. He doesn't argue. He's afraid of this, wants to 
           run as much as she does. But he inches closer. ...Closer. 
           Until they both crack a smile.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        You're trying to think of another 
                        one aren't you?

                                 BENNETT
                        Girl, you may not eat sugar, but 
                        you must've sat in some, 'cause you 
                        got such a sweet tush.

           She bursts into laughter.

                                 DULCIE
                        Tush??

                                 BENNETT
                        That one needs work. I was--I was 
                        trying not to sound like a total 
                        creep, you know? Tush, bottom, 
                        behind, rump, buns...I weighed them 
                        all out and went with the best 
                        option besides ass. Ass--it's so 
                        obvious. I was being bold.

           Dulcie is nearly crying with laughter.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Meter's running here--

                                 BENNETT
                        --Yeah, yeah, I'll pay you--
                             (back to Dulcie)
                        I don't know, Dulcie. I'm--I 
                        don't... have time for this either. 
                        But, I have so many more of those 
                        cheesy lines. You don't want to 
                        hear them all?

           She's heard them all before. Every cheesy line. But with 
           Bennett she knows they'd sound different. A smile on her 
           lips, but she turns to the cab.

                                 DULCIE
                        ...I have to--

                                 BENNETT
                             (a Hail Mary)
                        My shirt--it’s, uuhhh...
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Dulcie turns to him once again, waiting. 

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        It’s a sign that we should hang 
                        out. ...uh, the “S” is really. For 
                        “Sugar.”

           He knows it’s a stretch. But she can’t resist him. 

                                 DULCIE
                        So you’re “Sugarman”... disguised 
                        as Superman.

           He grins broadly.

                                 BENNETT
                        It’s a great costume. 

           She laughs. A beat. He steps in close. The tension returns. 
           Builds... magnetic.

           He kisses her.

           And she doesn't stop him. It's long and intense. They press 
           against each other. But then, with difficulty, she pries 
           herself away and slips into the cab.

           Bennett watches it drive off, totally consumed by her.

           EXT. PEARSON HOME - DAY

           Dulcie's father, ROBERT PEARSON, 48, opens the door onto the 
           front step of 1120 Bourbon Street; a multi-million dollar 
           historic Creole-cottage home.

           Dressed in a sharp suit, he stoops to get the NEWSPAPER and 
           notices a SMALL BOX addressed to Dulcie. She appears in the 
           doorway, dressed for class.

                                 DULCIE
                        Hey, Daddy can I--

                                 ROBERT
                        Package for you, baby. Be ready in 
                        ten, I'll drop you on my way.

           He kisses the top of her head as he steps back into the house 
           with his paper.

                                 DULCIE
                             (muttering, annoyed)
                        Was gonna ask if I could take the 
                        car.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           She picks up the box and opens it. Inside, assorted WHITE 
           CHOCOLATES and a NOTE.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        Oh, no he didn't.

           She reads the note: DULCIE, THE ALLERGEN IN CHOCOLATE IS A 
           PHENOLIC COMPOUND FOUND IN COCOA POWDER. ONLY COCOA BUTTER, 
           NOT POWDER, IS USED IN WHITE CHOCOLATE. ENJOY. -BENNETT

           She laughs in amazement, touched by this gift, and eats one.

           EXT. UNO AQUATIC CENTER - DAY

           Bennett emerges from practice, headphones blasting. He stops, 
           smiles to find Dulcie waiting for him. She tries 
           unsuccessfully to keep a straight face.

           He approaches. She steps back, puts a hand up. A barrier.

                                 DULCIE
                        Just came to say thank you.

                                 BENNETT
                        Wanna take a walk?

                                 DULCIE
                        Just wanna say thank you.

           He shrugs. They stand at an unnatural distance.

                                 BENNETT
                        It's one thing Mom didn't let 
                        Dulcie eat sweets. Kinda ironic. 
                        But, allergic to chocolate? Just a 
                        damn shame. That from your mom too?

                                 DULCIE
                             (a long beat, deciding)
                        Mmm-mm. She loved chocolate. Wasn't 
                        allergic at all.

           Loved. Wasn't. Bennett looks at her, fascinated.

                                 BENNETT
                        My mom would be rolling in her 
                        grave if I didn't eat sugar. She 
                        was an all-organic, grass-fed 
                        hippy. But sweets were her 
                        weakness.

           He laughs at the memory. Dulcie shares his fascination.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE
                        How old were you?

                                 BENNETT
                        Twelve. You?

                                 DULCIE
                        Twelve. Weird.

           There's a new, unspoken depth to their connection. She 
           softens a little.

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS - DECATUR STREET - DAY

           Bennett and Dulcie walk from the crowded CAFE DU MONDE, 
           eating BEIGNETS. She maintains the unnatural distance between 
           them. He observes the distance with some humor. She notices.

                                 DULCIE
                             (mouth full)
                        What?

           Bennett watches her, enamored. She takes another bite.

                                 BENNETT
                        Nothing. You like it?

           She regards the last half of her beignet. Shrugs.

                                 DULCIE
                        Not bad.

           He laughs. She's devoured the thing.

                                 BENNETT
                        Got some powdered sugar there--

           --On her face. She wipes it away, embarrassed.

                                 DULCIE
                        Guess it's pretty good. Thanks. 
                        You're gonna make me fat.

           He grins, delighted at the long-term implication. Encroaches 
           on her space.

                                 BENNETT
                        I am?

           She rolls her eyes, shoves him away as they step off the 
           stone sidewalk to cross the street. So satisfied that he’s 
           getting to her, he’s still grinning, until--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Mid-crossing, within a matter of moments, a CAR speeds around 
           the corner, its DRIVER distracted. Within a heartbeat more it 
           will hit them, an unaware Dulcie first.  

           Bennett throws Dulcie forward, out of the way, then--

           WHUMP!!!

           He smashes onto the hood, rolls, ejected back onto the 
           asphalt as the car SCREECHES to a stop. 

           Dulcie watches in horror, hardly aware of what just happened. 
           Bennett sits up slowly, rubbing his shoulder, grumbles: 

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Fine. ...I’m fine.

           INT. PEARSON HOME - DAY - LATER

           Dulcie leads a limping Bennett up the STAIRS, on a serious 
           mission. He’s holding an ICE PACK on his shoulder.

                                 BENNETT
                             (grinning, teasing)
                        I think this is too fast. I don't 
                        think I'm ready for this.

           Dulcie glances back at him, rolls her eyes.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You know that car could’ve killed 
                        me.

                                 DULCIE
                        It didn’t hit you that hard.

           But we see the truth in her face. She’s still shaken. 

           GUEST BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A beautiful room, drenched in color. She shows him an ANTIQUE 
           ARMOIRE and a gorgeous WOODEN ROCKING CHAIR beside it. She 
           sits in the chair in reverie, tracing her fingers over a 
           SYMBOL carved into the right arm of the chair.

           The symbol is the VEVE DE ERZULIE.

                                 DULCIE
                        My mother's favorite things.

           Bennett watches her closely. She's nervous.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        She had a PhD in metaphysics and 
                        philosophy of religion. She 
                        believed in this...
                             (re: symbol)
                        The Veve de Erzulie. Symbol of the 
                        Voodoo patron saint of love.

           She checks on Bennett, on his reaction. His face reveals 
           nothing as he takes a seat on the edge of the bed.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D (CONT’D)
                        Magic is a real thing.

           She stops, waits for him to run for the door. He doesn't.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        I know this, because my mother was 
                        an Obeah woman. A conjurer.
                             (long pause)
                        This is where you start laughing 
                        and walk out.

           Bennett crosses his arms, settles in. Something’s really got 
           his attention.

                                 BENNETT
                        I'm very curious.

                                 DULCIE
                        It's...it's an important part of 
                        who I am. My mother was incredibly 
                        gifted. Naturally. Born with magic 
                        in her blood. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Hm. Okay. So, your mom--Mrs. 
                        Pearson...?

                                 DULCIE
                        Roseline.

           Bennett stares at her a beat, almost breathless. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Roseline. What's the most magical 
                        thing she believed?

                                 DULCIE
                        ...She always said love is the most 
                        powerful magic. She got this--
                             (re: the symbol)
                        --tatooed on her arm the year I was 
                        born.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett looks at it, looks away. Gazes at the floor, lost in 
           thought. Silence stretches on, uncomfortable.

           QUICK FLASH of a WOMAN, 37, (we will learn this is his mom, 
           RAE) lying in BED, sunken and purple, a breath from dying. 
           But her eyes dance, watching empty space in sheer awe. Seeing 
           something beautiful. 

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        So. There it is.

           She stands; certain it's over. He stands, not done--

                                 BENNETT
                        Then I guess magic isn't--wasn't... 
                        powerful enough. For her to save 
                        herself. I mean, with real magic 
                        she could've saved herself, right?

           Dulcie freezes, caught between disbelief and anger.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        ...When the tumor in my mom's brain 
                        got big enough, she started to lose 
                        her mind. She’d whisper to me, 
                        Benny--I can see between the 
                        worlds. Kept saying it. That she 
                        could "see between the worlds" like 
                        there was some magic. Like she 
                        wasn't really dying. She and my dad 
                        called in healers. Shamans... but. 
                        She, uh, she died. And my dad--it 
                        destroyed him. There was no magic 
                        to their love.... or, at all.

                                 DULCIE
                             (a beat)
                        Well. I'm sorry. It just doesn't 
                        work that way.

                                 BENNETT
                        Then what's the point?

                                 DULCIE
                        Love changes you. Makes you better. 
                        Shows you something, like, cosmic--
                        yes, magical. Something bigger than 
                        yourself. But I can see you're 
                        unable to grasp that.

           A close, heated moment. She's overly hostile, overly 
           defensive--could slap him or kiss him.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        You like me. More than you think 
                        you should. And what I did in the 
                        street, that scares you. So you 
                        brought me here to scare me off. 
                        But isn't that like the opposite of 
                        what you supposedly believe?

           She glares at him. The thin line between love and hate at its 
           thinnest. He's right.

                                 DULCIE
                        That car could’ve killed you.

                                 BENNETT
                             (smiles)
                        ...It didn’t hit me that hard.

           She rolls her eyes, but finally gives in, steps toward him--
           and kisses him. A deep, free-falling kiss.

           INT./EXT. MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT

           Wardrobe/seasons shows passage of about three months:

           -Bennett and Dulcie walk hand-in-hand along the MISSISSIPPI 
           RIVER on a beautiful NIGHT. Lights glimmer on the water's 
           surface. They talk and laugh, bundled in warm clothes.

           -Bennett with Dulcie and her friends, Clay and Olivia, all at 
           a BARACK OBAMA RALLY.

           -Bennett and Dulcie sit and talk in JACKSON SQUARE with their 
           CAFE DU MONDE beignets and coffees.

           -Bennett and Dulcie alone in the UNO AQUATIC CENTER. She 
           laughs and squeals as he throws her into the pool. THEN--a 
           close, sweet moment in the pool. Madly in love.

           -Dulcie straddles Bennett in the back seat of his CAR as they 
           make out. She removes her panties from beneath her skirt. 
           It's clumsy, but no lack of passion.

           -A nervous Bennett on the freezing doorstep of 1120 BOURBON 
           STREET, dressed in a suit jacket and holding flowers. Robert 
           lets him in, with no warmth to the welcome.

           INT. PEARSON HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bennett, Dulcie, and Robert sit around a formal dining table 
           inside this immaculate home, eating dinner. Tense silence. 
           Bennett fidgets with his napkin, nervous.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE
                        Oh, Daddy, did I tell you? Bennett 
                        is undefeated this season. He's 
                        come in first every meet.

                                 ROBERT
                             (nodding, unimpressed)
                        And what do your parents do, 
                        Bennett?

                                 BENNETT
                        My dad owns a hardware store back 
                        home in LA. Built it from the 
                        ground up. And, uh, my mom died 
                        when I was twelve. It's something 
                        Dulcie and I have in common.

           UNDER THE TABLE, Dulcie takes Bennett's trembling hand. He 
           looks at her--they share a deep understanding, beyond 
           words... Robert just barely nods again, yet unimpressed.

                                 ROBERT
                        What does your father say about you 
                        not declaring a major?

                                 BENNETT
                        ...He doesn't say--he doesn't know--
                        we, we don't talk. About that.

                                 DULCIE
                        Daddy, Bennett's at UNO on a full 
                        scholarship.

                                 ROBERT
                             (feigning shock)
                        An academic scholarship. That's 
                        wonderful!

                                 BENNETT
                        No. Uh, no, sir. It's an athletic 
                        scholarship. For swim. ...I'm 
                        faster than Clay.

           Bennett laughs sheepishly. Robert is unamused.

           EXT. PEARSON HOME - LATER

           Dulcie and Bennett walk to his car, both shivering in the 
           winter cold. They're angry, distant.

                                 BENNETT
                        I thought it was worth mentioning!
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE
                        Clay is pre-med and has a 3.9 GPA!

                                 BENNETT
                        We both knew this was going to 
                        happen. We both knew he would hate 
                        me! It's because I'm white!

                                 DULCIE
                        Do NOT. Don't even go there. He has 
                        been hard on all colors of guys 
                        I've brought home!

                                 BENNETT
                        All colors of guys?? Really? That 
                        many? How many guys exactly?

                                 DULCIE
                        Don't get off subject.

                                 BENNETT
                        Right. Right. I'd hate to stray 
                        from Dulcie's father hates me to 
                        all the colors of guys Dulcie's 
                        been with. I mean, I don't know 
                        which one I'm more excited about.

                                 DULCIE
                        Will you stop?!
                             (a long, heated silence)
                        This was why--I knew this wasn't 
                        going to work.

                                 BENNETT
                        Wh--Dulcie. This is, this is 
                        just...your dad hates me. So what?

                                 DULCIE
                        He's protective. And this is it.
                             (she shifts, looks away)
                        This is where we stop seeing each 
                        other. I'm leaving for law school 
                        this summer anyway, and--

                                 BENNETT
                        You can't be serious! That's crazy! 
                        How can you let him dictate your 
                        life like this? You realize you're 
                        acting like a child.

           She knows he's right, but she's prideful and guarded. This is 
           hard for her--uncharted territory. It hurts...
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE
                             (walking away)
                        ...Yeah, I think we're done here.

                                 BENNETT
                        Stubborn as a child, too!

                                 DULCIE
                             (stops, turns)
                        When my mother died it was 
                        like...like...he thought I was made 
                        of glass! Like I could break if I 
                        stepped outside the front door. And 
                        if I so much as scraped a knee--my 
                        god, the field trips I missed. 
                        Prom? With the drinking? No way. 
                        Living in the dorms or my own 
                        place? Nope. I'm pretty sure he 
                        would actually have a heart attack 
                        if anything happened to me. 
                        And...he's all I have.

           She fights tears, shrugs...it's over.

                                 BENNETT
                        What about the whole "love is 
                        magic" thing? You're supposed to 
                        prove that to me! Not prove I was 
                        right! Not prove that being stupid 
                        enough to love someone just brings--
                        just brings...

           Dulcie shakes her head, heartbroken. Humiliated.

                                 DULCIE
                        He'll stop paying my tuition. I 
                        won't graduate.

                                 BENNETT
                        ...When did he say that?

                                 DULCIE
                        While you were helping with the 
                        dishes.
                             (a beat, a heavy breath)
                        There's something else I should 
                        tell you...

           Bennett swells with anger, not listening. He paces a few 
           moments. Looks at her, tears in his eyes--

           And drops to one knee. No ring. This is impromptu. He takes 
           one of Dulcie's hands as she gapes at him.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        I love you. Oh my god, I am so in 
                        love with you, Dulcie. Magic or 
                        not, I've loved you since our first 
                        dance. And I don't want to lose 
                        you. Not to your dad, not to law 
                        school... I--I have a shitty GPA. 
                        Your dad might hate me forever. 
                        I'll probably never be a doctor. I 
                        win races. But, but the only thing, 
                        in this entire world, that matters 
                        to me is--is winning you--Jesus 
                        that was terrible. That was 
                        cheesy...Sounded so good in my 
                        head.

           Dulcie is crying. She adores him. He looks up at her.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Dulcie...marry me.

           INT. PEARSON HOME - ENTRY FOYER - AFTERNOON

           Dulcie arrives home with her schoolbag.

                                 DULCIE
                        Daddy?

           No answer. She heads upstairs and into the--

           GUEST BEDROOM

           Where she creeps to the antique armoire. She opens it, pulls 
           a PINK VINTAGE SUITCASE from the bottom, then parts a rack of 
           women's clothing to pull out an IVORY WEDDING DRESS covered 
           in clear plastic. Dulcie holds it up to herself, beaming.

           As she sways with the dress, a FEW TATTERED BOOKS stacked on 
           the top shelf of the armoir catch her eye. 

           She slides her fingers down the spine of one book. It reads:

           “LOVE AND THE SACRED MULTIVERSE” BY ROSELINE PEARSON

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                             (whispers, to book)
                        You’d love him. 

           EXT. PEARSON HOME - MINUTES LATER

           Dulcie leaves her house, toting the PINK VINTAGE SUITCASE, 
           schoolbag, and books. Bennett is standing outside his car, 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           waiting for her. They share a nervous, wild smile.

           INT./EXT. BENNETT'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY

           Bennett turns from a main street and approaches a toll to a 
           bridge that stretches further than the eye can see. LAKE 
           PONTCHARTRAIN CAUSEWAY. A sign reads TO MANDEVILLE.

                                 DULCIE
                        Just wait til you see where my mom 
                        and dad got married. The Mandeville 
                        courthouse is... it's perfect.

           EXT. MANDEVILLE COURTHOUSE - DAY

           An historic white building. Quaint and beautiful.

           INT. MANDEVILLE COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Bennett and Dulcie wait in a small STAGING ROOM, tense with 
           excitement. She wears her mother's wedding dress. He's in a 
           modest suit and LACE-UP BOOTS.

           The MUFFLED VOICES OF WEDDING PROCEEDINGS float in from one 
           room over. Bennett and Dulcie are up next. She holds a 
           BOUQUET OF YELLOW DAISIES, smells them, whispers--

                                 DULCIE
                        Thank you. They were her favorite? 

           Bennett nods. They share that wild, nervous smile again. She 
           laughs as she muses:

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        It'll be perfect. You know why? 
                        Because our marriage will age like, 
                        sorta like dog years, in reverse. 
                        So when people are normally four 
                        years in, it'll be our first 
                        anniversary...We’ll still be having 
                        sex at least six nights a week.

                                 BENNETT
                             (softly laughing)
                        Dog years in reverse is good.

                                 DULCIE 
                        Mm-hmm. Our seven-year itch won’t 
                        happen for...28 years.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. MANDEVILLE COURTHOUSE - SAME

           ALL MOS: A small judicial room. Bennett and Dulcie face each 
           other before a PODIUM, holding hands. 

           CLOSE on a MARRIAGE LICENSE on the podium; two blank 
           signature lines. Dulcie signs. Then Bennett signs.

           Beneath reads: FEBRUARY 29th, 2008

                                 DULCIE (V.O.)
                        Bennett... I vow to be by your side 
                        every day. I vow to always eat 
                        chocolate with you.

           LATER, behind the podium, an OFFICIANT in a black robe 
           speaks. Clay stands off to the side, recording on an EARLY 
           iPHONE MODEL.

                                 DULCIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I vow to love you until my dying 
                        breath, and to prove the magic of 
                        our love to you every chance I get. 

           LATER, they exchange rings and Bennett kisses his bride.

                                 DULCIE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I vow to you that our dance will be 
                        the dance of my soul, and our song 
                        will be the song of my heart. 
                        Always. 

           LATER, Bennett and Dulcie hold each other close, dancing 
           before the podium as if no one else exists in the world.

           EXT. MANDEVILLE COURTHOUSE - LATER

           Robert pulls up to the curb outside the courthouse in a 
           VINTAGE MERCEDES, with Olivia in the passenger seat.

           INSIDE HIS CAR:

                                 OLIVIA
                        I told 'em they're crazy.

                                 ROBERT
                        Thank you, Olivia. Stay here.

           He gets OUT OF THE CAR. She ignores him and follows. Just as 
           he's heading for the courthouse entrance--

           Bennett and Dulcie come spilling through the doors, giddy. 
           Clay is right behind them. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           All three stop short when they see Robert. He rushes toward 
           Dulcie, seizes her by the arm and starts dragging her back to 
           his car.

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        And in this dress?! You lost your 
                        damn mind?! This isn't how it's 
                        gonna go.

           Dulcie resists his grasp. Bennett follows close beside them, 
           helpless. Clay and Olivia watch.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                             (to Bennett)
                        You get the hell outta here!

                                 BENNETT
                        Please, sir. I love your daughter 
                        very much.

                                 DULCIE
                        Stop, Dad, I love him! This is 
                        crazy, let me go! It's too late, 
                        we're married!!

                                 ROBERT
                        Oh, I know people who can fix this. 
                        Trust me, we're gonna fix this.

           Robert forces her into his car. Bennett makes a run for his 
           own car, to follow them.

           INT. MERCEDES - LAKE PONT. CAUSEWAY - MINUTES LATER

           Robert speeds over the causeway, fuming. Dulcie cries in the 
           passenger seat, clutching the MARRIAGE LICENSE and her DAISY 
           BOUQUET.

                                 DULCIE
                        You can't just undo my marriage. 
                        It's my marriage! You of all people 
                        should understand this!

           Robert doesn't respond. He glances in the REARVIEW, sees 
           Bennett tailing him. He speeds up, weaves between cars.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                             (re: marriage license)
                        This is more than some legal paper! 
                        I'm not a child! You can't erase 
                        it! You can't--

           He snatches it out of her hands as--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           UP AHEAD, vehicles suddenly slow down to heed a flashing 
           sign: GO SLOW>>>LOW FOG

           Dulcie reaches to snatch it back. Robert, preoccupied, 
           doesn't see the cars in front of him stopped. He's still 
           flying at 65 mph. Dulcie notices just in time.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Dad!!

           Robert slams on his breaks, but--

           The car skids, fishtails, moments from smashing into traffic. 
           Robert cranks the wheel to the right. The car swerves, just 
           before impact--

           And CRASHES through the guardrail. It plummets, plunging 
           through the thinly frozen lake 15 feet below.

           EXT. LAKE PONT. CAUSEWAY - SAME

           Bennett's car SCREECHES to a stop behind them. He jumps out, 
           races across the causeway--sees Robert's car sinking beneath 
           the lake surface.

           He dives from the bridge into the frigid water.

           EXT. LAKE PONT. - UNDER WATER - SAME

           Through the MURKY BROWN WORLD, Bennett swims after the car as 
           it drifts to the lake floor 12 feet below.

           INSIDE THE SUBMERGED MERCEDES Robert unbuckles himself, then 
           Dulcie. She's panicking. The car twists, drifting sideways, 
           until it settles on its driver side on the lake floor.

           Bennett reaches the passenger side, looks in. Dulcie tries 
           the door. It won't open. Bennett points to the manual lock. 
           She pulls up on it, tries the handle again. It clicks!

           She pushes to open it as Bennett pulls. The pressure is too 
           heavy. Robert tries. He and Bennett get it open just wide 
           enough. Robert holds it as Dulcie slips through, and swims 
           out right behind her. The door closes on itself.

           Pained for breath, all three clamber towards the surface.

           But Dulcie stops short.

           The train of her dress is caught in the door. Bennett swims 
           back down as Robert, unknowing, keeps swimming for the 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           surface. Bennett pulls on the dress. It won't tear.

           Dulcie claws for air, choking on water, starting to convulse. 
           Her nose bleeds.

           Bennett tries to open the door. Too heavy. He heaves...

           Robert swims back down now and helps. Together, they open the 
           door. Release Dulcie's dress. Free her. But--

           Her arms suspend in the water. She’s gone still. No longer 
           struggling. Bennett holds her and swims to the surface.

           EXT. LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN - ABOVE WATER - SAME

           Bennett and Robert burst through the surface, sucking in air, 
           wheezing and coughing. Dulcie is limp in Bennett’s arms.

           CARS on the bridge are stopped. A CROWD OF PEOPLE stand 
           looking over into the lake. GASPS and MURMURS. People CALL 
           OUT TO THEM, MAKE PHONE CALLS.

           Bennett cradles Dulcie, whose lips are blue. He slaps her.

                                 BENNETT
                        Dulcie! Dulcie! Wake up!

           No response. SIRENS approach in the distance.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Bennett lies awake in a hospital bed, BANDAGES, BREATHING 
           TUBE. Distressed and anxious, he's ready to get up and walk 
           out of there. Clay enters.

                                 BENNETT
                        Clay!! Clay, you seen Dulcie?? 
                        They're not--they won't--I need--

                                 CLAY
                        No, I don't know. Hey, lay back, 
                        man. Lay back. Relax. I haven't 
                        seen her. Or Mr. Pearson. You ok?

           Bennett broods--a caged animal. He pulls the tube off his 
           face and gets up. A DOCTOR enters.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Whoa. Easy. Mr. Carter, you've been 
                        in shock, not to mention 
                        hypothermic. You need to rest.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        How's Dulcie? I need to see her.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Right now, I just need you to lay--

                                 BENNETT
                        I need to see Dulcie!! How is she?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Please. I need you to be calm.

                                 BENNETT
                             (in his face, agitated)
                        WHERE'S DULCIE?! WHERE IS SHE?!!

                                 CLAY
                        Man, relax!

                                 DOCTOR
                        I need a nurse in here please!

           A MALE NURSE runs in as Bennett grabs the doctor. The nurse 
           forces him to bed. He fights. Clay helps, they overpower him. 
           The doctor gives Bennett a shot. The room blurs.

           HOURS LATER

           Bennett blinks, opens his eyes, lies motionless. Clay is 
           still in the room, crying now. 

           Bennett's father, JACK CARTER, 45, the stoic type, stands in 
           the doorway. The doctor talks to Jack in a hushed tone. They 
           don't realize Bennett has woken, or that he's listening.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        --Plenty of excellent grief 
                        specialists you'll want to make 
                        sure he talks to. Considering Ms. 
                        Pearson was eight weeks pregnant, 
                        he may take her death even harder. 
                        As his father, you'll likely be a 
                        stronghold for him, so I advise...

           In a world of shock and pain, Bennett shuts his eyes.

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS - AQUATIC CENTER - NIGHT

           Quiet. Empty. Bennett sits in a far corner of the bleachers. 
           As far as possible from the pool. He stares at the water. So 
           still, serene. Always like home before. But now... haunting. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           He looks down at his wedding ring, spins it around and around 
           on his finger. 

           NIGHT LAPSES TO DAY--

           as the BLEACHERS fill--a CROWD CHEERS. SWIMMERS are mid-race.

           POV IN THROUGH EXT. WINDOW 

           as Clay reaches the wall, others finish behind him. A BUZZER 
           SOUNDS. CHEERS ERUPT.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Clay Harrison for Dillard in 
                        first...

           And we find it’s BENNET’S POV; he stands outside looking in. 
           He watches Clay's COACH help him out of the pool. But Clay 
           doesn’t celebrate, the win feels empty.

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF NEW ORLEANS - ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

           Rows upon rows of white folding chairs filled by HUNDREDS OF 
           STUDENTS in GRADUATION REGALIA. Bennett sits among them, 
           indifferent.

                                 FEMALE DEAN (O.S.)
                        And now, if the 2008 College of 
                        Business Administration would 
                        please rise...

           Bennett stands with his fellow graduates. 

           EXT. LONG BEACH, CA - JACK'S HOME - DAY

           Bennett's packed car is parked along the curb in front of a 
           modest suburban house (which we recognize from the earlier 
           flashback). He and Jack unload the car.

           INT. JACK'S HOME - BENNETT'S ROOM - LATER

           The same as Bennett must have left it when he was 18 years 
           old. He's taking down old stuff and unpacking when a 
           PHOTOGRAPH in a corkboard distracts him.

           CLOSE on this picture of himself as a kid (10) with his mom,  
           RAE (35), pretty, vibrant. She and Bennett are all smiles at 
           the beach, the ocean behind them.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           EXT. CARTER'S HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT

           A small, Whole Foods-adjacent hardware store in a strip mall.

           INT. CARTER'S HARDWARE STORE - SAME

           Quaint, but fully stocked and moderately busy. Bennett works 
           a cash register, rings up supplies for an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. 
           His hair is longer now, he looks a little older.

           Her eyes linger on his. She smiles. He smiles back, awkward, 
           then not-so-subtly removes his work gloves, revealing his 
           WEDDING RING. He still wears it.

                                 BENNETT
                        Easier without the gloves.

           She nods, taking the hint.

           LATER - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Bennett helps VARIOUS PEOPLE with DIY projects. He measures 
           and cuts wooden boards and planks. Shows customers what color 
           paint to buy; nails, screws, tools. He helps some of them map 
           out their plans. He seems to enjoy his work.

           INT. JACK'S HOME - GARAGE - DAY

           Bennett works at a workbench, bobbing to headphones. His hair 
           is even longer now, pulled back in a bun. His face is scruffy 
           with beard growth.

           He wears GOGGLES, GLOVES, smooths wood with an ELECTRIC 
           SANDER. Other stained pieces sit aside to dry. Jack enters.

                                 JACK
                        New project?

           Bennett stops sanding. He looks around. Shrugs. Nods. Jack 
           crosses the garage to the other side, where we see--

           Two WOODEN ROCKING CHAIRS, side by side. They're replicas of 
           Dulcie's mother's, down to the VEVE DE ERZULIE carving. 
           Bennett has enough pieces to build at least three more.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Rocking chairs. Anything else?

                                 BENNETT
                        I like making them. They're 
                        beautiful pieces of furniture.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett turns to start sanding again. Jack quickens, 
           navigating uncomfortable territory--

                                 JACK
                        They are. They're extraordinary.
                             (a beat)
                        Hey. You hungry?

                                 BENNETT
                        I could eat.

           LATER - DUSK

           Jack and Bennett sit in rocking chairs. They eat from a box 
           of pizza on the ground, drink beer, watch the street. Lost 
           for words.

           Each is stuck beneath a hard shell, but especially Jack--he's 
           been at numbness a long time. He curiously runs a hand over 
           the VEVE DE ERZULIE, doesn't inquire.

                                 JACK
                             (rocking in his chair)
                        These are nice. Comfortable. Solid.

           Bennett nods and raises his beer to that. Passing cars fill a 
           long silence.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        So. Your hair's gotten...long.

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah.

           Jack regards the WEDDING RING on Bennett's finger. He’s 
           uncomfortable broaching the subject, it’s painful:

                                 JACK
                        ...Therapy’s still an option.

           Bennett shoots him a "You fucking kidding me?" look.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Almost four years. February 29th is 
                        around the corner and you become a 
                        one-man rocking chair factory...

                                 BENNETT
                        So therapy. Because that worked so 
                        well for you. Oh wait--you never 
                        tried it.

           Bennett downs his beer, tosses his remaining slice back into 
           the box and stands to put his work gear back on.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 JACK
                        This isn't about me.

                                 BENNETT
                        I’ve finally gotten your attention? 
                        It’s about me now? It’s my turn?

           Jack watches him...knows he deserves every word. He makes an 
           attempt at redemption, or atonement at least:

                                 JACK
                        You know, I never told you this, 
                        but I dream about her. All the 
                        time. She brings me daisies, these 
                        bright yellow daisies. They were 
                        our--

                                 BENNETT
                        Your wedding flower, yes, I know.

                                 JACK
                        Fine. Look. I wasn't there for you 
                        when your mom died, it emptied me 
                        out. But I know what that emptiness 
                        looks like and I see it in you. You 
                        don't wanna listen to me, fine. I 
                        get it. I was a mess. I'm still a 
                        mess... Still never cleaned her 
                        office... 

                                 BENNETT
                        Well it wasn’t just my wife. Had a 
                        kid, too. Both gone. 

           Jack watches the street, hardly knows how to look at his son.

                                 JACK
                        I--I know. And I don't want what’s 
                        become of my life to be yours. I 
                        want you to...move on. You should 
                        talk to someone, and I know it 
                        isn't me. If it's not a therapist, 
                        then, you should--I think you 
                        should...talk to Robert.

           Bennett shoots the same crazy look as before. Jack keeps his 
           eyes focused on a passing car.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I bought you a plane ticket. Just a 
                        cheap red eye, so you'll get there 
                        on the 29th.

           Bennett considers this as Jack collects the pizza and beer.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Go see him. You know, closure. Just 
                        think about it.

           Jack leaves Bennett to his thoughts and his sanding.

           INT. JACK'S HOME - BENNETT'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Bennett struggles to pack a suitcase, uncertain whether he 
           wants closure.

           INT. JACK'S HOME - BATHROOM - LATER

           Bennett stands before the mirror over the sink. He grazes his 
           beard, runs a hand through his hair--

           Then proceeds to shave his head with electric clippers. REAR 
           POV OVER BENNETT'S SHOULDER: He grazes his fingers over his 
           smooth buzzed head like freedom. He shaves his beard next.

           INT. AIRPLANE - TAKE OFF - NIGHT

           Bennett stares out the window. The WOMAN BESIDE HIM puts in 
           earplugs, dozes off. The city disappears below as he puts in 
           headphones and pulls his BEANIE down over his eyes. The 
           muffled sound of A FAST SUBLIME SONG plays.

           MORNING

           QUEEN'S I WANT TO BREAK FREE is playing. We pass empty row 
           after empty row, until we reach Bennett's row, where he's 
           passed out. (The Queen song is coming from his earbuds.) A 
           mature FLIGHT ATTENDANT leans over and shakes him gently.

           Bennett startles, pulls out his earbuds and looks at her.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Sir, we've landed. It's a quarter 
                        past seven. Everyone has de-planed.

           He gets his bearings. A glance at her NAMETAG, which bears a 
           wings emblem and the name PARKER. He nods, stands and hurries 
           off the plane. 

           He nods to the PILOT on his way out.

           INT. LOUIS ARMSTRONG NEW ORLEANS INT'L AIRPORT - DAY

           Bennett approaches BAGGAGE CLAIM. He waits nervously for his 
           bag. The carousel hasn't started yet.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           A glance around, unsure when he'll see Robert. He checks his 
           cell. No missed calls. Turns his attention back to baggage. 
           The carousel revs into motion. Bags spill onto the belt. 
           Bennett spots his bag. And behind it--

           A PINK VINTAGE SUITCASE spills onto the belt. He stares at 
           it. Unmistakable. He waits to see who will claim it. It makes 
           a second round on the carousel. Ownerless. He edges toward 
           it, to look at the luggage tag, as--

           A LITTLE GIRL, 3, pummels his leg. Startled, he looks down at 
           her. The beautiful, olive-skinned, curly-haired girl gazes 
           up, adoring. She raises her arms.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dad-deeeeeeee.

           Bennett glances around, crouches down to her.

                                 BENNETT
                        Hi. You lost? What's your name?

           The little girl giggles and throws her arms around his neck. 
           Bennett looks to the luggage belt again, bewildered. And now--
           the pink suitcase is gone...

           It suddenly SMACKS down on the floor next to him, a woman's 
           legs beside it.

                                 DULCIE (O.S.)
                        Hon, really? It went around the 
                        thing like four times. You still 
                        asleep? C'mon, the rental's ready.

           Bennett freezes. Not a breath from his lips. He can't look. 

           And, like an alarm, a light, shrill BEEP!--

           Sends Bennett’s world out of focus. This little girl's sweet 
           face, so close to his, flits with light from behind, casting 
           a glow like a halo. BEEP! Her laughter echoes. And then, 
           there, crouching perfectly clear into his view--

           Dulcie. Now 25 years old. Her face wrought with worry.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Helloooo?

           BEEP! BEEP!--a TSA CART drives past, its rhythmic beep 
           clearing the way. Bennett is transfixed. Paralyzed.

                                 BENNETT
                             (sotto)
                        It’s not real.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Snapping out of it, he pushes the girl--EMMA--away as he 
           stands. He rushes toward no place in particular, just to get 
           away. But Dulcie follows, scooping up Emma, who’s crying now. 

                                 DULCIE
                        Hey, what--you're scaring Emma. 
                        ...You're scaring me. Where are you 
                        going?

           She grabs him, turns him by his shoulder. He stares, awed.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god, Bennett... Did you leave 
                        something on the plane??

           He glances around. PEOPLE stare and whisper. Among them, the 
           flight attendant who woke him on the plane.  

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        Bennett...?

           He studies her, taking her in. An apparition. A ghost. With a 
           shaking hand, he touches her cheeks, then her lips.

                                 BENNETT
                        You. This--this beautiful girl--

                                 DULCIE
                        Emma? Our daughter??

                                 BENNETT
                        It's like you’re really here. 

                                 DULCIE
                        Really here? What--we are. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Like you’re... alive.

           Dulcie blinks. Her eyes well with tears as she absorbs this 
           unsettling mystery. But her bewilderment quickly dissolves to 
           anger--this must be a joke. She soothes Emma, grabs her bag. 

                                 DULCIE
                        The car’s ready.

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS, LA - PEARSON HOME - LATER

           Dulcie parks their rental car out front. She gets out, 
           Bennett slow to follow. She watches him as he regards the 
           wintry street, the house, like a frozen memory.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           She seems to have some new understanding--whatever he must've 
           told her on the car ride.

           Robert suddenly rushes out the front door in a suit, carrying 
           a packed suitbag and briefcase.

                                 DULCIE
                        Dad! Where you going? I thought 
                        you'd be at the office.

                                 ROBERT
                        Hi baby. Had to collect some 
                        things. Doug is terribly ill, have 
                        to cover him in court tomorrow in 
                        Jackson. Won't be back tonight.

           Bennett watches their interaction, stupefied. Robert kisses 
           Dulcie's cheek, shakes Bennett's hand, and hails a cab. As 
           he's getting in--

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        I am so sorry you kids came all 
                        this way. I'll make it up to you. 
                        Dinner tomorrow night. You choose 
                        the place. A nice one. Love you!

                                 DULCIE
                        Love you!

           Dulcie looks to Bennett, observes his perplexity and unease. 
           She wraps her arms around him. He resists at first, but 
           slowly surrenders to a deep hug.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        See? I didn’t...die. No one died. 
                        We were so lucky. 

           He glances at Emma, asleep in her car seat. Dulcie begins to 
           sway, like there's music playing. He can't help but sway with 
           her. And soon it's some rendition of a slow swing-waltz. 
           CLOSE on Bennett, smiling, as--

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett and Dulcie slow dancing in the 
           COURTHOUSE STAGING ROOM on their wedding day. Intense love.

           EXT. PEARSON HOME - SAME

           Dulcie and Bennett dance on the sidewalk. He twirls her, lets 
           the moment take him. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. PEARSON HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           The ARMOIR and ROCKING CHAIR are still there, but the room 
           looks different than it used to. It’s tidy, feels emptier, 
           things have been moved around--and removed. 

           As Bennett unpacks alone, he can’t help staring at Dulcie's 
           pink suitcase.

           He turns his attention to the rocking chair, walks toward it, 
           removing his beanie, just as--

           He glimpses himself in the armoire MIRROR. Stops, startled. 
           And WE SEE--his hair...is a medium length. He examines that 
           which he just buzzed off yesterday as Dulcie enters.

                                 DULCIE
                        Our little trouble maker is down 
                        for the count.

           She unpacks. He hedges around a question, glances around, 
           passively noticing a WATER STAIN in the ceiling...

                                 BENNETT
                        Why didn't you tell me you were 
                        pregnant?

           Dulcie looks strangely at him. Thinks a moment, realizing.

                                 DULCIE
                        I was scheduled for an abortion the 
                        same week you proposed.

                                 BENNETT
                             (stung)
                        Is that why you said yes?

                                 DULCIE
                        Bennett. I said yes because I fell 
                        madly in love with you. And I was 
                        going to give you the sonogram on 
                        our wedding day. But...plans 
                        changed. So I gave it to you in the 
                        hospital as a--BIG surprise. You 
                        were so excited. You were in love 
                        with her right then.
                             (touching his face, his 
                              forehead)
                        There's really something going on 
                        with you.

                                 BENNETT
                        Can I see it? The sonogram?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE
                        Do you still keep it in your 
                        wallet?

           Bennett takes out his wallet. Opens it. From within the cash 
           slot, he removes a folded black and white SONOGRAM of 
           prenatal Emma. He stares. Fascination and sadness.

           His sensibility pulls Dulcie in--like a constant force of 
           gravity; she can’t fight it, and she would never want to be 
           released from it... Suddenly, she makes for the armoir as:

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        I have a crazy idea...

           She throws its doors open--

           To find it empty. No rack of clothing. No books. She pauses, 
           thinks, momentarily averted. But then, turning to Bennett, a 
           fondness for this crazy idea lights up her face.

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS - STREETS - DAY

           Dulcie walks at a brisk pace, Bennett right on her heels, 
           carrying Emma. Life feels almost normal again--everything is 
           alive. Live MUSICIANS play along the narrow street, DAY 
           DRINKERS hang over painted balconies above. 

           Bennett can’t help smiling. This feels like how it should be. 

           Dulcie clips along, past CAFES, PUBS, TAROT SHOPS and 
           CRAWFISH JOINTS. He watches her, reaches for her hand. Now 
           with the presence of mind to--notice her.

                                 BENNETT
                        You cut your hair. I like it. 

                                 DULCIE
                             (smiling)
                        Cut it a couple years ago.

           And then he realizes...he doesn't know his own life.

                                 BENNETT
                        How--uh--how've you been?

           They both laugh strangely at the gravity of such a simple 
           question. She’s unsure how to answer, slows her pace a bit. 

                                 DULCIE
                        Uhh, good. Pretty good. Kicking ass 
                        in law school. Second year in, top 
                        of my class.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Proud and enamored, he watches her with that old, all-
           consumed look he used to. She continues, with an edge of 
           strain in her voice now...

                                 DUCLIE (CONT'D)
                        And you. You're... Best dad. Best 
                        cook.

           Bennett notices her rigidity. But he diverts, whispers:

                                 BENNETT
                        And the, uh, the sex? Am I getting 
                        enough sugar?

           Dulcie laughs, nods. They hold each other's gaze a beat, 
           until she sucker punches him:

                                 DULCIE
                        Less sugar now with your med school 
                        applications.

                                 BENNETT
                        Med school? Me? I’m--

           She’d already forgotten. She nods, mulling over his surprise.

                                 DULCIE
                        This reminds me of a time you got 
                        stitches.
                             (off his silent confusion)
                        You fell off a ladder in our 
                        backyard. Hit your head on this old 
                        brick and your memory was off for a 
                        day or two...Twelve stitches? Ring 
                        any bells? Right back there.

           Bennett touches the back of his head, surprised when he feels 
           something. She watches him, intrigued.

                                 DULCIE (PRE-LAP)(CONT’D) 
                        I don’t know what’s going on with 
                        you... 

           EXT. OCCULT BOOKSHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Dulcie tugs Bennett along faster, and in through the doors.

                                 DULCIE (PRE-LAP) 
                        ...I’m sure you think this is 
                        ridiculous. But. You’re the one 
                        saying I--died... 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. OCCULT BOOKSHOP - MINUTES LATER

                                 DULCIE (O.S.)
                        ...Saying you have this other life. 

           Rows and rows and stacks upon stacks of books. Old oak from 
           floor to ceiling, a winding staircase to reach the height of 
           the rear bookshelf. Tables of sage, incense, and crystals.

           We find Dulcie, scanning the shelves for titles as she leads 
           Bennett down one row. He follows close, absorbing this place.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        So I thought, why not just... We 
                        can call Dr. Matthews when we get 
                        back, too. I think we should.  

           She turns to him. He’s confounded--by many things.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Matthews is the psychiatrist I 
                        saw after the accident. You didn’t 
                        want to see anyone.

           She stops suddenly. She’s found the BOOK she was looking for, 
           slides it from the shelf and hands it to Bennett.

           “LOVE AND THE SACRED MULTIVERSE” BY ROSELINE PEARSON

           He skims the cover with immediate aversion. Emma, still in 
           Bennett’s arms, points at the book.

                                 EMMA
                        Grammee.

                                 DULCIE
                        Yeah, baby. That’s right, Grammy.
                             (to Bennett, a hint of 
                              resentment)
                        It’s a great book. I’ve tried to 
                        share it with you many times, but 
                        you avoid it like the plague. My 
                        mom was the premier metaphysical 
                        author of her time. Not so long 
                        ago. It’s out of print now, but 
                        it’s like a collector’s item. 

           Bennett takes a long time with it, heavy with old grief. 
           Something flares in him, just like the day she read his Tarot 
           cards. He tries to blink it away.

                                 BENNETT
                        No disrespect to your mom.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           He shakes his head, hands the book back to her. She looks 
           stung. But it’s not a new hurt. This has been there. 

                                 DULCIE
                        At least open it. 

           He’s already turned, heading back for the entrance. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Nothing in that book is going to 
                        bring you back.

                                 DULCIE
                        Bring me back? I’m right here. Your 
                        daughter is right here. 

           He takes Dulcie’s hand, benign in his refusal. He pulls her 
           toward the exit the same way she pulled him in. 

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                             (reciting, memorized)
                        “Parallel universes: universes, 
                        dimensions, worlds, realities 
                        separated from each other by a 
                        single quantum event. Portals often 
                        open when consequence diverges from 
                        intended path, such as accident--”

                                 BENNETT
                        --Let’s call Dr--who?--Matthews?

           She gives up, rolling her eyes as they push through the door.

           EXT. DECATUR STREET/CAFE DU MONDE - LATER - DUSK

           The streets are more crowded at the onset of night. Dulcie 
           and Bennett walk hand in hand, but in silence, slowly 
           approaching the cafe. There’s a strain, a tension between 
           them that feels older than a single day. Emma fusses.

                                 EMMA
                        Daddeee, I need to go pee-pee. 

           Before Bennett can respond, Dulcie is pulling her from him.

                                 DULCIE
                        I’ll take her. Grab us beignets, 
                        and grab me a coffee please. 

           And the two are gone, Dulcie pushing into the restaurant, 
           disappearing in the CROWD. Bennett fights the throng of 
           people, trying to find his place in a line that stretches 
           onto the sidewalk.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. CAFE DU MONDE - LATER

           Bennett orders at the counter. 

           LATER

           Bennett balances TWO COFFEES and a PAPER BAG of beignets as 
           he stands off to the side. Tries to avoid being bumped into. 
           He glances around for Dulcie and Emma. 

           LATER - NIGHT

           Bennett shoves through the cafe, back out to the--

           SIDEWALK OUTSIDE

           Searching the crowd of TOURISTS, LOCALS, street VENDORS, 
           ARTISTS... he spots a WOMAN and CHILD... takes a step--

           Someone bumps him, knocking one coffee to the ground. A 
           momentary annoyance, but he doesn’t care. Panic wells within 
           as he looks around...

                                 BENNETT
                        Dulcie?

           He turns, on tip toes, searching atop heads.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Dulcie! Emma?

           He paces down the sidewalk, around the outside of the cafe 
           and down a CORRIDOR to the--

           RESTROOMS

           He scans the line of PEOPLE WAITING. No Dulcie. No Emma. He's 
           on the brink of a meltdown, rushes back out to the--

           SIDEWALK

           And nearly runs right into Dulcie, walking Emma along by the 
           hand. Bennett lurches forward, wraps his arms around Dulcie, 
           realizing only now that he hasn’t been breathing.

                                 DULCIE
                        Sshhhh. Shhh. Sshhhhh. We're here 
                        baby. It's okay. We're here.

                                 BENNETT
                        I'm so--I'm sorry.

           Bennett catches his breath. He scoops Emma into his arms.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE
                        I’m sorry. The line took forever, 
                        and then we couldn’t find you. 

           Bennett wipes at his eyes, misty. His hands tremble as he 
           extends Dulcie’s coffee.

                                 BENNETT
                        Probably cold now. Mine spilled. I 
                        can get in line again. 

           Dulcie shakes her head, looking at him with slight wonder, as 
           if for the first time. She gives him a gentle kiss. 

                                 DULCIE
                        Let’s go home. 

           INT. PEARSON HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dulcie, Bennett, and Emma eat beignets and drink glasses of 
           milk on the carpeted floor. Emma pauses playing with a toy to 
           take a long gulp. It gives her a milk mustache.

                                 DULCIE
                             (to Emma)
                        Grandad can't know we were eating 
                        in the living room, 'kay bug?

           Emma's eyes go wide as she dramatically holds a finger over 
           her lips, then collapses to the floor in giggles, rolling 
           around. Bennett laughs, watching her.

           He suddenly seizes her mid-beignet bite and tickles her 
           wildly. Emma squeals and laughs, delighted. He roars:

                                 BENNETT
                        Will she defeat the tickle beast?!

           Dulcie watches for a beat, then jumps on Bennett to rescue 
           Emma. The two team up against him and take him down to the 
           carpet in tickle torture.

           MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Bennett carries in a sleeping Emma, lays her in a crib near 
           the door. Bennett watches her.

                                 DULCIE (O.S.)
                             (near distance)
                        This message is for Dr. Matthews, 
                        it’s Dulcie Pearson calling to 
                        schedule an appointment... 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett traces a finger over Emma's nose, over her fingers, 
           amazed. Strokes her hair, whispers to her:

                                 BENNETT
                        Before I could ever love you, I'd 
                        already lost you. But somehow, all 
                        these years, I've loved you anyway. 
                        I hope you know how much.

           GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           Bennett enters, oblivious to Dulcie undressing for him.

                                 BENNETT
                        Unbelievable. She looks like you--

           He stops--Dulcie stands there, blouse open. She walks toward 
           him as he freezes, like he's forgotten how...

           She kisses him, moves his hands to the right places. It only 
           takes a second for him to remember. He kisses her back, 
           touches her, picks her up and carries her to bed.

           INT. PEARSON HOME - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

           Morning sunlight wakes Bennett, bundled in a HOODED 
           SWEATSHIRT. He rolls over to find the bed empty. All smiles, 
           he pulls on a pair of boxer briefs and races out of the room.

           INT. PEARSON HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Bennett bounds into the kitchen.

                                 BENNETT
                        I smell coffee! I'm gonna dip you 
                        in it to get my sugar--

           He halts. Robert sits at the counter, reading a newspaper, 
           sipping coffee.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Oh. You're here. Uh...

           Bennett glances down at his briefs, embarrassed. He pulls 
           back his hood, reveals a BUZZED HAIRCUT.

                                 ROBERT
                        Yeah. You feeling better?

           Robert regards Bennett strangely.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        I feel fine. Where's Dulcie? Emma 
                        still asleep?

           Robert rises from his stool.

                                 ROBERT
                        What did you just say?

                                 BENNETT
                        I asked where Dulcie went. I'll 
                        check on Emma...

           Robert--who we now notice is disheveled, scruffy--stalks 
           toward Bennett, looks at him close. Looks in his eyes.

                                 ROBERT
                        Come sit down.

                                 BENNETT
                        Sit down for what? Where's Dulcie?

                                 ROBERT
                             (a sigh)
                        Dulcie died, Bennett.

           Bennett shakes his head, unwilling to accept it. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Dulcie! You here? Your dad doesn't 
                        believe me! Dulcie you--

           He marches from the KITCHEN into the HALL, where he catches 
           his reflection in a hallway MIRROR. Runs his hands over his 
           BUZZED HEAD--

           And crumbles to the ground. He sobs, can't catch his breath. 
           Robert wraps his arms around Bennett's shaking body. Bennett 
           clutches on as Robert gently helps him up.

           INT. PEARSON HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Bennett sits at the table. His red, tired eyes fixate on 
           nothing. Robert sits across, watches him.

                                 BENNETT
                        It wasn't a dream. They were here. 
                        Talking. And laughing. And Emma, 
                        you should've seen her, she... how 
                        will I remember her face?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           He’s already exhausted trying to remember. Robert opens his 
           mouth, about to say something. But stops. He clears his 
           throat, seems to change his mind.

                                 ROBERT
                        You’ll never forget her face. She 
                        lives in a world right here.
                             (pats his heart)
                        I'm sorry you lost your mother, 
                        Bennett. I'm sorry about the 
                        accident--sorry you lost Dulcie. 
                        It's going to take real hard work 
                        not to lose yourself while you 
                        figure out what all this means.
                             (a beat)
                        I've wanted to call you for a long 
                        while. Years now. Because, you 
                        know, I--I lost me. Back then.

           Robert fumbles through this rare humility. But there's an 
           edge of hope in his voice, an energy in his words that rings 
           with enthusiasm.

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        I lost me when my wife died. And I 
                        was wondering if you can forgive me 
                        for what I did. I was so far out of 
                        line. So afraid of losing Dulcie 
                        too. The older she got, the scarier 
                        it was for me...the tighter I held 
                        on. Wherever Dulcie and Emma are... 
                        the pain you feel now is real. I'm 
                        so sorry you're living with that.

           Robert wipes his tears before they can fall. He reaches for 
           Bennett's hand, squeezes tight.

           INT. PEARSON HOME - GARAGE - DAY

           Robert stands before a wire rack of shelves, pulls down ONE 
           OF MANY DUSTY BOXES, this one labeled “DONATE.” He sets it on 
           the floor, and pulls out a few TATTERED BOOKS. 

           GUEST BEDROOM - LATER

           Bennett finishes packing, his is now the only suitcase. A 
           KNOCK. Robert slowly enters and extends the books to Bennett.

                                 ROBERT
                        These were Roseline's. Woulda been 
                        Dulcie's. I want you to have them.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Before really seeing what they are--

                                 BENNETT
                        I can't take those... they--

           He stops, finding the offer bizarre now as Robert sets them 
           on the bed... and he reads each cover: 

           "OBEAH ANCIENT INCANTATIONS" 
               "THE HIDDEN REALITY"
                   "LOVE AND THE SACRED MULTIVERSE," BY ROSELINE PEARSON 

           Bennett is astonished by this third book. 

           Robert walks out before Bennett can object again, leaving him 
           alone to more carefully read all the titles. Conjure healing. 
           Astral projection and angelic guides. Parallel universes. 

           Begrudged, but undeniably piqued, Bennett opens "LOVE AND THE 
           SACRED MULTIVERSE." He leafs through and a BUSINESS CARD 
           falls out, a card for a TAROT & PSYCHIC READINGS SHOP, local 
           address and phone number.

           He keeps flipping pages, soon finding a single section 
           highlighted in PINK MARKER. He stops... reads:

           INSERT ON PAGE--

           Parallel universes: dimensions, worlds, realities separated 
           from each other by a single quantum event. Portals often open 
           when consequence diverges from intended path, such as 
           accident, natural disaster, or death. 

           Bennett recalls easily--it’s Dulcie’s exact recitation from 
           the previous day. He’s mystified, but heartened by this 
           tangible trace of her. He looks around, looks to the door as 
           if half-expecting her to come around the corner.

           He moves to sit in the rocking chair, trying to piece it all 
           together. Pulls out his wallet, looks inside. No sonogram. 

           Instead, there’s a FOLDED, PRINTED PAGE, torn and browned at 
           its edges. He pulls it out a moment and brushes it between 
           his fingertips, then puts it back, puts his wallet away.

           He leans against the chair, notices--the WATER STAIN in the 
           ceiling is gone. Perplexed, he runs a hand over his head.

           REAR POV OVER BENNETT'S SHOULDER: We see past Bennett to the 
           pristine egg shell ceiling. His hand runs over his smooth 
           buzzed head and we notice--

           A LONG DISTINCT SCAR on the back of his scalp, about 12 
           stitches wide. It wasn't there before.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           EXT. LOUIS ARMSTRONG NEW ORLEANS INT'L AIRPORT - DAY

           Curbside, Bennett and Robert hug goodbye. Robert gets in his 
           car and drives away as Bennett heads into the airport. But he 
           stops before entering, pulls the TAROT CARD out of his 
           pocket. He hesitates... hails a cab.

           EXT. TAROT SHOP - DAY

           More of a derelict one-room house, jammed in between liquor 
           stores on a rundown street. Bennett gets out of the cab, 
           approaches the tarot shop door. KNOCKS.

           A beat. The door slowly opens. A brown-skinned GIRL, 13, on 
           the other side gazes up at him.

                                 BENNETT
                        Hi. Uh...psychic readings?

           She nods, steps back to let him through, into--

           INT. TAROT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           A dim, candlelit room. A soundtrack on a CD player fills the 
           shop with ambient OCEAN SOUNDS. Tables and shelves are 
           stacked with OCCULT CURIOS. A BACK ROOM is partitioned by a 
           hanging bed sheet. Behind it, a mattress on the floor, the 
           feet of a SLEEPING GROWNUP.

           The girl motions for Bennett to kneel at a low table, where a 
           COFFEE SETTING for one sits beside a TAROT DECK.

                                 BENNETT
                        Little young for coffee?

           She settles down across the table from the coffee. Bennett 
           motions to the back room, to the person sleeping.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Tarot reader on a break? You gonna 
                        wake 'em up? Please?

                                 TAROT GIRL
                             (Trinidadian accent)
                        Sit. I do your reading.

                                 BENNETT
                        Uhhhh. Is this...legal?

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        Doesn't matter how old I am. Time 
                        is liminal.

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D)
                        I am 90 years old and you are 9. I 
                        am being born and you are dying. 
                        Love and wisdom are the only 
                        permanent things. And love--it is 
                        the transcender. It transcends all. 
                        It defies time and space and moves 
                        like water between the worlds. So 
                        you want to know if what's in your 
                        heart is real?? You want 
                        answers?... Sit. Drink.

           LATER

           Bennett sits cross-legged at the table. Sets the emptied 
           coffee cup down in front of the girl.

                                 BENNETT
                        Good coffee. You make that?

           She closes her eyes a moment, then gazes down into the 
           grounds left behind at the bottom of the cup. 

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        Two hundred dollars.

           Annoyed, Bennett opens his wallet. Exactly $220 in twenties. 
           He hesitates.

                        The rest will be enough for travel 
                        back to the airport.

           Bennett curiously hands her $200.

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
                        You have a lesson to learn. We all 
                        can transcend this fear that holds 
                        you back. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Fear? Wha--

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        Yes. Fear. What blocks you. 

           Unfazed by Bennett’s confusion, She picks up the tarot deck. 
           Holds it in her right hand and hovers her left over the cards 
           as she closes her eyes.

           She hands him the deck. Signals for him to shuffle. He 
           shuffles, hands them back. In a quick, sweeping motion, she 
           fans them out across the table.

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Choose.

           Bennett chooses a card. Flips it over. DEATH. He stares at 
           the card, stricken by the coincidence.

           QUICK FLASH of Dulcie pulling this card for him years ago at 
           the Halloween party. 

           And as if the Tarot Girl has read his mind:

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT’D)
                        You see? Death has a lesson. She is 
                        alive. And she is dead. She is with 
                        you. And she is not with you. Space 
                        is liminal, like time. There are 
                        many realities. To have the one you 
                        want, you must believe the one you 
                        want. Face the fear. Love is 
                        waiting for you to let go. 

           Bennett nods. A long silence as he waits.

                                 BENNETT
                        Is that it?

           Off her silent nod--

           EXT. TAROT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett bursts through the door, fuming. He hails a cab.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Bennett sits in his seat, numb. He pulls down the window 
           shade, puts in his headphones, closes his eyes.

           INT. JACK'S HOME - ENTRY HALL - DAY

           Bennett enters and immediately stops to listen. Jack is on 
           the phone in another room.

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        --I do, and I appreciate the 
                        call... Right, of course. It was 
                        real--but to him. I, uh, I know the 
                        feeling... I already have someone I 
                        want him to see... Thanks, you too, 
                        Robert. Be well.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           A CLICK and Jack emerges, headed for the front door. He stops 
           when he sees Bennett.

                                 BENNETT
                        Flight landed early.

           Jack rushes to embrace his son.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Bennett and Jack wait. An ADMIN sits behind the counter. DR. 
           PARKER, late 50's, emerges from an inner door.

           --She's the flight attendant who woke him on the plane.--

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Hi, I'm Dr. Annalise Parker. You 
                        must be Bennett. And you must be 
                        Jack. Nice to meet you both.

           Bennett eyes her, tries to place her.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                             (to Bennett)
                        Come on back.
                             (to Jack, graciously)
                        Probably best if you wait out here.

           Bennett follows her, wary. They enter--

           DR. PARKER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           She shuts the door and sits, gestures for Bennett to have a 
           seat. Silence. Dr. Parker smiles. She has a comforting, 
           motherly nature; a talent for gently delivering hard truths.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Would you like water? Or tea?

           Bennett shakes his head, still trying to place her.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Why don't you tell me what's 
                        been on your mind lately.

           He shifts, uncomfortable.

                                 BENNETT
                        S-sorry. This isn't easy for me... 
                        Have we--uh--have we met before?

           Dr. Parker gives him a long look. Thinking.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Not that I can recall.

           A beat. Bennett drops the nagging familiarity--for now.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT'D)
                        What's on your mind, Bennett?

                                 BENNETT
                        Well, first of all, no meds. I've 
                        seen my dad on meds, and...he's 
                        just gone. Shut down.

           Dr. Parker nods her consent. He continues.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        My wife died four years ago. Or--I 
                        thought she died. But, uh, she--
                        she...I saw her on the 29th. I 
                        spent the day with her. And my, my 
                        daughter. Who also died. In the 
                        same accident. In 2008, on the 29th 
                        of February.

           Dr. Parker jots notes on a pad of paper.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        She--they had--we had a whole life. 
                        This whole other life. Like... 
                        another reality. We had all these 
                        memories. Things I've never 
                        experienced. I held my daughter. I, 
                        uh, I made love to my wife. Dulcie. 
                        I thought it was a dream at first. 
                        But she convinced me it was real. 
                        And. I believed her. And the next 
                        day they were gone again.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Do you still believe her? Do you 
                        believe she's alive?
                             (off his hesitation)
                        Do you believe she was real?

           Bennett stares at the floor, fights tears. He shrugs.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT'D)
                        Reality is a funny thing. I believe 
                        that our perception is our reality. 
                        And... it seems to me that your 
                        perception might not be aligning 
                        with the collective reality. That 
                        doesn't invalidate your experience 
                        or make it not real to you.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        Sounds like something you'd tell 
                        one of your schizophrenics.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Do you think you're schizophrenic?

                                 BENNETT
                        No.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Have you ever seen other people or 
                        heard voices the rest of us might 
                        not see or hear?

                                 BENNETT
                        No.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        So you likely had a vivid dream?

                                 BENNETT
                        I don't know. Maybe.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Alright. What else do you think 
                        could have happened?

                                 BENNETT
                             (long pause)
                        I don't know. Have you--have you 
                        ever heard, what if time and space 
                        are, um, liminal?

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Liminal? Like transitional?

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah. Like, everything is in 
                        between. It's all impermanent, and 
                        all existing at once. Like there 
                        can be multiple "worlds" going at 
                        the same time. And they all bend 
                        around various quantum events...? I 
                        sound crazy.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        No, it's okay. This is good. We 
                        have a starting point. We're 
                        working with the possibility of an 
                        alternate reality, and a dream 
                        state. Which of those two do you 
                        think is more likely? 
                             (a beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT'D)
                        I’m no meta-physicist, but I do 
                        find the laws of physics pretty 
                        compelling.

           Bennett doesn't reply. His silence says it all.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT'D)
                        People come to me because they're 
                        suffering in some way. This--
                             (pointing to her temple)
                        --is so very, very powerful. But 
                        you can harness that power. You can 
                        decide to take your life back. 
                        Deciding that February 29th was 
                        probably a dream doesn't take 
                        anything away from you. Or from 
                        your love for your wife. That love 
                        is real and will always be real.

           Bennett nods. A trust bond is building between them.

                                 BENNETT
                        What if I want it to be the real 
                        reality?

                                 DR. PARKER
                        If that's the real reality, then 
                        what is this? This moment right 
                        now? This feels real to me. And to 
                        your father. If you're willing to 
                        accept your experience as a dream, 
                        you are acknowledging the power of 
                        the mind and choosing to let go of 
                        the dream as a potential reality. 
                        Again, that doesn't mean you have 
                        to let go of your wife or daughter. 
                        It just means you can move forward 
                        and begin to heal.

           Bennett is visibly overwhelmed.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
                        You've already taken some big steps 
                        towards healing. Focus on that. 
                        Navigating tragedy is a tremendous 
                        task. You're already doing gr--

           Fidgety, Bennett stands up.

                                 BENNETT
                        Thank you for your time, Dr. 
                        Parker. I think--I don't know if 
                        this is right for me.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           He leaves her office.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

           Bennett and Jack stand in line at a quaint cafe. STUDENTS and 
           YOUNG PROFESSIONALS at the tables. Bennett looks at Jack, 
           waiting for him to ask about the session, but his dad ignores 
           the subject. Bennett shakes his head, frustrated.

           Jack pretends to be engrossed in the menu he's holding.

           They stand in tense silence. Until something in the bakery 
           display catches Bennett's eye. He steps up to the glass, 
           seeing something behind it that brings a huge grin to his 
           face. He laughs a little.

                                 BENNETT
                        Dad. You ever had a beignet?

                                 JACK
                        A bin-what?

           Next in line, Bennett steps up to the counter.

           LATER - LATE AFTERNOON

           Golden sunlight pours in on Bennett and Jack as they sit at a 
           window table. They eat their beignets in happy silence.

           Bennett points to a spot of powdered sugar in Jack's beard. 
           They share a little laugh.

           INT. JACK'S HOME - BENNETT'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Bennett sits on the floor of his bedroom, Roseline’s book in 
           hand. Almost afraid, he opens it to a specific page and 
           starts reading. His eyes well after a few lines. He pauses, 
           almost puts the book down. But he continues out loud:

                                 BENNETT
                        ...Love has hurt us, it has drown 
                        us in its tides and taken from us. 
                        Love is an infinite expanse, so 
                        deep and wide and dangerous that we 
                        fear it may swallow us whole. We 
                        fear both its mystery and its 
                        translucence. We fear its vastness 
                        and its power. But it is lifeblood 
                        we cannot live without. To embrace 
                        its magic, we must face it. We must 
                        dive straight in.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           QUICK FLASH oF Emma’s giggling face glinting like a beautiful 
           flare of light. And Dulcie beside her. So clear and vivid, 
           like they’re right in front of him. 

           Shaken by the vision, he shuts the book.

           INT. JACK'S HOME - OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

           Dark. Then a fragment of light with a slow CREAK as Bennett 
           opens the door to this seemingly forgotten room. As if frozen 
           in time, a covering of dust blankets most everything. 
           Mementos of his mother--her things--are everywhere.

           Bennett creeps through, careful not to disturb the stillness. 
           He smiles at some of the artifacts that conjure childhood 
           memories.

           A PHOTOGRAPH on the desk catches his eye. It's the only thing 
           he picks up, clears away the dust...

           Rae--seven months pregnant in her wedding dress--and Jack, on 
           their wedding day. Absolutely beaming. She holds a bouquet of 
           BRIGHT YELLOW DAISIES over her head like a trophy.

           Disappointment sets in as he returns the photo to its place. 
           He takes a last weary look around and leaves the room in its 
           perpetual darkness.

           EXT. JACK'S HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Bennett is working away, hair getting longer again. He stains 
           wood pieces, his usual headphones blasting. In the open 
           garage behind him, ROWS AND ROWS OF ROCKING CHAIRS. Dozens of 
           them. All the same.

           A phone call interrupts his music. RACHEL on the caller ID, 
           which also displays the date: SAT, FEB 28 2015. He's 
           considering answering, until--

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        You gonna get that?

           Bennett didn't realize Jack had approached. He shakes his 
           head, sends the call to voicemail.

                                 BENNETT
                        Got a lot of deliveries today.
           LATER

           A shining pick-up truck in the driveway. Bennett and Jack 
           load in rocking chairs as they talk.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 JACK
                        This is the one--that cashier that 
                        was with us for a few months, like, 
                        a couple years ago?

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah, Rachel.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, I remember her. So you like 
                        her. How long you been seeing her?

                                 BENNETT
                        Pretty much since we met.

                                 JACK
                             (beat, confused)
                        Since...you met at the store? Two 
                        years ago? You never mentioned her.

                                 BENNETT
                        I'm taking my time.

                                 JACK
                        That's...a lot of time.

                                 BENNETT
                        I'm taking her out tonight. Gonna 
                        ask if she wants to, uh, do the 
                        girlfriend thing.

                                 JACK
                        Girlfriend? After two years?
                             (off Bennett's annoyed  
                              silence, carefully:)
                        The timing doesn't bother you?

                                 BENNETT
                        The timing? What about it?

                                 JACK
                        The date, Bennett. It's February 
                        28th. The day before--

                                 BENNETT
                        And tomorrow is March 1st. So what?

           They load the last chair. Bennett closes the truck gate.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Thanks for the help. Be back.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           EXT. WALNUT AVE - DAY

           Bennett turns onto a tree-lined suburban street. CLOSE on the 
           corner sign--WALNUT AV.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett pulls into a driveway, unloads two rocking chairs. He 
           carries them to the front door and knocks, turns to observe 
           the street while he waits.

           His gaze leads to a SMALL HOUSE a few doors down. A FOR RENT 
           SIGN on the lawn.

           Bennett is drawn back to his delivery when the front door 
           opens. A middle-aged man, Bennett's CUSTOMER, shakes 
           Bennett's hand.

                                 CUSTOMER
                        Appreciate the delivery.

           MOMENTS LATER - SMALL HOUSE

           Bennett stands in the street, stares at the 825 address 
           painted on the curb.

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett in the PEARSON GUEST ROOM, seeing the 
           TAG on Dulcie's pink suitcase: 825 WALNUT AVE, LONG BEACH CA.

           Bennett studies the house. Scrutiny...familiarity. He's been 
           here before. Perhaps many times.

           He regards the contact number on the FOR RENT SIGN. Considers 
           it a long time, before he pulls out his phone and dials.

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Bennett and RACHEL, 25--pretty, doting in the way she looks 
           at him. Just...not Dulcie. They sit across from each other in 
           the low-lit ambience. Awkward silence. He's jittery and 
           distracted. She smiles, tries to find his eyes.

                                 BENNETT
                        The sea bass here is supposed to be 
                        excellent.

                                 RACHEL
                        No fish for me, remember? Been full 
                        vegan for months.

                                 BENNETT
                        Oh, oh, of course.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Both begin to say something and stop, overly polite; but they 
           start laughing together. A sweet, genuine moment of ease and 
           connection. 

           LATER

           They eat in silence. Occasional comments about the food. 
           Occasional overcompensating smiles.

           LATER

           The check comes. Bennett absently puts down his credit card.

                                 RACHEL
                        You okay? 

                                 BENNETT
                        Actually, there was, uh, something 
                        I wanted to ask you.

           She suppresses a grin, places her hands on one of his.

                                 RACHEL
                        Before you ask. I just want to make 
                        sure the timing is okay.

                                 BENNETT
                        The timing?

                                 RACHEL
                        The date. Being so close to--

                                 BENNETT
                        It's not--it's not even the right 
                        year. It's, why does everyone...?
                             (a beat)
                        Rachel. This is what I want. I 
                        think it's time for us to move this 
                        forward. I want you to be my 
                        girlfriend. If that's what you 
                        want, too.

           A beat.

                                 RACHEL
                        I'm sorry--your--what'd you say?

                                 BENNETT
                        A relationship. I'm ready for a--

                                 RACHEL
                        A relationship? What have we been 
                        doing all this time?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        Um, we've--we've been, uh. We've--
                        what...did you think I was asking?

                                 RACHEL
                        It's been two years, Bennett. I was 
                        thinking a marriage proposal??

                                 BENNETT
                        Well. Yeah. That's--that's, 
                        marriage is... That's what I was 
                        saying. I'm just, I'm not good at 
                        this. I'm sorry. Moving this 
                        forward, to marriage, is--

                                 RACHEL
                        Bennett. It's okay, sweetie. I know 
                        this is hard for you. Just take a 
                        minute...and ask. Don't be nervous, 
                        you know I love you.

           She strokes his hand, gives him a sweet, nurturing smile. He 
           swallows...and pushes through, so determined to move on--

                                 BENNETT
                        Rachel. Will you marry me?

           INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - MEN'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Bennett rushes in. Panic. He slaps water on his face. He 
           leans, catches his breath, pulls out his WALLET.

           A CIRCULAR INDENT in the leather, impressed there by his 
           WEDDING RING, which he pulls out at present. Beside it, we 
           also see the FOLDED, PRINTED PAGE he keeps there.

           He looks at the ring, softly smiling as he spins it around 
           his ring finger. But then, in surge of anger--he hurls it 
           across the room. A CLANG echoes off the walls as it hits tile 
           and bounces across the floor.

           He takes a few deep breaths and collects the ring. He thinks 
           and paces... Finally, he pulls out his cell phone and dials 
           ROBERT PEARSON. A JET PLANE ROARS in PRE-LAP--

           EXT. CLOUD-SPECKED BLUE SKY - DAY

           A COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE sails toward the sun.

           EXT. LOUIS ARMSTRONG NEW ORLEANS INT'L AIRPORT - DAY
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett, DUFFEL BAG in tow, makes his way from BAGGAGE CLAIM. 
           He glances over his shoulder at the carousel a couple times. 
           Nothing unusual. No Dulcie. No Emma.

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS - JACKSON SQUARE - DAY

           A beautiful, sunny day. Bennett and Robert slowly stroll. 
           They feel familiar, friendly, even though it's been years. 
           Robert looks strangely well, almost younger than before.

           People are out, enjoying the historic city. Robert and 
           Bennett relish the silence between them. Somehow, words don't 
           seem necessary. 

           After a few beats...

                                 ROBERT
                        Do you love her?

           Bennett can't find the words to answer.

                                 ROBERT (CONT'D)
                        You came all this way for my 
                        blessing and don't even know if you 
                        love her?

                                 BENNETT
                        I--it's--I do. I...care about her. 
                        Very much.

                                 ROBERT
                        I never married someone I cared 
                        about very much. Dulcie's mother 
                        and I were madly in love. You 
                        two... kind of reminded me of me 
                        and Roseline.

           Bennett smiles, but then grapples with the assertion. Another 
           few beats of silence. Until, across DECATUR STREET, he 
           observes CAFE DU MONDE and tenses.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        You have my blessing. 

           Bennett contemplates, distracted now. A familiar anger 
           surfacing.

                                 BENNETT
                        Those books you gave me--did you--
                        do you... believe in the magic 
                        stuff? I mean, do you believe, uh, 
                        love has some kind of... magical 
                        properties??
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Robert laughs good-naturedly.

                                 ROBERT
                        Ros was drawn to the metaphysics of 
                        love. Its energy, she believed was 
                        unbound by dimension. Just like in 
                        physics--the law of conservation of 
                        energy. Energy can be neither 
                        created nor destroyed. She was 
                        certain the love in one lifetime 
                        could not be destroyed, even in 
                        death. 

           He chuckles ironically at the memory. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        I thought it was a nice sentiment, 
                        while she was alive. A nice idea 
                        for a greeting card.

           His expression edges into belief, with a shine of mystery. 

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Since she’s been... I--I’ve started 
                        to believe her. In a real way.  

           Bennett blinks, silent. He didn’t expect this, and it wasn’t 
           the response he was looking for. Robert anticipates his next 
           question... and stops. Faces Bennett, looks at him gravely.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        It’s hard to explain. I don’t see 
                        Ros. Not like you’ve seen Dulcie. 
                        And Emma. But--we still... have 
                        conversations. She sends me signals 
                        that she’s listening...

           Something that would have made Robert sheepish once. Even if 
           he could have brought himself to such vulnerability. But he 
           stands firm in this conviction. Not a belief. It’s a knowing.

           Bennett nods, quiet, but the skepticism and resentment are 
           loud in his set jaw and exhausted eyes. LOUD LIKE CRASHING 
           WAVES...

           QUICK FLASHES 

           -Of Bennett (10) and Rae (35) the day of the CORKBOARD PHOTO. 
           She leads him into the SURGING TIDE.

           -Of Dulcie, a frozen beauty in her CASKET. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. JACK'S HOME - BENNETT'S ROOM - NIGHT                  

           EMPTY CARDBOARD MOVING BOXES are stacked against one wall. A 
           few on the floor, half full. A pile of others near the door, 
           sealed and labeled with black marker. 

           Bennett sits on his bed, spinning his wedding ring on his 
           finger. He stops to pick up a FRAMED PHOTO sitting beside 
           him. It’s a candid wedding shot of him and Dulcie.

           Bennett places it in a small black TRASH BAG, already full of 
           other mementos--letters, swim medals, additional photos. 

           He glances OUT THE WINDOW, at the GARBAGE BINS on the curb 
           awaiting collection.

           A long beat. Defeated, he dumps the contents of the trash bag 
           back into the beat up SHOEBOX it all must’ve come from, angry 
           he can’t bring himself to get rid of it. 

           His WEDDING RING THUDS off the side and bounces onto the bed. 

           Bennett hesitates, places the ring back into its well-worn 
           spot in his wallet. 

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - DAY

           Bennett and a PROPERTY MANAGER, 40s, stand in an empty MASTER 
           BEDROOM. He stares up in wonder at a FAMILIAR WATER STAIN in 
           the ceiling. A step closer. He studies it. 

           QUICK FLASH of the identical WATER STAIN in the PEARSON GUEST 
           ROOM ceiling.

                                 PROPERTY MANAGER
                        Leak in the roof. The owners 
                        already scheduled a roofing company 
                        to come next week, so you're good 
                        there.

           A long silence as Bennett continues to stare. The stain seems 
           to swallow all sound. LIKE BEING UNDER WATER. Then--

                                 PROPERTY MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        --Uh, excuse me...? Hi. 

                                 BENNETT
                             (snapping to)
                        What? --Oh, sorry. I’m sorry--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 PROPERTY MANAGER
                        I was confirming your rental 
                        agreement. It’s just you and your 
                        wife on the lease, right? No pets?

                                 BENNETT
                        Yes. Just me and my--my...uh, 
                        Rachel. My fiancee. No pets.

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - SERIES OF SCENES - DAY/NIGHT

           Bennett and Rachel arrange furniture, unpack boxes, put 
           things in cabinets. 

           He revisits the WATER STAIN in the bedroom, gazing up at it 
           for a while. Then he returns to unpacking, eventually finding 
           the METAPHYSICAL TEXT BOOKS Robert gave him. He puts them in 
           a box labeled TRASH.

           LATER - BACKYARD

           Bennett stands on a slate patio surrounded by fresh sod, all 
           enclosed by a BRICK RETAINING WALL. The wall is beautiful and 
           rustic, pieced together with a mix of new and OLD BRICKS.

           He's entranced by it, but can't place what feels familiar. He 
           turns, glances up to the bedroom window--to the WATER STAIN 
           visible from this vantage point. 

           QUICK FLASH - NEW ORLEANS

           Dulcie leads him through the busy street.

                                 DULCIE
                        --Fell off a ladder in our 
                        backyard. Hit your head on this old 
                        brick ...Twelve stitches? Right 
                        back there.

           BACK TO SCENE

           And now Bennett is stumbling across the YARD toward the brick 
           wall, which he slowly touches, searching it like it has 
           answers. He feels the back of his head.

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett passes Rachel, who’s wiping down KITCHEN countertops, 
           and beelines for the--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           BATHROOM

           In a daze, Bennett approaches the three-way medicine cabinet 
           mirror. Adjusts it so he can see the back of his head. Parts 
           his hair. And there--

           The SCAR he never realized he had.

           He stares at it, hands now shaking. Tries to get a closer 
           view, blinks as if he could blink it away. But it remains. 
           His breathing quickens. He wavers, grips the edge of the 
           sink, trying to process...

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Bennett sits. Dr. Parker waves him into her office.

           DR. PARKER'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett sits across from Dr. Parker.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        I'm glad you came, Bennett.

                                 BENNETT
                        Don't know what else to do.
                             (beat)
                        When I was here a few years ago, I 
                        told you my wife had died--

                                 DR. PARKER
                        I remember your situation.

           He looks at her, relieved and thankful. But also remorseful, 
           weighted with guilt about wanting this to be over.

                                 BENNETT
                        There are these--these traces of 
                        her everywhere. Like. Signals. Like 
                        an ongoing conversation. It’s... 
                        hard to explain. I just need it to 
                        stop. I’m--I want to move on.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        Moving forward from a tragic event 
                        is hard. It's like it becomes a 
                        piece of you. So you have to commit 
                        like hell to what you're letting go 
                        of in order to move forward. When 
                        we hold onto the past, we leave no 
                        space in our lives for the future.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett nods, knows she's right.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT'D)
                        Has this dream ever come back?

           Bennett shakes his head, an air of disappointment that 
           surprises him.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, that’s a good thing. But just 
                        because it hasn’t doesn’t mean it 
                        won’t. It may very well recur and 
                        feel just as real. When these 
                        dreams do recur, it's usually 
                        because the dreamer is not dealing 
                        with some present fear. There are 
                        certain lucid dreaming techniques 
                        to help... 

           As the session with Dr. Parker continues in V.O.--

           INT./EXT. SERIES OF SCENES - DAY/NIGHT

           -At the WALNUT AVE HOUSE, Bennett stands on a step stool, 
           paint roller in hand, staring up at the WATER STAIN. Deeply 
           conflicted. He paints over it.

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.)
                        You simply need to face whatever 
                        fear is arising within the dream. 
                        It will feel terrifying. Even 
                        crippling. But you push through. 
                        Face the fear. Wake up.

           -Jack explores the untouched OFFICE in his home. Every dust-
           coated relic seems to have some deep significance. He opens 
           the shutters, lets light in as he notices the WEDDING PHOTO--
           the only thing cleared of dust. It's painful to look at. His 
           wife, her belly, the DAISIES. He closes the shutters... 

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.)
                        And a big piece of that is letting 
                        go of what you’re holding onto. 
                        Because the things we hold on to 
                        feel comfortable, like protection. 
                        But, if we embrace the thing that 
                        scares us, we don’t need all that 
                        old stuff anymore. 

           -Bennett jogs near the ocean. He stops a moment to gaze out 
           at its formidable vastness.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.)
                        I'm developing a cognitive sleep 
                        study and I think you should 
                        enroll... 

           BACK TO DR. PARKER’S OFFICE

           Bennett's leery. She tries gently to sell him...

                                 DR. PARKER
                        No medication involved. I think it 
                        would give us information that 
                        could stop this dream from 
                        returning. Stop these--signals.

           A careful pause. She grabs paperwork from her desk and hands 
           it to him. 

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                        Here. This explains more. Covers 
                        most of what you need to know about 
                        the study. 

           Bennett considers it all as he reads the pamphlet. WE SEE a 
           section about “LETTING GO OF THE PAST”: 

           INSERT ON PAMPHLET--

           Prior to the study, purge familiar places and sleep habitat 
           of physical reminders, photographs, mementos, etc. Such items 
           can signal the brain, triggering repeat dream patterns.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                        You'd be under surveillance every 
                        night for maybe a week surrounding 
                        the 29th of February. I think that 
                        date is one of your triggers. 

           Bennett closes the pamphlet, shutting down. Not ready.

                                 BENNETT
                        I’ll think about it. 

           EXT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           A few empty beer bottles. An empty pizza box. Jack and 
           Bennett stain rocking chair parts and assemble the chairs 
           from finished pieces.

           Instead of listening to headphones, Bennett plays his music 
           on speakers for his dad to hear too. Both father and son bob 
           to the beat. Silent as they go, but they function like a well-
           oiled machine. Eventually, Bennett ventures, reluctant...
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        Decided not to do the sleep thing.

                                 JACK
                             (a beat)
                        Oh yeah? How come?

           Neither looks up from his work. Bennett shrugs.

                                 BENNETT
                        Seems bogus. Like getting rid of 
                        some photos is the answer. The 
                        problem is--she died. That’s the 
                        problem. Not that I keep photos of 
                        her. And, and a ring. 

           Jack sneaks a glance at Bennett. He’s got no right to judge, 
           and knows it. He takes his time...

                                 JACK
                        Your mother used to say, “Things 
                        hold energy.”

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett (12), in a pew of folding chairs 
           filled with people, sand beneath them. Could be a beach 
           wedding, but it’s a funeral. Bennett’s hands tremble against 
           his black suit, clutching the FOLDED, PRINTED PAGE.

           Bennett, poised as usual to say something snarky and 
           defensive about his father’s failures, has no fight. 

                                 BENNETT
                        I’m not doing it. Who knows if the 
                        same thing’ll even happen again. 

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           It's early. Bennett stirs in bed. Checks his iPHONE on the 
           nightstand. The display reads--

           MON, FEB 29 2016 7:12AM

           He looks over. Bed empty. A TOILET FLUSHES. He breathes. 
           Anticipation. A DOOR CREAKS. And in walks--

           Rachel. Rubbing her eyes, hair disheveled. Bennett lies back 
           down, tries to hide his disappointment.

                                 RACHEL
                        What's up?

                                 BENNETT
                        Nothing.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Rachel lies her head on his chest.

                                 RACHEL
                        You feeling ok? Because I can call 
                        in sick. I can stay with you.

           Bennett kisses her hand. Smiles at her.

                                 BENNETT
                        Nah. I'll be fine.

           Rachel nods, yawns, closes her eyes.

                                 RACHEL
                        Mmmmm. Ten more minutes...

           Bennett stares up at the pristine white ceiling. He kisses 
           Rachel's forehead, slides out from under her.

           BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett starts the shower. Places his iPHONE on the counter 
           and sets his Spotify to shuffle. It plays through a small set 
           of Bluetooth speakers.

           CALIFORNIA LOVE by TUPAC comes on as Bennett showers.

           IN THE SHOWER

           Bennett leans into the water. He turns the heat knob all the 
           way. Scalding. Steam billows up. He grits his teeth. After a 
           long beat, he turns the heat knob all the way off, blasts the 
           cold water. Freezing.

           He repeats this self-inflicted torture--he can feel. A couple 
           songs later, I WANT TO BREAK FREE by QUEEN starts to play.

           Bennett pauses, can't help but smile to himself as he 
           listens. But his face hardens, gaze turning upward, as if to 
           God, or the Universe. He’s pissed.

           He rolls his eyes, impatiently sings along as if forced:

                                 BENNETT
                        I've got to break free--God knows, 
                        God knows I want to break free. 
                        I've fallen in love.

           Bennett shuts off the water and steps out of the shower, cuts 
           the song. As he dries himself, he notices the time.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Rachel! Wake up! You’ll be late!
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett shuffles to the bed in his towel, gently shakes 
           Rachel.

                                 BENNETT
                        Rachel. Hey.

           She stirs BENEATH THE COVERS, GROANS, pulls the sheets from 
           over her head. But--

           It's Dulcie. Now 29.

                                 DULCIE
                        Who's Rachel?

           Bennett jolts back. A long beat. His eyes shine, locked on 
           her. He falls to his knees, lays his head on her chest. 
           Dulcie wraps her arms around him, kisses his head.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        Huh? Who's this Rachel?

                                 BENNETT
                        Nobody. It doesn't matter. It was 
                        just, just a weird dream.

                                 DULCIE
                        You got a girlfriend?

           Bennett kisses her chest, her neck, her cheek, her lips, 
           adamantly shaking his head.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        Better not. I'll whoop your ass.

           Bennett doesn't waste a moment. He removes his towel and gets 
           into bed, pulls the covers back over both of them. Dulcie 
           GIGGLES, GROANS with pleasure. 

           Muffled, from under the covers:

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        I have morning breath.

                                 BENNETT
                        I don't care.

                                 DULCIE
                        I'm gonna be late for work!

                                 BENNETT
                        I don't care.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Bennett sits across the kitchen table from Emma, now 7, a 
           booster seat in her chair. He stares at her in wonder and 
           adoration as she eats oatmeal.

           She notices Bennett watching her, gives him a big grin, 
           missing two front teeth.

                                 EMMA
                        What Daddy?

                                 BENNETT
                        Nothing. Just can't believe what a 
                        big girl you are.

                                 EMMA
                        Mom says it's cuz of this.
                             (re: the oatmeal)
                        But it tastes like snails.

                                 BENNETT
                        Oh really? When did you taste a 
                        snail?

           Emma's eyes go wide with mischief. She giggles and holds a 
           finger to her lips, ssshhhh. Bennett laughs, gets up and 
           fixes her a bowl of sugar cereal. He copies her gesture of 
           silence. She smiles, nods. Their secret.

           Dulcie enters on the fast clicking of her heels. Dressed to 
           the nines in a suit. Bennett ogles her, but then--

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Wait, you're not actually leaving 
                        are you? You said--

           Dulcie pours coffee into a travel mug.

                                 DULCIE
                        I was kidding. You know I can't 
                        miss court--Oh, baby, what did you 
                        give her?

           Bennett and Emma share a silly look.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        And what are you doing acting all 
                        casual? Your USMLE is in four days.

           Bennett looks puzzled. Emma whispers to him--

                                 EMMA
                        Gargantuan doctor test.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                             (winks at Emma)
                        It's our anniversary. I'll study 
                        tomorrow.

           Dulcie rolls her eyes. Searches the pantry--

                                 DULCIE
                        We already celebrated last weekend, 
                        and Bennett--I swear to god--that 
                        is a thousand dollar test. Where 
                        are my protein bars? ...Oh, here.

           She puts one in her purse, grabs her coffee, rounds the table 
           to kiss Emma, then Bennett. He stands and holds her back from 
           leaving, pretends it's play. Grinning, he checks the tag in 
           the back of her shirt.

                                 BENNETT
                        As I suspected; made of 100% pure 
                        sugar.

           This earns him a reminiscent laugh from her, a surprised, 
           wondrous look. He holds her tight, bites her shoulder.

                                 DULCIE
                        What are you--stop. I have to go.

                                 BENNETT
                        Call one of the partners to cover 
                        you. Please.

                                 DULCIE
                        I have a solo practice! Move.

           She struts for the door again. Bennett blocks her.

                                 BENNETT
                        Wait! Wait. Stay. Please. Dulcie. 
                        What day is today.

           It’s not a question, but a prompt. Dulcie stops, looks at him 
           again, closer now. She knows what day it is, of all days.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        You remember the last anniversary? 
                        Four years ago, in New Orleans?

           Dulcie remembers. She cocks her head--is this a joke? He 
           blinks, face set. No joke. She averts her eyes, thinking. 

                                 DULCIE
                        ...Uhhh. Okay. You’re taking Emma 
                        to her swim meet later. Yeah?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett turns to Emma, pleasantly surprised. She beams at 
           him. Swim is their thing. Dulcie searches his face, pulls out 
           her phone and taps buttons, frenzied. A little frustrated.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                             (tapping away)
                        So. You don’t remember...okay. I'm 
                        texting you the address of the 
                        meet. Do not be late, they're in 
                        the finals. I'll meet you there. 
                        And we’ll talk about this then. 
                        Okay? I love you, I have to--wait, 
                        oh my god. You know you're taking 
                        her to school, right?

                                 BENNETT
                        School? It's already... 8:30.

                                 DULCIE
                        Yes, Bennett, children go to school 
                        on Mondays. She starts at nine.

                                 BENNETT
                        Nine? Since when does school start 
                        at nine?

           Dulcie tries to contain her vexation.

                                 DULCIE
                        Since we won the charter lottery.
                             (to Emma)
                        I love you baby.

           Dulcie gives Bennett a quick kiss, then side-steps him and 
           rushes out the door. He watches her go, listens to her CLICK-
           CLACK down the driveway. A CAR STARTS. She's gone.

           Fuming, anguished, he kicks a chair over. Emma startles.

                                 BENNETT
                        Sorry. I'm sorry sweetie.

           He rights the chair and sits in it. Pours himself cereal.

           INT./EXT. LEXUS SUV - DAY

           Bennett drives. Emma is in the back, in her car seat. She 
           points. Bennett makes a right turn. He glances at her in the 
           rearview, wanting to know her but not wanting to scare her 
           with too many questions. 

           He turns on the radio, flips through. Immediately--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 EMMA
                             (singing, bopping)
                        Shake it off, shake it off--uh-oh-
                        oh!! Shake it off, shake it off!

           Emma joins in mid-Taylor Swift. Despite Bennett's obvious 
           distaste for the song, he watches his daughter in adoration. 
           Her enthusiasm is contagious.

           Bennett blasts the volume and bops along with Emma, messing 
           up the lyrics as he goes.

                                 BENNETT
                        Players gonna play play play play 
                        play and the something, ba-da-da-da-
                        fake fake fake.

           Emma delights in their sing-along, laughing and getting even 
           more into it.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Hey Emma, what if we played hooky 
                        today and I didn't take you to 
                        school?

                                 EMMA
                        But I like school.

                                 BENNETT
                        You do? Okay then, school it is.
                             (sotto)
                        You are your mother's daughter.

           EXT. CHARTER SCHOOL - DAY

           Bennett walks hand in hand with Emma toward the entrance. 
           Like an inside joke, they quietly sing:

                                 BENNETT/EMMA
                        Haters gonna hate hate hate hate 
                        hate...

                                 BENNETT (PRE-LAP)
                        Would it be okay if I observe her 
                        classes today?

           They enter the school.

           INT. CHARTER SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           Bennett stands in the middle of a second grade classroom 
           talking to the teacher, "MISS AMANDA".
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 MISS AMANDA
                        Of course. Long as I can use you as 
                        a volunteer.

                                 BENNETT
                        Sure. Definitely.

           LATER - SERIES OF SCENES

           Bennett has the time of his life with Emma and her 
           schoolmates. He reads to the class, paints and glues with 
           them during art, helps with their handwriting, plays with 
           them at recess, coaches them during PE. 

           EXT. COMMUNITY SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Bennett and Emma are parked in a lot that serves a beach-
           front, outdoor community pool. He gets her out of the car in 
           her yellow bathing suit, swim cap, and goggles.

                                 EMMA
                        Ready coach!

           Coach. He shakes his head.

           INSIDE THE POOL ARENA - MINUTES LATER

           Bennett stands with Emma and the rest of the DUCKLINGS, 
           giving them high-fives. A few onlooking PARENTS wave to him 
           from the BLEACHERS. He nervously waves back, then realizes--

           One of them is his dad. Jack smiles, cheerful, as Bennett 
           makes his way over.

                                 BENNETT
                        Dad??

                                 JACK
                        Hey Bennett.

           Bennett looks around, then back at his father a beat too 
           long. Jack gives him a sidelong stare. He shifts, awkward.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Things better now? With Dulcie? 
                        Takes work, ya know... She--uh, 
                        mentioned it to me.

           Bennett thinks a second, thrown off. He looks to Jack now for 
           an unspoken answer, but there’s none to be found.

                                 BENNETT
                        Trying. I’m trying.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           LATER

           Kids are lined up at the edge of the pool, Emma among them. 
           Coaches hover at the edge with their swimmers. Bennett is 
           about as far from the pool as possible.

           A WHISTLE BLOWS. The kids jump in, some try to dive. 

           LATER

           Bennett cheers. Emma comes in first place by a stretch.

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah! That's my girl!

           Bennett suddenly spots Dulcie in the bleachers next to Jack. 
           She waves to him. Seeing her stops his heart, like always. He 
           waves her over. She joins him poolside as Emma runs into 
           Bennett's arms.

                          DULCIE
                                                    BENNETT (CONT'D)
                 (to Emma)
                                                (to Emma)
           Good swim, baby.
                                              So proud of you!

           Hugs and kisses. He sets her down, watches her run to Jack, 
           who awaits her with an open towel. Bennett turns to Dulcie.

                                 DULCIE
                        Hi. Sorry I was so flustered this 
                        morning. I’d--I’d forgotten... I 
                        mean, I--

                                 BENNETT
                        It's okay. Hi. Our daughter is 
                        incredible.

                                 DULCIE
                        I know. She's our little trouble-
                        maker. Our little fish. 

           Bennett’s eyes shine with grief. Dulcie watches him, baffled.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Bennett, you and I--we’ve... I 
                        don’t understand--

                                 BENNETT
                        My dad asked... Are we not okay?

           Dulcie goes tense. Silent. She takes a big breath and shakes 
           her head. But seeing him vulnerable, she’s reassured:

                                 DULCIE
                        We’re okay.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 BENNETT
                        I don’t know what you are. Or how. 
                        Or what’s happening. Every day but 
                        this one, I live in a different 
                        world.  

           It hurts her, hearing this. Her eyes well up, search the 
           ground as if their memories are written there. She’s scanning 
           them, recalling their lifetime together. 

                                 DULCIE
                        Feels like that when you are here. 
                        Sometimes. You--you’re closed. It’s 
                        like... you’re mad at me. Because--

                                 BENNETT
                        I love you.

                                 DULCIE
                        Exactly. Does it scare you? Loving 
                        me too much? You ever think that? 
                             (a beat, silence)
                        Bennett, you just. Need to open up. 
                        Talk about stuff.  

           Eventually, she finds his face again, finds him staring at 
           her. That breathless, all-consumed look in his eyes. 

                                 BENNETT
                        I’ll talk about whatever you want.

           She nods, wipes at her eyes and gives him a smirk. It grows 
           into a wide grin as she glances around. Everyone’s watching 
           the next meet. Bennett smiles now at her mischief.

           Dulcie takes his hand and drags him to a WALLED OFF AREA on 
           the way to the restrooms.

           She leans into him, giggling as they press against the wall. 
           He wraps his arms around her and laughs, relishing this 
           moment, until her muffled laughter subsides. He kisses her 
           hard, hands roaming... But then--

           A SWIM MOM marches behind the wall, headed for the bathroom. 
           She stops when she sees them. Bennett and Dulcie release each 
           other.

                                 SWIM MOM
                        --I--sorry... I can--

           Embarrassed, she stumbles back the way she came. Dulcie and 
           Bennett burst into laughter, her mouth hangs open--he's in 
           trouble.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE
                        Ooohhh... Lizzie's mom! Of all the 
                        moms! You're gonna get an 
                        eemaaaiil.

           Bennett grabs a dry TOWEL hanging from a nearby hook, pulls 
           Dulcie close again and throws it over their heads.

           UNDER THE TOWEL

           Their giggling continues. Bennett shakes his head, puts a 
           finger over Dulcie’s mouth, his grin huge... but then slowly 
           collapsing as he looks at her. He’ll lose her again tomorrow.

           She shakes her head, adamantly protesting his grief. She 
           whispers, assuring him:

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        We’ll figure it out. We’re gonna 
                        figure it out. 

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - SERIES OF SCENES - NIGHT

           AT HOME Bennett and Dulcie cook spaghetti. Bennett takes 
           breaks to show Emma how to throw noodles at the wall. In 
           EMMA'S BEDROOM, she falls asleep as Bennett finishes a 
           bedtime story. Dulcie leads Bennett to a BOOKSHELF where she 
           retrieves "LOVE AND THE SACRED MULTIVERSE."

           MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Dulcie and Bennett sit in bed. She holds her mother’s book 
           open in her lap.

                                 DULCIE
                        It could help. Give us answers. 
                        Just this one chapter.

           She finishes, holds it out to him. He looks at her, glances 
           at the book, then takes it and lays it open-face on the bed. 
           He takes her in his arms, resigned to tomorrow.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                             (sighs, exasperated)
                        At least read it. 

           LATER

           Dulcie lies asleep on Bennett's chest. He stares up at the re-
           emerged WATER STAIN.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Morning. Bennett opens his eyes, lying in the exact same 
           position we last saw him. No Dulcie. FOOTSTEPS approach and--

           Rachel appears, leaning over him, pulling the blanket over 
           his shoulders. She holds a hand to his forehead.

                                 RACHEL
                        How do you feel?

           He looks up at her, the loss of Dulcie and Emma sinking in 
           once again.

                                 BENNETT
                        Like, uh, like my chest has been 
                        crushed. It's hard to breathe.

           She wipes a tear at the corner of his eye.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. You were pretty gone. Sick, 
                        sleeping most of the day.
                             (a beat)
                        I know you dream about her.

           Bennett doesn't know what to say.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        Keep sleeping. I have to get to 
                        work, but your dad's on his way.

           She kisses his cheek and heads for the door.

           Once she’s gone, he finds, lost amid the rumpled bedding, 
           “LOVE AND THE SACRED MULTIVERSE” open-face-down just like he 
           left it. Across the room, the box labeled TRASH sits open.

           KITCHEN TABLE - LATER

           Bennett and Jack sit across from each other, sipping coffee. 
           Bennett stares at the chair Emma sat in yesterday morning.

                                 BENNETT
                        You were there this time. You spoke 
                        to Dulcie. And you held Emma. You 
                        called her your granddaughter.

           Jack sits in weary silence.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        And the way you held her was--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 JACK
                        You can't live the rest of your 
                        life dreaming of your dead wife and 
                        kid every four years. Seeing me 
                        seeing your dead wife and kid.

                                 BENNETT
                        What if it's not a dream, Dad? What 
                        if it's something else?

                                 JACK
                        What else?

                                 BENNETT
                        What if she's--

                                 JACK
                        Stop! Whatever this is, it has to 
                        stop. I had to face it. And you 
                        have to face it. I dread going to 
                        sleep at night, because I know 
                        there's a chance I'll see her. And 
                        fall in love with her all over 
                        again. But she's not here, is she? 
                        Do you see her? I can barely look 
                        at a yellow fucking flower. But I'm 
                        still trying to live my life.

           Bennett relents, shocked to see his dad express this much. 
           Jack stands from the table, storms off. 

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Bennett wakes up early--can't sleep. He slips out of bed, 
           puts on running shorts. Kisses Rachel, sneaks out.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY - LATER

           Bennett jogs along a paved path until he comes to the 
           COMMUNITY POOL. A junior swim-meet is in progress. He stops 
           to watch from afar, smiling at the memory. 

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Bennett sits on the couch, still in his running shorts. His 
           cell phone in hand, Roseline’s BOOK in the other--from which 
           he removes the TAROT & PSYCHIC READINGS CARD, tattered now 
           after years. He glances around, then dials the number.

                        Dee...dee...dee...we're sorry, this 
                        number has been disconnected or--

           Bennett hangs up.

           INT./EXT. MONTAGE - DAY/NIGHT

           -Bennett and Rachel go to CAKE TASTINGS and EVENT VENUES. He 
           feigns happiness, really trying to move on this time.

           -Bennett rifles through the REFRIGERATOR, dances to his ear 
           buds. Rachel approaches with a BRIDAL MAGAZINE, but stops, 
           her face twisted with strange curiosity as he sings: "Players 
           gonna play play play...Shake it off, uh-shake it off--uh-oh-
           oh," taking no notice of her.

           -Bennett and Jack eat pizza and drink beer late at NIGHT in 
           CARTER’S HARDWARE. Inventory. Jack opens up about Bennett's 
           mother with a funny story. They both laugh cautiously at 
           first, but it builds to hysterical laughter.

           -Bennett and Rachel in the BATHROOM, get ready for bed. Don't 
           talk, don't touch, barely look at each other.

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           It's dusk. Dressed in a casual gray suit, Bennett looks out 
           the window with an intense stare. A FULL GLASS OF WHISKY on 
           the sill.

           In the ceiling above him, the WATER STAIN is a faint 
           presence, seeping back through the paint.

           BENNETT'S POV: 40 or 50 FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS gather in 
           the BACKYARD. A fancy setup of tables and chairs.

           SLOW FOOTSTEPS APPROACH. It's Rachel coming down the hall, 
           almost reticent. She paces into the room.

                                 RACHEL
                        Gonna miss your own rehearsal 
                        dinner.

           A thick silence. Bennett tries to make light of the tension. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Speaking of which, c'mon, there's a 
                        party downstairs.

           He smiles, extends his hand. She doesn’t take it.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 RACHEL
                        Wow. That's a record. 

                                 BENNETT
                        A record?

                                 RACHEL
                        You can't stand to actually be with 
                        me. Like, just be.

                                 BENNETT
                        That's not true.

           But it is. A long silence. Everything they both already know 
           passes between them. It’s over. Bennett sighs--a confession.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Rachel.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s weird, it’s like--like you 
                        don’t want to love her so much, but 
                        at the same time you don’t trust 
                        that it’s--it’s enough, or 
                        something. When you love someone, 
                        they're never really gone. She, of 
                        all people, should’ve taught you 
                        that by now. You don't have to 
                        carry your wedding ring around in 
                        your wallet to prove she existed. 
                        And you don't have to, like, 
                        deprive yourself of love. I’ve 
                        never seen someone so deathly 
                        afraid of love--it literally gives 
                        you nightmares. 

           She lets out a long breath. Relieved. Then, with a small 
           smile, she extends a hand to him. He takes it. 

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Let's tell everyone after dinner. 
                        We can still enjoy the night. I'll 
                        call the site, cancel the vendors 
                        for tomorrow. Let's just keep 
                        pretending a few more hours.

           He nods. They walk out together.

           INT. JACK’S HOME - HALLWAY/OFFICE - NIGHT

           Bennett approaches the door to this forgotten room. His gray 
           suit is slightly wrinkled and disheveled, shirt half 
           unbuttoned. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           The door is ajar, a light glowing from inside casts a sliver 
           into the hall. Before entering, Bennett places a hand on the 
           door, on a paper we’ve never seen... Scotch-taped there for a 
           lifetime, it looks like... 

           It’s torn, sun-faded and yellowed. A large crossed out circle 
           is drawn in FRANTIC RED MARKER, in the middle simply reads:

           MOM’S ROOM. NO REMOVING MOM’S THINGS

           A surge of silence swells up around Bennett, staring at the 
           sign...the HOLLOW RUSH OF BEING UNDER WATER, as--

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett (12) frantically drawing this sign. 

           Bennett blinks, pushes the door open to find Jack sitting on 
           the floor, taking it all in for the thousandth time. A big 
           PLASTIC BIN beside him. Bennett watches his dad a moment.

                                 BENNETT
                        You weren’t supposed to appease me, 
                        Dad. You weren’t supposed to let me 
                        decide-- 
                             (a beat, he chokes back 
                              tears)
                        You were the adult. You were 
                        supposed to clean this stuff up. 

           Jack rises to his feet and hugs Bennett.

                                 JACK
                        You’re not the reason for this, 
                        Benny. I wanted to hold on, too. 

           He pulls back, looks at his crying son. Jack fights his 
           aversion to intimacy, digs deep for the strength to admit:

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        But I shouldn’t have. And it’s time 
                        to let go. 

           Bennett nods in agreement. Both look around the room, 
           wondering where to start. What can they possibly let go of? 
           Jack nudges the empty bin with his foot, and they begin. 

           They start on opposite sides of the room, filling the bin 
           with books, figurines, a pair of reading glasses, a sweater 
           on a chair... 

                                 BENNETT
                        ...Did you know I have a scar on my 
                        head? Twelve stitches. You remember 
                        how I got ‘em?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Jack shakes his head. He smiles.

                                 JACK
                        You got into all kinds of trouble 
                        as a kid. I’m sure your mom would 
                        have the exact moment memorized. 
                        What you were wearing. How she 
                        washed out the blood so it wouldn’t 
                        stain.

           WE HOLD on Bennett, finding a smile. And hope.

                                 DR. PARKER (PRE-LAP)
                        I’m not surprised it happened 
                        again. Wish you’d come to me 
                        sooner. It was definitely different 
                        this time?...  

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

           Bennett sits in his usual spot across from Dr. Parker. Lost 
           in his thoughts, but listening. She watches him.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        ...Recurring lucid dreams are 
                        usually repeats. 

                                 BENNETT
                        No, it was different. Different 
                        day, she and Emma were both older. 
                        I mean, literally it was like, just 
                        a day four years later. Our--the 
                        anniversary.

                                 DR. PARKER
                             (sighs)
                        You’re ready to let this go? 
                        There’s one spot left in the sleep 
                        study. I already recommended 
                        another patient, but I can bump 
                        her.

           Bennett nods; this is exactly what he came for. 

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Bennett sits at a table, studying from a MEDICAL TEXT. A 
           stack of MEDICAL BOOKS and BACKPACK beside him. His hair is 
           short and shaggy. He looks stressed, but well focused.

           A WOMAN'S LAUGH grabs his attention. He looks up to find--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Rachel, in line for a coffee, holding hands with a man, 
           GRAHAM (30). He's just said something to make her laugh. 
           Bennett watches and smiles.

           She glances to the side, catches his gaze. Awkward. No way to 
           pretend they don't see each other. He stands and walks over.

                          BENNETT
                                                         RACHEL
           Hey.
                                              Hi.

                                 BENNETT
                        You look great.

           And she does. She's glowing. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Thank you. So do you. 

                                 BENNETT
                        So, god, it's been--

                          RACHEL
                                                    BENNETT (CONT'D)
           A long time.
                                              Two years?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, over two years. Uh, this is 
                        my fiance Graham.

                          GRAHAM
                                                         BENNETT
           Hi. Pleasure.
                                              Hey. Congratulations. Wow.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Thanks. You look pretty slammed 
                        over there.

                                 BENNETT
                        Oh--yeah. It's uh, I decided to go 
                        to medical school. Decided I wanted 
                        to do more with my life than make 
                        furniture.

                                 RACHEL
                        Wow. Congratulations to you.

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah, thanks... Hey, can I talk to 
                        you a minute?

           Graham puffs up a little. Rachel is caught off guard.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        Please, only a second.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Rachel nods, looks to Graham as she follows Bennett away from 
           the line to a more secluded corner.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        I'm glad to see you happy. And. I 
                        just wanted to say that I did care 
                        about you. Really, Rachel.

           Rachel nods, assesses the shine in his eyes. Like a boy who 
           never lost hope, instead of the bitterness he used to carry.

                                 RACHEL
                        You're still in love with her. All 
                        these years. But you seem... like 
                        you’re not trying to fight it now. 
                        Like, okay with it. 

                                 BENNETT
                        I'm getting my life back. The med 
                        school thing. And finally doing 
                        that sleep study soon. So... the 
                        dreams’ll be gone.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh yeah. Leap year. The 29th is 
                        just a few days away. 
                             (beat)
                        I...I hope you figure it out.

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah, thanks. I think I will. I'll 
                        let you get back to your coffee. 
                        And Graham. Congratulations again.

           She smiles, walks away into Graham's arms.

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY

           TRASH BAG in hand, Bennett scours the HOUSE, collecting every 
           remnant of Dulcie. LETTERS, PHOTOS, SWIM MEDALS. He grabs a 
           WINE BOTTLE-TURNED CANDLE HOLDER from the DINING ROOM.

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett and Dulcie in his COLLEGE APARTMENT, 
           polishing off this BOTTLE OF WINE and laughing all night. 

           He grabs a BROKEN AND GLUED-TOGETHER DISH from the KITCHEN.

           QUICK FLASH of Dulcie and Bennett arguing at breakfast in his 
           COLLEGE APARTMENT. She stands, drops her PLATE, it breaks. 

           He grabs the Halloween SUPERMAN T-SHIRT from his BEDROOM.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           QUICK FLASH of Dulcie asleep in his COLLEGE BED, wearing only 
           this SUPERMAN T-SHIRT.

           The trash bag is full now. He takes his WEDDING RING out of 
           his WALLET. A beat as he spins it around his ring finger. 
           ...He puts it back--alongside the FOLDED, PRINTED PAGE.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Bennett sits among a handful of other waiting PATIENTS. At 
           the COUNTER an ADMIN calls:

                                 ADMIN
                        Bennett Carter!

           Bennett approaches. She hands him a STACK OF PAPERWORK on a 
           clipboard.

                                 ADMIN (CONT'D) (CONT’D)
                        Here for the sleep study?
                             (off his nod)
                        Fill all this out and turn it in to 
                        room 517 on the fifth floor.

           He nods, looks at the paperwork, which has HIS NAME and the 
           DATE already printed: FEBRUARY 28TH, 2020.

           ELEVATOR - LATER

           Bennett stands, eyes closed, head rested back against the 
           wall as the elevator climbs. He's tired, ready for the end of 
           all this. DING! The doors slide open.

           He opens his eyes to exit, but not before noticing--

           THAT GODDAMNED WATER STAIN in the tiled elevator ceiling. 
           Distinct. It's the same one as everywhere else.

           He stares a while. The doors almost close, but the next RIDER 
           steps in--looks to Bennett expectantly. Bennett finally finds 
           his way out into the--

           HALLWAY

           Perplexed, he continues down the hall and spots room 517. 

           INT. SLEEP CLINIC/ROOM 517 - DAY

           Bennett lies on a wide HOSPITAL BED, wearing a GOWN, as a 
           TECHNICIAN quietly goes about prepping EQUIPMENT nearby. Dr. 
           Parker stands beside him. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DR. PARKER
                        You ready? We start with tonight 
                        and four consecutive nights after. 
                             (off his nod)
                        You've been doing very well. 
                        Nothing to be nervous about.

           Bennett takes a deep breath, nods. She smiles, reaches over 
           him with her STETHOSCOPE, listens to his heart a few times.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                        Deep breath. 
                             (a beat, she listens)
                        This is going to be it for you, 
                        Bennett. No more dreams. Just one 
                        reality.

           She leans over him a little further, and as she does--

           QUICK FLASH - AIRPLANE

           Bennett awakens to Dr. Parker leaning over him in his seat 
           eight years ago.

                                 DR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                        Sir, we've landed. It's a quarter 
                        past seven. Everyone has de-planed.

           FOCUS on her NAMETAG--a wings emblem and the name PARKER.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Bennett jolts, causing Dr. Parker to flinch backward. He 
           shoots to a seated position, heart pounding, trying to wrap 
           his head around what he just remembered. 

           QUICK FLASH - TAROT SHOP

           The TAROT GIRL reads his cards eight years ago.

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        Space is liminal, like time. There 
                        are many realities. To have the one 
                        you want, you must believe the one 
                        you want. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           He stares into Dr. Parker’s face, certain: there’s more than 
           just one reality.

                                 BENNETT
                        I have to go. I have to go to the 
                        bathroom. I have to go.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Dr. Parker jumps aside as he runs from the room.

           INT. LAX AIRPORT - NIGHT 

           Bennett rushes through the airport.

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS LA - TAROT SHOP - NIGHT

           An Uber pulls up. Bennett gets out, walks to the front door.  

           His soft knock pushes the door ajar, as if inviting him 
           inside. He steps in to find--

           INT. TAROT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           A dark room but for dozens of lit CANDLES. The TAROT GIRL 
           stands before him. But now she's 25. And about eight months 
           PREGNANT. Her Trini accent is still thick:

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        You know 12 is a sacred number? 
                        Considered perfect. A symbol of 
                        God's authority. A mathematical 
                        keystone of the creation of the 
                        Universe.

           Bennett doesn't know how to respond. Bad idea, coming here?

           She motions for him to sit in the same place he did years 
           ago. This time on the table are several SILVER ROCKS, a 
           bottle of WHISKEY, a bag of BLACK SAND, and an OUTDATED PIECE 
           OF MEDICAL MACHINERY. Bennett takes it all in.

           The tarot girl goes about dousing each of the rocks in 
           whiskey as she speaks--

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D)
                        "As Jesus went, the crowds pressed 
                        around Him, including a woman who 
                        had been subject to bleeding for 
                        twelve years. She had spent all her 
                        money on physicians, but no one was 
                        able to heal her. She came up 
                        behind Jesus and touched the fringe 
                        of His cloak, and immediately her 
                        bleeding stopped..." Luke 8:43.

           Finished dousing the stones, she begins arranging them in a 
           large circle on the floor.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D)

                        disciples of Christ. Twelve 
                        constellations of the zodiac. 
                        Twelve months in a year. Twelve 
                        hours of day and night. Twelve 
                        musical notes in an octave.
                             (beat)
                        Twelve years for you to let go. To 
                        believe. And to return.

           She looks at him. He gets it now, but there are still parts 
           he’s piecing together.

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett’s mom in bed, frail, reading from a 
           BOOK, the cover out of focus or obscured by shadow.

                                 BENNETT
                        ...Let go...of the fear of love. 
                        ...And believe that love can create 
                        any reality. 

           A broad smile spreads across the tarot girl’s face--a 
           satisfied teacher with an “A” student. 

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        That was Death's lesson. You 
                        learned it, yes? And you've come to 
                        cross back to a different reality.

           Bennett's eyes well up as he struggles to believe.

                                 BENNETT
                        How?

           Stones now arranged in a circle, she pats the floor in the 
           middle of them. 

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        Lie here.

           Bennett does as she says, lies down in the center. She begins 
           sprinkling the black sand on each stone. It sticks, magnetic.

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D)
                        With this spell, we attract the 
                        quantum portal. But to find it, and 
                        to cross over, you must face your 
                        anchor. 

           Bennett reflects on this.

                                 BENNETT
                        My anchor?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        It is... your fear. And your 
                        belief. But also much more. It is a 
                        tether within you. It binds you to 
                        everything, good and bad. Your 
                        pain, your hopes and dreams. 
                        Like... a fracture in time, a 
                        moment when everything changed. You 
                        are bound to that moment like an 
                        anchor. Your anchor will lead you 
                        to the portal. When it does, 
                        follow.

                                 BENNETT
                        Sounds the same as a quantum event.

           She smiles. 

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        They are cosmic mirrors of each 
                        other, much the same. But a quantum 
                        event is a divergence from one’s 
                        intended path. An anchor introduces 
                        a new path for one to choose.

                                 BENNETT
                        How will I know what the anchor is?

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        It manifests differently for 
                        everyone, because the fracture is 
                        different for everyone. Could be a 
                        feeling, or a leaf on the wind. You 
                        will know it, trust me. 

                                 BENNETT
                        What if I don't see it? Or feel it?

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        Then you do not believe after all. 
                        And you will wake up here. But 
                        believing is seeing. If you truly 
                        believe, you will see. 

           Bennett’s chest heaves with anticipation and dread. 

           The tarot girl finishes with the sand, takes the outdated 
           medical device, equipped with cords and electrodes, and 
           sticks two of the electrodes onto his temples. He flinches--

                                 BENNETT
                        Whoa. What's that?
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        EEG. Old, but it works. I monitor 
                        your heart so you don't die. 
                        Crossing a portal is hard on the 
                        physical body. An object helps if I 
                        need it. A memory. You have one?

           He pulls out his WALLET, places it aside on the carpet. 

                                 BENNETT
                        My wedding ring. It’s in there.

           She nods, lifts his shirt, sticks more of the wires onto his 
           chest and abdomen. He flinches again.

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Cold, I know.

           She finishes. Stands and EXITS FRAME.

                                 TAROT GIRL (O.S.)(CONT'D)
                        Find your anchor. Follow. Cross the 
                        portal. You'll be fine.

           She returns, crouches down and offers him a full shot glass.

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT’D)
                        Whiskey. Help you sleep. I would 
                        take one, too, but--
                             (re: her belly)
                        not now.

           He takes the shot, hands her the glass.

                                 TAROT GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Okay. We are ready. Oh--one more 
                        thing. This is important, do not 
                        forget. Tell your father it's her.

                                 BENNETT
                        Huh? Tell him it's her? What does 
                        he have to do with this?

                                 TAROT GIRL
                        Don't argue. Just tell him. Okay, 
                        now we are ready. Don't be nervous.

           Bennett breathes deep. Nervous. His vision is BLURRING. She 
           smiles down at him, pulls up her sleeves in preparation to 
           begin some incantation. Revealing--

           A TATTOO of the VEVE DE ERZULIE on her forearm.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett stares, astounded. But he's too intoxicated to make 
           sense of it...

                                 BENNETT
                        Your tattoo. It's... You nev--you 
                        never told me...your name...

                                 TAROT GIRL
                             (smile widening)
                        Roseline. 

           She SNAPS HER FINGERS, and--

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           QUEEN'S I WANT TO BREAK FREE blasts Bennett awake. He bolts 
           up in bed, scrambles for the nightstand to silence his phone. 
           He finds it--a blank face that only reads:

           SAT, FEB 29 2020 7:30AM

           There's no song playing from it, no recent apps open. 
           Nonetheless, the song has stopped--now only an echo in his 
           mind that turns into FAST FOOTSTEPS bombing down the hallway 
           outside. Into the rooms bursts--

           Emma, now 11 years old.

           Giggling with mischief, like always, she pounces on him. He 
           wraps his arms around her, laughing, trying not to cry. She's 
           so big.

           INT. TAROT SHOP - NIGHT

           Bennett jolts in response to stimulus, but remains asleep.  
           Roseline observes him as she quietly prays over him.

           A tear slides from the corner of Bennett's eye. Roseline 
           turns on the EEG machine. Its BEEP is steady.

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

           Emma sprawls on top of Bennett, finding herself hilarious. 
           She whispers--

                                 EMMA
                        Wake up, Daddy.

           For a split-second, she's in a halo of light. It flashes, 
           then disappears, jarring him a bit.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           He wipes a tear from his temple and launches her into the 
           air. She soars above him, propped up on his feet.

                                 DULCIE (O.S.)
                             (approaching)
                        Emma! I know you didn't wake your 
                        father...
                             (appears in doorway)
                        When I told you not to.

           Emma is caught red handed, mid-air.

           Dulcie, now 33, gives her a look.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        C'mon. It's not funny. Let's go. 
                        Your dad had a long ICU shift last 
                        night, we need to let him sleep.

           Bennett knows not to challenge her. He lowers Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        Sorry Daddy.

           His heart breaks a little.

                                 BENNETT
                        Oh, no--don't--never be sorry for 
                        that...

           He winks at her. She grins and runs for the hall. Dulcie 
           smacks her playfully on the butt as she passes.

                                 DULCIE
                        I'll be right down, trouble! 
                        Pancakes. Blueberries or bananas, 
                        you choose.

           Dulcie walks over to the bed, sits beside Bennett.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        You got this look in your eyes 
                        right now. It's like--oh, to even 
                        explain it... like even crazier 
                        than the first night we met. Like, 
                        mesmerized.

                                 BENNETT
                        Mesmerized? I was mesmerized the 
                        night we met? At Theta?

                                 DULCIE
                        Damn straight. I could see it. Like 
                        I see it now. I am the whole world. 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        I am everything that brings you 
                        happiness. And everything that 
                        brings you pain. So is she.

           She places her forehead against his, holds his face. Again, 
           the halo of light. It flashes and then disappears, this time 
           with a faint BEEP. The EEG. 

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        We're right here, my love. We've 
                        never left. 

           Bennett pulls her against him. Holds onto her tight, afraid 
           his real life is pulling him back. Afraid Dr. Parker is 
           right. A long thoughtful silence. 

           She looks up at him, waiting for him to say something--gives 
           a disappointed nod and wipes her cheeks when he doesn’t.

                                 BENNETT
                        Dul--

           Dulcie SNIFFS, then sniffs louder, changing the subject. She 
           giggles as she sniffs his neck, his chest, his armpits.

                                 DULCIE
                        Puh! You stanky.

                                 BENNETT
                        Oh, you got jokes? You got jokes?!

           He jumps out of bed, slings her over his shoulder, and 
           carries her toward the hall.

                                 BENNETT (CONT'D)
                        I'll show you who's stanky!

           BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bennett carries Dulcie into the bathroom, haphazardly starts 
           the shower and steps in with her. Both fully clothed. She 
           squeals, now laughing hysterically.

                                 DULCIE
                        Bennett Carter! Bennett! Don't--

           INSIDE THE SHOWER

           He sets her down beneath the water, himself already soaked. 
           Doesn't try to hide how mesmerized he is; openly studies her 
           face, now 12 years older than the day they got married.

           They kiss, start peeling off clothes.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. WALNUT AVE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Bennett and Dulcie enter in bathrobes. Emma has a stack of 
           pancakes on a plate beside the stove. She's monitoring two 
           more on the griddle. Bennett is impressed...but concerned.

                                 DULCIE
                        She's fine. Every Saturday. Grab 
                        these please.

           She hands him the plate of pancakes, takes Emma’s spatula.

                                 DULCIE (CONT'D)
                        Go eat with Daddy. I'll finish 
                        these, thank you my darling.

           Emma grabs fixings and heads to the table. Bennett watches 
           her eat, no less amazed than the last time.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Sweet-pea, grab your equations book 
                        when you finish breakfast. 

                                 EMMA
                             (off Emma's frown)
                        But it’s Funday.

                                 DULCIE
                        Uh-uh. I don't wanna see that face. 
                        Turn it upside-down for Funday. 
                        Just a few word problems.

           Bennett makes a quick pouty face at Emma, commiserating with 
           her. They stifle their laughter with pancakes.

           EXT. BEACH CLIFFS - DAY

           Bennett, Dulcie, and Emma hike downward along steep bluffs, 
           each wearing a backpack, all bundled in fleece. It's cold and 
           windy, but the sun is shining.

           Emma runs ahead of them, jumping off rocks, picking flowers.

           Bennett gazes out at the expanse, the sun bouncing off its 
           glass surface to the horizon. It looks endless, overwhelming. 
           He stares eerily over the edge, until--

           BEEP! Louder than before. It seems to echo from the sky, like 
           a crack of lightning, snapping him to the present. He looks 
           to Dulcie. She didn't hear it. BEEP BEEP!
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT. TAROT SHOP - NIGHT

           Roseline hovers her hands over Bennett, who's gone rigid, 
           fists clenched, as if bracing for impact. The EEG BEEP 
           quickens. She regards it with some concern.

                                 DULCIE (PRE-LAP)
                        Bennett? ...Bennett!

           EXT. BEACH CLIFFS - SAME

           He didn't realize he'd stopped walking. Dulcie looks back at 
           him from a ways ahead.

                                 DULCIE
                        What are you doing? C'mon.

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Dulcie and Bennett put up a BEACH TENT. Emma hands them the 
           parts and pieces they need as they go. Bennett stops a beat, 
           again wary of the ocean...

                                 BENNETT
                        You don't think we're a little too 
                        close to the water?

           She turns, surveys the ocean very seriously.

                                 DULCIE
                        A tidal wave might get us...

           A smirk betrays her. He races after her. She runs, laughs as 
           he tackles her to the sand.

           LATER

           Backpacks unpacked, blankets laid out, the three of them lay 
           half-in, half-out of the tent. Bennett pulls a few thermoses 
           and sandwiches out of a small cooler, along with a small box 
           of assorted dark and white chocolates.

           Dulcie and Emma go over a math problem in her book.

           LATER

           All three of them huddle together in the tent beneath 
           blankets; Emma sandwiched between Bennett and Dulcie. They 
           watch the sunset. Dulcie eyes him with lingering 
           disappointment. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Bennett steals a glance at Dulcie and Emma, looks back toward 
           the setting sun. And the ocean. He glances around, looking 
           for his anchor, for the portal...anything. 

           LATER - DUSK

           All packed up, they head inland. Dulcie hugs a shivering 
           Emma. Bennett scans the area frantically as they walk towards 
           the PARKING LOT. Still...nothing unusual. Dulcie watches him.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                             (hands Emma car keys)
                        Oooooh!! So cold! You know what 
                        baby, why don’t you run ahead and 
                        get that heater going in the car.

           Emma takes the keys, runs for the car. They slow their pace 
           once she’s gone, Dulcie now free to air her frustration: 

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Bennett. Talk to me for Christ’s 
                        sake! I need you to open up.

           Bennett contemplates. Then-- 

                                 BENNETT
                        You never told me your mom was from 
                        Trinidad. 
                             (Off Dulcie’s strange 
                              look)
                        Her accent. Beautiful woman. And 
                        funny. I like her. 

           Dulcie goes quiet. Perplexed, wondering if he’s joking. 

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        She’s helping me. I’m with her 
                        right now. Lying down with a bunch 
                        of rocks. 

           He laughs. Dulcie’s expression edges toward astonishment-- 
           This is sounding familiar to her. 

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Today was supposed to be it, 
                        Dulcie. She told me I’m supposed to 
                        cross the portal back to you. I’m 
                        supposed to see an anchor. But--

           Dulcie stops walking.

                                 DULCIE
                        An anchor?? 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           She stares at Bennett, caught between disbelief and 
           confusion. The sun has dropped behind the horizon now. 

                                 BENNETT
                        Yeah. Why? You know what that is?

           Dulcie doesn’t seem to hear him. She fights tears, but they 
           surge. She knows it’s really all true now. He’s been 
           someplace else. Distracted, she looks around, up at the sky, 
           at her own hands--at Bennett. Fascinated.

                                 DULCIE
                             (sotto, amazed)
                        We’re between the worlds. 

           Bennett blinks. Though it seems impossible, he finally gets 
           it--what’s been happening. It was never a dream. The NEARBY 
           TIDE BREAKS, CRASHES, FIZZING to--

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett’s mom lying in that BED, on death’s 
           door, but delighting at the empty air before her. Seeing 
           between the worlds. 

                                 BENNETT
                        You know how to find an anchor?

                                 DULCIE
                             (shakes her head)
                        She mentioned the term. Used it in 
                        her advanced writings. She died 
                        before they were published. 

           Dulcie looks at Bennett, her mind racing, retracing her 
           knowledge, what her mom taught her, how she might help...

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        My mom stopped conjuring right 
                        around the time I was born. Started 
                        writing... 
                             (recalling...)
                        She, uh, she said her last visitor 
                        was an anchor. Fractured her world--

           INT. TAROT SHOP - NIGHT

           The EEG BEEP is frightening, it’s so fast. Roseline grabs 
           Bennett’s WALLET, opens it and pulls out his WEDDING RING. 
           But with it, she pulls out the FOLDED PAGE. 

           CLOSE ON THE PAGE--a corner of the top margin shows “Roseline 
           Pea--” She unfolds the page, finds her full name printed in 
           this margin, and printed in the margin on the opposite side, 
           the book title “LOVE AND THE SACRED MULTIVERSE.” 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DULCIE (V.O.)
                        --showed her a page of her book 
                        when she hadn’t even planned to 
                        write it yet... 

           EXT. BEACH - SAME

           Bennett’s face goes wild with possibility, piecing the puzzle 
           together as Dulcie continues:

                                 DULCIE 
                        ...That’s why she got her PhD and 
                        wrote it--so other people could 
                        know that...whatever reality they 
                        were living in, magic is real. It’s 
                        out there. It’s inside. And love is 
                        the most powerful kind. ’S why I’ve 
                        tried to get you to read--

                                 BENNETT
                        What page?

           Dulcie stares blankly, resenting the interruption.

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Her--her anchor. What page of the 
                        book was it?

           INT. TAROT SHOP - NIGHT

           Roseline’s eyes scan down the page of her book, to a section 
           highlighted in yellow marker... “Love moves like water 
           between the worlds.”

                                 DULCIE (V.O.)
                        I don’t remember. But, I remember 
                        what it said. It’s beautiful. 
                             (a beat)
                        “Love moves like water between the 
                        worlds...”

           EXT. BEACH - SAME

           Dulcie gazes out at the ocean, then closes her eyes, soaking 
           in the memory of her mother as she continues reciting:

                                 DULCIE
                        “...Like time and space, it has no 
                        permanent place, it is constantly 
                        moving, expanding, ebbing and 
                        flowing--”
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Tears slide down Bennett’s cheeks, his face filled with awe.

           INT. SUNNY BEDROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Bouquets of DAISIES fill the room, in various stages of life 
           and death. Bennett (12) sits beside his mom, who lies in bed, 
           Jack on the opposite side of the bed--both hold back sobs. 

           Rae clings to life by a thread, but has that book propped up 
           in her lap. And now we can see the title on its cover--

           “LOVE AND THE SACRED MULTIVERSE” BY ROSELINE PEARSON

           With fortified conviction, she reads aloud to her husband and 
           son (from where Dulcie left off), voice thin and rasping:

                                 RAE
                             (slow and labored)
                        “--ebbing and flowing. It is itself 
                        shapeless, but can take on any 
                        shape.”

           Her voice goes out. Her breathing catches. She coughs. 
           Bennett squeezes her hand. She nudges the book towards him, 
           slowly nodding, the murmur of a smile on her lips.

           Bennett takes the book, and from BENNETT’S POV, we see the 
           highlighted passage. The PAGE he tore out and kept in his 
           wallet. He struggles to continue reading as he cries:

                                 BENNETT
                        “Love has hurt us, it has drown us 
                        in its tides and taken from us. 
                        Love is an infinite expanse--”

           EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           Bennett is breathless as he listens to Dulcie, who now sees 
           how affected he is by the words. Unsure why, but she knows to 
           keep going. She strokes his face, takes his hand.

                                 DULCIE
                        “--infinite expanse, so deep and 
                        wide and dangerous that we fear it 
                        may swallow us whole. We fear both 
                        its mystery and its translucence, 
                        its vastness and its power...”

           Ocean waves CRASH, dark and ominous. Up ahead, in the-- 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           PARKING LOT

           A TRUCK pulls in near their SUV, where Emma has fallen asleep 
           in the passenger seat. 

           A few MEN AND WOMEN in swim suits pile out of the truck, pull 
           SURFBOARDS from the back. Eager to catch a set while the sky 
           is still light. 

                                 DULCIE
                        “...But it is lifeblood we cannot 
                        live without. To know its magic, we 
                        must face it. We must dive straight 
                        in.”

           QUICK FLASH of Bennett (12), book still open to the PAGE in 
           front of him, squeezing his mother’s hand. Now limp. 
           Lifeless. She’s gone.

           EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATE

           Before Dulcie has the chance to ask Bennett what’s going on-- 

           He halts. Frozen between moments. Staring at the truck parked 
           a short ways off, entirely transfixed. BEEP! BEEP! snaps from 
           the sky as he remembers:

                                 ROSELINE (V.O.)
                        If you believe, you will see... 
                        Find your anchor. Follow. 

           A shivering Dulcie watches him curiously, leads him the short 
           walk to their car and climbs into the driver’s seat. She 
           follows his gaze, but doesn’t know what’s so remarkable.  

                                 DULCIE
                        Bennett, what are you doing? It’s 
                        freezing.

           He breaks his gaze and glances around, trying to catch up 
           with his thoughts, then turns to Dulcie.

                                 BENNETT
                        Stay here with Emma. Leave the car 
                        running. 

           Dulcie assesses him, knows something is happening.

                                 DULCIE
                        Wait--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           His gaze lingers on Emma and Dulcie, just for a moment. With 
           a trembling hand, he shuts her car door and quickly trudges 
           off toward the water. Dulcie watches him a beat. 

           She looks toward the truck again, watches the surfers as they 
           finish pulling on their wetsuits. One of them--

           We recognize. The PRETTY WOMAN, 35, from the PHOTO on 
           Bennett's corkboard. Rae. His anchor. 

           She and her group, surfboards in hand, run for the water. 
           Dulcie looks back to the horizon, no longer able to see 
           Bennett over the slight incline. Just sand and sky. She's 
           unsettled. 

           After several beats she checks on Emma, still sleeping, and 
           slips out of the car to head for the water.

           EXT. BEACH - SAME

           Bennett stands ankle-deep in the ocean, looking out at the 
           horizon. His pants are soaked to the knee.

           He watches as his mother and her friends paddle out to sea on 
           their boards. In the distance--

                                 DULCIE (O.S.)
                        Bennett!

           Bennett turns, sees Dulcie walking towards him. Turns back to 
           face the ocean, and without another moment's hesitation--

           He wades forward, into the freezing waves. HIS PULSE QUICKENS 
           on the EEG monitor, echoing through the clouds, rushing over 
           the water--BEEP. BEEP. BEEP. It urges him on.

           Dulcie, still a ways off, picks up the pace, running now.

                                 DULCIE (CONT’D)
                        Bennett?! Bennett!!

           He's waist deep...chest deep, plunging ahead. Until he's 
           submerged and swimming. His powerful freestyle stroke aligns 
           with his quickening pulse.

           BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP...

           INT. TAROT SHOP - NIGHT

           BEEP BEEP BEEP--faster. Roseline crouches beside Bennett, 
           watching him in his restless torment. His vitals racing. 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           She douses his WEDDING RING in WHISKEY and BLACK SAND, then 
           slides it onto his ring finger.

           EXT. OCEAN - SAME

           Out in the water, the surfers are perplexed as they watch 
           Bennett race forward, abreast of them.

           As his head goes under, WE GO UNDER with him--into dark 
           bubbles and crashing water. As he comes up for air, WE COME 
           UP with him--back to blue sky and endless ocean.

           BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP--

           Water. Stroke, stroke, stroke. Air. Water. Stroke, stroke, 
           stroke. Air...

           EXT. BEACH - SAME

           Dulcie runs full speed into the water, screaming--

                                 DULCIE
                        BENNETT!!! Come back!!

           Eventually, waist deep, she stops, watches him dive under and 
           disappear. She stands helpless.

           EXT. OCEAN - SAME

           The surfers, perched on their boards, watch him disappear 
           below the surface. A MALE SURFER poises for action.

                                 MALE SURFER
                        What the--what's he doing?

           Bennett's mother calmly observes, while the rest wait in 
           panic for him to re-emerge. When he doesn't, the male surfer 
           dives in after him.

           EXT. OCEAN - UNDER WATER - SAME

           Bennett dives through the MURKY BROWN WORLD, swims deep, 
           deep, deep down...the surfer swims after him. We drift past 
           them, to find--

           Robert's VINTAGE MERCEDES on the bottom of--
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           LAKE PONTCHARTRAIN - FLASHBACK

           Dulcie, in her wedding dress, swims for the surface. Bennett, 
           in his suit, is right behind her. But--

           He stops short. The lace of his boot is caught in the car 
           door. He tries to free it, tries to remove his boot, 
           scrambles to untie it. It's stuck.

           BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP--echoes through the water like sonar.

           Robert--not the surfer--swims down, tries the door. Too 
           heavy. Bennett claws for the surface, choking. His nose 
           starts to bleed. Robert rushes to loosen the boot as Bennett 
           begins convulsing, still clawing, until--

           He goes motionless.

           Robert frees Bennett, grabs him, swims for the surface.

           BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEPBEEEEEEEP--

           Up, up, up, until--

           ON THE SURFACE

           The surfer breaks through with Bennett and they hit air! 
           Bennett takes a deep, GASPING BREATH, as--

           INT. TAROT SHOP - NIGHT

           Bennett awakens, GASPING and RETCHING for air, with Roseline 
           at his side. BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. Only a moment, until--

           INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

           Bennett awakens, GASPING, CHOKING. BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.

           BENNETT'S POV: Lying on a bed, staring up at a tiled ceiling 
           with THAT WATER STAIN. Dr. Parker leans over him in a halo of 
           fluorescent overhead light. Embroidered on her whitecoat: DR. 
           PARKER--similar to a nametag.

           A PENLIGHT SHINES in his eyes--

           And Dulcie (33, still same age) is there, leaning over him.

                                 DULCIE
                        Bennett? C'mon. We're right here.

           Emma's voice, from somewhere in the room, choking on tears.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        He woke up? Daddy's awake?

           And Jack, equally overwhelmed.

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        I don't know, sweetie. I think so. 
                        But we have to wait and see.

                                 DR. PARKER
                        I need this room clear right away! 
                        Call Dr. Matthews, get him in here 
                        immediately with whoever else is 
                        here on neuro!

           A WIDE view of the room reveals--

           Everyone Bennett has seen or known. In addition to Dulcie, 
           Emma, Jack, and Dr. Parker--Clay is there. Robert is there.

           His NURSE...is Rachel, the woman who sat beside him on his 
           flight the first February 29th.

           A familiar face from the airport that day later became the 
           property manager. We also recognize the surfer. In reality, 
           they're both ancillary hospital staff.

           Dr. Matthews rushes into the room--the pilot from the flight 
           where Bennett first saw Dr. Parker.

           Bennett takes this all in as Dulcie fights to stay by his 
           side. But Dr. Matthews insists--

                                 DR. MATTHEWS
                        Please! We need to give him space. 
                        We have no idea what his 
                        functioning will be like.

           Bennett, in a world of confusion...finds his voice--

                                 BENNETT
                        No. No. Wait. I'm--I...don't leave 
                        me, please...stay.

           Dulcie throws herself on him, crying as they hold and touch 
           each other. Emma (11, still same age) rushes to join them, 
           face red with tears.

                                 EMMA
                        Daddy!

           Bennett pulls her onto the bed, into his arms.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           Dr. Matthews and Dr. Parker clear everyone else from the room 
           as they allow Bennett, Dulcie, and Emma to reunite. Hugging. 
           Kissing. Crying. Bennett examines Dulcie’s face.

                                 BENNETT
                        ...Is it...still February 29th?

                                 DULCIE
                        No. It’s--

           He kisses her. A long, deep kiss. They look to Emma. Bennett 
           wipes her tears.

                                 EMMA
                        Daddy. I'm your daughter. Emma.

                                 BENNETT
                        I know who you are. I know you.

           INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - MONTAGE

           ALL MOS:

           -Bennett lies in his hospital gown on the sliding bed of an 
           MRI machine. He glides into the tunnel.

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.)
                        It's what we call a "waking coma." 
                        You've been in a partial vegetative 
                        state since the accident. Within 
                        the first year, Dr. Matthews led a 
                        surgery--fairly new at the time--

           -Dr. Matthews inspects Bennett, does some clinical tests. As 
           he talks, he runs a finger over the SCAR on the back of 
           Bennett's shaved head--the surgical incision.

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.
                        --"Deep brain stimulation." We 
                        planted electrodes in your 
                        thalamus. It was successful. You 
                        didn't speak or move voluntarily, 
                        but neuroimaging showed you were 
                        somewhat responsive...

           -Bennett sits up in his hospital bed. Dr. Parker and the male 
           surfer--a NEURO TECH--are at his bedside with Dulcie, Emma, 
           Jack, and Robert, explaining.

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                        ...On rare occasion, quite 
                        responsive. 
                                 (MORE)
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                        Your ability to see your daughter 
                        before meeting her, your ability to 
                        see Dulcie, and process certain 
                        stimuli...it's similar to a dream 
                        state.

           -Bennett works with the property manager--a PHYSICAL 
           THERAPIST--in a rehabilitation session.

                                 DR. PARKER (V.O.)(CONT'D)
                        Various realities could be 
                        selectively processed and 
                        incorporated into the dream. But 
                        much of what you experienced the 
                        last twelve years was a world 
                        created within your own mind.

           INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

           Dulcie enters carrying a few folded men's clothing items. 
           Bennett and Emma sit side by side in his hospital bed, going 
           through one of her math workbooks. Her eyes shine. It's still 
           so unbelievable.

           A beat. She joins them on the bed, pulls out a large, thin 
           TABLET. She glances at Emma, who gives an excited nod.

                                 EMMA
                        We want to show you something. 
                        Something we made for you. 

                                 DULCIE
                        We played this for you all the 
                        time. The doctors said sensory 
                        things could signal your brain. 
                        Music, visuals, memories. Our 
                        signals got through a few times. 
                        They think the anniversary was a 
                        trigger, when your scans were most 
                        active... Go ahead, Em.

           Emma opens a VIDEO on the tablet, presses play:

           We see Dulcie holding baby Emma in her arms circa 2009, 
           talking to the camera. It's hard for her--

                                 DULCIE (ON VIDEO) (CONT’D)
                        Hi my love. We know you're here 
                        with us. We want you to know that 
                        we think about you all the time, 
                        and you are a piece of our every 
                        day. We love you.
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           THE VIDEO CUTS TO:

           Clay's RECORDING of them dancing on their wedding day. 
           QUEEN'S I WANT TO BREAK FREE fades in. Bennett sways Dulcie 
           to the music playing in this small judicial room so many 
           years ago. The song builds, as--

           INT. THETA HOUSE - FLASHBACK

           The night they met. Bennett and Dulcie enter from their talk 
           outside to find Freddie Mercury now running the DJ BOOTH.

           QUEEN'S I WANT TO BREAK FREE has just started. Both seem to 
           acknowledge it’s not a typical first dance song. But Bennett 
           takes her into a waltz pose and shuffles around, twirls her. 

                                 BENNETT
                        God knooows. God knows I want to 
                        break freeee! I've fallen in looo-
                        ove. I've fallen in love for the 
                        first time and this time I know 
                        it's for reeeeee-eeal...

           Dulcie laughs, but the moment is strangely intimate--like 
           they're the only two people in the world.

           INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - TABLET SCREEN

           Their WEDDING DAY VIDEO. He dips her and kisses her as QUEEN 
           fades out. The VIDEO CUTS from their wedding dance to other 
           moments lived by Dulcie, Emma, Jack, and Robert:

           The New Orleans airport. Eating beignets on the floor. Moving 
           into the Walnut Ave house. The back yard--ladder and bricks. 
           The sonogram. Emma singing and dancing to Taylor Swift. 
           Emma's swim meet, Jack waving to the camera. A day at Emma's 
           school, working in her math book. Dulcie at the beach...

           The video comes to an end. Bennett takes a moment to process 
           it all. A hint of sadness that there's...an explanation.

                                 DULCIE
                        You okay?

                                 BENNETT
                        I have so much to tell you.

           Dulcie smiles, squeezes his hand. No words will suffice.

                                 EMMA
                        Daddy, can we go home now? 
                                     Rev. (08/30/18)

           INT./EXT. - LEXUS SUV - DAY

           They head home from the hospital in overwhelmed silence. Jack 
           drives. Emma rides shotgun. Bennett and Dulcie hold onto each 
           other in the back seat.

           Bennett gazes out the window, watches a WINDSTORM blowing the 
           trees, sunlight dancing. Something remains unresolved--

                                 BENNETT
                        Hey, Dad?

                                 JACK
                        Yeah Bennett? You need something?

                                 BENNETT
                        ...Do you ever dream of mom?

           Their eyes meet in the REARVIEW. Jack finds it a strange 
           question. But before he can answer--

           A YELLOW DAISY drifts onto the windshield. Then another. And 
           another. Then SEVERAL MORE. Jack slows to a stop, and they 
           all observe--

           A FLOWER VAN stopped in the road a short way ahead of them, a 
           fallen tree branch trapped beneath. The VAN DRIVER has the 
           back doors open, and in the back--

           Two-dozen floral centerpieces--a SEA OF YELLOW DAISIES. Half 
           of them overturned. The wind surges, whirling more of the 
           flowers out onto the street. It's beautiful.

           Jack steps out of the car.

           Bennett follows his father, followed then by Dulcie and Emma. 
           The WIND GUSTS outside the car. Jack is entranced by the 
           whirlwind of daisies. He meets Bennett's gaze...

                                 BENNETT (CONT’D)
                        Dad. Someone told me to tell you-- 
                        It's her.

           WE HOLD on Bennett and Jack, as tears shine in his eyes. 
           Jack's amazement, his questioning stare.

           Bennett and Dulcie share a look, a knowing. He pulls her and 
           Emma close as they marvel at his mother's swirling daisies--

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                                                THE END
