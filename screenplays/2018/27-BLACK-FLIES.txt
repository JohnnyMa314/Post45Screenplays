           INT. AMBULANCE - HARLEM, NEW YORK, 1993 - NIGHT

           Sirens. The back of a speeding ambulance. A metal stretcher 
           rattles. 

           Paramedic OLLIE CROSS, 22, white, closely cropped hair, sits, 
           bracing himself against the speed. 

           He stares at the ground, trying to steady his breath.

           The ambulance turns, hard. Cross reaches out a hand to 
           balance himself.

           He looks out the back window. The sirens seem to get louder.

           Then everything goes silent. Cross stares out the window, 
           watching the city pass by - cars, buildings, people. Cars, 
           buildings, people.

           Finally, the ambulance slows and comes to a stop. Cross 
           braces himself.  

           The back doors swing open and street light pours in.

           Suddenly, a barrage of sounds - sirens, screams, radios 
           crackling.

           Paramedic GENE RUTOVSKY, 40’s, crew cut, military bearing, 
           stands outside, motioning, hollering.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Come on, come on!

           Cross rises.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Cross runs down the street, lugging a trauma bag over his 
           shoulder. He frantically looks into doorways and peers into 
           cars. Emergency vehicles speed by.

           At an approaching corner, a middle aged woman stands, 
           hysterically crying, grocery bags at her feet. Two neighbors 
           try to calm her. 

                                 RUTOVSKY’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Victims on 119th!

           Rutovsky sprints alongside Cross, huffing for breath, radio 
           held high.
           Up ahead, a bloody gunshot victim writhes in the middle of 
           the street, groaning. A paramedic rushes up and starts 
           treating. A police car speeds by, headed down the block.

           Rutovsky motions and they angle down the side street after 
           the police car. Another medic is running just behind them, 
           shouting into his radio.

           At the end of the block - police cars, flashing lights. 
           Screaming from several locations, louder.

           Cross, still running, sees a crowd huddled in the doorway of 
           a large brown apartment building. An older man calls out and 
           motions to Cross.

           Cross squeezes between two parked cars as Rutovsky and the 
           other medic rush ahead. 

           Cross pushes through the crowd.

           A 13-YEAR-OLD KID lies on the stoop, very still, eyes open. 
           His head rests on a colorful backpack.

           Cross crouches and the bystanders lurch forward.

                                 CROSS
                        Step back! Step back!

           They step back. Cross sets down his bag.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                            (to victim)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 13-YEAR-OLD VICTIM
                        I’m shot.

           The kid points. Cross looks down to see -

           A hole in the kid’s white shoes, blood on the laces.

           Cross reaches into his bag to start treating the victim. The 
           crowd suddenly lurches.

           LAFONTAINE, 40’s, a thick-necked, mustached paramedic with 
           huge biceps, pushes through the crowd.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        What’s wrong with him?

                                 CROSS
                            (hesitates)
                        Shot in the foot.
                                 LAFONTAINE
                        The foot?! I’ve got critical 
                        patients! Listen to your fuckin’ 
                        radio and leave the hand-holding to 
                        the techs!

           He pushes back out through the crowd. Cross grabs his bag, 
           rises, hesitates, turns back to the victim.

                                 CROSS
                        Don’t worry. You’ll get a cast.  

           A BYSTANDER shoves him.

                                 BYSTANDER
                        Do something, man! He’s 13!

           The onlookers start to get angry. Someone else shoves him 
           from behind. He lurches forward, losing his balance, then 
           manages to push his way out of the crowd.

           Cross runs down the center of the street. More sirens 
           approaching.

           A paramedic treats a gunshot victim sprawled across a car’s 
           hood. A police officer holds the victim down with his 
           nightstick, arresting him at the same time.

           Children line the sidewalk, watching, scared.

           Several bloody bodies are spread out in the street up ahead.  
           Paramedics are treating. 

           Police try to keep onlookers away. Cross runs up to a victim -

           It’s a teenager. He’s been shot several times and blood soaks 
           his shirt and jacket. 

           He’s stares at Cross, desperately trying to speak. Blood 
           seeps out of his mouth.

           Cross drops down beside him and starts rifling around in his 
           bag, but his hands are shaking.

           An ambulance screeches to a halt. PHELPS, a young paramedic, 
           hops out of the cab, slamming a longboard onto the ground 
           next to the victim. 

           He starts to collar the victim. 

                                 PHELPS
                        What the fuck are you doing, man?! 
                        Give me a hand!
           Cross leans back in and helps to ease the victim onto the 
           board.

           A young mother with a crying baby strapped to her stands in 
           the middle of the street, wailing, deep and low. She hasn’t 
           been shot but she’s covered in blood.

           Cross and Phelps load the victim into the back of the 
           ambulance.

           The wailing gets deeper. Surreal. A sound like that shouldn’t 
           come from this body.

           Cross stares at her.

           The baby’s cries merge with the mother’s. The wailing gets 
           louder until it’s the only thing we hear.

           Cross climbs into the back of the ambulance. Shuts the doors.

           EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Later. A bay in the garage. Cross, shaken, slowly cleans the 
           ambulance:

           He wipes down the steering wheel and radio in the front cab.

           He scrubs out the back compartment, plunging a sponge into a 
           bucket of bloody water.  

           He wipes down the cables and face of the monitor in the back.

           He changes the sheets on the cot.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           An exhausted Cross opens the door to his tiny one bedroom 
           apartment. He tosses his keys on the side table.

           Cross stands in a hot shower, scrubbing himself. He tilts his 
           head back and lets the water pour over his face.

           He eases open the door to his small bedroom and peeks in. His 
           girlfriend, CLARA BURKE, 23, is asleep in bed.

           Cross steps in and slips into bed, careful not to wake her. 
           He looks at her, then lies back and stares at the ceiling.

           EXT. STATION HOUSE - DAY

           Station 18. 136th between Lenox and Fifth Avenue. 
           Leaning against the brick wall of the building - bloodstained 
           longboards lined up in a row.

           Medical debris blows against the chain link fence. 

           REGGIE VERDIS, 40’s, African American, digs with a shovel in 
           a tiny makeshift garden alongside the building. He calls out 
           and waves as Cross walks by. Cross waves back.

           INT. CHIEF’S OFFICE - DAY

           CHIEF BURROUGHS, 50’s, African American, dreadlocks pulled 
           back into a ponytail, sits at a desk. His top collar is 
           buttoned. He wears a tie and ten bars over his badge. A radio 
           behind him quietly plays the Manhattan North frequency.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        I hear you’re going to medical 
                        school.

           Cross stands on the other side, hands behind his back.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen your MCAT book.

                                 CROSS
                        I want to. My girlfriend’s in at 
                        Columbia. I didn’t get in on the 
                        first round. Or the second. I was 
                        told to raise my scores and get 
                        some experience and then reapply.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        So you came here?

                                 CROSS
                        Yes, sir. I requested it.

           Chief Burroughs looks at him steadily.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to come to Harlem. Do good 
                        things as a medic.

           The chief nods.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Well, you’ll get your experience 
                        here. Just do your job. Show up to 
                        work. That’s all we ask.

                                 CROSS
                        I will, sir.
           The chief leans back.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        How’s it being paired with 
                        Rutovsky?

                                 CROSS
                        Good, so far, sir.

           The chief laughs.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        That’s good to hear. We’ll see what 
                        you say in a few months. You have 
                        any problems, you come to me. My 
                        door’s always open.

                                 CROSS
                        Thanks, sir.

           The chief sits there, studying him.  

           Cross doesn’t know what’s going on. He shifts his weight, 
           unnerved. Finally -

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Good. Now get into service.

           Cross lets himself out and shuts the door.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Cross and Rutovsky get dressed in the medics’ locker room. 
           Cross buttons his uniform. Rutovsky takes an expensive 
           stethoscope out of his locker and puts it in his bag.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           The ambulance speeds down a Manhattan street, sirens blaring.

           Rutovsky drives. Cross sits in the passenger street. They 
           both stare straight ahead.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           A public park just under the George Washington Bridge. A 
           lighthouse nearby.

           A DOMINICAN MAN, 50’s, lies on a picnic bench, gasping for 
           breath, his legs hanging over the edge. His wife, a DOMINICAN 
           WOMAN, holds his head. Their daughter watches nearby, crying.
           Cross and Rutovsky run across a grassy hill toward the 
           victim, trauma bags in hand. 

                                 DOMINICAN WOMAN
                            (noticing them)
                        Ayudame! Ayudame!

           Cross and Rutovsky approach. Cross goes to the victim. The 
           wife goes to stand with her daughter. 

           Rutovsky notices an asthma nebulizer in the grass.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (to woman)
                        Asthmatica?

           She nods, crying. 

           Cross touches the man, upsetting his balance. The man slides 
           off the table, landing as a lump in the grass. The wife and 
           daughter call out. Cross crouches down next to him.  

           His chest heaves once and then he’s still. Eyes glazed.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Showtime.

           Rutovsky tosses over his tube kit.

                                 CROSS
                        Not on this guy. He’s dying.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Gotta learn sometime, Cross.

           Rutovsky crouches and works a bag-valve mask over the man’s 
           face. 

           Cross starts to set up the laryngoscope, his hands shaking.

           Rutovsky steps away from the body. 

           Cross moves around, positioning himself at the head. He 
           crouches and goes into the man’s mouth with the laryngoscope. 

           He misses the first time. 

           He tries again and gets it successfully in the second time. 
           He roots around, looking, then -

                                 CROSS
                            (starting to panic)
                        I can’t see the cords.
                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Look again.

                                 CROSS
                        He’ll die.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        He’ll definitely die if you sit 
                        there not doin’ nothin’.

           The beeping of the heartbeat monitor is slowing. Cross looks 
           up. 

           The wife and daughter watch, crying, clinging to each other. 
           The daughter wipes her eyes with a pair of strangely bright 
           white mittens.  

           Cross grips the scope and goes back in, searching. Rutovsky 
           watches.  

           Cross roots around, desperate. He finally finds them.

                                 CROSS
                        They’re shut. That’s why I couldn’t 
                        see them.

           Cross looks up. Rutovsky stares at him.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do it, Rut! He’ll die.  The 
                        cords are spasmed shut.

           Rutovsky doesn’t move. The beeping of the monitor slows down 
           further. 

           The wife and daughter start screaming, begging the medics to 
           do something.

           Finally, Rutovsky drops down and pushes Cross aside. He 
           snatches the scope and slides it into the man’s mouth.

           He repositions himself, careful, alert, calm.  

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Come here. I want you to see this.

           Rutovsky hands him the tube with one hand and holds the scope 
           in place with the other. Cross leans in and looks. 

           On the screen, two white lines, barely visible.
                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Those are the cords. The two white 
                        lines. Remember what they look 
                        like. Remember how to find them.

                                 CROSS
                        They’re clamped shut.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Just wait.

           They wait. And wait. 

           The mother and daughter are wailing.

           Wait.

           The guy’s chest heaves up.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           Cross stabs the tube downward. After a moment...  

           The beeping of the monitor slowly picks up speed.  

           The man’s skin flushes. Cross rocks back on his heels, 
           relieved.

                                 CROSS
                        Thanks, Rut.

           Rutovsky ignores him, listening with his stethoscope.

           The wife and daughter rush to his side, in tears, and thank 
           them.

           Cross stares at the victim slowly coming to.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           The ambulance slows as it approaches a recently crashed 
           motorcycle, roped off from the rest of the road with orange 
           cones and police tape. Smashed cycle parts are scattered 
           across the road. An officer motions and Rutovsky drives 
           around.

           The rider is a full block away - a lump, not moving. A small 
           group of cops keep bystanders away.

           The ambulance stops and Cross and Rutovsky jump out. 

           Cross grabs a longboard out of the back.
           They duck under the police line and rush to the body - a 
           Jamaican kid, legs twisted at impossible angles. His mouth 
           opens and closes mechanically. His chest is not moving.

           Cross and Rutovsky ease the victim onto the board. Cross puts 
           the collar on. 

           They lift the victim, maneuver back out through the crowd and 
           police line, and head for the ambulance. 

           Another ambulance drives up and Verdis jumps out of the 
           passenger seat. 

           Cross and Rutovsky load the victim into their ambulance. 
           Verdis climbs into the back just as they finish loading. 
           Cross shuts the doors.

           Inside. Cross starts breathing for the victim with the bag 
           valve mask. Verdis and Rutovsky both go to the victim’s arms, 
           ready to set up an IV bag.  

           Rutovsky and Verdis glance up at each other. It’s race time.

           Verdis quickly takes out a fourteen-gauge angiocath (metal 
           tube) and kneels on the bag to run it through.

           Rutovsky doesn’t run a line. He wraps a stretchy band around 
           the victim’s arm, tightens it, and finds a vein. Then he 
           holds the fluid bag high in the air while starting the IV 
           with the other. He finishes before Verdis even gets started.

           Verdis looks up, impressed.

                                 VERDIS
                        Beautiful.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - LATER

           A bit later. The siren blares. The ambulance speeds back to 
           the station. 

           Cross sits with the victim in the back as they drive. The 
           monitor beeps steadily.  

           The young victim on the stretcher stares up at Cross. Cross 
           stares back. A long moment as they look at each other. 

                                 CROSS
                            (quietly)
                        You’re gonna make it.

           Something shifts in the victim’s eyes. They go empty.
           The life drains out of him. The monitor flatlines.

           Cross stares at the victim and shakes his head. He grabs the 
           defibrillator paddles and turns them on.

           He places them onto the victim and waits as they charge. 
           Waits.

           He presses the button. The body convulses with the shock.

           The monitor flatlines again. Cross BANGS his hand against the 
           ceiling of the ambulance.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                            (calling out)
                        He’s flatlined! He’s flatlined!

           He shocks the body again.

           EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Cross and Rutovsky roll the victim out of the ambulance, now 
           covered by a white sheet.

           INT. MEDIC’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           The tiled floor lounge area. Verdis enthusiastically tells a 
           story to the surrounding medics. LaFontaine stands in the 
           doorway. Cross sits in the corner, listening.

                                 VERDIS
                            (laughing)
                        Motherfucker ran a line with one 
                        hand and set the angiocath with the 
                        other. And with his left fucking 
                        hand!

           The medics laugh. Rutovsky doesn’t react. 

           Cross shakes his head and looks away, distracted. Verdis goes 
           on with his story, but we can’t make out the words.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           The small living room of Cross and Clara’s apartment. Exposed 
           pipes. Cross sits at a small desk - a calculator, timer, 
           three sharpened pencils sit lined up in a row. He’s taking a 
           test, but having trouble concentrating. He stares at the 
           sheet.
           The sound of keys in the lock, then the door opens. Clara 
           comes in carrying a book bag. She sees Cross at the desk.

                                 CLARA
                            (surprised)
                        You’re awake.

           Cross doesn’t answer. He makes a mark on the test. Clara goes 
           into the bedroom.

           Cross shuts his eyes, opens them, and tries to refocus. The 
           timer dings. He looks down at the test. He didn’t even come 
           close to finishing. 

           He turns the page and starts checking his answers as Clara 
           comes back in. She crosses over to him and puts her arms 
           around him from behind.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        How’d you do?

                                 CROSS
                        Better. How was school?

                                 CLARA
                        Good. We got to see the bodies 
                        today. That guy from California 
                        totally passed out.

           She tries to look at the test. He flips it over and turns in 
           his seat to look at her.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I haven’t seen you.

                                 CROSS
                        You haven’t.

           He smiles. He kisses her, picks up a mug from off the desk, 
           and goes into the kitchen. 

                                 CLARA
                        Kind of shitty, isn’t it? Is this 
                        your shift for good?

                                 CROSS (O.C.)
                        I mean, it’s not a grocery store. 
                        You don’t get to pick and choose.

                                 CLARA
                        I know. I just miss you. I didn’t 
                        think we’d be apart this much until 
                        our residencies.
           He comes back in with coffee and leans in the doorway.

                                 CROSS
                        It’s just for a year.

           She looks at him.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - EARLY EVENING

           Cross and Rutovsky stand in front of the parked ambulance.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Cross, meet Lance. You’ll be seeing 
                        a lot of him.

           An older HOMELESS MAN sits in front of the door of the 
           restaurant with a forty ounce beer, a stuffed orange backpack 
           by his side.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        What’d I do now?!

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You’re unconscious.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Aw fuck that, I mighta closed my 
                        eyes - but I didn’t pass out. They 
                        just don’t like me sittin’ here, so 
                        they call it in.

           Cross notices the manager watching them.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Look, you can come with us to the 
                        ER - or find some other place to 
                        sit. Those are your choices.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Fuck that. Free country.

           He makes a toast with his forty and drinks.  

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Option 3. I call P.D. My buddy on 
                        the force shows up and they tool 
                        you up in the back of the squad car 
                        - you spend three days in 
                        processing.

           Cross steps forward.
                                 CROSS
                        Sir, it’s easier if you walk away.

           Rutovsky looks at Cross. The homeless man laughs.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Aw, thanks for spelling it out for 
                        me. Look at that uniform - it’s 
                        still got the creases in it. Jesus.  
                        Welcome to Harlem, mothafucker.

           Rutovsky almost laughs. The homeless man takes a long swig, 
           wedges the bottle into his backpack, shoulders it, and 
           stands. He salutes the medics and wanders off.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Another successful medical 
                        intervention.

           The manager comes barrelling out.

                                 MANAGER
                        You just let him walk away?!

           Rutovsky walks around the ambulance to the driver’s side. 

                                 CROSS
                            (to manager)
                        We look like cops?

                                 MANAGER
                        He’ll just come back - then I gotta 
                        call again!

           Rutovsky opens his door, sets his equipment in the side 
           compartment, climbs in, and -

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (to manager)
                        He left. What do you care?

           - shuts his door. Cross climbs into the ambulance.

           INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

           He shuts the door. Rutovsky is already reading his Daily 
           News. Cross pulls his MCAT textbook off the dash and notices 
           something out the front windshield.

           The homeless guy crosses in front of the ambulance and comes 
           around the side, holding his beer. Cross watches him.
           The homeless guy peers through the driver’s side window, 
           hard. Rutovsky ignores him.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Assholes!

           He spits beer all over the window. It runs down the glass.  

           Cross waits to see what Rutovsky will do.  

           Rutovsky sits very still for a moment. Then he switches on 
           the radio and turns a page of the newspaper. The homeless man 
           wanders away, yelling at someone else.

           Cross glances down at Rutovsky’s uniform. Rutovsky eventually 
           senses him staring.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        What?

                                 CROSS
                        What’s that one for?

           Rutovsky looks at him, then down - a single black bar over 
           his badge.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        It’s the thing I’m most proud of.

                                 CROSS
                        What is it?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (not looking at him)
                        From when I was in the war. It’s a 
                        kill bar. For a confirmed kill.

           Rutovsky goes back to reading.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Cross and Rutovsky walk across the lot of Station 18.  
           Discarded dirty longboards and medical debris everywhere.

           LaFontaine hurries the other direction, lugging a large 
           plastic bag with something heavy inside.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        What’ve you got?

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        You don’t know and you don’t wanna 
                        know.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT'D)
                            (to Cross)
                        And you definitely don’t wanna 
                        know.

           LaFontaine passes them. Cross glances back at him.

           INT. MEDICS’ LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Cross and Rutovsky walk into the medics’ lounge and set down 
           their bags. 

           In the corner of the room, Verdis argues with MARMOL, 30’s, 
           another paramedic on his shift. Verdis shakes a hand in his 
           face and walks away.

           Cross glances towards the chief’s office.

           Through the window - Phelps stands in front of the chief’s 
           desk, staring at the ground, while Chief Burroughs speaks to 
           him gently but firmly. 

                                 CROSS
                            (to Rutovsky)
                        What’s going on?

           LaFontaine busts into the lounge, wiping his hands with a 
           rag.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Put a fork in’m, he’s done!

           He tosses the rag in the trash.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                            (to everyone)
                        I told you that fucker wouldn’t 
                        make it, didn’t I say that? We had 
                        on MVA on the Triboro. He didn’t do 
                        nothin’ - just fucking sat there, 
                        not doin’ shit. Kept saying, “Head 
                        like a crushed melon.” Didn’t even 
                        help with the patients. 

                                 VERDIS
                        You could be cool about it. We’ve 
                        all been there.

           LaFontaine crosses over and laughs in his face.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Speak for yourself. I ain’t never 
                        been there. It’s time for that boy 
                        to transfer the fuck out of here.
           LaFontaine notices Cross looking at him.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        You want us to give you one, too? 
                        Make it a little two for one?

           Cross looks down. 

           Another medic sits in the corner, reading a magazine, 
           ignoring the whole thing. Rutovsky stands in a doorway.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (to LaFontaine)
                        He’ll go out tonight, get loaded, 
                        fuck his wife, come back tomorrow 
                        and it’s another day. He’s a tough 
                        kid.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Twenty bucks.

           They slap hands - it’s on.

           Phelps comes out of the chief’s office, glassy-eyed, shell-
           shocked. 

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                            (clapping his hands 
                             together)
                        Here he comes, folks! New York’s 
                        finest!

           Everyone watches Phelps. He wanders slowly into the lounge 
           and then stands still, dazed.  

           LaFontaine grins at Rutovsky - “What did I tell you?”

           Phelps turns and looks around the room, studying the watching 
           faces. He looks at LaFontaine. 

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t hack it, I don’t have 
                        time for you. 

                                 PHELPS
                        I’m not transferring.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Mmm hmm. We’ll see. 

           Phelps stares at him. A face-off. Verdis steps forward to get 
           between them.

           Phelps suddenly turns to Cross.
                                 PHELPS
                        What’re you looking at, rookie?!

           Cross just stares at him.  

           Phelps turns and walks out. Verdis quickly follows.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                            (calling to Verdis)
                        What’re you, his mother? Let’m work 
                        it out himself.

           Cross follows Verdis out. LaFontaine laughs and turns to the 
           others.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        No fucking way that guy’s showing 
                        up tomorrow.

           Rutovsky shakes his head.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Two kids in t-shirts hang out a window of a brownstone across 
           the street. They toss two paper airplanes that spiral down in 
           the dim light.

           Cross and Verdis are just behind Phelps as he strides across 
           the parking lot. They try to calm him down.

                                 VERDIS/CROSS
                        Come on, man, come back inside -

           Phelps tears open the door to his car. He looks inside, sees 
           something, and immediately slams it shut. 

           Cross and Verdis freeze.

           Phelps KICKS the car, hard, repeatedly.

           Once he’s done, he rests his head on the door and covers his 
           eyes.

                                 PHELPS
                            (breaking down, barely 
                             audible)
                        I can’t - fuck this, fuck this 
                        shit, just...

           He starts crying. A long moment.

           Cross steps forward, carefully. 
           As he nears - the sunroof of the car has been smashed in, 
           glass everywhere. Something appears to be sitting in the 
           driver’s seat. 

           Cross angles closer to get a better look. He freezes.

           A bloated dead dog is propped up in the driver’s seat. Wires 
           are wrapped around the paws, attaching them to the steering 
           wheel. It looks like it’s driving.

           The other medics all stand at the edge of the parking lot 
           watching.

           Phelps stands there with his head on the car, hysterically 
           crying. His back shakes violently. 

           Maggots swarm across the dog and front seat. Cross has to 
           look away.

           Everyone is still, silently watching.

           Finally, Phelps pushes away from the car and walks back into 
           the station, head down. 

           He brushes past Cross and the medics, not looking at them.

           As he nears the station, LaFontaine comes out, laughing.  He 
           watches Phelps go back inside.

           Then he gets right up in Cross’s face.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Pay attention. You’re next.

           LaFontaine stays close, daring him. Everyone watches.

                                 CROSS
                        Not happening. I’m not 
                        transferring.

           LaFontaine smiles and looks to Rutovsky.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        We’ll see. 

           Everyone except Cross starts to walk back inside.

           Rutovsky approaches LaFontaine and hands him a crumpled 
           twenty dollar bill.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you get that fucking dog?

           LaFontaine laughs. They disappear back into the station. 
           Cross stands alone in the parking lot. After a moment, he 
           turns and walks away in the opposite direction.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Cross purchases a pint-sized bottle of vodka at a liquor 
           store. The clerk gives him his change from behind a bullet-
           proof partition.

           INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

           Cross rides the subway home. He takes out the bottle hidden 
           in a brown paper bag and takes a long swig.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Cross drunkenly takes out his keys as he walks up to the 
           apartment. He tries to unlock the door, but his hands are 
           shaking. He tries again, but drops the keys on the ground. He 
           stares at them.

           INT. MEDICAL SCHOOL - DAY

           Cross leans on a counter at a visitor’s desk. A receptionist 
           hands him a guest pass.

           Cross walks down a hallway. Two students wearing medical 
           scrubs pass him, headed the other direction.

           INT. MEDICAL LAB - DAY

           A high shelf lined with medical jars - floating hearts, 
           brains, kidneys, fetuses. Medical students dissect bodies on 
           steel tables.

           A half-dissected cadaver lays on a steel table, the interior 
           cavity of the body open, organs visible. Grey formaldehyde 
           pools in the plastic wrapping around the body.

           Clara, in lab gear, her long straight hair folded tight under 
           a blue cap, stands over the body, prodding the organs with 
           forceps. Cross stands at the foot of the cadaver and watches.

                                 CLARA
                        Well, fuck him. Don’t let them get 
                        to you.
                                 CROSS
                            (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, okay.

                                 CLARA
                        Everyone has to be new at some 
                        point.

           Cross is silent. 

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be here next year anyway.

                                 CROSS
                        If I get in.

                                 CLARA
                        Don’t say if. Say when.

                                 CROSS
                        I’ll say “when” when it happens.

           Clara picks up a scalpel and makes a cut inside the body.

                                 CLARA
                        This is what happens to you. People 
                        think you’re a nice guy - so they 
                        mess with you. Test you. They want 
                        to see if you’ll quit.

           She looks up at him.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        You have to make a choice. Either 
                        walk away. Or fit in. Convince them 
                        you can survive.

                                 CROSS
                        How?

           She puts down the scalpel. 

                                 CLARA
                        Make them think you’re one of them.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Screaming. A Rottweiler with a bloody mouth pads up and down 
           the street, snapping at pedestrians.

           A street outside the medics’ station. A ten-year-old boy with 
           a raw, gnawed arm SCREAMS, blood dripping down his arm and 
           all over the sidewalk.
           Cross and Rutovsky pull up in the ambulance. They hop out.

           A crowd of kids has formed. They taunt the dog and jump back 
           when he lunges at them.

           Cross and Rutovsky rush up to join a group of medics nearby.

           The dog turns the corner and walks into the fenced-in parking 
           lot of the station just as LaFontaine walks by. He slams the 
           chain link gate shut and locks the dog in.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        You’re welcome! You guys need me to 
                        solve any other problems, just let 
                        me know.

           Verdis bandages the young victim from a small tech bag.

           The crowd runs up to the fence and bangs on it. They shout at 
           the dog and throw empty bottles over the fence.

           The dog barks and dodges the bottles. Glass shatters around 
           him.

           A TEENAGE BOY in the crowd pulls a small pistol out of a 
           backpack and aims it at the dog.

                                 TEENAGE BOY
                        He bites my friend, I cap him.  
                        That’s it.

           Cross looks back to the ambulance, thinking.

           Rutovsky puts a call over his radio, asking for a rush on the 
           police. LaFontaine waves him off.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Forget the cops. Dog bites him, 
                        they shoot the dog. Long as he 
                        doesn’t hit my car, that’s justice.

           Sirens approach. Cross rushes to the cab of the ambulance.  

           He rifles around in his backpack and pulls out a little brown 
           bag.

           The teenage boy is aiming. The dog runs back and forth among 
           the cars, desperately trying to find a way out.

           Cross runs to the gate and opens it. The crowd lurches back. 
           The dog wheels around and barks and growls at Cross.
                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Look at this fuckin’ genius.
                            (calling to Cross)
                        What’re you gonna do?! Shut the 
                        fuckin’ gate!

                                 CROSS
                        Give me a minute!

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        He’s got no brains, and soon he’ll 
                        have no balls!

           The crowd laughs. Cross eases the gate shut behind him and 
           approaches the dog. He reaches into the brown bag and pulls 
           out a pastrami sandwich.

                                 CROSS
                        Hey pup. Hey pup.

           Someone in the crowd - “If that’s a pup, I’d hate to see his 
           mother.” Rutovsky watches, silently.

           Cross inches forward, tears off a piece of meat from the 
           sandwich, and tosses it on the ground.  

           The dog lunges at him, just missing. The crowd reacts. Cross 
           jumps back. He regains his balance.

           The dog growls at Cross. Cross tosses more meat.

           The dog looks at the meat. Then back to Cross. Cross waits.

           The dog approaches the meat. He sniffs and snatches it up.

           Rutovsky watches, nodding to himself. Sirens getting closer.

           Cross tosses more. The dog eats that too.

           Cross tosses the rest of the sandwich and the dog eats it up.  

           Cross eases over and reaches for the dog’s collar. The dog 
           suddenly SNAPS at him. Cross jumps back.

           Someone from the crowd - “Motherfucker should’ve brought a 
           bigger sandwich.” Laughter. Cross freezes for a moment, eyes 
           locked on the dog.

           He inches forward and reaches out a hand. The dog growls, 
           watching. He moves the hand slowly - closer, closer, closer, 
           finally -

           The dog pads forward and sniffs his hand.
           Cross carefully takes the dog by the collar. 

           The police cars arrive. Rutovsky opens the gate for Cross as 
           he guides the dog out.

           Cross hands the dog over to the cops, who put it in the back 
           of a squad car. 

           Officers start to break up the crowd. 

           A MUSCLE-BOUND GUY in a tank top and a black fez rushes up, 
           holding a leash.

                                 MUSCLE-BOUND GUY IN A FEZ
                        Where’s my dog? Who the fuck’s got 
                        my dog?!

           A kid nearby lifts his shirt and reveals a machete in his 
           waistband.

                                 MACHETE KID
                        That dog bit my brother. So I’m 
                        gonna get that dog.

                                 MUSCLE-BOUND GUY IN A FEZ
                        You hurt that dog, I hurt you.

           The crowd gets agitated. Cross steps up to the guy.

                                 CROSS
                        See that kid with the bandage? Your 
                        dog bit him.

           The muscle-bound guy considers him.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                            (to muscle bound guy)
                        Yeah, you might apologize. Rather 
                        than being an asshole bout it.

           The muscle-bound guy breaks away.

                                 MUSCLE-BOUND GUY
                        Where the fuck’s my dog?!

           Verdis steps in and guides him away.

                                 VERDIS
                        Come this way - talk to the 
                        officers...

           Once they’re gone -
                                 LAFONTAINE
                            (to Cross)
                        You see that?! You saved that 
                        gorilla’s dog. Did he thank you for 
                        it?

                                 CROSS
                        Yeah, where’s my fucking gift 
                        basket?

           Rutovsky laughs. LaFontaine hesitates, then laughs, too. 

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Shit. I’m starting to like this 
                        guy.

           Rutovsky taps Cross’s shoulder.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You ready, Cross? They want us in 
                        service.

           They walk away.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A fireman cuts a man’s North Face jacket and rips it off. He 
           throws it aside.  

           The man lies on the pavement in a pool of blood, hoodie still 
           on, white feathers stuck to his face and chest.  

           A fireman starts doing CPR - “Let’s go, let’s go, he’s not 
           breathing!” Cross rushes up and tosses his equipment down.

                                 CROSS
                        Board and collar, let’s get going.  
                        Everything else en route.

           Rutovsky stands behind Cross.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Look at him closely, Cross. You 
                        sure you wanna work him?

                                 CROSS
                        Definitely. This guy just coded.

           Rutovsky shakes his head and looks away.

           Cross eases the body onto the longboard. Blood soaks the 
           victim’s hood at the back of his head.
           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Later. Three doctors walk out of an emergency room - one 
           shakes his head, one laughs. The third DOCTOR notices Cross 
           and Rutovsky standing down the hall. He marches over to them.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Who brought him in?

           Rutovsky smiles and slaps Cross on the back.

           Inside the room. The victim from earlier lies flat on a 
           stretcher. Cross stands over him, Rutovsky just behind.  

           The doctor reaches over and tilts the victim’s head to the 
           side. Cross looks away.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                            (right at Cross)
                        As far as I know - patients without 
                        a brain cannot be resuscitated.

           He lets go of the victim’s head.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Be more careful next time - don’t 
                        waste our time.

           The doctor exits. Rutovsky looks at Cross, who looks away.

           EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM GARAGE - DAY

           Cross leans against the ambulance in the garage bay. Rutovsky 
           smokes.

                                 CROSS
                        I got excited. I made a mistake.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You’re a rookie. You’re supposed to 
                        want to treat everyone. Long as you 
                        don’t get on your high horse no one 
                        gives a fuck. You learned 
                        something. We can’t be treating 
                        every unsalvageable patient. Keep 
                        your eyes open, stay calm...

           Rutovsky tosses away the cigarette.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        And always check the back.

           He opens the driver’s side door.
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Cedar Tavern. Eighties music and bottles clinking. A waitress 
           clears away empty pint glasses. Clara makes a toast - “To 
           midterms being done!” - everyone cheers.

           A tipsy Cross argues with a MALE CLASSMATE of Clara’s. They 
           struggle to be heard above the noise. Clara takes a seat next 
           to Cross.

                                 CROSS
                        I’d have given him Dopamine, but 
                        Rutovsky -

                                 MALE CLASSMATE
                        Wait, who’s Rutovsky?

                                 CROSS/CLARA
                        My partner./His partner.

                                 CROSS
                        Right, my partner, he pinched her 
                        skin. It tented. She was 
                        dehydrated. He said we should try a 
                        fluid bolus.

                                 MALE CLASSMATE
                        You don’t give fluid to someone 
                        with pulmonary edema. That’s 
                        obvious, right?

                                 CLARA
                        That’s what I said.

                                 CROSS
                        It’s under the discriminatory 
                        cardiogenic shock treatments.

           Clara puts a hand on Cross’s arm and squeezes, trying to get 
           him to ease up.

                                 MALE CLASSMATE
                        It’s risky.

                                 CROSS
                        It worked.

                                 MALE CLASSMATE
                        Yeah, but it’s not recommended, 
                        though, right?

                                 CROSS
                            (sharp)
                        It is recommended. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CROSS (CONT'D)
                        It’s in the fucking discriminatory 
                        options. And it worked. How can you 
                        argue against it?

                                 MALE CLASSMATE
                            (taken aback)
                        I didn’t realize I was arguing.

           Clara leans over.

                                 CLARA
                        You weren’t.

           She gives Cross a look. Cross looks back to the classmate, 
           who takes a drink.

           INT. CAB - NIGHT

           Cross and Clara in a cab on the way home.  Clara is looking 
           away, out the window. Silence. Then -

                                 CROSS
                        Come on, that fucking guy is acting 
                        like he knows something about it.  
                        He’s a student. He’s probably never 
                        treated a real patient before.  

           Clara looks at him.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I mean, what the fuck?

           Cross waits for her to say something. She looks away back out 
           the window.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           LaFontaine drives. Cross sits in the passenger seat.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Homeless fucks don’t get outta the 
                        way. They want you to hit ‘em. They 
                        think they’ll make money off it.

           LaFontaine points and Cross looks. A homeless man crosses 
           slowly in front, looking straight at them.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        You seen Rut whack anyone with the 
                        ambulance yet?
                                 CROSS
                        No.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        I’ve done it twice - but not on 
                        purpose. And haven’t killed anyone 
                        yet, but, hey, three’s a charm.

           LaFontaine swerves around him and speeds up.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        You’re lucky Rut called in sick.  
                        We can finally train you right.
                            (beat)
                        Guess what day I’m on?

                                 CROSS
                        What?

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Seventeen. Seventeen days without 
                        anyone thanking me. Almost broke my 
                        streak yesterday. Puerto Rican 
                        girl. Asthmatic. Good looking - had 
                        a fucking rack. I give her the 
                        point four sub q. She starts 
                        feeling better. I mean - a minute 
                        before she’s not moving air, now 
                        she’s breathing twelve times a 
                        minute. I think the least she’s 
                        gonna do is thank me. So she leans 
                        in. Guess what she says?

                                 CROSS
                        She wants Verdis’s number?

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Fuck off. She says, “You know, you 
                        got really bushy eyebrows.” Just 
                        like that. In her Spanish accent - 
                        “You got really bushy eyebrows.”  
                        And they expect me to be polite.
                            (out windshield)
                        Look at this genius.

           A man in a suit, holding coffee, steps off the sidewalk into 
           the street. 

           LaFontaine angles the wheel toward the curb.
           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The sideview mirror of the ambulance SMACKS the coffee out of 
           the guy’s hand as it speeds past.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

           Metallica blares out of LaFontaine’s car as he holds court in 
           the lot, medics surrounding him. LaFontaine shows Cross the 
           heavy flashlight on his utility belt.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        See - this one’s good, because it 
                        looks like just a flashlight - but 
                        if someone fucks with you...BAM!

           He mimes hitting someone with the flashlight. Medics laugh. 
           From a window across the street - “Turn the music down!”

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                            (calling out)
                        I’m sorry! Are we keeping you up?!

           He reaches into the car and cranks the music up.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           The next day. A trail of blood leads up a staircase, pooling 
           in places.  Cross and Rutovsky follow it up.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        He couldn’t just lie down? He just 
                        had to run up to the highest floor 
                        possible, didn’t he?

           Cross laughs. They reach the next landing and keep climbing. 
           A few floors up, they come upon -

           An ASIAN MAN, mid-20’s, perched on the steps. His hand is 
           pressed hard against the side of his face. Blood seeps 
           between his fingers and soaks his shirt.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        I’m shot is what happened.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Where?
           The man removes his hand. An inch in front of his left ear - 
           a small entrance wound. Looks like a cigarette burn. Cross 
           sets down and opens his bag to start treating.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Only one shot?

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        I didn’t wait around for a second.

           Rutovsky looks at the other side of the man’s head.

           The bloody exit wound is directly in his right ear.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (almost to himself)
                        Bullet went straight through.

                                 CROSS
                            (to kid)
                        How do you feel?

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        I have a headache.

           Cross looks to Rutovsky, then back to the guy.

                                 CROSS
                        Normally I think our patients are 
                        complainers. But in your case, you 
                        say you got a headache - I don’t 
                        blame you.

           Rutovsky bursts out laughing. The patient doesn’t react. 
           Cross looks back. 

           Rutovsky can’t stop laughing. He pulls away and walks a 
           little down the hall, trying to contain himself.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Rutovsky stops the ambulance in front of a shabby apartment 
           building. He puts it in park and grabs his bag.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Come on.

           Cross looks at him.

                                 CROSS
                        You’re actually gonna let me in 
                        this time?
                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Don’t get used to it.

           He opens his door.

           INT. RUTOVSKY’S PLACE - DAY

           Rutovsky tosses his keys onto a side table.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        This place sucks, I know. My kid 
                        gets all my money.

           He walks into the kitchen, which is separated from the living 
           room by a counter. He takes some bills out of a jar and 
           starts counting them. 

           Cross stands in the doorway and looks around. It’s neat, 
           efficient. A tiny TV rests on a grey fold-out chair. Cross 
           gestures to the single metal-barred window.

                                 CROSS
                        I’ve been meaning to get one of 
                        those.

           Rutovsky smiles, paper clips the money, and puts it in his 
           pocket. He starts making a pot of coffee.

           Cross steps further in and looks into the other room. A metal 
           cot against a wall, medical textbooks packed onto a low 
           shelf.

           Rutovsky comes back in and tosses something on the couch.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Almost forgot. Here.

           Cross looks - it’s an expensive Littmann Cardiac stethoscope.

                                 CROSS
                        Rut, I can’t take that.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Why not? You see that dust on it?  
                        Ten years of dust. I got one.

           Cross hesitates. Rutovsky walks over to him.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        You’re my partner. We aren’t down 
                        at fucking Bellevue. We’re Station 
                        18. Take it.
           Cross takes it, tentative. He puts the earpieces in and taps 
           the bell, smiles.

                                 CROSS
                        A Littman Cardiac! Thanks, Rut.

           Rutovsky doesn’t respond. He turns away, goes back into the 
           kitchen, and takes a travel mug out of the cupboard.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Cross and Rutovsky walk across the parking lot at the 
           station, talking. Rutovsky notices something and motions.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (low)
                        Nan. That’s Nancy.

           Cross looks. NANCY, 30’s, lanky and athletic, chats with 
           Verdis as he digs in his makeshift garden along the side of 
           the building. She sees Rutovsky.

                                 NANCY
                            (calling out)
                        You got it?

           Rutovsky pulls the paper-clipped wad of bills out of his 
           pocket and holds it in the air. She walks over to him.  

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Nice to see you, too.

           He tosses it to her. She counts it.

           Rutovsky looks around and sees a blue station wagon parked up 
           on the sidewalk across the street.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Sylvia?

                                 NANCY
                        I sent her inside. Didn’t want you 
                        seeing her until you paid.

           Rutovsky almost says something, but walks past Cross back 
           into the station. Nancy eyes Cross, suspicious.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        You the new partner?

                                 CROSS
                        Yep. I’m Cross.
                                 NANCY
                        I’m the most recent wife. The 
                        mother of his child.

                                 CROSS
                        How many wives has he had?

                                 NANCY
                        Four.

           She smiles, noting Cross’s surprise.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve been separated six months.  
                        We have a house in Sommerville.  
                        He’s been thinking he’ll come back. 
                        He won’t.

           They look over and see Rutovsky coming back out, smiling, 
           with six-year-old Sylvia sitting on his shoulders.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        He loves his daughter, though.  
                        I’ll give him that.

           Rutovsky and his daughter approach.

                                 SYLVIA
                            (to Cross)
                        You the rookie?

           Everyone laughs.

                                 CROSS
                        I’m the lifesaver.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (to Nancy)
                        I told you. She hears everything.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Cross watches through the windshield as Rutovsky and family 
           stand at the back of the station wagon. Nancy stands close to 
           Rutovsky and puts a hand on his arm.

           Rutovsky opens the back of the station wagon and takes out a 
           kite. He threads a string through the eyelet, ties it off.

           Rutovsky starts to fly the kite right there on the sidewalk.

           He passes the kite to his daughter.
           His daughter holds the kite and guides it further up.

           The kite flies up above the abandoned buildings of 136th 
           Street.

           EXT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

           A rundown brownstone. Black flies buzz against the window 
           next to the front door.

                                 LAFONTAINE (O.C.)
                        Aw, man, I can smell him from here.

           Rutovsky, Cross, and LaFontaine stand on the landing. Marmol, 
           off to the side, talks to an old man who leans out of a 
           second-story window next door.

                                 OLD MAN
                        It’s been like that for a few days 
                        now.

                                 MARMOL
                        Then why’d you wait to call it in?

           The old man shuts the window. Marmol shakes his head.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Who wants to make sure he’s dead?

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        The guy with the least seniority 
                        always does it.

           They all turn to Cross.

                                 CROSS
                        Which one of us is that?

           They all laugh.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care. I want to go. I want 
                        to see it.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Look at this. This little guy comes 
                        creepin’ in those first weeks.  
                        Mister MCAT. Now look at him. He 
                        wants to go in, he wants to see it. 
                        You’re a trip, Cross.
                                 CROSS
                        Thanks, Laf. I feel like my first 
                        priority as medic is to impress 
                        you.

           More laughter. Cross reaches for the door.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Hang on, cowboy.

           Rutovsky pulls out a container of Vicks, wipes some under 
           Cross’s nose, and puts a mask over his face. 

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Make sure he’s dead.

           Cross puts his hand on the knob.

           INT. BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS

           The front doors swing open. Everyone except Cross pulls away 
           and groans, the smell is so awful.

           Cross steps into a long, wood-floored hallway.

           Marmol kicks the front doors closed -

           - and they slam shut behind Cross. It’s suddenly very dim, 
           quiet. A muffled laugh from the guys outside.

           Cross steps down a hallway packed with framed family photos 
           hanging on the wall.  

           He heads toward the yellow light of a dirty window with 
           frayed curtains at the end of the hallway. A used towel lies 
           in the doorway of a bathroom. Cross peeks around a corner. 

           A plate of moldy food and a coffee cup are still resting on 
           the dining room table. Cross glances around, then walks up 
           the long wooden staircase to the second floor. 

           At the top of the steps - it’s quieter. A few black flies 
           swirl around the bedroom door. Cross pushes it open.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bedroom is very dim, brown paper taped over the windows. 
           He steps into the doorway and lets his eyes adjust.

           There’s a mass lying on the bed against the wall, hard to 
           see.
           Cross steps forward to get a better look and freezes.

           Sprawled across the bed - the massive form of a naked, obese 
           man, discolored, bloating, rotting, eyes bulged wide.  

           Cross stares at him, in shock.

           Flies buzz and maggots crawl over the body. A brown fluid 
           leaks out of his mouth. 

           Cross looks away.

           A rotting container of takeout sits on the floor next to the 
           bed.

           Porno mags spread across the floor. Worms squirm across the 
           covers.

           A black and white television in the corner plays a cartoon, 
           the sound turned off.

           Cross looks back to the body. Then turns.

           Hundreds of black flies crawl over the bare white wall behind 
           the bed. We can hear them quietly buzz.

           Cross stares at the flies. The buzzing gets louder.

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Clara sits on the couch, studying. Cross comes in. She looks 
           up and smiles. He shuts the door a bit too hard.

                                 CLARA
                        Another exciting day of saving 
                        lives?

           He sits down heavily on the couch, puts his head in his 
           hands, and rubs his eyes. She reaches over and touches his 
           face. He pulls away, gently.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Ollie, what happened?

           He’s silent.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Whatever you tell me has got to be 
                        more exciting than my A and P 
                        textbook.

           Cross looks at her.
                                 CROSS
                            (sharp)
                        Well, I found the fat, rotting, 
                        naked body of some guy who died 
                        alone in a shitty apartment. It was 
                        fucking great. How was your day?

           Clara is taken aback. 

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        What do you want me to say?

           Clara shakes her head, stands, and walks away. Silence.

           INT. MEDICS’ LOUNGE - DAY

           A medics’ potluck dinner. The long table is covered in 
           casserole dishes and aluminum pans. Medics and EMT’s are all 
           spread around the room, legs stretched out and paper plates 
           of food in their laps. Radios are set on tables, volume low. 

           Cross enters, pulls a chicken wrapped in tinfoil out of his 
           backpack, and sets it on the table. The medics cheer.

           Later. Things are rowdier. LaFontaine tells a story. Everyone 
           laughs. 

           Verdis and Marmol get a call and have to rush out. More 
           laughter.

           Cross sits next to LaFontaine, eating a piece of pie. He 
           glances over. 

           Rutovsky sits on the windowsill, apart from the group. He 
           stares out, silent.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           A shabby apartment building. Kids skip rope on the sidewalk 
           out front.

           Cross and Rutovsky approach and look around. They notice a 
           small trail of blood on the steps.

                                 CROSS
                            (to Rutovsky)
                        I thought they said he’d be 
                        outside.

           A group of nicely dressed older ladies sit on folding chairs 
           in front of the stoop.
                                 OLD LADY 1
                            (calling out)
                        He left. He didn’t want no doctor. 
                        I told them not to call.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (to Cross)
                        Let’s check the lobby.

           Rutovsky and Cross bound up the stairs.

                                 ANOTHER OLD LADY
                        Go get him, Gene!

           The other ladies laugh. Cross and Rutovsky go inside.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           A beautiful marble lobby with nice fixtures. They look 
           around, then to each other. Cross shrugs and raises his radio 
           to cancel the call, but Rutovsky motions to stop. 

           Rutovsky crosses to the stairwell and opens the door.

           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           Cross walks behind Rutovsky up the stairs.

                                 CROSS
                        Hey, how’d she know your name?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        I used to live here.

           At the top of the steps - an emergency exit. Rutovsky pushes 
           it open, no alarm, and steps onto -

           EXT. ROOF - DAY

           The tar-covered roof. Orange light and white noise from the 
           city. Rutovsky walks to the edge. 

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Come here.

           Cross joins him. 

           An amazing view of Harlem. Tar roofs, water towers, clothes 
           lines. The Hudson and the GW Bridge to the west. In the other 
           direction, 141st Street stretches on and on.
                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        This used to be a great 
                        neighborhood. But it went to shit 
                        like everything else.

           Cross looks around. The sun is just going down behind some 
           buildings. 

                                 CROSS
                        I don’t mind it.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You like it as a novelty. You have 
                        no idea, Cross. When I was growing 
                        up - it used to be a nice place.

                                 CROSS
                        Maybe it’ll get better again.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        I won’t be around to see it.

           Cross turns and looks at him. 

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t happenin’ tomorrow. I won’t 
                        be around to see it.

           Rutovsky stares out into the distance. After a moment, he 
           turns to Cross -

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

                                 CROSS
                        I’m always ready.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Right.

           He lifts his radio to get put back into service.

           EXT. POLO GROUNDS PROJECTS - DAY

           Cross hurries a stretcher across a sidewalk. Rutovsky rushes 
           just behind. 

           Near the base of a tower, a crowd has formed. People jostle 
           each other and point toward the roof. 

           Cross leaves the stretcher on the ground and pushes into the 
           group.
           The mangled body of a girl has cracked the pavement, 
           indenting it - one leg is bent backward beneath her body,  
           the head twisted at a crazy angle.

           Rutovsky stands above her and studies the body. He looks up.

           The 30 stories of the tower loom over them.

           Cross stands, confused, holding a curved piece of flesh the 
           size of a hockey puck.

                                 CROSS
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Hard palate. Knocked it out when 
                        she hit.

           Cross winces. Rutovsky crouches and feels her neck and the 
           back of her skull. He lifts her shirt to examine her torso.

           Carved into her belly in scraggly, red letters: “Life Sucks.”

           Cross quietly breathes in, taken aback. Rutovsky, without 
           changing expression, stares at the body. Stands.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                            (checking watch)
                        Six forty-three.

           The crowd groans, angry the medics aren’t doing more. A cop 
           behind them notes the time on a pad.  

           The VICTIM’S MOTHER, 40’s, nearby, starts to wail and scream.

                                 VICTIM’S MOTHER
                        My daughter is dead and they ain’t 
                        doing shit!

           Cross notices her and turns to Rutovsky.

                                 CROSS
                        Maybe we should...

           Rutovsky pulls a white sheet off the nearby stretcher, tosses 
           it to Cross, and walks away.

           Cross turns to the mother and tries to comfort her. 

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        Ma’am, there’s nothing we could’ve 
                        done.

           The mother wails louder. 
           Cross spreads the sheet over the body, carefully tucking in 
           the edges so it won’t blow away. He pushes back through the 
           crowd and tries to catch up with Rutovsky. 

           INT./EXT.  AMBULANCE - DAY

           On the dashboard of the ambulance - a small takeout container 
           of sesame chicken steams the glass.

           Rutovsky gets back in the front seat and shuts the door. He 
           grabs the container, picks up a plastic fork, and starts 
           eating.  

           Cross gets in the passenger seat and shuts the door. He 
           watches Rutovsky eat, then notices something out the driver’s 
           side window.

           The victim’s mother runs toward the ambulance. She comes up 
           to Rutovsky’s side and stares through the window at him, 
           hard. A young girl who’s crying rushes to her side. 

                                 VICTIM’S MOTHER
                        Look at him! He’d rather eat than 
                        save my daughter.

           Rutovsky turns and considers her. He places his food back on 
           the dashboard and starts the engine.  

           He blares the horn once. The woman steps back.

           Rutovsky lets his foot off the brake.

           The ambulance starts to roll backward down the block. The 
           woman steps forward and screams in the window - 

                                 VICTIM’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        My daughter’s dead! He’s eating 
                        sesame fucking chicken!

           Rutovsky carefully maneuvers the wheel, angling them down the 
           block. Cross watches him.

           Near the bottom of the hill, the ambulance turns onto another 
           street and rolls to a stop alongside the curb.

           Rutovsky puts the ambulance into park, grabs the fork and 
           container, and starts eating again. Cross stares at him.

                                 CROSS
                        She just wanted us to work her up - 
                        I mean, so she knew nothing else 
                        could’ve been done.
           Rutovsky lowers his fork and looks at Cross.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Like I was going to try to save 
                        her. I was eating my dinner.

           He starts eating again.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Streetlight comes in through the blinds of a window. Cross 
           and Clara are in bed, kissing. They’re having trouble getting 
           started. Cross hesitates. He’s exhausted and would rather go 
           to bed.

           Clara pulls him on top of her and kisses him harder.

           Cross kisses her and puts his hands in her hair, pulling, not 
           exactly gentle.

           She moans. They look at each other and smile. They’re into 
           it.

           Clara pushes him off and rolls on top of him. She puts him 
           inside of her and they start having sex.

           It’s slow, gentle. Cross has trouble getting into it. Clara 
           leans down, kisses him, then puts her hands on his sternum 
           and presses herself down into him. She digs her nails into 
           his skin, hard.

           This excites Cross. He grasps onto her hips, pulls her down, 
           close, and presses her body into his.

           He flips her over, climbs on top, and puts himself back 
           inside of her. Clara is surprised but presses into him. Cross 
           breathes heavy.

           Cross takes Clara’s arms and pins them above her head. Clara 
           closes her eyes and starts to moan. She’s into it.

           Cross starts to move faster, harder. He pins her arms 
           tighter.

           Clara tries to move her arms. She can’t.

           She opens her eyes.

           Cross puts his hand in her hair and starts to move faster. 
           He’s breathing hard. It a little scary, like an animal.

                                 CLARA
                        Stop.
           Cross starts to pull her hair, hard. He’s moving so fast her 
           head hits the headboard.

           She struggles to get away from him but can’t.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Ollie, stop!

           He stops suddenly. Looks at her. She looks him in the eye.

           He doesn’t say anything. She pushes him away.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

           She rolls off the bed and goes into the bathroom.

           INT./EXT. TAXI - MORNING

           The next morning. Clara and Cross sit in the back of a taxi 
           as it pulls over to the curb. Clara notices something out the 
           window. 

           Rutovsky leans against the wall with his work bag, waiting.

           She frowns. Cross leans over and looks.

           Rutovsky strides over, swinging his arms carelessly. He steps 
           up to Clara’s side window. She rolls it down.

                                 CLARA
                            (quietly)
                        Hello.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You must be Clara.

                                 CLARA
                        I am. And you’re Rutovsky.

           He leans in a little closer and eyes her - nice blue print 
           top, pearls, fancy shoes. He notices the expensive briefcase 
           sitting on her lap. He looks up at Cross.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        They’re holding jobs, Cross. You 
                        might wanna pick it up.

                                 CLARA
                        Nice meeting you.

           He stands back up straight, smiles, and walks away.
                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        That was rude.

                                 CROSS
                        You judged him.

                                 CLARA
                        It was him judging me.

                                 CROSS
                        You judged each other.

                                 CLARA
                        I was being nice. And why are you 
                        defending him?

           He looks at her.

                                 CROSS
                        He’s my partner.

                                 CLARA
                        I’m your girlfriend.

           Cross pauses, then gets out of the cab.

           He shuts the door, leans down to talk to her through the 
           window, but the cab drives away.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Cross and Rutovsky get dressed for work.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        So that was Clara.

                                 CROSS
                        That’s her.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Well, have fun while you can.

           Cross looks at him.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        She’s soft. She’s not one of us.

                                 CROSS
                        We’ll see.
                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You seen LaFontaine’s new girl? 
                        She’s a beast. A cop in the three-
                        two, brought up twice for abusing 
                        prisoners. She’s worse than him, 
                        probably kick my ass.

           Cross smiles.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        That’s the sort of girl for people 
                        like us. Some skel-beating beast. 

                                 CROSS
                        What about Verdis? His wife -

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        We’re not Verdis.

           Cross looks away.

           INT. CHIEF’S OFFICE - DAY

           Chief Burroughs sits at his desk. Cross stands on the other 
           side, holding an envelope and a green bar with gold lining.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        The attendance and punctuality bar.

           Cross stares at it.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS (CONT’D)
                        You haven’t missed a day or been 
                        late for more than six months. That 
                        shows dedication. Professionalism. 

           Chief Burroughs waits.

                                 CROSS
                        Thanks, Chief.

           He puts the bar back into the envelope.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        The next will be a save bar. Keep 
                        up the good work.

                                 CROSS
                        Thanks, Chief. Anything else?

           Chief Burroughs leans back in the chair and tries to act 
           casual.
                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        How’s it out there with Rutovsky?

                                 CROSS
                        He’s a good partner.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        And a great medic. But no one can 
                        do it forever.

           Cross stays silent. Chief Burroughs leans forward.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS (CONT’D)
                        People’s lives are in our hands. If 
                        you have any problems with him, 
                        come to me. You understand why I 
                        say this?

                                 CROSS
                        I do.

           Chief Burroughs stares at Cross for a long moment. Cross 
           looks back and meets his eyes.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Good. I’m glad to hear it.
                            (beat)
                        Alright. Go. Get into service.

           Cross nods and exits.

           He walks down the hallway and tosses the envelope with the 
           green bar into the trash.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Cross and Rutovsky walk across the lot to the ambulance, 
           joking with each other.

                                 MARMOL (O.C.)
                            (strange puppet voice)
                        Hello, medics!

           Cross and Rutovsky slow up.

                                 CROSS
                        Oh man, he finally lost it.

           Sitting on the back of the ambulance is Marmol - he has a 
           sock puppet with yellow hair over one hand.
                                 MARMOL
                            (puppet voice)
                        Verdis called in sick. Can we ride 
                        with you?

           Cross and Rutovsky look at each other and grin.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Through the ambulance window, Cross watches the summer 
           heatwave -

           Shirtless kids play in the spray of an uncapped fire hydrant.

           An old woman sits on her stoop, drinking iced tea. Her 
           grandchildren shoot water guns on the sidewalk.

           A handful of shirtless men hang out in front of a colorful 
           mural. One of them freestyle raps and another serves as his 
           hype man, interjecting lyrics.

           Women get their hair done, reading magazines, chatting.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           An older MAN IN A HAT sits at a large stone chessboard in a 
           park, his face slick with sweat. He presses a fist to his 
           chest. Marmol runs up and thrusts the puppet out.

                                 MARMOL
                            (puppet voice)
                        Hi! I’m Papi the puppet! Are you 
                        having chest pain? Papi’s going to 
                        give you nitro.

           Cross puts a pill in the puppet’s mouth and the puppet drops 
           it on the old man’s tongue. Rutovsky watches nearby.

                                 CROSS
                        I think I’m going to borrow Papi to 
                        talk to my girlfriend.

           Everyone starts laughing. The man in the hat laughs, then 
           coughs. He puts his fist back against his chest.

                                 MAN IN THE HAT
                        Oh, Lord, you guys are killin’ me.

           They all laugh louder.
           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - EARLY EVENING

           The sun’s going down. A group of young men run along the 
           sidewalk, catcalling at something in the street.

           Rutovsky drives. As they approach -

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (in awe)
                        That’s the thing about this job. 
                        You think you’ve seen everything, 
                        then something like this happens.

           Through the window - a naked woman walks down the center of 
           the street, away from them. Cross just stares. He can’t 
           believe it.

           The ambulance pulls alongside the woman, who just keeps 
           walking. Papi the puppet pokes out the window and starts 
           speaking to her.

                                 MARMOL
                            (puppet voice)
                        Are you on drugs? Do you have a 
                        psychiatric history? Have you taken 
                        your medications?

           Cross and Rutovsky crack up in the ambulance.

           The ambulance follows slowly alongside the woman as she walks 
           down the street. Cross gets out and covers her gently with a 
           blanket as she walks.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           Cross sleeps, alone, sprawled across his bed. The phone 
           rings. He doesn’t move. It rings again. He slowly comes to. 
           He’s exhausted and it takes him a moment to reach over and 
           pick up the phone.

                                 CROSS
                        Hello?

                                 RUTOVSKY (O.C.)
                            (on phone)
                        Hey man, what are you doing today?

                                 CROSS
                        Who is this?
           EXT./INT. SUBWAY - DAY

           The A train comes out from underground into sunlight, headed 
           further into Brooklyn.

           Cross and Rutovsky sit across from one another, dressed for 
           the beach, a small cooler at Rutovsky’s feet.

           EXT. ROCKAWAY BEACH - DAY

           An emptyish stretch of Rockaway Beach. Cross and Rutovsky 
           walk over the dunes toward the ocean.

           Later. They’re shirtless and spread out on towels. Cross has 
           his MCAT book open on his lap. He looks at Rutovsky, noticing 
           a thin purple scar that runs from his foot to his knee.

           Rutovsky sees Cross looking and raises his leg.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        During the war. It was a bad break. 
                        They weren’t sure I’d be able to 
                        run again. I did my medic training 
                        in a cast. Crazy.

                                 CROSS
                        I bet you were a good soldier.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You kidding? I sucked.

           Cross smiles. Rutovsky takes something from his shoe and 
           tosses it on Cross’s towel. Cross picks it up. 

           It’s a chain he wears around his neck - his dog tags. Hanging 
           alongside the tags, a Silver Star Medal.

                                 CROSS
                        Jesus. 
                            (beat)
                        How long did you work as a marine 
                        medic?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Two years.

                                 CROSS
                        And then you came back and got a 
                        job with the city?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        I know. Glutton for punishment.
                                 CROSS
                        You regret it?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Nah. I’m a lifer.

           Cross nods.

                                 CROSS
                        I think I might be too.

           Rutovsky looks at him.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You’ll get your experience and get 
                        out.

                                 CROSS
                        If I ever get into medical school. 

           Rutovsky sits up.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You’ll get in. And if you don’t - 
                        don’t stay here. I mean, you can 
                        see what it’s like. Marmol with his 
                        puppet. LaFontaine. Verdis and his 
                        garden. Me. This place...

                                 CROSS
                        I like it.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Well stop liking it, Cross. Liking 
                        is how you get sucked in. Get your 
                        experience. And get out.

           Cross looks at him, waiting. Rutovsky brushes the sand off 
           his hands, stands, and walks away toward the ocean.

           Cross gets up and follows him. He dives into a wave and 
           disappears under the water. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cross unlocks his front door, opens it, and walks in.

           In the middle of the floor lies his MCAT textbook.

           He picks it up and notices a note stuck inside, like a 
           bookmark. He opens it and reads. After a moment, he shakes 
           his head.
           He opens the closet in the bedroom. Half of it is empty. 
           Clara has taken her clothes.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           The ambulance is stuck in heavy traffic, sirens blaring. 
           Honking, shouting.

           Rutovsky driving. Cross shotgun.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        She broke up with you in a letter?

                                 CROSS
                        Yeah, instead of staying here for 
                        the break, she’s going home. Then I 
                        guess she’ll find another place.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Very efficient. I hate to say I 
                        told you so, but...
                            (calling out window)
                        Come on!

           Rutovsky blares the horn, frustrated. After a beat -

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Nancy’s getting remarried. 

           Cross looks at him.

                                 CROSS
                        When?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Already left. Moved to the West 
                        Coast. Took Sylvia with her. I used 
                        to get her every weekend. Now it’ll 
                        be summers. Alternate holidays.

           Rutovsky is as close to crying as he gets. He shakes it off. 

           Traffic finally starts moving, slowly. Rutovsky maneuvers 
           them through.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Probably better if she doesn’t see 
                        me. She’ll have a better life.

                                 CROSS
                        That’s a shitty way to think.
                                 RUTOVSKY
                        This is what happens if you stay in 
                        the job. Dirtbag medic for life. 
                        Fucked up by all the shit we see. 
                        What else was gonna happen?

           He waits for Cross to say otherwise, then looks away.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           The filthy kitchen of a tiny apartment. Cross and Rutovsky 
           stand with their hands raised, trying to calm someone. Behind 
           them, a seventy-year-old woman slumps against the cabinets, 
           having a stroke and flapping around with her one good arm.

           The woman’s SON, 50, tears running down his cheeks, waves a 
           huge curved carving knife at them.

                                 SON
                        That’s my mother. I know you all 
                        don’t give a fuck, but if she dies, 
                        you die.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        She won’t die.

                                 SON
                        That’s right, she won’t.

           The son gestures with the knife.

           Cross kicks away some debris, grabs a pillow, and eases the 
           woman down onto the ground. 

           Rutovsky stares at the son, then kneels and starts breathing 
           for the mother with the bag-valve mask. Cross starts a line.

           The son hovers in the doorway with the knife raised 
           threateningly. He wipes away tears with his wrist.

           The woman stops seizing. Rutovsky starts to intubate, so 
           Cross takes over the bag-valve mask. Once he’s done, Rutovsky 
           stands and steps carefully toward the hall.

                                 SON (CONT’D)
                            (gesturing with knife)
                        Where you going?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        For equipment.

           The son considers him, then steps to the side.
           Rutovsky disappears into the hallway.

                                 SON
                        Don’t take too fucking long!

           The son turns back to Cross, who’s still breathing for her. A 
           long moment.

           The son turns back to the hallway, getting nervous.

                                 SON (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing out there?! 
                        You’re taking too long!

           After a beat, Rutovsky comes back, putting his radio away as 
           he steps in.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (to son)
                        Get her pill bottles.

           The son doesn’t move. Rutovsky turns to him.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        You wanna help your mother, get her 
                        pill bottles!

           The son hesitates, then goes into the bathroom.

           Cross and Rutovsky ease the mother onto the stretcher, strap 
           her in, and lift her.

           They carry the mother out into the hallway. Four housing cops 
           arrive in the doorway just as they pass through.

           The son steps out of the bathroom, his hands filled with 
           medication bottles.

           One of the cops steps up and swings his nightstick.

           WHACK. Medicine bottles go flying everywhere.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A few police cars line the block outside the apartment. Cross 
           treats the mother in the back of the ambulance. Rutovsky sits 
           in the cab with the door open. 

           The cops drag the son out of the building. He’s handcuffed, a 
           puffy purple hematoma ballooning on his forehead. 

           They shove him into the back of a squad car and slam the door 
           shut.
           Rutovsky suddenly jumps out of the ambulance and dashes at 
           the car. He flings open the back door and comes at the son.

           He throws himself on the man and starts to strangle him.

           The cops grab Rutovsky from behind. He’s screaming, arms 
           flailing, desperately trying to get at the son.

           The cops pull him away from the vehicle. Rutovsky shakes 
           loose and SHOVES one of the officers onto the ground, hard.

           Another officer grabs him from behind and YANKS him away. 

           Cross watches from the back of the ambulance, adjusting the 
           drip rate on the mother’s IV.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Later. Cross and Rutovsky sit silently in the ambulance, both 
           staring straight ahead.

                                 CROSS
                            (careful)
                        That fucking skel, pulling a knife 
                        on us. Fuck him.

           Rutovsky doesn’t react.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to kick his ass too. But 
                        shit, Rut...

           Nothing.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        I mean, Jesus. Maybe you should 
                        take the rest of the week off or 
                        something.

           Rutovsky stares forward blankly, like he isn’t going to 
           react.

           But then he slowly turns and looks at Cross, hard.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        What do you know about it? Shut the 
                        fuck up.

           Rutovsky stares at him, a challenge. Cross stares back.
           INT. MEDICS’ LOUNGE - DAY

           Chief Burroughs’s door is closed, but the medics can still 
           hear him yelling at Rutovsky. Cross sits on the windowsill, 
           waiting.

           The door flings open. Rutovsky steps out and grabs one of the 
           lounge chairs, flips it over, and storms out. The chief steps 
           into the doorway and looks at Cross.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Stop staring and pick up that 
                        chair.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Cross steps out of the building just in time to see Rutovsky 
           storm out of the parking lot and away down 136th Street.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Verdis drives. Cross sits in the passenger seat, reading his 
           textbook.

                                 VERDIS
                        How’s Rut doing?

           Cross smiles.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 CROSS
                        You and the chief, man. Always 
                        asking about Rut.

           Verdis looks at him, waiting.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        He’s a great teacher.

                                 VERDIS
                        He’s been quiet lately.

                                 CROSS
                        He’s always quiet.

           Verdis looks away.

                                 VERDIS
                        But it’s different now, don’t you 
                        think? Three days off?
                                 CROSS
                        He missed a few days. Big deal. The 
                        guy’s a fucking rock. He’s fine.

           Verdis shakes his head.

                                 VERDIS
                        I’ve known Rut for fifteen years. I 
                        wouldn’t have gotten through 
                        without him. If someone needs help, 
                        we gotta get together and give it.

           Verdis looks at him.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        You gotta watch out for your 
                        partner, Cross.

           A moment between them. Verdis looks forward again. So does 
           Cross.

                                 CROSS
                        Rut would hate to think we were 
                        talking about him behind his back.

                                 VERDIS
                        You got that right.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           An apartment full of dusty, ancient wooden furniture. Framed 
           pictures of Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and John F. 
           Kennedy line the walls. Verdis kneels before A LARGE WOMAN IN 
           A NIGHTGOWN sitting in a kitchen chair.

                                 LARGE WOMAN IN A NIGHTGOWN
                        Arthritis, bursitis, 
                        conjunctivitis. I got all kind of 
                        aches and pains.

           Cross, Marmol, and LaFontaine lean against a wall and watch. 

                                 LARGE WOMAN IN A NIGHTGOWN (CONT’D)
                        I talked to my neighbor. She’s got 
                        something called diverticulitis. 
                        Maybe I got that too.

                                 MARMOL
                        Why don’t you tell us what you
                        don’t got? I mean, damn, lady, this 
                        is an emergency service.
           Marmol walks out. LaFontaine glances at Cross. Cross smiles. 
           Verdis goes on with his examination.

                                 VERDIS
                        What else? What other complaints?

           LaFontaine leans over to Cross.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        You better get Rut back on the job. 
                        Otherwise, this is what you have to 
                        look forward to. Every patient gets 
                        the whole fucking physical exam. 
                        The Verdis Special.

           Cross watches Verdis giving the exam. Then -

                                 CROSS
                        Enough with the questions, Verdis. 
                        Nothing wrong with her.

           Verdis turns and looks at Cross.

                                 VERDIS
                        I’m doing my physical exam. What 
                        are you doing?

           LaFontaine laughs.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Cross approaches Rutovsky at his open locker. He’s getting 
           ready.

                                 CROSS
                        Hey, Rut.

           Rutovsky turns and looks at him. 

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        How you feeling?

           Rutovsky nods.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Better.

           They stand there, each waiting for the other to say 
           something.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get into service.
           He shuts his locker door.

           INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

           Cross and Rutovsky climb the final stairs into a dimly lit 
           hallway.

           At the other end of the hall a few neighbors congregate. 
           Rutovsky rushes over to them. Cross follows, but freezes at a 
           door.

           Blood slowly spills out from underneath.

           Rutovsky questions a YOUNG NEIGHBOR, 30’s.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        What happened?

                                 YOUNG NEIGHBOR
                        Don’t know. Heard screaming about 
                        ten minutes ago. So we called.

           Cross waves Rutovsky over. Rutovsky notices the blood. Cross 
           checks the door but it’s locked.

                                 CROSS
                        Should we wait?

           Rutovsky tries to kick in the door.

           The wood SPLINTERS around the lock.

           He kicks again.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           The door swings open onto a tiny apartment. Cross and 
           Rutovsky step into a living room and assess the scene.

           The wooden floor is slick with blood. A newborn baby, not 
           moving, is curled on its side next to a bloody placenta. 

           The DRUGGY MOTHER is up on one arm trying to cut the twisted 
           umbilical cord with the jagged end of a broken crack pipe.

           Cross has to look away. Rutovsky shakes his head.

           He steps in and SLAPS the crack pipe out of her hand.

           He kneels, clamps the umbilical cord shut, cuts it, wraps the 
           baby in a blanket, and carries it down a hallway toward the 
           bathroom.
                                 RUTOVSKY
                            (over his shoulder)
                        Treat the fucking mother.

           Cross kneels and checks her pulse.

                                 CROSS
                        How do you feel?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        I’m all fine. Baby’s dead.

                                 CROSS
                        How do you know?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        Wasn’t breathing is how.

           He takes her blood pressure.

                                 CROSS
                        How long wasn’t it breathing?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        Whole time.

                                 CROSS
                        How long was it out before we came 
                        in? In minutes.

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        Ten maybe. I don’t know.

                                 CROSS
                            (calling to Rutovsky)
                        Out ten minutes!

           Cross starts a line. The mother’s arms are sinewy, scarred. 
           She fidgets and her eyes dart around in her head.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        How many weeks were you?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        Thirty-two.

                                 CROSS
                        Are you on drugs?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        What?! No!

           He looks over at the crack pipe.
                                 CROSS
                        When’d you last smoke?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                            (matter of fact)
                        ‘Bout an hour ago.

           Cross can’t find a vein. He switches arms.

                                 CROSS
                        You were smoking while you were in 
                        labor?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        I needed something for the pain.

                                 CROSS
                        Did you do anything else?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        Methadone.

                                 CROSS
                        How’d you get it when you’re 
                        pregnant?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        My friend Jimmy’s in two programs. 
                        He gets it for free.

           Cross looks down and notices blood pooling toward his feet. 

           He twists back and pushes the placenta against the wall with 
           his boot. It leaves a purplish streak on the wood.

                                 CROSS
                        Have you been tested for HIV?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        Yeah. I got it.

           Cross notices blood all over his gloves, boots, and blood 
           pressure cuff. He gets dizzy for a moment but shakes it off.

                                 CROSS
                        Did you take the pills so your baby 
                        wouldn’t get the virus?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        Aw, those don’t work.

           Cross rocks back on his heels, furious.
                                 CROSS
                        You should’ve at least taken the 
                        meds for the baby.

           She looks right at him, seemingly sober for a moment.

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        What’s it matter? Baby’s dead.

           Cross stares at her, stifling his anger.

           Footsteps in the stairwell. Two police officers appear in the 
           doorway. They glance at Cross, scan the room, and rush down 
           the hallway toward the bathroom.

           Cross looks back. He smacks the mother’s arm, trying to find 
           a vein.

           The officers come back. One exits quickly back out the front 
           door while the other stands guard in the doorway.

                                 CROSS
                            (to officer)
                        How’s the baby?

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        The baby’s dead.

                                 CROSS
                        I’m asking him.

                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                        I thought I saw it breathe.

                                 DRUGGY MOTHER
                        I know babies. And that baby’s 
                        dead.

           The mother lies back, eyes darting around.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Cross steps into the doorway of the bathroom down the 
           hallway. Rutovsky stands with his back to him, writing his 
           report.

                                 CROSS
                        Patient is HIV positive and hasn’t 
                        taken her meds. Baby’s probably 
                        positive, but she says it doesn’t 
                        matter because it was stillborn.

           He waits for a response. Silence.
                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        How’s the baby?

           Rutovsky turns.

           Cross can now see the baby resting on the toilet seat, 
           wrapped in a towel, tiny.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Dead. Stillbirth.

           Cross stares at the lump beneath the towel. Is it breathing?

           Cross doesn’t move. Rutovsky looks at him.

           They stare at each other. A moment between them. Finally -

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Treat the mother.

           He shuts the door in Cross’s face. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           A bit later. Cross has managed to get a line. He sets a 
           longboard alongside the patient

           Heavy footsteps in the stairwell again. Two bright-faced 
           LENOX HILL MEDICS burst in, out of breath.

           They rush through the room and out toward the bathroom. 

           Cross starts to ease the mother onto the longboard, but leans 
           away so he can see what’s happening down the hall.

                                 LENOX HILL MEDIC 1 (O.C.)
                        Where’s the baby?

                                 RUTOVSKY (O.C.)
                        Calm down. She’s a crackhead. It 
                        was stillborn.

                                 LENOX HILL MEDIC 1 (O.C.)
                        Where is it?!

           Beat. Then the first medic swoops back through the living 
           room, cradling the baby. He rushes it out the door. From the 
           bathroom -

                                 LENOX HILL MEDIC 2 (O.C.)
                        Always treat a newborn.
                                 RUTOVSKY (O.C.)
                        You read that in your protocol 
                        book?

           The other medic crosses back through the room and leaves. 
           Rutovsky comes back in and watches him leave.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        The fucking calvary.

           Cross looks down and notices Rutovsky’s hand is shaking.

           Rutovsky looks at the mother, who’s still, her eyes shut 
           again. He stares at her.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - EARLY EVENING

           The ambulance drives back to the hospital, lights flashing.

           Cross drives. Rutovsky sits in the passenger seat and stares 
           out the window. Cross can’t look at him. 

           INT./EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Cross and Rutovsky roll the mother into the ER, handing off 
           the stretcher to an awaiting nurse.

           Cross and Rutovsky walk out of the hospital.

           The two cops from earlier and an EMS PATROL LIEUTENANT stand 
           next to the ambulance.

           As Cross and Rutovsky approach, the EMS lieutenant steps 
           forward.

                                 EMS PATROL LIEUTENANT
                        Sorry, Rut. I have to ask for your 
                        badge.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        What the fuck did I do now?

                                 EMS PATROL LIEUTENANT
                        You know the dead baby you covered 
                        with the towel?

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Yeah.

                                 EMS PATROL LIEUTENANT
                        Well, that dead baby is breathing.
           Rutovsky just stares at him. Cross looks down.

           INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

           Cross and Rutovsky ride in the backseat of a police car. 

           The EMS lieutenant drives them back to the station. He pulls 
           over and stops in front of a bodega. 

                                 EMS PATROL LIEUTENANT
                        You two aren’t supposed to talk to 
                        each other.

           He turns around to look at them.

                                 EMS PATROL LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
                        But I gotta get some cigarettes.

           Rutovsky looks at him and gives a subtle nod. The EMS 
           lieutenant gets out and shuts the door.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Don’t tell them anything.

                                 CROSS
                        What can I tell them? I was in the 
                        other room.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Good. Keep saying that.

                                 CROSS
                        I was treating the mother.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        That’s right. You were treating the 
                        mother. I’ll deal with them.

           The patrol lieutenant gets back in and shuts the door. He 
           spins around and offers Rutovsky a cigarette. Rutovsky takes 
           it and the lieutenant lights it. 

           The lieutenant glances at Cross, then turns back around 
           without offering him one.

           INT. STATION 18 - NIGHT

           A small room in Station 18. Cross sits in a chair, facing 
           front. Anatomy posters line the wall behind him.

           Behind a long desk in front of him - CAPTAIN RUSSELL, an 
           intense-looking police captain with thick glasses. 
           Medical control physician DOCTOR TOWERS, a slender man in 
           civilian clothes, sits to his right. Chief Burroughs, in 
           uniform, sits further off to his left. They all stare at 
           Cross.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        Your partner just fucked himself.

                                 DOCTOR TOWERS
                        He’s civil service. He’ll be 
                        reassigned. He won’t even lose his 
                        job.

           The captain turns sharply to the doctor.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        You sound like you want him to lose 
                        his job. Twenty years of service 
                        and he has one fuckup. As if it 
                        doesn’t happen all the time in the 
                        hospital.

                                 DOCTOR TOWERS
                        We have different problems inside.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        Paid three times as much and have 
                        half the responsibility and risk. 
                        That’s the problem.

           Captain Russell slams his notebook down and turns back to 
           Cross.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           Cross looks at them and waits, then -

                                 CROSS
                        I was with the mother. She was my 
                        patient.

           The captain shakes his head and smiles.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        Right. And you never saw the baby.

                                 CROSS
                        I did for a moment. When I came in.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        And?
                                 CROSS
                        I saw the mother cutting the cord 
                        with a crack pipe.

           The doctor and captain both take a note. The chief just sits 
           back, silent, eyeing Cross calmly.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        Did you see the baby breathe?

                                 CROSS
                        No.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        Did you look closely?

                                 CROSS
                        It wasn’t my patient.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        You ask the mother about the baby?

                                 CROSS
                        Yes.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        What did she say?

                                 CROSS
                        That it was dead.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        Did you ask anyone else?

                                 CROSS
                        I asked Rutovsky.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        What’d he say?

                                 CROSS
                        He said it was dead, too.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        When did you ask Rutovsky about the 
                        baby?

                                 CROSS
                        I went to get a trauma dressing. 
                        The bag was in the bathroom.

                                 CAPTAIN RUSSELL
                        Why in there?
           Cross looks at him steadily.

                                 CROSS
                        There was blood on the floor in her 
                        room and she’s HIV positive. We 
                        didn’t want to decon our equipment.

           The doctor and captain scribble notes. Cross glances over at 
           the chief, still sitting there, watching him.

                                 DOCTOR TOWERS
                        When you asked about the baby, did 
                        you not look yourself?

           Cross hesitates.

                                 CROSS
                        Rut’s the senior medic. I’m a 
                        rookie.

                                 DOCTOR TOWERS
                        So you let him do whatever he 
                        wanted?

                                 CROSS
                        I let him treat the most critical 
                        patient. I thought he ought to know 
                        whether a baby is breathing or not.

           The captain frowns. Chief Burroughs finally speaks -

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Did you know I’d talked to Rutovsky 
                        about putting him into an 
                        administrative position, and that 
                        he was very - resistant to the 
                        idea?

                                 CROSS
                        No, sir. He didn’t tell me that.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        At the job today, did you hear 
                        Rutovsky say anything about the 
                        baby’s chances for survival? About 
                        its chances of a decent life?

                                 CROSS
                        There wasn’t much discussion going 
                        on.
                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Did you know that the baby’s almost 
                        certainly brain damaged from the 
                        mother’s drug habits? Or that after 
                        lying in that pool of HIV-infected 
                        blood that baby’s most likely 
                        infected himself?

                                 CROSS
                        I didn’t think of that.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Do you think it’s possible that Mr. 
                        Rutovsky, with his greater 
                        experience - would’ve known these 
                        things?

                                 CROSS
                        Yes.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        And knowing this - isn’t it 
                        possible he thought he might as 
                        well end his career with an act of - 
                        misguided euthanasia?

           The captain looks up from his pages. Cross is silent.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS (CONT’D)
                        I’m only going to ask this one 
                        time. Tell the truth now or your 
                        case goes before the board.

           The chief leans forward.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS (CONT’D)
                        Did Rutovsky intentionally withhold 
                        treatment?

                                 CROSS
                        I don’t know.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        Give us an answer. Yes or no.

           Cross stares at him.

                                 CROSS
                        No. He made a mistake.

           The chief looks at him, then away. 

           The captain turns his notebook over and pushes Cross’s badge 
           across the desk.
           INT. CROSS’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Lonely weekend -

           Cross sits at the edge of the bed, staring into space.

           Cross on the phone. No answer. He hesitates, then -

                                 CROSS
                            (on phone)
                        Hey, it’s Ollie.
                            (beat)
                        I’m good, it’s good. I was just...
                            (beat)
                        Yeah, I was actually wondering if 
                        you might have her new number?
                            (beat)
                        Okay, yeah. I understand. Could you 
                        just - will you tell her I called? 
                        Thanks.

           He hangs up. After a moment, he unplugs it from the wall.

           Cross sits in a chair and listens to a Yankees game, 
           distracted.

           He unlocks his front door.

           EXT. DELI - NIGHT

           It’s cooler out. People dressed in sweaters and hoodies. 
           Cross orders a sandwich at a Harlem deli.

           Cross eats his sandwich at a stand-up counter by the window, 
           studying his textbook. He’s having trouble concentrating.

           EXT./INT. RIVERSIDE PROJECTS - DAY

           The towering Riverside Projects.

           The basement. Longboards are propped against a wall. Bandages 
           and medical tape all lined up, ready.

           Cross, Verdis, Marmol, and LaFontaine wait down the hall. 
           LaFontaine and Marmol smoke.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Tell us the truth, Cross. You were 
                        there. He knew what he was doing, 
                        right?
                                 CROSS
                        No. The baby was dark blue. It 
                        looked stillborn.

           A loud SQUAWK down the hall. Several firemen try to pry open 
           an elevator with a long metal wedge. 

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Bullshit. You might’ve been fooled. 
                        But not Rut. He was doing the right 
                        thing.

           A teenage girl with a laundry basket is on the phone nearby.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                            (on phone)
                        Probably ten people dead inside and 
                        I’m gonna have to walk to the 
                        twenty-fifth floor with all my 
                        clothes.

           LaFontaine turns to Marmol.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Rut didn’t show up for his 
                        administrative job. He hired a 
                        lawyer, gonna try to work the 
                        streets again.

                                 MARMOL
                        I love the guy, but no way they’ll 
                        let him back.

                                 CROSS
                        He made one mistake.

           The firemen jam the wedge in further.

           An older woman down the hall peeks out her door, watching.

           Marmol flicks his cigarette at LaFontaine.

                                 MARMOL
                        Smothering a baby ain’t the right 
                        thing.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Depends on the baby.

           Cross looks at Verdis, who’s shaking his head.

                                 VERDIS
                        Rut was freakin’. But he didn’t try 
                        to kill no baby.
           Another loud SQUAWK. The medics all jump up and turn.

           The doors are pried open. A flash inside - tangled limbs, 
           tossed grocery bags, blood and eggs cover the bodies.

           Cross is the first to the door. He bends over and reaches for 
           a patient’s bloody hand.

           EXT. RUTOVSKY’S PLACE - DAY

           Cross knocks at Rutovsky’s front door.

                                 CROSS
                        Rut! Rut! Hey, come on, open up!

           Cross waits. After a moment, the door unlocks and opens.

           INT. RUTOVSKY’S PLACE - DAY

           The apartment is a mess, clothes everywhere, half-eaten food 
           on the floor.

           Rutovsky sits on bed. Cross sits on a crate in the corner.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        I mean, can you imagine me behind a 
                        desk?

                                 CROSS
                        I can imagine it.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Well, I can’t. I’m a medic. I gotta 
                        get back on the streets. 

                                 CROSS
                        I thought you hated it.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        I do. But I hate everything else 
                        more.

           Cross laughs.

                                 CROSS
                        If you get reinstated, I’ll 
                        transfer to be your partner.

           Rutovsky looks at him, pleased, but waves it off, hiding it.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Who they got you with now?
                                 CROSS
                        Verdis.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Ah, he’s a good medic.

                                 CROSS
                        He’s fucking slow.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Comin’ from you, that’s sayin’ 
                        something.
                            (beat)
                        Do they talk about me?

                                 CROSS
                        All the time.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        I’m sure they say I deserve what 
                        happened.

                                 CROSS
                        They say you were a great medic. 
                        And that they fucked you for one 
                        mistake.

           Rutovsky looks at him.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        They really say that?

           Cross nods. Rutovsky smiles.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        What’d they do to you?

                                 CROSS
                        Chief said I was unobservant.

           Rutovsky leans back and laughs.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Look who’s talking. When the chief 
                        was a street medic, he was worse 
                        than Verdis. Tried to do everything 
                        by the book and freaked out on real 
                        jobs. Now he’s spending his life 
                        trying to figure out why he failed. 

           Rutovsky looks at the floor, suddenly dark.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck the chief. Fuck all of them. 
           Cross watches him closely.

                                 CROSS
                        It was fucked up.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Totally fucked up.

                                 CROSS
                        Anyone could’ve made a mistake like 
                        that.

           Rutovsky looks at him. A long moment between them.

           EXT. RUTOVSKY’S PLACE - DAY

           Cross walks down the stairs and onto the sidewalk in front of 
           Rutovsky’s place. He looks up.

           Rutovsky stands in the window, watching him.

           Cross lifts a hand to say goodbye.

           Rutovsky shuts the curtains.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           The NICU unit. Quiet. Babies in incubators. The beeping of a 
           heart monitor. Cross stands behind a window, looking at one 
           baby in particular. 

           He’s tiny, but pink and healthy now. He has needles and tubes 
           going into his head and the veins on the top of his feet. His 
           arms and legs make small movements.

           Cross looks at him for a long moment. 

           He watches the baby’s tiny belly ballooning with each breath.

           INT. CAFFE REGGIO - DAY

           Cross and Clara sit across from each other in a busy cafe. 
           Clara’s tan. Cross is skinnier, circles under his eyes. He 
           fiddles with a salt shaker, having trouble looking at her.

                                 CLARA
                        You don’t fit in up there, and it’s 
                        mixed you up. You’ve been mistaking 
                        callousness for strength.
                                 CROSS
                        I’m not mistaking anything for 
                        anything. It’s just an attitude. 
                        It’s what happens if you work in an 
                        environment like we do.

                                 CLARA
                        Okay.

                                 CROSS
                        I’m not...
                            (beat)
                        I’m working my ass off. Trying to 
                        be a good medic. And part of that 
                        is having a certain attitude. 
                        People have to listen to you and 
                        obey. You can’t waste time being 
                        polite.

                                 CLARA
                        I’m just saying, that new attitude 
                        has brought out other changes that - 
                        aren’t helpful.

           Cross looks at her. A waitress comes over and takes away a 
           plate. “Anything else?” Clara looks at Cross.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        Ollie.

                                 CROSS
                        What?

           She motions. Cross realizes the waitress just spoke to him.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no. Thank you. I’m good.

           The waitress leaves. An awkward silence. Clara grips her 
           coffee mug with both hands. Cross notices and waits.

                                 CLARA
                        I wanted to apologize - about how I 
                        left. I didn’t like what was 
                        happening, but I shouldn’t have...

           Cross lifts a hand - “stop”. She looks at him.

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        You always wanted to help people. 
                        That’s a good quality. That’s what 
                        I always liked about you. But now - 
                        your good qualities aren’t being 
                        used.
           Cross looks at her, starts to say something, but stops. Then -

                                 CROSS
                        Well, if I lose those good 
                        qualities, maybe others will take 
                        their place.

                                 CLARA
                        Exactly.

           They look at each other.

           EXT. RUTOVSKY’S PLACE - DAY

           Cross is at Rutovsky’s door, waiting. He knocks again.

                                 CROSS
                        Come on, man. Let me in.

           After a moment, through the closed door -

                                 RUTOVSKY (O.C.)
                        Wait on the stoop.

           Cross looks at the door.

           Later. Cross waits on the stoop in front of Rutovsky’s place. 
           Rutovsky comes down the steps unshaven, wearing old jeans and 
           a dirty sweater. He looks like shit. Cross looks at him.

           EXT. DELI - DAY

           Rutovsky buys a pack of cigarettes at a deli. He gets his 
           change, comes out, and joins Cross. They walk down the 
           street.

                                 CROSS
                        I saw the kid the other day in the 
                        NICU.

           Rutovsky looks at him.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        He’s alive. There’s nothing wrong 
                        with him.

           For a moment, Rutovsky’s face lights up, but then he shakes 
           his head and looks away. He starts packing the cigarettes.
                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Just gonna make it worse later on. 
                        He’ll end up an orphan, maybe brain-
                        damaged, definitely HIV-positive. 
                        The state’ll spend a million 
                        dollars on him - and for what kind 
                        of life?

                                 CROSS
                        I don’t know.
                            (beat)
                        I thought I’d go see him again. And 
                        you could come with me.

           Rutovsky stops.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        Why should I care what happens to 
                        that fucking baby? No one else 
                        gives a fuck. The newspapers don’t 
                        report anything above 125th Street. 
                        The city doesn’t spend any money up 
                        here. The place goes to shit, 
                        nobody notices. And they definitely 
                        don’t give a fuck about us or 
                        anyone in EMS. We grind ourselves 
                        down, trying to make it a little 
                        better until we can’t do it anymore 
                        - and then we get kicked out with a 
                        shitty pension that we can’t even 
                        live on.

           Rutovsky looks away.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                            (quieter)
                        That’s the reality. We all know it. 
                        So I see some woman cutting the 
                        cord with a crack pipe, some kid 
                        set up to have miserable fucking 
                        life. I think, what chance does 
                        this kid have?

           Rutovsky turns and looks at him.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        So, I said fuck it. I was in a 
                        position to help him. I chose not 
                        to treat.

           Cross stares at him.
                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        And don’t think I’m claiming to be 
                        some do-gooder. I didn’t do it to 
                        save the kid his miserable fucking 
                        life. I did it cause I was sick of 
                        it. I’d had enough. 

           Cross is still staring, something shifting.

                                 RUTOVSKY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, fuck, Ollie. Don’t look at me 
                        like that. It doesn’t take long to 
                        figure out what the fucking deal 
                        is. No one cares. And we have to 
                        wade through all the miserable 
                        shit. That’s our job.

           Cross shakes his head.

                                 CROSS
                        I mean, yeah, I’m sick of it, too. 
                        But I had no idea what you were 
                        doing with the baby. And I’m glad 
                        he’s okay.

           Rutovsky laughs.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You’re a coward.

           Cross steps forward.

                                 CROSS
                        What are you then?

           Rutovsky steps up to him and gets in his face. They stare at 
           each down.

           Something goes dark in Cross’s eyes, then -

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                            (quietly)
                        Murderer.

           Rutovsky takes this in, his jaw tightening. Finally, he turns 
           and starts to walk away. 

           He stops and suddenly comes back.

                                 RUTOVSKY
                        You came out to try to help me. I 
                        get it.

           He sticks out his hand to shake.
           Cross looks at his outstretched hand. He doesn’t shake it.

           Rutovsky draws his hand back and turns abruptly to leave, 
           unwrapping his cigarettes as he walks away.

           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE - EARLY EVENING

           Cross reads his textbook in the passenger seat of the 
           ambulance. 

           He glances out the window and watches Verdis walk into a 
           deli, then he goes back to reading.

           The passenger door suddenly flies open. A MAN IN A SKI MASK 
           grabs Cross from behind and puts a gun to his head. He drags 
           him out of the ambulance.

           The man flings Cross down onto the ground, hard, then starts 
           to head around to the other side of the vehicle.

           Cross leaps to his feet and comes at the guy.

           The guy swings around and points the gun in his face.

           Cross freezes. He stares at the barrel of the gun.

           The man tightens his grip on the trigger.

                                 MAN IN A SKI MASK
                        Get the fuck back down.

           Cross slowly gets down on the pavement.

           The man hops in the ambulance and speeds away.

           Verdis comes barrelling back outside, pissed. He slams his 
           hand against the ambulance as it drives off.

                                 VERDIS
                        Stupid motherfucker! 
                            (to Cross)
                        Won’t even get two blocks in that 
                        thing.

           Verdis grasps Cross’s hand and helps him up. 

           EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING

           A few blocks down. Several police cars are parked at crazy 
           angles along a street, lights flashing. 
           The stolen ambulance has run up on a curb. The hijacker from 
           earlier is handcuffed in the back, now with bloody bandages 
           wrapped around his face, his nose poking out.

           Marmol stops another ambulance down the block and Verdis 
           jumps out.

                                 VERDIS
                        Where the fuck is he? Just tell me 
                        where he is! 

           He storms away up the street. Cross, Marmol, and LaFontaine 
           get out of the ambulance as well.

           The bandaged man looks up and sees Cross.

           Verdis talks to the cops guarding the ambulance up the 
           street. The cops nod and walk away. 

           Verdis climbs into the back of the ambulance and screams in 
           the perp’s face.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Gotta love it. He’s supposed to be 
                        the good one.

           Verdis is now strangling the perp, whose arms flail wildly.

                                 MARMOL
                        Someone should do something.

           They all look at each other. Cross runs up the block. 

           The cops are in the back of the ambulance. Cross hops in and 
           they all yank Verdis out.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                            (disappointed)
                        Think of what that would’ve done to 
                        Verdis. If he killed someone. I 
                        mean, God, it would’ve been 
                        beautiful.

           Verdis storms away.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           The next day. The ambulance is parked alongside a playground.

           Verdis and Cross sit inside.
                                 VERDIS
                        Sorry you had to see that 
                        yesterday.

                                 CROSS
                        You kidding? I loved it.

           Verdis doesn’t laugh.

                                 VERDIS
                        So I was in a seminary high school, 
                        getting ready to be a priest.

           Cross turns to look at him - “where’s this going?”

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        My mom was religious. She always 
                        dressed me in this little black 
                        suit with a clip-on bow tie. I got 
                        all kinds of shit in the 
                        neighborhood. So then I’m seventeen 
                        and I’m getting ready to go to a 
                        seminary college, but they don’t 
                        give the SATs at the seminary high 
                        school, so I had to go to a regular 
                        school to take them. I met a girl 
                        that day after the tests. That 
                        night there was a Sadie Hawkins 
                        dance. And, oh Lord, she asked me 
                        to go with her, and that was it. I 
                        decided I wasn’t going to be a 
                        priest no more. 

           Cross smiles.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        Within the year, I was drafted. My 
                        mama had always made sure we 
                        enunciated clearly, so they made me 
                        a radio operator. I was just a kid 
                        and suddenly I’m sending these 
                        orders that killed hundreds of 
                        people. I’m not exaggerating. 
                        Hundreds of people died because of 
                        those orders. And I knew it. 
                        Thought the best thing I could do 
                        was to kill my sergeant.

           Cross isn’t smiling anymore.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        If I was brave, that’s what I’d 
                        have done. I loaded my gun. Came up 
                        behind him. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        Raised the gun to his head.
                            (beat)
                        But I couldn’t do it. I put the gun 
                        to my own head, couldn’t do that 
                        either. So I just went on, relaying 
                        the orders. For two years. When I 
                        got back to New York, I started in 
                        on drinking, drugs. Lost a few 
                        years. But my people looked out. 
                        Neighbors. My family. People at 
                        church...

           Verdis turns to look at him.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        I was responsible for hundreds of 
                        deaths. I’ll never make up for 
                        that. Never. But you can sit around 
                        and worry about all the bad things 
                        you’ve done - or you can look 
                        forward to what you can do now. I 
                        love this job. I hope I never have 
                        to do anything else.

           He turns away and looks out the windshield.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        So when someone interferes with us, 
                        tries to keep me from treating...I 
                        freak out.

           Cross stares at him.

           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           Cross runs across a park toward a group of police officers 
           surrounding a body in the grass.

                                 CROSS
                        How’s he doing?!

                                 POLICE OFFICER 
                        He ain’t makin’ it. Half his face 
                        is shot off.

           Cross pushes through the group and kneels. Verdis rushes in 
           just behind, carrying a longboard. Cross quickly checks the 
           body.

                                 CROSS
                        He’s still breathing. Let’s go.
           Cross cuts the clothes off the body and rips off the shirt. 
           He looks down and freezes.

           Rutovsky’s dog tags hang around the victim’s neck.

           Cross and Verdis look at each other, realizing.

           Half of Rutovsky’s face is obscured in the blood soaked 
           grass.

           Verdis slams down the longboard. Cross and Verdis desperately 
           start working on the body.

           Ten feet away - a police officer finds the gun and places it 
           into a plastic bag.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           The ambulance speeds to the hospital, sirens blaring.

           Cross desperately does chest compressions on Rutovsky in the 
           back of the ambulance.

                                 CROSS
                        Come on, Rut! Come on, Rut!

           Blood is getting everywhere. Cross slams his fist against the 
           ceiling. 

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        Fucking drive faster!

           He slams back down on Rutovsky’s chest and keeps doing 
           compressions, crying and screaming.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

           Nurses rush Rutovsky down a hallway. Cross and Verdis run 
           just behind them.

           They push into the trauma room and four doctors immediately 
           surround the patient. A flurry of activity. Cross and Verdis 
           watch from the corner of the room.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT

           Cross sits in a chair in the lobby, staring at the ground. 
           Verdis walks up and hands him a cup of coffee. He sits down 
           and they wait.
           Later. Marmol and a few other medics have joined them. They 
           all sit, waiting. LaFontaine is visible through a glass 
           window, smoking outside. 

           A DOCTOR, 50’s, enters the lobby and notices them.

           Cross and the medics stand. LaFontaine comes back in.

           The doctor approaches and stops in front of them. He 
           hesitates.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I’m very sorry.

           A cry rings out from the crowd. LaFontaine slams his hand 
           against a wall.

           Cross stands very still. Processing. Not ready to accept this 
           yet. 

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           Cross sits, in shock, in a quiet office. Verdis sits next to 
           him.

                                 CROSS
                        That was my area. He knew I was on. 
                        He was making a point.

                                 VERDIS
                        Rutovsky wouldn’t have done that.

                                 CROSS
                        Maybe even a joke.

                                 VERDIS
                        I don’t think he’d joke about that.

           Beat.

                                 CROSS
                        He could joke about anything.

           They sit.

           EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

           Rutovsky’s funeral. An American flag is draped over the 
           coffin. A picture of a younger Rutovsky in his uniform sits 
           on top.

           A pastor speaks at a podium.
           All the medics from Station 18 stand in a huddle, in uniform, 
           many crying. LaFontaine stares at the ground, angry. Verdis 
           stands with his wife and three kids.

           Nancy and Rutovsky’s daughter Sylvia are dressed in black, in 
           tears. Sylvia clasps a stuffed bunny. 

           Cross stands off by himself, not crying. Strangely empty.

           INT. SUBWAY - DAY

           Rush hour at Penn Station. Cross waits at the end of the 
           platform for the train. He looks down the dark hole of the 
           tunnel. A light approaches.

           He looks back down the crowded platform. People jostle each 
           other, irritated.

           A little girl in a red jacket with a hood stands at the edge 
           of the platform and waves her hand to warn a rat near the 
           rails. She’s pulled away by her parent.

           Cross inches toward the edge of the platform.

           The light of the train approaches.

           Cross steps over the wrong side of the yellow danger line.

           The train is so close now he can see the conductor in the 
           window.

           It looks like Cross is stepping off the platform.

           The conductor sounds the horn.

           INT. CHIEF’S OFFICE - DAY

           Cross stands in front of the chief’s desk.

                                 CROSS
                        I got two weeks off. I know that. I 
                        don’t want it. I want to work.

           Chief Burroughs sits at the desk, considering him.

                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS
                        I shouldn’t let you, but you know 
                        the deal. We need medics.

           He holds out a set of keys. Cross reaches out, but the chief 
           pulls them away. He eyes Cross closely.
                                 CHIEF BURROUGHS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be doin’ anything stupid.

                                 CROSS
                        I’m not. Other than coming back to 
                        work.

           Cross grabs the keys.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A large group of bystanders grudgingly step aside to reveal a 
           teenager sprawled on the pavement. Blood seeps from his head 
           and nose. Cross runs up -

                                 YOUNG BYSTANDER 1
                        Ten minutes it took you to get 
                        here!

                                 CROSS
                        We just got out of the hospital. 
                        There aren’t enough ambulances.

                                 YOUNG BYSTANDER 1
                        Don’t be talking to me. Do your 
                        job, motherfucker.

           Cross stops and looks the guy right in the face. 

           He SHOVES the guy to the ground, hard.

           The bystander jumps up and comes at Cross, but Verdis steps 
           between them and pushes them apart.

                                 VERDIS
                        Come on, Cross. Treat the patient.
                            (to bystander)
                        Get back! He’s treating the 
                        patient. Step back!

                                 YOUNG BYSTANDER 1
                        Doesn’t look like he’s doing shit.

           Cross kneels and quickly assesses the victim. He puts a 
           cervical collar around the kid’s neck and an oral airway in 
           his mouth.

           The crowd presses in.

           Cross gives two breaths with the bag-valve mask and notices 
           blood pulsing from a shot just behind the victim’s ear.
           He checks for a pulse and cuts the kid’s shirt off. He finds 
           another gunshot on the kid’s elbow.

           Verdis comes back with the stretcher and tosses a longboard 
           to the ground. 

           Sirens approach in the distance. Murmuring from the crowd. 
           They’re getting angry - “Took them long enough!”, “These guys 
           don’t give a fuck!”, etc.

           Cross and Verdis ease the victim onto the longboard.

           A police car and another ambulance pull up and SCREECH to a 
           stop.

                                 YOUNG BYSTANDER 2
                        Hurry up! Why don’t you hurry?

                                 CROSS
                        We’re doing our job! Trying to save 
                        his fucking life! What’re you 
                        fucking doing?

                                 VERDIS
                        Easy. Forget them.

           LaFontaine and Marmol jump out of the ambulance.

           Cross and Verdis lift the victim onto the stretcher. Cross 
           gives another two breaths.

                                 YOUNG BYSTANDER 3
                        Look how slow he’s going.

           He SHOVES Cross from behind, almost knocking him down.

           Cross spins around, but the kid darts away. Cross starts 
           after him, but LaFontaine barrels into the crowd, waving his 
           radio like a weapon.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Get the fuck back! I’ll kick your 
                        fucking asses!

                                 CROSS
                        That kid pushed me!

           The kid that shoved Cross stops at a distance, gives him the 
           finger, and runs away.

                                 VERDIS
                        Cross! Let it go. Focus.
           Verdis and Cross load the stretcher into the back. Verdis 
           tosses his keys to Marmol, who jumps into the front to drive. 
           Verdis hops in the back.

           Cross starts to step into the back of the ambulance, but 
           someone grabs him from behind.

                                 OLDER BYSTANDER
                        That’s my cousin. I wanna ride 
                        with.

                                 CROSS
                        Go up front.

                                 OLDER BYSTANDER
                        I wanna go in the back with him.

                                 CROSS
                        Not with a critical patient. You 
                        have to ride up front.

           Cross tries to step up, but the guy grabs him again, gripping 
           harder.

                                 OLDER BYSTANDER
                        Please. He’s my -

           Cross pushes his hand away. The guy backs up, hands raised.

           Cross comes at him and shoves him, hard, knocking him back 
           into the crowd.

                                 CROSS
                        Get away! Get the fuck away!

           Everyone freezes, surprised. Even LaFontaine.

           Cross jumps into the ambulance and slams the door shut.

           INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Verdis bangs the roof.

                                 VERDIS
                            (yelling up front)
                        Let’s go!

           The ambulance lurches into gear.

           Out the back window - a police officer grabs the guy’s cousin 
           by the shirtfront and throws him down.
                                 CROSS
                        Fucking asshole tried to grab me!

           Verdis looks at him, steady.

                                 VERDIS
                        The patient. Forget all that. Treat 
                        the patient.

           Cross turns and stares at the patient.

           Then he starts to cut off the rest of his clothes.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           LaFontaine leans against his car in the parking lot, drinking 
           a bottle of bourbon. Cross exits the station, headed home. 

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Hey, Cross! Get over here!

           Cross considers, then walks over. LaFontaine lifts the bottle 
           to him as he nears.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Saw you kick some ass today.

           Cross grabs the bottle, takes a long swig, and wipes his 
           mouth.

                                 CROSS
                        He was bugging me.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                            (laughing)
                        Well, that’s a start.

           Cross takes another swig and passes the bottle back.

           LaFontaine takes a drink and considers Cross for a moment. 

           He glances over and notices a young kid in a baseball cap 
           walking outside the fence.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Get over here!

           The kid in the cap stops walking and freezes.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        Get the fuck over here! I ain’t 
                        gonna do nothin’!
           The kid hesitates, then walks over warily. LaFontaine smiles.

           The kid stops five feet away from them. 

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                            (to kid)
                        See? Told you I wouldn’t do 
                        nothin’.

           He suddenly reaches over and  grabs the kid by the hair. He 
           wrestles him into a lock by the arms. 

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                            (to Cross)
                        Take a shot at him.

                                 KID IN THE CAP
                        Get the fuck off me!

           Cross looks at the kid, who’s struggling to get away.

                                 CROSS
                        He didn’t do anything.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Your partner is fucking dead. 
                        Doesn’t that mean anything to you? 
                        This is the skel tax. It’s what he 
                        gets for being out here. Hit him.

           Cross hesitates. He puts down the bottle and cocks his fist.

           He rears back to punch the kid -

           The kid flinches.

           - but Cross slaps him instead, not hard. 

           The kid looks at him, confused.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                        That’s a start. Coming attractions. 

           LaFontaine heaves the kid up and pushes him away roughly.

                                 LAFONTAINE (CONT’D)
                            (to kid)
                        Stay outta trouble.

           The kid stumbles away quickly, glancing over his shoulder.

           Cross picks up the bottle and takes a long drink. LaFontaine 
           watches him, pleased.
           INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT

           A police officer rudely wakes up a wasted Cross on a subway 
           car at the end of the line.

           EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT

           Cross, wasted, can barely walk down the street. He stumbles 
           up to a group of homeless men camped out on a side street and 
           sits down with them. He leans against a wall and closes his 
           eyes. 

           The group of men stare at him.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           The next day. Cross and LaFontaine load a victim into the 
           back of the ambulance and climb in.

           LaFontaine cuts the clothes off a twenty-year-old man. Heroin 
           baggies line his waistband and fill a holster inside his 
           shirt.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        This motherfucker hit a girl, eight 
                        years old, in the fucking knee. 
                        She’ll never jump rope again. And 
                        we’re treating him. Bullshit.

           He reaches over and turns off one IV. Then the other.

           Cross looks down at the patient. His skin is already turning 
           grey and slick with sweat.

           LaFontaine looks at Cross, a challenge. He pulls out the 
           keys, hops out the back, and slams the door shut behind him.

           EXT./INT. - AMBULANCE - LATER

           The ambulance speeds to the hospital.

           In the back, Cross watches the kid, slowly turning greyer and 
           greyer, lips moving silently. 

           Cross looks up at the IV. It’s still turned off.

           The ambulance pulls into the ER bay. Verdis and Marmol are 
           waiting to help with transport.

           The ambulance slows to a stop. 
           Cross suddenly reaches over and starts one of the IV’s.

           Cross gets the second IV started again just as the doors 
           open. Verdis notices and glances over at Cross.

           Verdis and Marmol pull the stretcher out. LaFontaine comes 
           around and looks into the back, noticing the IV’s are turned 
           back on.

                                 LAFONTAINE
                        Way to go, Cross. Now he can go on 
                        to kill someone else.

           Cross watches Verdis and Marmol through the glass doors as 
           they rush the victim into the ER.

           EXT./INT. CHURCH - MORNING

           A gospel choir sings. The towering spire of a Harlem church.

           Sun pours through an impressive stained-glass mural behind 
           the altar. A gospel choir sings, swinging and clapping in 
           unison.

           The preacher at the podium smiles at his congregation. 
           Everyone in the pews sings along, some with their eyes 
           closed, feeling the spirit.

           Verdis and his wife and kids sit in a row together. They clap 
           and sing. Cross sits beside them.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Later, the congregation files out of the church after the 
           service. The preacher thanks people as they exit.

           Verdis kisses his wife and kids and says goodbye. He takes 
           Cross and they walk down the block.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Cross and Verdis walking.

                                 VERDIS
                        You’ve had crazy trouble this fall. 
                        Don’t be making it worse by jumping 
                        on the ambulance with LaFontaine. 
                        He can be a good medic when he 
                        wants to be. But there’s something 
                        totally fucked up with him.
                                 CROSS
                            (laughing)
                        He’s all right.

           Verdis stops.

                                 VERDIS
                        There’s two kind of medics out 
                        here, Cross. The ones that want to 
                        help people. That’s most of us. And 
                        then there are the few bad medics 
                        who like being around sick people. 
                        Who like the power it gives them. 

           Cross looks away.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s easy to get on the wrong path. 
                        I’ve seen it happen with guys like 
                        you. Look at LaFontaine. What do 
                        you think he was like when he first 
                        came out? But you start working 
                        with the wrong guy. You do a few 
                        things you regret. That can change 
                        who you are.

           Cross looks at him.

                                 CROSS
                        I know who I am.

                                 VERDIS
                        Do you? You’re right on the edge of 
                        something. We all see it. Who do 
                        you really wanna be, Cross?

           Cross stares at him, then looks away.

           EXT. HARLEM RIVER PROJECTS - DAY

           Verdis rushes a stretcher carrying an older woman down a 
           sidewalk. Cross leans against the ambulance. 

           Verdis pushes the stretcher up, expecting Cross to help load, 
           but he doesn’t. Verdis looks down, frustrated. He tosses the 
           keys to Cross.

                                 VERDIS
                        Go on, Cross. I got her. Drive.
           INT./EXT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Cross drives back to the hospital, slowly. His face calm.

           The ambulance pulls into a parking spot at the hospital 
           crookedly. Cross stops, reverses, pulls back out, then pulls 
           back in, perfectly between the two white lines.

           Cross gets out and walks around to the back of the ambulance 
           and opens the doors. 

           It’s messy with blood. Verdis huffs and puffs, desperately 
           doing CPR on the patient.

           Bloody hundred dollar bills are all over the floor.

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Two bloody wheel tracks run all the way down a white tile 
           hallway in the emergency room. At the end - Cross and Verdis 
           hand off the stretcher to the nurses.

           INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Cross waits in the driver’s seat. Verdis approaches the 
           window, wiping sweat from his forehead.

                                 VERDIS
                        Esophageal varices.

                                 CROSS
                            (not looking at him)
                        Dead?

           Verdis nods.

                                 VERDIS
                        You did a good job, Cross. Most 
                        guys drive like maniacs. You can’t 
                        even do CPR. You have a nice slow 
                        steady ride so I could do 
                        everything I wanted. Good work.

           Cross turns and looks at him coldly. Verdis goes around to 
           the back of the ambulance. 

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - LATER

           Verdis stuffs the bloody dollars into a biohazard bag. 
                                 VERDIS
                            (calling up to Cross)
                        She had the money around her neck 
                        in a pouch. When I cut her clothes 
                        off I got the pouch. Must be twenty-
                        five hundred dollars there.

           He shuts the doors and heads back inside.

           Cross gets out, comes around to the back, and opens the 
           doors. 

           Blood is everywhere, on the cabinets, the stretcher. There’s 
           one bloody bill off to the side that Verdis missed. He takes 
           it and shuts the door.

           A bit later. Cross sits in the driver’s seat. He rolls up the 
           window and leans his head back. 

           Cross looks down at the stethoscope around his neck, the one 
           Rutovsky gave him. He puts the earpieces in and holds the 
           bell against his own chest.

           He takes a deep breath. Then lets it out slowly. 

           We hear his breathing. In. Out. 

           Then louder. In. Out. In -

           A sudden knock on his window. Cross takes out the earpieces, 
           but doesn’t turn.

           A 70-year-old man with a parka thrown over his bathrobe 
           stands by driver’s side window, looking in.

           He knocks again, harder. Cross finally rolls down the window. 
           The man has been crying.

                                 CROSS
                        What?

                                 MAN IN A BATHROBE
                        My wife. She’s dead.

                                 CROSS
                        Yeah?

                                 MAN IN A BATHROBE
                        You were the ambulance for her. She 
                        had our rent money. If it doesn’t 
                        go in today, they’ll evict me.
                                 CROSS
                        My partner took the money to the 
                        cops. They hold it for next of kin.

                                 MAN IN A BATHROBE
                        When can I get it?

                                 CROSS
                        I don’t know. A few weeks.

                                 MAN IN A BATHROBE
                        I’ll be evicted if I don’t get it 
                        now. It’s why she died. Gettin’ 
                        that money together. It killed her.

                                 CROSS
                        Talk to the cops.

           He rolls the window up and turns away. After a moment, he 
           looks back. The man is still standing there.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                            (yelling through the 
                             glass)
                        Talk to the cops!

           The man stares at him, then walks inside. 

           Cross looks down at the crumpled hundred dollar bill in his 
           hand. He pockets it.

           He looks through the sliding glass doors of the ER and sees 
           Verdis talking with the guy. Verdis nods. He takes out his 
           wallet and gives the guy money. Cross shakes his head.

           Verdis gives the guy a hug and comes back out. He glances 
           toward the back of the ambulance.

                                 VERDIS
                        You planning to wash out the back?

           Cross doesn’t answer.

           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           The ambulance bay. Verdis washes out the back of the 
           ambulance, while Cross waits in the driver’s seat.

           EXT./INT. AMBULANCE - DAY

           Later. The ambulance is parked along the edge of the Harlem 
           River.
           Cross in the driver seat, Verdis in the passenger seat. They 
           stare out at the river. Verdis takes off his jacket. Cross 
           notices.

                                 CROSS
                        I’m cold.

           He reaches over and turns up the heat. Verdis looks at him.

                                 VERDIS
                        Yeah, no problem.

           The sound of the heater on low. Verdis leans back.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        That guy didn’t even have money for 
                        food.

           Cross doesn’t respond.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        I’d have given him more, but my 
                        wife would kill me.

           Verdis smiles. Cross shakes his head.

           Verdis waits. Sweat starts to come down his cheeks.

           Cross leans back, too. After a moment -

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        You still cold?

                                 CROSS
                        Yeah.

                                 VERDIS
                        Okay.

           Verdis reaches over and turns it up higher. He waits. 

           Cross is sweating now too.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        Are you still cold?

                                 CROSS
                        Yes.

                                 VERDIS
                        You must have a fever or something.

           He cranks the heat up even higher. It’s louder now. Cross 
           just stares straight ahead, sweating.
           Sweat soaks Verdis’s shirt and streams down his face.

           Cross waits, his jaw tight. He reaches over and turns it up 
           as high as it will go. 

           Verdis wipes his face. He smiles and shakes his head.

           It’s really blasting. The sound rattles the whole vehicle. 

           Cross presses back into his seat, waiting. He turns.

           Suddenly, Verdis isn’t smiling anymore. He turns and stares 
           into Cross’s eyes. A deep and penetrating gaze.

           Cross falters, waits.

           Finally -

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                            Think about it, Cross.

           A moment between them. 

           Something shifts and softens in Cross’s eyes. He has to turn 
           away.

           Verdis studies him, then leans back in his seat. 

           No one speaks. Just the sound of the heater blaring.

           Cross reaches over and turns it off. Silence.

           He stares out the window and watches the rocking grey water.

           EXT. HARLEM RIVER PROJECTS - NIGHT

           The man in the robe from earlier sits on his stoop, staring 
           at the ground.

           Cross walks up and stands before him. The old man looks up. 
           Cross uncrumples the bloody bill from earlier and hands it to 
           him.

           Cross walks away, back down the block.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Verdis’s garden on the edge of the parking lot. Verdis, his 
           wife, and their three kids pull weeds during a quiet moment 
           between calls. Verdis’s radio is wedged upright in the dirt.
           Cross sits in the ambulance, his textbook open on his lap. He 
           watches the family.

           Verdis’s wife digs in the dirt with a handheld spade. Verdis 
           leans over to his kids and shows them the difference between 
           what’s dead and what’s alive.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Cross sits in a classroom, with several other students, 
           taking his MCAT. He’s focused and calm.

           EXT./INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           A raging fire in a multi-story apartment complex. 
           Firefighters fight the blaze, hoses spraying water into 
           windows.

           The basement. Dim light and a deafening roar of fire hoses. 
           Water pours down a linoleum staircase into the basement and  
           lights flash, illuminating the street-level windows. 

           Cross and Verdis splash down the steps and disappear down 
           separate hallways.

           Cross turns into a laundry room with flickering lights. 

           A twelve-year-old girl lies in a pool of water. Her skin is 
           pale. Her mouth is open and her eyes stare blankly, a sodden 
           pile of laundry next to her.

                                 CROSS
                            (calling out)
                        Verdis! I found someone!

           No response, just the roar of the hoses. Cross turns back and 
           reaches for her, but stops.

           He notices wires in the corner of the room. They’re touching 
           the wet floor.

           Cross looks around, deciding what to do. He grabs a wet shirt 
           from the pile and drapes it onto her, letting an arm of the 
           shirt touch her. He touches it. No current.

           He reaches down and grabs her.

           Cross pulls her down the hallway, splashing in the inches-
           deep water, until he reaches a dry spot. He lays her down 
           carefully, grabs his flashlight, and sets it pointing up, 
           reflecting light off the ceiling.
           He cuts off her shirt and puts the four monitor leads on her 
           gray skin. The green light of her heart bounces and quivers 
           like crazy.

           He charges the paddles, puts them on her bare chest, waits, 
           and presses the button.

           Her arms and legs flap with the shock. Then her rhythm goes 
           flat.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                            (calling out)
                        Verdis!

           He charges the paddles again, holds them to her chest, and 
           tries again.

           She contracts, arms flapping. On the monitor, her rhythm goes 
           flat again for an even longer time.

           Cross watches it and waits.

           Then the green light bounces up with a heartbeat. Then 
           another. Another.

           Cross checks for a pulse with one hand, grabs the flashlight 
           with the other, and shines it on her face.

           Things seem to slow down for a moment. Her grey face slowly 
           flushes over with life.

           There’s a sudden heaving in her chest, a rattling sound in 
           her throat.

           Cross watches closely as death leaves her.

           Her pupils contract and chest heaves again. She gasps for 
           breath.

           Verdis bounds in, splashing in the water. He bends to the 
           girl and looks at the strip of the monitor.

                                 VERDIS
                        Fuckin’ A, Cross, looks like you 
                        got your save.

           Cross pulls out the tube kit and starts to put the scope into 
           her mouth.
           EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The flames are under control now. A few firemen spray down 
           the still smoldering building. Verdis sits in the ambulance 
           and radios in Cross’s save.

           Cross walks out of the building hauling his bag. LaFontaine 
           rushes up and pats him on the back. Marmol smiles wide.

           Families huddle together on the sidewalk, under blankets, 
           watching the smoke clear.

           EXT./INT. MACOMB’S PROJECTS - DAY

           A four-story dirty brick building in the shape of an open 
           square.

           Benches and scraggly trees are scattered around the 
           courtyard. Some kids play on a jungle gym. An old man 
           crumbles up stale bread for the birds.

           Inside. Cross walks up the steps. He reaches the top floor, 
           knocks on a door, and waits. 

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.C.)
                            (through the door)
                        Who is it?

                                 CROSS
                        My name’s Ollie Cross.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.C.)
                        Who?

                                 CROSS
                        Ollie Cross. I’m a paramedic.

           The door doesn’t open. The sound of footsteps walking away.

           A neighbor down the hall opens her door a crack and eyes him 
           suspiciously.

           The footsteps come back, a bit heavier.

                                 GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                        Who is it?

                                 CROSS
                        I’m a paramedic. I’m from the 
                        hospital.

                                 GRANDMOTHER (O.C.)
                        We didn’t call for an ambulance.
                                 CROSS
                        It’s about the baby. Open up.

           A beat. Then the door opens. A GRANDMOTHER, 50, eyes him 
           through the crack in the door. She wears a white button down 
           shirt, bifocals hung around her neck with a wood beaded cord.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        There a problem with the baby?

                                 CROSS
                        No. I was one of the medics on the 
                        scene when he was born.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        You from Lenox Hill?

                                 CROSS
                        No. I’m from the city.

           Her expression shifts.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        The first ambulance crew?

                                 CROSS
                        Yeah, that’s me.

           She stares at him.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                        Can I come in?

           She hesitates.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           A green refrigerator covered with a child’s colorful 
           pictures. The grandmother sits at a small kitchen table next 
           to an open window with white curtains.

           In the corner - a crib with low wooden rails. The baby lies 
           on his back, much bigger. Eyes shut, arms flexed, hands open. 
           Cross stands over him and watches. The baby is looking right 
           at him.

                                 CROSS
                        What’s his name?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Lenox.

           Cross nods.
                                 CROSS
                        He looks healthy.

                                 GRANDMOTHER.
                        He is healthy. And’ll stay that 
                        way, too, God willing.

           Cross turns and stands there, awkwardly.

           The grandmother stares at him.

           Cross walks over to the table and sits across from her.

                                 CROSS
                        You know the story?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        You left him to die on the bare 
                        floor. ‘Cause he’s black.

                                 CROSS
                        It wasn’t because of that.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Don’t you lie.

                                 CROSS
                        I wouldn’t be here if I wanted to 
                        lie.

                        Maybe you wanted to bust in here 
                        and finish him off.

           Cross hesitates, hard to go on.

                                 CROSS
                        I wanted to come and tell you about 
                        it.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        I know everything ‘bout it already. 
                        You and your partner. And now you 
                        want forgiveness?

           Cross is silent. She looks at him steadily.

                                 GRANDMOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Because I don’t know if I can give 
                        it.
                                 CROSS
                        I wanted to - I just wanted to tell 
                        you what happened, so you didn’t 
                        misunderstand, think it was 
                        something else. I wanted to see if 
                        it would help in some way.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Where’s the other one? I heard 
                        there were two. He didn’t wanna 
                        come and see the bad thing he’d 
                        almost done?

                                 CROSS
                        No. He’s...

           Cross stops and looks down, holding back tears. He breathes 
           in deep, lifts his head, and looks her straight in the eyes.

                                 CROSS (CONT’D)
                            (matter of fact)
                        No. He’s dead. He killed himself.

           The grandmother waits.

           Cross keeps looking at her, tears forming.

           The grandmother gently shakes her head.

           Cross looks down and starts to cry.

           The grandmother looks at him, studying him. After a moment -

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                            (calling out)
                        Myla!

           She eases herself up on the chair, sitting up straight. 

           Her 8-year-old granddaughter comes into the room, waiting on 
           the threshold, shy. The grandmother waves her over. The 
           granddaughter walks over and stands with her.

                                 GRADNMOTHER
                        Myla, I want you to meet this man. 
                        He drives an ambulance.

           Myla stares at Cross. Cross looks up, trying to stop crying.

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Maybe someday he’ll come back here 
                        to help us.

           Myla steps forward and sticks out her hand. 
           Cross looks at her hand for a moment.

           He reaches out and grasps it. They shake. The grandmother 
           watches. 

           Through the open living room window - the Harlem River.

           INT. MEDICS’ LOUNGE - DAY

           Cross walks through the medics’ lounge to the locker room. 
           Suddenly, everyone pours in from the hallway to congratulate 
           him. 

           It’s rowdy. Verdis shakes Cross’s hand, Chief Burroughs slaps 
           him on the back, Marmol presents him with a framed picture of 
           the EKG strip from his save.

                                 VERDIS
                            (to Cross)
                        You may be leaving us next month, 
                        doctor, but at least you’ll be 
                        leaving with a save bar. Took you 
                        long enough. 

           Laughter. Cross smiles, hesitates.

                                 VERDIS (CONT’D)
                        Aw, he’s doubting. Sign him up for 
                        another year of this shit!

                                 MARMOL
                        Fuck medical school!

           Everyone laughs. The celebration continues. Cross looks over. 

           LaFontaine stands off to the side, less enthusiastic. Cross 
           turns away. 

           INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

           Cross walks down the hallway away from the emergency room, 
           stripping off a pair of bloody latex gloves. The stethoscope 
           that Rutovsky gave him hangs around his neck. He throws the 
           gloves away. 

           He slows, then stops, thinking. He turns and looks back down 
           the hallway.
           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

           The girl that Cross saved sits up in a hospital bed, looking 
           at the IV in her arm.

           Cross stands just outside the doorway, watching.

                                 CROSS
                        Feeling better?

           She turns and sees him.

                                 SAVED GIRL
                        I feel fine now. Thanks.

           He nods.

                                 SAVED GIRL (CONT’D)
                        I think they’re letting me go home 
                        later today.

                                 CROSS
                        That’s good.

           They look at each other for a long moment. Cross turns to go.

                                 SAVED GIRL
                        Are you the guy that found me?

           Cross turns back around.

                                 CROSS
                        Yeah.

           She smiles.

                                 SAVED GIRL
                        Thanks. Thanks for saving my life.

           Cross hesitates, smiles, and walks away. She watches him go.

           As he’s leaving, a nurse brushes by him and heads into the 
           room.

           He stops. From outside the door, he watches - she’s touching 
           the IV in her arm, tenderly. The nurse checks the lines. The 
           girl turns away to speak to her. 

           Cross watches for a long moment. The steady beep of a monitor  
           keeps time. Then - it goes quiet.
