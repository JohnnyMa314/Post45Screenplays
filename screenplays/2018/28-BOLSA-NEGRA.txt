           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - THE MORGAN GROUP - DAY

           STEVE SANTOS sits at his tiny desk inside what probably used
           to be the janitor's closet. He squeezes at a foam Nerf ball.

           Steve is thirty-six years old, light-skinned Latino, neatly
           groomed. He wears a suit from Sears and isn't proud of it.

           SUPER: Beverly Hills, California - 1994

           Right outside Steve's office: the glaze and polish of a
           trendy, upscale sports agency.

           An ASSOCIATE appears at Steve's door, knocking gently.

                                 ASSOCIATE
                        Closing time.

           Steve sighs, setting down his Nerf ball.

           INT. HALLWAY - THE MORGAN GROUP - DAY

           Steve stands outside a conference room, watching as:

           Three AGENTS -- all white -- sit opposite a dark-skinned
           Latino ATHLETE.

           Steve observes the courtship. Takes a breath.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THE MORGAN GROUP - DAY

           Steve gently peels the glass door open, moves to the corner.

           The lead agent ANDREW SACKS adjusts his three-piece, a smile
           on his face. Andrew is 40, Ivy-League suit, Ivy-League
           smarm. He acknowledges Steve with a slight nod.

                               (
                                to Athlete

                                          )
                        ...we handle everything. Arbitration,
                        taxes, sponsorships, even nightlife.

           The athlete (FRANCISCO, early 30s) stares, his eyes slit. He
           looks at a mammoth contract which sits center-table.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        I may need some time to... read this.

           Steve, sensing his moment, pulls up a chair, extending his
           hand to Francisco.
                                 STEVE
                        Francisco, hey. Steve Santos. I've
                        been a fan of yours since you played
                        for the Dukes in Triple-A.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        No shit?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes shit. Still remember that walk-
                        off you hit in the conference
                        championship.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Yeah man, that felt good.

                                 ANDREW
                        Steve can help you navigate the
                        contract terms, answer any of your
                        questions...

                        En Español, if you need. Steve's
                        actually Cuban.

           Steve shoots a look to Andrew. Francisco looks to Steve.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        They always call you in here for the
                        Spanish-speaking ones?

           A knuckle-gnawing beat.

           Andrew and the associates rise.

                                 ANDREW
                        We'll, uh-- let you two... to it.

           They exit the room, leaving Steve and Francisco alone.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        What's with that guy?

                                 STEVE
                        Someone comes in here any shade of
                        brown, he thinks they need
                        "translating" or whatever.

           Francisco laughs.

                        If my Nanna calls me on my birthday,
                        I'll speak a little Spanish. But
                        that's my Nanna. And this is America.

                        What I will do is lay out exactly
                        what's in this beast. No bullshit.
                        Sound good?

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Yeah, man. That sounds great.

                                 STEVE
                        Take my word, this place will get you
                        your money. Sign here, and you'll
                        only have to deal with me.

           Francisco leans back, at ease.

           INT. ANDREW'S OFFICE - THE MORGAN GROUP - SHORTLY AFTER

           Steve opens the door to a nicely-sized office and sets
           Francisco's contract in the door-mounted bin.

           Inside, Andrew reclines at his desk, chatting on the phone.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm done closing out meetings.

                               (
                                into phone
                                 ANDREW
                                          )
                        One sec.
                                to Steve
                                        )
                               (
                        What was that?

                                 STEVE
                        You make things awkward for
                        prospects. They know what you're
                        doing, bringing me in. They see right
                        through it. It's embarrassing.

                                 ANDREW
                        Hey, we landed the guy, didn't we?
                        That's a big get! Ya feel me, Pepe?

           Steve stares at Andrew. Andrew stares back, a wide smile on
           his face. After a moment, Steve leaves the office.

                                 ANDREW (cont'd)
                               (
                                into phone
                                          )
                        Sorry about that. Just a colleague--

           Andrew looks up to see--
           Steve STORMING BACK INTO THE OFFICE... a man on a mission...
           he grabs the phone base off Andrew's desk with both hands
           and HEAVES it against the wall. CRASH!

           Andrew sits there, receiver in hand, stunned into silence.

                                 STEVE
                        Consider that my two weeks notice,
                        dickhead.

           A beat of silence. Steve storms out of the office and SLAMS
           the door just as we--

           A convergence of SUITS, FANS and BEAT WRITERS, mostly men.

           We're at America's annual baseball orgy.

           Steve dices through the crowd, now wearing a fitted designer
           suit. He walks with a little "fuck you" in his step.

           He rolls his head around his neck. Psyching himself up.

           Two Years Later

           A familiar face catches Steve's attention. It's Andrew,
           stepping into an elevator.

           Steve sprints toward the elevator. Seeing Steve, Andrew
           mashes at the DOOR CLOSE button.

           Just as the door closes, Steve wedges his hand in between.

                                 ANDREW
                        Steve. Hi.

                                 STEVE
                        You're dodging my calls.

                                 ANDREW
                        Our lawyers are handling that. You
                        poached our client so--
                                 STEVE
                        --Francisco chose to go with me. And
                        last I heard, the court agreed.

                                 ANDREW
                        Yeah? And how are those legal fees
                        treating you?

                                 STEVE
                        Fuck you.

           The doors start to close again, but Steve forces them open.

                                 ANDREW
                        Who are you even here for anyway?
                               (
                                then, smiling
                                             )
                        Did you come all the way to Boston
                        for a backup?

           Steve doesn't say anything. Andrew taps Steve's suit.

                                 ANDREW (cont'd)
                        Nice rental.

                                 STEVE
                        I bought this.

                                 ANDREW
                        Sure.

           The elevator closes, and as the doors shut...

                                 ANDREW (cont'd)
                        Enjoy your TV dinners.

           INT. ST. LOUIS CARDINALS SUITE - RITZ CARLTON - DAY

           Steve sits at a long table, on which rests the fakest,
           silkiest set of flowers in a jar.

           Across from him: Assistant GM WALLY DOYLE, forties.

                                 DOYLE
                        You're with The Morgan Group, right?

                                 STEVE
                        On my own now, actually.

                                 DOYLE
                        Well. Good for you.
           A rental tag creeps out from Steve's sport coat sleeve. He
           surreptitiously slides it under the cuff.

                                 DOYLE (cont'd)
                        So: Manny Peña. We'd like to offer
                        four hundred over two years.

           Steve recoils just a bit. Doyle, sensing the reaction:

                                 DOYLE (cont'd)
                        It's standard.

                                 STEVE
                        "Standard." You cram me into this
                        time-slot, your GM and research folks
                        aren't even here. It's insulting.

                                 DOYLE
                        Look. We love Manny. But let's be
                        honest: the guy is a bench-warmer.

           Steve starts to say something but stops himself. Then:

                                 STEVE
                        You like your playoff chances?

                                 DOYLE
                        We'd like to think so. Your point?

                                 STEVE
                        So what if Manny rides the bench? You
                        need him for that crucial pinch-hit
                        in game seven. Someone who doesn't
                        get rattled. A journeyman. Instead,
                        you prefer to low-ball the insurance
                        player. And then whose ass is it
                        gonna be when a late-season injury
                        dashes your playoff chances? Yours,
                        Wally. You're the fall guy.

           Steve stands. Steps to the door. Hand on the knob...

                                 DOYLE
                        Steve.

           Steve turns.

                                 DOYLE (cont'd)
                        Take the four hundred or we cut him.
           EXT. MEN'S WEARHOUSE - DAY

           Steve walks out of the store and into the parking lot,
           wearing an undershirt, a brick of a cell phone to his ear.

                                 STEVE
                        See if you can get me onto an earlier
                        flight home... assuming the change
                        fees aren't too high.

           INT. STEVE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Lying in a bed with no bed frame, Steve snaps awake as his
           alarm hits 7:00 am. His eyes open to the spinning pull-chain
           of a wobbly ceiling fan, which could fall any second.

           -- Runs a comb through his hair, carefully applies mousse

           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY

           A cramped office. Sloppily spaced-out photos of players
           adorn the walls. A worn couch is next to a liquor cabinet.

           Steve paces back and forth, squeezing a Nerf ball.

           At a nearby desk, BRANDY (28) looks at once both harried and
           in total control, punching at a calculator and filing bills.

                                 STEVE
                        Seriously? Not one call?

                        Do telemarketers count? Apparently
                        you won a free cruise to the Bahamas.
                        Also, your mother called.

           RING-RING! Steve stops pacing, expectant--

                        No, I'm his assistant. I don't have
                        him now. Okay... right. ...Yes, we
                        are aware. Yes. Thank you.

           Brandy hangs up. Looks to Steve.

                        Can they take your house?

                                 STEVE
                        C'mon, no.

                        We'll figure something out. Relax.

           Steve looks at his watch.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        I gotta go scout some kid. Can you
                        look at flights for the Miami
                        Classic? I should really see
                        Francisco play.

                                 BRANDY
                        The Miami Classic's tomorrow. And
                        isn't he a reserve?

                                 STEVE
                        Vaughn got injured, so Frisco's
                        taking his place. As a starter.

                                 BRANDY
                        You want to max out the credit card
                        for a game you could watch on TV?

                                 STEVE
                        What? The guy pays our bills. I'll
                        surprise him... he'll love it.
                                 BRANDY
                        Help me understand why you want to
                        splurge money just to show your face
                        at a game.

                                 STEVE
                        No agent would miss seeing their
                        client play for Team USA. It's a huge
                        honor for him. Besides, the game's
                        against Cuba. Those are my people.

                                 BRANDY
                        Yeah. "Your people." You only mention
                        your heritage when it's convenient.

                                 STEVE

                        That's insulting. My parents fled
                        communism.

                        You never called your mom back.

           Steve chucks the Nerf ball at Brandy. She one-hands it.

           RING-RING. Brandy picks up the phone.

                                 BRANDY (cont'd)
                        Hello, S-S-I...

           Brandy turns to Steve, mouthing "Francisco." Steve
           immediately takes the phone from her.

                                 STEVE
                        Frisco! Aren't you flying out today?

           INT. LAX AIRPORT - ARRIVALS TERMINAL - DAY

           Francisco speaks into a payphone.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Not without my wallet.

           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Steve swears silently.

                                 STEVE
                        Terminal seven? Hang tight.

           Steve hangs up, picks up his keys, darts for the stairs.
                                 BRANDY
                        Sure you don't want me to--

                                 STEVE
                        I've got this one!

           We follow Steve as he steps up the stairs, into--

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           ...and through the front door of--

           EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He bolts to his car parked in the driveway, a seen-better-
           days 1982 Toyota Camry.

           INT. STEVE'S CAR - 405 FREEWAY - SHORTLY AFTER

           VROOOM! Steve maneuvers through sluggish traffic.

                                 STEVE
                        Come on, come on...!

           Steve looks at the clock, his mind now insane.

           EXT. WEST LA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Steve's Camry peels into the driveway of a nicely-sized
           house in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood. He jumps out.

           EXT. FRANCISCO'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Steve looks underneath the welcome mat. Nothing. He tries
           the front door. Locked.

           There's a window next to the door. Steve makes his decision:
           he locks his elbow and WHAP -- slams it into the window.

           Nothing happens. Steve looks around the quiet neighborhood.

           Steve reloads his elbow and SMASH -- the glass shatters.

           INT. FRANCISCO'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Steve unlocks the door, dashes inside. A house alarm BLARES.
                                 STEVE
                        Shit.

           Steve makes his way to the kitchen, where he nabs
           Francisco's wallet from the kitchen island, then--

           --dashes back to the foyer where the alarm keypad blinks. He
           types in a few digits to try and disarm it.

           EXT. FRANCISCO'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           The alarm still blaring, Steve steps out to the driveway as
           an LAPD Patrol Car pulls to the curb. Two white COPS pour
           out.

                                 COP #1
                        Hands where we can see em!

           Steve puts his hands up.

                               (
                                into radio

                        Suspect is Hispanic, male--

                                 STEVE
                        I know the homeowner--

                                 COP #2
                        Shut the fuck up. Hands on the car.

           Steve puts his hands on his Camry. Cop #2 frisks him. Stops
           at Steve's elbow, which is bleeding from broken glass.

                                 STEVE
                        Let me just explain--

           Cop #1 pulls two wallets from Steve's pocket, inspects them.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        I'm a sports agent. You know
                        Francisco Diaz? He lives here.

           The cops look at each other: of course they've heard of him.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        He's at LAX. He left his wallet. He
                        plays for Team USA in the Miami
                        Classic tomorrow.

                                 COP #1
                               (
                                         )
                                to Cop #2
                        License is Francisco's.
                                 STEVE
                        Are you Dodgers fans by any chance?

           They nod.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Ever sit behind home plate?

           EXT. LAX AIRPORT - ARRIVALS DECK - SOON AFTER

           Huffing and puffing, Steve FLIES up the escalator, wedging
           his way past stationary TRAVELERS, into--

           INT. TERMINAL 7 - CHECK IN AREA - CONTINUOUS

           --where he turns, heaped in sweat, to find Francisco
           standing there with his WIFE and two YOUNG SONS.

           Seeing Steve, Francisco's family jubilantly runs towards
           him. Steve hugs Frisco's kids, kisses his wife on the cheek.

                                 FRANCISCO'S WIFE
                        Steve, you're a lifesaver.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        You couldn't send your assistant?

                                 STEVE
                        I was in the area.

           Steve reaches into his blazer, hands Francisco his wallet.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Good luck tomorrow, buddy.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Thanks bro. We gotta run.

           Steve waves as Francisco and family power-walk away.

           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DUSK

           Steve sits on the couch, squeezing his Nerf ball, as Brandy
           uses a Q-tip to treat Steve's elbow with rubbing alcohol.

                                 STEVE
                        ...any window repair company in the
                        Yellow Pages will do. Ouch!

           Steve jerks his arm away, wincing in pain.
                                 BRANDY
                        C'mon. Almost done. And you still
                        gotta pack.

                                 STEVE
                        I know my flight's super early, but--

                                 BRANDY
                        --yes, I'll give you a ride.

                        You rock. I'll reimburse you for gas.

           RING-RING! Brandy throws on her headset. Steve jumps up.

                                 BRANDY
                        S-S-I.

                        It's Jackie.

           Steve smiles, nods to Brandy, and fits on his headset.

                                 STEVE
                        Jackie! What's new in Dodger-land?

           INT. DODGERS OFFICES - DUSK

           JACKIE STONE sits at her desk in a compact office
           overlooking Dodger Stadium. She's 35, formally-dressed and
           jaded, with a certain Midwestern wholesomeness.

                                 JACKIE
                        Nelson Rojas.

           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Steve looks amused.

                                 STEVE
                        No hello? Just throwing a name at me?

           INTERCUT STEVE AND JACKIE AS NEEDED:

                                 JACKIE
                        What do you think of him?

                                 STEVE
                        Not much. Only that he was a great
                        client who defected to TMG and I hope
                        he's a huge goddamn failure. Why?
                                 JACKIE
                        My bosses are trying to sign him.

                                 STEVE
                        Of course they are. So you're looking
                        for dirt.

                                 JACKIE
                        It's a boys' club over here. I'm
                        practically invisible to them.

           Outside Jackie's office: laughing MEN IN SUITS stroll by.

                                 JACKIE (cont'd)
                        Unless, maybe, I prevent them from
                        signing a bust. So help me break the
                        glass ceiling: what's wrong with
                        Nelson Rojas?

                                 STEVE
                        You think I'm just gonna volunteer
                        precious intel on a silver platter?

                                 JACKIE
                        Yes I do. At dinner, tomorrow night.

                        Brandy, you can hop off.

           Brandy smirks, replaces her headset with Walkman headphones.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Can't do tomorrow. But we should get
                        together soon.

           A beat.

                                 JACKIE
                        Are we dating?

                        Well, we go on dates.

                        When do we go on dates?

                                 STEVE
                        I took you to see Primal Fear.

                                 JACKIE
                        That was like three weeks ago. And a
                        terrible choice for a date movie.
                                 STEVE
                        Okay. Dinner on Friday. Can you
                        expense it?

           Jackie smiles: typical Steve.

                                 JACKIE
                        Fine. We'll talk business.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Before you go: Rojas. It can't wait
                        till Friday.

           A beat.

                                 STEVE
                        He's had knee pain since Triple-A.
                        Think he might need surgery.

                                 JACKIE
                        Surgery... no shit.

                                 STEVE
                        Yes shit. See you Friday.

                                 JACKIE
                        Don't blow me off this time.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm not that big of an asshole.

           EXT. CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS - DAWN

           Steve parks his Camry in a ritzy area off Wilshire Blvd. He
           looks out the window at a FOR LEASE sign on a high-rise that
           sits adjacent to The Morgan Group's building.

           EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           Brandy idles inside her car on the curb. Looks at her watch.
           After a few moments, Steve's car turns into the driveway. He
           hops out with a suitcase, dashing to her car.

           INT. BRANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Steve collapses into the passenger's seat with his luggage.

                                 BRANDY
                        Cutting it close. Where were you?
                                 STEVE
                        Looking at some places for when we
                        expand.

           She stares at him.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        What? We're in Alhambra. I can't
                        bring prospects here. I gotta meet em
                        in a cafe like a goddamn peasant.

                                 BRANDY
                        If we keep spending out of pocket the
                        agency's not gonna grow.

                                 STEVE
                        Gotta fake it till you make it.

           A beat.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        I, uh, post-dated your paycheck for
                        Saturday, after the money from
                        Frisco's card deal comes in.

           Brandy puts the car into gear. Reverses out of the driveway.

                                 BRANDY
                        Maybe you should post-date it a
                        little more.

           EXT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Steve's plane touches down on the runway.

           INT. JOE ROBBIE STADIUM - DAY

           The crowd is heavy, with the game already in progress. Steve
           sips a beer in a field-view seat by Team USA's dugout, next
           to an OLD-TIMER SCOUT (60s).

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        Which one's yours?

           Steve points to center-field.

                                 OLD-TIMER (cont'd)
                        Francisco? Great arm.

                                 STEVE
                        Even better wheels.
                                 P.A. ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Now batting: Hector Gonzalez.

           Some fans in the stadium ROAR as HECTOR GONZALEZ struts to
           the plate. Hector is a mountain of a man: tall, hulking,
           tanned Cuban features, twenty-five years old.

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        Keep an eye on this guy.

                                 STEVE
                        A Cuban?

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        They call him El Coco. "The
                        Boogeyman." Plays for the
                        Industriales.

                                 STEVE
                        Ah, the Yankees of Cuba.

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        See that? He holds the bat like a
                        toothpick. Zonked about a hundred
                        dingers over the fence in practice.
                        Raw power to all fields. Quick hands.
                        He's a mix of Frank Thomas and Albert
                        Belle, minus the attitude.

                                 STEVE
                        Too bad he's the property of a
                        Communist country that hates America.

           SMACK! Hector sends the ball over the wall... and out of the
           stadium. He rounds the bases.

           Steve looks to the scout, who returns an "I toldya so" look.

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        Too bad indeed.

           Hector steps on home plate and gets mobbed by his teammates.
           Steve watches, wheels turning in his head.

                                 STEVE
                        Wait... René Arocha. The guy on the
                        Cardinals. Isn't he Cuban?

                                 OLD-TIMER
                        That's right. Played in a game just
                        like this. Then... missed his flight.   

           Steve focuses on the Jumbotron as it replays the home run.
           INT. TEAM USA LOCKER ROOM - JOE ROBBIE STADIUM - DAY

           Steve jukes by half-naked BALLPLAYERS before finding
           Francisco packing his bag at his locker.

                                 STEVE
                        What's up, Frisco?

           Francisco turns, puzzled to see Steve.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Steve? What are you doing out here?

           They clasp hands, pull in for a hug.

                                 STEVE
                        Thought I'd surprise you. This a bad
                        time?

                                 FRANCISCO
                        No. I mean, I've got some news, but I
                        wanted to wait till I was back--

                                 STEVE
                        --I'm right here. What's up?

           A beat.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        It's kinda hard to... can we maybe--

                                 STEVE
                        Come on. You can tell me anything.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        You're right. Sorry for being weird.
                               (
                                takes a breath
                                              )
                        I'm going back to The Morgan Group.

           Steve pulls back. Shock.

                                 STEVE
                        What?

                                 FRANCISCO
                        You've been really great, but I just
                        feel like those guys over there can
                        do better for me and my family.

           Steve tries to keep it together.

                                 STEVE
                        It's a contract year...
                                 FRANCISCO
                        I just don't think you could land me
                        a max deal.

                                 STEVE
                        I see. You think I'm small time.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        TMG is used to top dollar clients.
                        They don't get strong-armed.

                                 STEVE
                        You think I'd settle for any amount.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        I'm not saying that. It's just--
                        what's the largest contract you've
                        personally negotiated? Half a mil?

                                 ANDREW (O.S.)
                        You don't need to justify yourself.

           Steve turns to find Andrew Sacks chewing on a stadium hot
           dog. Andrew places a hand on Francisco's back.

                                 ANDREW
                        I’m taking three percent. It was an
                        easy call.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Plus, I actually have a law degree.

           Steve launches himself at Andrew, who fumbles his hot dog.
           The two tussle as Francisco gets in between them. The other
           PLAYERS in the locker room stare.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Goddammit guys, grow up!

           Andrew and Steve separate, finally cooling down.

                                 FRANCISCO (cont'd)
                               (
                                to Andrew
                                         )
                        Can you just... give us a minute?

           Andrew nods to Steve, smirking his way out of the room.

           Steve just stands there, suit disheveled. No words. Until it
           finally dawns on him....

                                 STEVE
                        I'm gonna lose my business.

           Steve wilts onto a bench. Crushed.
                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        All because I got sued... over you,
                        my now ex-client. I'm... finished.

           Francisco pats Steve on the shoulder.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Think of it as a fresh start. You
                        won't have me weighing you down.

           Francisco retrieves a small box from his locker.

                                 FRANCISCO (cont'd)
                        Here, I want you to have something.

           Francisco opens the box. Inside: a GOLD WATCH displays Cuban
           and American flags. Francisco wraps it around Steve's wrist.

                                 FRANCISCO (cont'd)
                        Twenty-four karat. Individually
                        numbered. Everyone on each team got
                        one: it's a collector's item.

                                 STEVE
                        I don't want a watch. I want you to
                        take a second to think about this.

           Francisco shakes his head. The decision's been made. He
           extends his hand... Steve takes it, reluctant.

                                 FRANCISCO
                        Love you dude. We had a good ride.
                        Anyway, I gotta head to the bus...

                               (
                                 STEVE
                                distracted
                                          )
                        The bus.
                                then
                                    )
                               (
                        The bus. Shit.

           Steve jumps up and dashes for the locker room exit.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS

           Steve bursts out of the locker room, sprints down the
           concourse and out of the stadium to--

           EXT. JOE ROBBIE STADIUM - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           --where he spots a trail of idling Coach buses.
           Several CUBAN PLAYERS carrying duffel bags board the buses.

           Steve side-steps through barricades. He sees Hector, who is
           feet away from the steps of the bus.

           A STADIUM SECURITY OFFICER steps in front of Steve.  

                                 STADIUM SECURITY OFFICER
                        Sir, you can't be here.

                                 STEVE
                        Hector! Hector!

           The officer places a hand on Steve's chest.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Listen, he knows me, okay?

           Steve powers past the officer, charging straight for Hector.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Hector!

           Hector turns to see Steve bee-lining towards him.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Hector! You played a helluva game.

           Steve holds out a baseball and a Sharpie. The security
           officer catches up and puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.

                                 STADIUM SECURITY OFFICER
                        Sir! No unauthorized personnel past--

                               (
                                 HECTOR
                                heavily accented
                                                )
                        He is okay.

           The security guy looks at Hector, then nods and steps away.

           Hector takes the ball and Sharpie. He's about to sign it,
           when he sees something written on the ball:

           Don't get on the bus

           Tucked under the ball, Steve's business card:

           Steve Santos - Certified Agent, Major League Baseball

                                 STEVE
                        I'm a very big fan. You understand?

           Hector processes all of this. Nods. Looks back to Steve.
                               (
                                in Spanish
                                 HECTOR
                                          )
                        I have a family.

           Hector signs the ball and hands it back to him, but he
           pockets Steve's business card.

           INT. TEAM CUBA COACH BUS - CONTINUOUS

           A TEAM TRAINER (40s) wearing flip-up sunglasses and a red
           sweatsuit, sits near the front, watching this interaction.

           As Steve and Hector shake hands, the Trainer notes the gold
           Cuban-American watch on Steve's wrist... identical to the
           watch ticking away on his own wrist.

                                 STEVE (PRE-LAP)
                        It's practically a fucking
                        invitation.

           EXT. MIAMI - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY

           Cooking in the sticky Florida humidity, Steve walks along a
           sidewalk, his cell phone to his ear.

                                 STEVE
                        Delay any meetings, push back any
                        calls. If anyone asks, I'm on a
                        scouting trip. Which isn't untrue.

           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Brandy sits at her desk, eyes incredulous.

                                 BRANDY
                        Right. You're just going to a
                        Communist country and stealing a
                        baseball player.

           INTERCUT BRANDY AND STEVE AS NEEDED:

                                 STEVE
                        Not stealing. Helping him defect.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I guess it does sound kind of insane.

                                 BRANDY
                        It is insane. All he said was that he
                        has a family. That's an invitation?
                                 STEVE
                        Meaning they gotta come too. Fine!
                        Let's get the whole Gonzalez clan on
                        a boat then! You said it yourself:
                        this agency needs to grow.

                                 BRANDY
                        Glad you listened to me for once.
                        This Hector guy must be something.

                                 STEVE
                        He's not something. He's the thing.

                                 BRANDY
                        So what happens after you kidnap him?

                                 STEVE
                        I'll get him to a nearby country,
                        anyone but this one, in order for him
                        to be considered a free agent. I'm
                        telling you, this guy is a goldmine.

                                 BRANDY
                        Do you even speak Spanish?

                                 STEVE
                        I was around it when I was younger.
                        I’ll get it back. How much do we have
                        in the emergency fund?

                                 BRANDY
                        Twenty-one thousand terrified
                        dollars... earmarked for legal debts.

                                 STEVE
                        Hector can get us all that and more.
                        Flush it out. Wire it. Overnight my
                        passport. And book a one-way flight.

                                 BRANDY
                        Flights.

                                 STEVE
                        What?

                                 BRANDY
                        You can't fly directly to Cuba.
                        There's an embargo.

                                 STEVE
                        I don't care if I have to go through
                        Bosnia. Get me to Havana.
           INT. GATE 54 - TORONTO PEARSON INTL. AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Lugging a suitcase, Steve crosses the airport lounge near a
           sign that reads: Havana Departures.

           INT. RESTROOM - TORONTO PEARSON INTL. AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Inside a stall, Steve removes a brown paper bag from a pouch
           in his suitcase. Shakes out a HUGE PILE OF CASH.

           He digs out a house key from his pocket, saws into the
           suitcase lining. With his fingers, he claws the hole wider.

           He pulls back his hand a moment. It's shaking. CLASP. He
           grabs the hand, firm. Sucks in a sharp breath.

           ANGLE ON: Steve's face -- what the fuck am I doing?

           Composing himself, Steve loads the cash into the lining.

           INT. TURBOPROP PLANE - DAY

           Steve is jolted awake as the plane hits the runway. Outside
           his window, a tiny runway surrounded by dirt fields.

           He sucks in a breath: Cuba.

           INT. JOSÉ MARTÍ AIRPORT - ARRIVALS - DAY

           Steve waits on a slow-moving line of CUBANS and TOURISTS.
           The room is nearly silent. No AC here. A half-broken TV
           hangs on a column, showing a low-fi Cuban soap opera.

           A buzzer goes off. The line inches forward.

           INT. ARRIVALS / PASSPORT CONTROL - JOSÉ MARTÍ AIRPORT - DAY

           Steve steps up to a small booth occupied by an unsmiling
           CUSTOMS AGENT (female, Cuban). He hands her his passport.

           She glances at it. Suspicious.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        American.

                                 STEVE
                        You got me.

           Steve smiles big as she scrutinizes the passport.
                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Purpose of visit?

                                 STEVE
                        ...Business.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        What is your business?

                                 STEVE
                        Agent.
                                then
                                    )
                               (
                        Travel agent.

           A long beat.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Where are you from?

                                 STEVE
                        Los Angeles. USA.

           She studies his face, the complexion of his skin.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Before that.

                                 STEVE
                        ...Nowhere. Just California.

           The Customs Agent eyes Steve, ever more distrustful. She
           looks at Steve for what feels like an eternity...

           ...and THUD. Stamps the passport.

           INT. CURRENCY EXCHANGE - JOSÉ MARTÍ AIRPORT - DAY

           Steve watches as a TELLER finishes counting his stack of
           cash, before substituting a stack of PESOS on the counter.

           Steve scoops up the pesos, quickly counts.

           He looks up to the teller, a glint of suspicion. Looking
           back at Steve, the teller's expression doesn't change.

           Steve nods to the teller, opting to walk away.

           The teller watches him go, then reaches into his sleeve cuff
           where -- like magic -- he slips out a fifty dollar bill.

           Seeing Steve exit the terminal, he picks up a phone.
           EXT. JOSÉ MARTÍ AIRPORT - GROUND TRANSPORTATION - DAY

           Steve steps outside, greeted by the PUTTERING of diesel
           engines, taxis and classic cars lined up on the curb.

           Before he can reach the curb, several MEN approach--

                                 CUBAN MEN
                        Taxi? / Taxi! / Where you need to go?

           Steve moves past them. Walking parallel to the road, when--

           A HAND lands on his shoulder, causing him to JUMP. He spins
           around to see a MAN WITH A CREW CUT (Cuban, 40s).

                                 CREW CUT MAN
                        You should relax, my friend.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm good. I'm relaxed.

           The Crew Cut Man laughs. Almost friendly.

                                 CREW CUT MAN
                        You must not worry. Three million
                        Cubans and two million police.

           The man flags down a boxy, Russian-style car for Steve.

                                 CREW CUT MAN (cont'd)
                        Word of advice: the crappier the car,
                        the cheaper the taxi ride.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Welcome to Cuba.

           INT/EXT. STATE TAXI - HIGHWAY - SOON AFTER

           Steve's taxi passes a building with a large mural of Fidel
           Castro. Beside it, a slogan: SOCIALISMO O MUERTE

           Seated beside the CAB DRIVER (20s), Steve takes in stretches
           of barren land as rain starts to patter the windshield.

           The driver reaches just above Steve's knees, grabbing a
           rusted lever to manually rotate the windshield wipers.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Very difficult to get here from
                        America. Why are you here?

           A beat.
                                 STEVE
                        I came for cigars.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Ah! My sister works at the factory.
                        I'll sell you five for forty dollars.

           The driver opens the glove box, fumbles out a bag of cigars.

                                 STEVE
                        No thanks.

           Steve reaches for a seat-belt, but the car doesn't have any.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        My friend, these are the same cigars
                        you will get on the tour.

           The driver, eyes on the cigars, swerves a bit, barely
           missing another car. Loud HONKS all around.

                                 STEVE
                        Sir. Could you please watch the road?

           The driver turns to Steve. Accusing.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        You really come here for cigars?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes.

           The driver cuts off a CYCLIST, who yells in angry Spanish.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Then just for you, my friend... five
                        cigars for twenty five.

           The windshield fogs up. The driver rolls down a window.

                                 CAB DRIVER (cont'd)
                        It's only half price--

           He grabs the wheel, swerving a bit as Steve has a coronary.

                                 CAB DRIVER (cont'd)
                        --you pay more at the factory. It
                        would be crazy not to take this deal!
           EXT. STATE TAXI - CITY STREETS - MINUTES LATER

           The taxi chugs through tight cobblestone streets, finally
           entering Old Havana: stray cats... doors flung wide open...
           SHIRTLESS MEN on sidewalks... ARMED POLICE at every corner.

           INT./EXT. STATE TAXI - CONTINUOUS

           Steve cradles a plastic bag full of cigars.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        What do you plan to do today? I can
                        arrange for a private boat tour--

                               (
                                over it
                                 STEVE
                                       )
                        I'm good.

           The cab pulls to the curb beside half-crumbling apartment
           buildings. Steve points to his travel guide.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        This isn't the hotel.

           Outside, a red wooden door BURSTS OPEN, revealing a bony man
           in his thirties, with striking raccoon eyes. This is RAYMÓN.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Hello! Welcome.

           Steve watches as Raymón makes his way to the back of the
           cab, opens the trunk, and grabs Steve's suitcase.

                                 STEVE
                        Hey, wait--

           Steve jumps out of the cab as Raymón lugs the suitcase
           toward a blue wooden door adjacent to the red door.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        What the hell is this?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Forget the hotel. This is my
                        beautiful casa particular.

           Steve lunges for his luggage, but Raymón yanks it away.

                                 RAYMÓN (cont'd)
                        Don't you want to experience the real
                        Havana? With real Cubans? Or you want
                        to stay in a place with tourists?
           Steve considers this... on edge...

                                 STEVE
                        Ten a night?

                               (
                                 RAYMÓN
                                smiling big
                                           )
                        Ten is good, you got it. Third floor.

           Steve rips some cash from his pocket. Hands it to Raymón,
           who keys open the blue door. Steve steps inside.

           After a beat, Raymón slips a few dollars to the cab driver.

           INT. CASA PARTICULAR - DAY

           Steve enters a small living room with a rocking chair and a
           worn couch. Draped across the far wall, a flag of Cuba.

           Steve peeks into a bathroom, where a scribbled note taped to
           a toilet reads: "Don't flush paper."

           He steps into a bedroom, where he spots a stained bed linen.
           A rotary phone sits on a dresser below a painted mural of
           Che Guevara. Che's gleaming eyes almost mesmerize Steve.

                                 RAYMÓN (O.S.)
                        I painted that.

           Steve flinches, startled to see Raymón behind him.

                                 STEVE
                        It's very life-like.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        I like to think he watches over the
                        place. If you need anything, I'm
                        right next door.

                                 STEVE
                        Actually, know any good restaurants?

           INT. PRIVATE RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A house that's been converted into a restaurant. Moody
           candlelight, classical music.

           Steve and Raymón sit at a table in the back corner of the
           place. Raymón scoops a mound of chicken, ham, and rice into
           a to-go container as the WAITER drops off the check.
           (*Note: Italicized dialogue indicates subtitled Spanish)

                               (
                                 WAITER
                                quietly to Raymón
                                                 )
                        Looks like you found a good one...

           Raymón laughs, and as the waiter leaves:

                                 STEVE
                        What'd he say?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Oh, nothing.

           Steve watches the waiter carefully as he disappears into a
           narrow corridor. There's an energy about this place that
           doesn't sit well with Steve.

                                 RAYMÓN (cont'd)
                        Stop worrying. Three million Cubans,
                        two million police. No crime here.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, "no crime." That's what I keep
                        hearing. But you and that cab driver
                        have a nice thing going, huh?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        What do you mean?

                                 STEVE
                        I wanted to go to a hotel, next thing
                        I know I'm dumped on the curb outside
                        your place. It's a hell of a scam.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Scam? My friend, I'm just trying to
                        make a living.

                                 STEVE
                        Doesn't the government give you a
                        job? Isn't that the whole point of
                        the system you guys have here?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        I'm a painter. But nobody makes
                        enough at their job. So bolsa negra
                        is the only way to make real money.

                                 STEVE
                        Black bag?
                                 RAYMÓN
                        Bolsa negra. Black market. You know,
                        like a side hustle. Here, everyone
                        does it. So watch for Cubans who try
                        to recommend their favorite places.
                        They get commissions.

                                 STEVE
                        I'll keep that in mind.

           Steve drops cash on the table, then walks out. The waiter
           takes the money, and slips Raymón a few bills off the top.

           EXT. PRIVATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Steve and Raymón step out onto the cobblestone street.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        You interested in cigars? I can get
                        you a good deal.

           Steve pulls out the cigars he bought from the cab driver.
           Raymón is unable to hide a grin.

                                 STEVE
                        They're not authentic, are they.

           Raymón snorts a laugh, then quickly turns stern.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        So. Why Cuba?

           Steve gives pause, surveys the empty street.

                                 STEVE
                        I've always wanted to see the
                        Industriales play.

           Raymón's eyes light up.

           EXT. ESTADIO LATINOAMERICANO STADIUM - DAY

           Steve sits beside Raymón in the mezzanine level nearest the
           first base line in the crammed stadium.

           PLAYERS for Havana's Industriales warm up on the field.

           Steve surveys the field, not finding a familiar face...

                                 STEVE
                        Where's Hector Gonzalez?
           Raymón shakes his head.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        El Coco? Ah, you won't be seeing him
                        today. Too bad! He's suspended.

           Steve tenses.

                                 STEVE
                        Wait, what? He's suspended? Why?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Castro's order. An incident in your
                        country involving some American.

           The blood drains from Steve's face.

                                 RAYMÓN (cont'd)
                        These players are like sons to him.

           EXT. ESTADIO LATINOAMERICANO STADIUM - LATER

           The crowd CHEERS on a thrown strike to the opposing batter.
           Swarms of fans rise from seats, walking up the stairs to the
           exits. Steve hustles down the stairs toward the field.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Exit is this way. Steve--

           Steve reaches the Industriales dugout. He leans over a bar,
           watching the players pack up. A PITCHER looks up at Steve.

                                 INDUSTRIALES PITCHER
                               (
                                                )
                                heavily accented
                        Would you like to buy a ball?
                        Used in game. Five dollars.

                                 STEVE
                        Yes, I would, actually.

           Steve gives him a five. The pitcher hands him a dirty ball.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Where's Hector? I want his autograph.

           A stillness. Some players within earshot look up at Steve,
           as if Hector's name was poison. The pitcher SPITS.

                                 INDUSTRIALES PITCHER
                        He's sweeping floors at a school by
                        the airport. He deserves worse.
           Raymón catches up to Steve, heaving and out of breath.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        What... what are you doing?

                               (
                                 STEVE
                                ignoring Raymón
                                               )
                        Hector... escuela... aeropuerto...?

           The pitcher nods, then disappears into the dugout.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Why are you asking about Hector?

           Ignoring Raymón, Steve looks around, seeing fans dribbling
           out the stadium. Then, above the opposing dugout, he sees:

           The friendly man with a crew-cut from the airport.

           He smiles and waves. Steve limply waves back. And then...

           ANOTHER MAN appears from the dugout, in a red sweatsuit and
           flip-up glasses. The trainer from the Coach bus in Miami. He
           looks Steve up and down, recognition crossing his face...

                                 TRAINER
                        Security! Security!

           A switch goes off in Steve. He takes Raymón by the arm.

                                 STEVE
                        Gotta go. Now.

           A PLAIN-CLOTHES OFFICER rises from a seat, fast pursuing--

           INT. EXIT HALL - STADIUM - SHORTLY AFTER

           Steve and Raymón forge ahead past remnants of fans, gunning
           for a baseball cap VENDOR. Steve slams down five bucks.

                                 STEVE
                        Uno sombrero, por favor. Rápido!

           The vendor, not wired for speed, showcases his selection.

                                 VENDOR
                        Which hat would you like?

           Steve yanks one of the hats from his hands, fits it on his
           head, and paces towards the exit with Raymón. AHEAD--

           A SEA OF FANS moving so slow, it seems like they're stopped.
           Steve grabs Raymón's arm as they slice between bodies, and
           then STOP SUDDENLY, looking straight ahead in awe at--

           AN IMPOSING FIGURE, shadowing above all at well over six-
           feet. Jungle-green army fatigues, fat cigar resting between
           his fingers. It's FUCKING FIDEL CASTRO. The Beard himself.

           He chats with CUBAN CIVILIANS, all the while--

           --looking directly at Steve...

           --who just stands there, mouth agape, entranced by the man
           from his history books. 

           Castro inches closer, approaching arms-length, when...

                                 FIDEL CASTRO
                        American?

           Steve half-chokes, mustering:

                                 STEVE
                        Yes. Yes. I'm... an American.

                                 FIDEL CASTRO
                        Ah. You're here for... baseball?

           Raymón looks to Steve, alarmed, careful not to interrupt.

                                 STEVE
                        No... well... visiting. I just wanted
                        to... see a baseball game.

           The Beard doesn't smile. His eyes drill holes in Steve, who
           is visibly sweating now... searching for the right words...

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Cuban baseball... is the best kind of
                        baseball.

           THWACK. The Beard pats Steve's arm.

                                 FIDEL CASTRO
                        Good answer.

           The Beard chuckles, then marches off...

           ...leaving Steve and Raymón with their jaws on the cement.
           EXT. ESTADIO LATINOAMERICANO STADIUM - DAY

           Steve and Raymón walk with purpose up a street, the stadium
           fading in the distance behind them.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        The fuck have you gotten me into?

                                 STEVE
                        I'll tell you once we get outta here.

           Raymón stops suddenly.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Why did you come here? Don't give me
                        that tourist bullshit.

           Steve spots a police patrol car rolling towards them.

                                 STEVE
                        Can we please talk about this
                        somewhere else?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        I'm not going anywhere until you tell
                        me: what do you want with Hector?

           A beat.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm a sports agent. I have baseball
                        players as clients. I get a...
                        commission off of them.

           Raymón takes this in.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Shit, that's a good job. I thought
                        you had to be white to get that.

                                 STEVE
                        Generally speaking, yes.
                                    )
                               (
                                then
                        I need to get Hector out of Cuba.

           Raymón takes Steve my the shoulder.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Let's get a cab.
           EXT. PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

           A taxi idles at the curb. Steve steps out of the taxi.
           Raymón follows. Steve puts up a hand: wait out here.

           INT. BATHROOM - PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

           Hector mops the floor of an empty stall. Cigarette hanging
           from his mouth. He peeks in the toilet: streak marks. He
           struggles to fit on yellow latex gloves. Squats.

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Hector.

           Hector turns, sees Steve. A glare.

                                 HECTOR
                        Leave. Now. Before you get me in more
                        trouble.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm so sorry for what happened.

                                 HECTOR
                        Fuck you.

           Hector sticks his gloved hand in the toilet.

                                 STEVE
                        Let me make it right. You wanna stay
                        here and scrub shit or you wanna live
                        like a god?

           Hector removes his hand from the toilet. He stands. Steps
           close to Steve. He dwarfs the agent.

                                 HECTOR
                               (
                                switching to Spanish
                                                    )
                        I'm trying very hard not to snap you
                        in half right now.

                                 STEVE
                               (
                                                   )
                                clearing his throat
                        No one would blame you if you did.
                        But everything you've ever wanted...
                        I'm the guy who can give you that.

           (*Note: Any time Steve speaks Spanish, it's semi-broken
           Spanish)

           The door opens. A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY in a school uniform
           walks in. He takes a look at Hector. SPITS on the floor.
           The boy looks at Steve: a stranger.

                                 TWELVE YEAR OLD
                        You shouldn't be here. I'll tell.

           Steve digs into his pocket. Holds up a five dollar bill.

                                 STEVE
                        Will you?

           The boy snatches the bill and walks into a stall.

           After a moment:

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                               (
                                       )
                                quietly
                        I'm working on a plan.

           Hector reaches back into the toilet.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        I can get you and your family out
                        safely.

           Hector stops scrubbing. He's listening now.

                                 HECTOR
                        What is the plan?

                                 STEVE
                        I'm working on it. But I need to be
                        able to contact you when I'm ready.

           EXT. CAMPUS - UNIVERSITY OF HAVANA - DAY

           Cuba's oldest institution. Neoclassical architecture, age-
           stained pillars. Steve and Raymón climb steps to an imposing
           building.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        I have an arrangement with a
                        professor here. I give him fresh
                        paint; he recommends my casa
                        particular to visiting academics.

           Walking down the steps, a familiar-looking man passes by...
           it's the Crew Cut Man. Steve looks away as the man passes.

                                 RAYMÓN (cont'd)
                        Something wrong?
                                 STEVE
                        No.

           INT. HISTORY BUILDING - UNIVERSITY OF HAVANA - DAY

           Steve and Raymón stand outside a classroom as a flurry of
           STUDENTS exits. Finally, PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ steps out, a
           slight man in his 50s, wearing glasses and carrying a case.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Professor.

           Álvarez stops. Alarmed at Raymón's presence.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        I told you never to come here.

                                 STEVE
                        He's here because of me.

           Álvarez looks at Steve. Sizing him up.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                               (
                                nearly accent-free
                                                  )
                        My office.
                               (
                                to Raymón
                                         )
                        You stay outside.

           INT. OFFICE - UNIVERSITY OF HAVANA - SHORTLY AFTER

           Professor Álvarez sits at his desk. Steve sits across.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        After Arocha defected, I knew it was
                        only a matter of time before one of
                        you came for Hector.

                                 STEVE
                        So you agree with what I'm doing.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        As a capitalist: yes. As a Cuban: no.

           Álvarez locks eyes with the American before him.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ (cont'd)
                        The humanitarian group I work with is
                        called Hermanos al Rescate. They get
                        people off the island and deliver
                        them to their families in Miami.
                                 STEVE
                        They ever take someone like Hector?

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        No. And considering his price tag, it
                        will require a hefty fee.

           Steve nods. This is a language he can understand.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ (cont'd)
                        They'll ask for a cut of Hector's
                        contract. And for setting this up:
                        I'll need fifty thousand.

                                 STEVE
                        Fifty thousand? For what?

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        Travel expenses, lodging, logistics--

                                 STEVE
                        --Will Hector be able to get
                        citizenship from another country? MLB
                        free agency rules require that--

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        Yes. They will handle all of that.

                                 STEVE
                        But for fifty thousand? Level with
                        me. Where I'm from, we negotiate--

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        And where I am from traitors get
                        shot. Where are you from anyway?

                                 STEVE
                        America.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        But where are you really from? You're
                        clearly Latino, yet you make no
                        effort to speak Spanish.

           Steve fidgets in his chair. Restless.

                                 STEVE
                        My parents were born here. I was born
                        in Florida. I'm not anything but
                        American.

           Álvarez sets down his eyeglasses.
                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        So... your parents flee to the States
                        to let their son live his American
                        dream. And yet, here you are, testing
                        your American dream in Castro's Cuba.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s not my dream. It’s Hector’s.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Work with me here. Ten thousand.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                               (
                                scoffing
                                        )
                        That's an insult. You can leave.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm not going anywhere, man. I'm
                        giving you a deal. Cash in your
                        pocket. And for what? A consultation?

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        You're paying for my expertise. And
                        my contacts. And my vessel.

                                 STEVE
                        What if I found my own boat?

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        If you happen to find a Cuban willing
                        to transport a national icon through
                        coast guard waters? Twenty thousand.

                                 STEVE
                        Twelve.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        Fifteen.

                                 STEVE
                        Thirteen and I'm not going higher.

           Álvarez considers this. Nods slightly.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        Is your client on board with this?

           Steve hesitates. Álvarez leans forward.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ (cont'd)
                        Listen to me carefully. I want to
                        hear it straight from Hector's mouth.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ (cont'd)
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        You're a foreigner. Immune from real
                        consequences. But Hector? His wife?
                        They die in prison. And the son? An
                        orphan.

           Álvarez lets this float.

                                 STEVE
                        I'll find a boat. A good one.

           EXT. CASA PARTICULAR - SIDEWALK - DAY

           The cab driver that drove Steve from the airport ushers a
           EUROPEAN COUPLE inside Raymón's building.

           INT. STATE TAXI - DAY

           The cab driver opens the door, sits behind the wheel. He
           counts a handful of bills, snickering, when...

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Hey there.

           The driver jumps, startled at the sight of Steve lighting a
           cigar in his backseat.

                                 STEVE
                        I'll be honest. I'm starting to think
                        these cigars you sold me are fake.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        I never sold you anything.

           Steve takes a puff. COUGHS.

                                 STEVE
                        This Cohiba tastes like tree bark.
                        And yeah, my friend... it was you who
                        sold me them out of your glove box.

           The cab driver says nothing.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Maybe I should talk to la policia
                        about this, ask their opinion.

           Steve opens the car door, starts to get out.
                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Wait. Come back. You want a tour of
                        the tobacco fields? Let's go. Free.

                                 STEVE
                        I was actually thinking about that
                        private boat tour you mentioned.

           EXT. DOCK - OCEANFRONT - DAY

           Steve and the cab driver approach ADRIAN (60s, portly), who
           sleeps on the deck. The driver slaps some dollars onto
           Adrian's belly.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        New customer.

           On a dime, Adrian awakens, pivots to charismatic.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Okay! Very good, my friend! Let's go!

           Adrian stands up, beckoning Steve to the water, but not
           before sliding a few dollars off the top for the driver.

           Steve fixates on the water, where--

           Moored and bobbing in the waves: a hot-pink, motorized WATER
           TAXI with a decal of a palm tree and smiling woman.

           EXT. WATER TAXI - OPEN WATER - DAY

           Adrian steers the boat as Steve looks over every inch of the
           vessel. The boat's motor RAT-TAT-TATs loud into the air.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Mojito?

                                 STEVE
                        What?

           The boat's motor rattles so loud, it's hard to hear. Adrian
           opens a LONG COMPARTMENT in the deck, eyeing a cooler.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                               (
                                shouting
                                        )
                        Now we're talking! Here, let me help.

           Steve steps knee-deep into the chamber, gauging its size.
           EXT. WATER TAXI - SHORTLY AFTER

           The boat's engine is now off and quiet. Steve sips a mojito,
           lounging on the deck.

                                 STEVE
                        How far can you take this thing?

                                 ADRIAN
                        How far you wanna go?

           Steve points to orange buoys in the distance.

                                 STEVE
                        Past there?

           Adrian chuckles, rubbing his thumb along his fingers.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You understand, my friend?

           Steve smirks: of course he does.

                                 ADRIAN (cont'd)
                        Who you taking?

                                 STEVE
                        A friend.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Why they want to leave?

                                 STEVE
                        Same reasons as everyone.

           HERMMMM!!! A loud-as-hell horn shakes Steve sober.

           Coast Guard. The imposing ship casts a shadow over the water
           taxi. Adrian waves to a COAST GUARD SAILOR who waves back.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        They ever stop you? Give you trouble?

                                 ADRIAN
                        Why? We're just having a nice time.

           Steve watches, ever vigilant, as the ship passes by.

           EXT. HECTOR'S HOUSE - DUSK

           Steve steps out of a cab in a flat, crumbling neighborhood.
           He eyes the small house in front of him. Takes a breath and
           steps to the front door. Knocks.

           After a moment, Hector appears at the door.

           INT. HECTOR'S HOUSE - DUSK

           Hector, Steve and Hector's wife CELIA (20s, guarded
           intensity) are seated around a table, the food hardly
           touched. Celia holds a BABY (Iván), looking at Steve warily.

                                 CELIA
                        Is the raft big enough?

                                 STEVE
                        Not a raft. It is a boat.

                                 CELIA
                        And who is driving this boat?

                                 STEVE
                        I have this guy... he does tours.
                        Coast Guard sees him all the time.

                                 CELIA
                        How long have you known him?

                                 STEVE
                        ...I just met him.

           Celia looks to Hector, fierce.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        He knows the waters better than
                        anyone. Plus, I'm paying him well.
                               (
                                then, re: the food
                                                  )
                        My mother used to cook this dish. It
                        wasn't as good as this, though.

                                 CELIA
                        I'm sure your mother has as much food
                        as she needs. But because of your
                        government, I only have a pinch of
                        what I used to cook with.

                                 HECTOR
                        What is the problem?

                                 STEVE
                        I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to--
                                 CELIA
                        --The problem is you let vermin into
                        our home. He doesn't see you as a
                        human! Only a goldmine, no more!

                                 HECTOR
                        He is our guest.

                                 CELIA
                        He's your guest. And the reason I now
                        get dirty looks from the neighbors!

                                 STEVE
                        If I could say something...

           Celia looks at Steve as if she forgot he was in the room.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        You're right. I'm here because I
                        think I can make money off of him.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        But you're wrong about one thing: I
                        do see Hector as a human. A human who
                        has an extraordinary talent, for
                        which he should be compensated.

           Celia takes this in, unconvinced, as Iván starts to cry.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Your husband makes the equivalent of
                        about seven dollars a month playing
                        here. I could get you closer to seven
                        million on the open market, easy.

           Hector and Celia don't know how to react to this.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Think about it. There's nothing your
                        child would ever be without--

                                 CELIA
                        --You know what happens to defectors?

           Celia abruptly stands up, walks out with the crying baby.

                                 HECTOR
                        You should go.

           Steve nods, calm. He drops a stack of dollars on the table.

                                 STEVE
                        For the meal. And your trouble.
           Steve hands Hector a paper with an address.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Come here tomorrow. Eight pm. Okay?

           Hector blankly stares at the paper. Doesn't respond.

           Steve stands up, leaves through the front door.

           Celia re-enters the kitchen, eyeing the money on the table.

           INT. BEDROOM - CASA PARTICULAR - DAY

           Steve hunches over four separately labeled cash stacks laid
           on his bed: Boat, Professor, Professor's contacts, Raymón.

           Steve counts the Professor's stack. Then he scours through
           his suitcase, digging mad, the veins popping from his head.

           Thinking a sec, he peels a few bills off Raymón's stack and
           adds it to the Professor's.

           INT. RAYMÓN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Raymón sits by a coffee table, whistling the Cuban national
           anthem, while Steve paces the small room, wound tight.

           KNOCK KNOCK. Steve jumps to the door, opens it. Professor
           Álvarez steps inside, holding an attache case. Looks around.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        Is Hector--?

                                 STEVE
                        Just give it a few minutes. Please.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        Five minutes. No more.

                                 STEVE
                        While we wait, we can discuss--

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        --I believe you are missing a step.

           Steve nods. He disappears into the other room.

           Steve returns with a brown paper bag, from which he pulls a
           wad of money and hands it to the Professor, who counts it.
                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ (cont'd)
                        It was my understanding I would be
                        paid upfront. In full.

                                 STEVE
                        I thought we discussed this. I'll
                        send you the rest when Hector signs.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        You’ll be in Mexico.

                                 STEVE
                        I'll pay the rest of your share
                        through the humanitarian group--

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        --You’ll be in Mexico, and I’ll be
                        here, in the country I betrayed. Do
                        you even understand the risk I’m
                        taking here?

                                 HECTOR (O.S.)
                        We are all taking a risk.

           All eyes swing to Hector, who stands by the front door.
           Behind him, Celia cradles Iván.

                                 HECTOR
                        Pay everything now, Steve. Todo.

           A beat. Steve takes a stack and hands it to the Professor.

                                 HECTOR (cont'd)
                        You are the Professor?

           The Professor nods.

                                 HECTOR (cont'd)
                        I've heard what you can do.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        I've heard what you can do. Seen it a
                        few times with my own eyes.
                               (
                                then, in English
                                                )
                        You are sure... about this?

           Hector looks around, studying the room of strangers.

           INT. RAYMÓN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Steve, Hector, Celia, Álvarez, and Raymón huddle around a
           map of Cuba spread across a coffee table.
                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        On Sunday at noon, Hector, Celia, and
                        their son will depart on a boat--

                                 STEVE
                        Wait wait. That's two days from now.
                        I thought we had more time.

           Celia looks to Hector, who looks to Steve. Distressed.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        Things changed. It's two days or two
                        months from now. Understand?

           Steve motions for Álvarez to continue.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ (cont'd)
                        They will depart on a boat from the
                        Gulf of Batabano with...

                                 STEVE
                        Adrian, the boat captain.
                               (
                                then, to Hector
                                               )
                        He doesn't know he's transporting
                        Cuban royalty, so let's make sure we
                        keep it that way.

           Steve unfurls a Panama hat from a bag. Hector nods.

           The Professor traces his finger down to an archipelago.

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                        You will go south to a remote part of
                        Isla de la Juventud, a Cuban island.
                        You must depart precisely at noon, as
                        you'll have a tiny window of time to
                        sail without being intercepted by the
                        coast guard. When you reach the
                        island, you will meet my contacts.

                               (
                                 HECTOR
                                new to the word
                                               )
                        Contacts?

                                 PROFESSOR ÁLVAREZ
                               (
                                to Hector
                                         )
                        Gloria and Gerardo Ceballos run the
                        humanitarian group. You will board
                        their boat and set sail for Cancún.

           Raymón points at a landmass north of Cuba: Key Largo.
                                 RAYMÓN
                        Why not go straight to Florida?

                                 STEVE
                        If he sails directly to the States,
                        Hector's at the mercy of the Major
                        League draft. Meaning he can't be a
                        free agent on the open market.

                                 CELIA
                        Less money.

           Steve snaps his fingers, pointing to her.

                                 STEVE
                        Way less money. So you're gonna go to
                        Mexico first.

                                 HECTOR
                        And you?

                                 STEVE
                        I'll be flying. Avión.

           Hector just stares. He wasn't aware.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Trust me, your boat's tight as it is.

           Hector considers this logic.

           INT. RAYMÓN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Steve hands Raymón three separate stacks of cash.

                                 STEVE
                        The captain's cut. The humanitarian
                        group. And... for you.

           Raymón carefully fits the first stack through a cracked tile
           in the floor just under the fridge.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        No one else knows about this?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Just her. Mi madre.

           RAYMÓN'S MOTHER (70s) knits in the dining room.

           Raymón fits the second stack of cash through, then the
           third... but then pulls it back. Quickly counts it.
                                 RAYMÓN (cont'd)
                        You're short.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm sorry. It's all I can pay now.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        You serious, man?

           Steve takes out his wallet.

                                 STEVE
                        See? This is all I got. Enough for a
                        couple meals and airfare. If I give
                        you this, I can't leave Cuba.

           Raymón pokes Steve in the chest, suddenly threatening.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Bullshit. I gave you a fucking deal
                        on this. I put this all together.

                                 STEVE
                        Take it easy. You've been helpful.
                        But there's literally no more cash.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        To you, I'm nobody. You could leave
                        with Hector and I could die and you
                        wouldn't give a shit.

                                 STEVE
                        Come on, that's not true.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        I heard Hector was seen talking to an
                        American sports agent.

                                 STEVE
                        I don't follow.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        It was you.

           A beat.

                                 STEVE
                        It could've been anyone.

           Raymón stares Steve down.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        I'm very loyal to my country.
                                 STEVE
                        How loyal?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Help me make some cash and you won't
                        have to find out.

                                 STEVE
                        And just how am I going to do that?
                        You're a jinetero... you're asking me
                        to be a criminal.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Cabrón, wake up. You're already a
                        criminal. And after this week, you'll
                        be the most wanted man in Cuba.

           EXT. PLAZA - OLD HAVANA - DAY

           A lively plaza in the heart of Old Havana. Raymón watches as
           an ENGLISHMAN (70s) with a cane saunters by. Raymón walks
           alongside him, holding up a cigar wrapped in gold foil.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Where you from?

                                 ENGLISHMAN
                               (
                                guarded
                                       )
                        Cheshire.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Ah, British! Always the kindest. You
                        need cigars? I'm selling half-price.

           The man stops, studying the cigar in Raymón's hand.

           From across the street, Steve observes the scam. He sucks in
           a heaping breath, before walking to them.

                                 STEVE
                        Sir, just to let you know, I heard
                        that anyone selling cigars on the
                        street is scamming you.

                                 ENGLISHMAN
                        Yes, I read that in my travel guide.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        I can prove they are authentic.

           Raymón hands Steve a cigar and a lighter. Steve debates the
           offer, then torches the cigar. Puffs on it once, twice...
                                 STEVE
                        How much you charging?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Eight dollars a piece.

           Steve casts a quick look to the Englishman, then steps in
           closer to Raymón, suddenly conspiratorial.

                                 STEVE
                        Eight bucks for Cohibas?

                                 ENGLISHMAN
                        Cohibas? Doesn't Castro smoke those?

                                 STEVE
                        I'm not sure.
                               (
                                         )
                                to Raymón
                        I'll give you...

           Steve counts out a wad of cash.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Three hundred for the whole box.

                                 ENGLISHMAN
                        Do you have any more?

                                 RAYMÓN
                        Only one box today.

           The Englishman uses his cane to cut in front of Steve.

                                 ENGLISHMAN
                        I can do better than that...

           He takes out his wallet, counts out a stack of cash, as
           Raymón sneaks Steve a look of approval.

           Raymón collects the money, and Steve sees someone watching
           them from a balcony: the Crew Cut Man.

                                 STEVE
                               (
                                quietly, to Raymón
                                                  )
                        Let's go.

           Steve power walks around the corner. Raymón follows,
           catching up to him, grabbing his arm.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        You're a natural!

           Steve shakes him off.
                                 STEVE
                        Do you work for the government?

           Raymón laughs.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        In Cuba, everyone works for the
                        government.

                                 STEVE
                        Someone's been... following us. This
                        guy... he was on the balcony...

           A beat. Raymón curls his arm around Steve's waste.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        My friend... you are too tense.

           EXT. MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR - PLAZA DE LA REVOLUCIÓN - DAY

           An eight-story building. Rows of awnings alternate teal,
           pink and yellow. Outstretched along the facade, a steel
           etching of Che Guevara's face in a military beret.

           INT. SECURITY DIVISION - MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR - DAY

           Our Crew Cut Man, now in security garb, stands before a
           processing desk. He signs his name on a request form:

           Gustavo Bolivar

           The CLERK takes the form, reads it. Then looks at Gustavo.

                                 CLERK
                        You need high-level clearance.

           The clerk gets up and disappears behind a corridor.

           Gustavo waits as the wheels of communism churn.

           INT. PRIVATE ENCLAVE - SECURITY DIVISION - DAY

           A GUARD nods to Gustavo as he enters. Inside, a TECHNICIAN
           waits beside a desktop computer.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Internete?

           The technician motions Gustavo to a swivel chair.
                                 TECHNICIAN
                        You can conduct a search for
                        anything. Places... people...

           Gustavo rests his hands on the keyboard.

           INT. PRIVATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A home doubling as a restaurant. Steve, Hector, Celia, and
           Iván are the only ones dining. The OWNER (50s) drops off
           plates at their table: flank steak, plantains, pork loin.

                                 STEVE
                               (
                                to Hector, re: Owner
                                                    )
                        How well do you know him?

                                 HECTOR
                        Since I was a child.

           Steve is forcing himself to relax -- it's a losing battle.

                                 CELIA
                        You should go to the disco tonight.
                        Be with your cousins.

                                 HECTOR
                        The night before?

                                 STEVE
                        She's right. You need to do what
                        you'd normally do.

                                 CELIA
                        So I'll stay home with the baby while
                        you go out and act like a drunken
                        idiot.

           INT. CLUB RIO - NIGHT

           A hopping crowd. The night still young. At a long table,
           Hector and two of his COUSINS (20s) recline like kings --
           sipping on mojitos, puffing their lungs out.

           INT. SECURITY DIVISION - MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR - SAME

           Alone, Gustavo sits at the internet station. The only source
           of light -- the computer screen gleaming on his face.
           INT. CLUB RIO - NIGHT

           Hector and his cousins salsa dance on the dance-floor.
           Roping in WOMEN who buzz off the group's energy.

           INT. SECURITY DIVISION - MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR - SAME

           Gustavo types away feverishly. A search engine on his
           screen. Alta Vista. Search results populate...

           INT. CLUB RIO - NIGHT

           Hector and his cousins dance together, drinks in hands, as
           Hector's cousins are sprawled out on couches, women on laps.

           INT. SECURITY DIVISION - MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR - SAME

           Gustavo is now hunched over the computer. Breathing audibly.
           A soft CLICK as he leads the mouse down the pad...

           As the screen reveals: "Major League" and "Baseball Agent."

           Another mouse CLICK produces a new screen, with:

           Steve's face. Steve's name. A full biography.

           Gustavo swivels the computer chair away from the computer,
           his face filled with a renewed energy.

           INT. CLUB RIO - NIGHT

           Hector yells over the music to his cousins on the couches.

                                 HECTOR
                        I'm too drunk!

           The cousins yell back, raising their drinks.

           Hector shakes his head, drunk-stumbling out of the club.

           EXT. CLUB RIO - CONTINUOUS

           Hector lurches out the door into the cold, silent night, the
           loud music from the disco muffled.

           A moment passes. Hector stands up straight. Sober.
           INT. BEDROOM - CASA PARTICULAR - NIGHT

           Steve sits on the bed, packing his clothes.

           A harsh RINGING PHONE makes him jump. He pulls the shrieking
           receiver off the wall.

                                 STEVE
                        Hello?

           A muddled voice on the other end:

                                 MUDDLED VOICE (O.S.)
                        It's Raymón. We have a problem. Come
                        to my place quick--

           The line goes dead.

           EXT. CASA PARTICULAR - OLD HAVANA - NIGHT

           Steve steps out into the humid Cuban night. He looks at the
           door to Raymón's apartment.

           It's slightly ajar. Swaying back and forth. The sound of
           WEEPING is coming from inside.

                                 STEVE
                        Raymón?

           Steve pushes the door open and soft-steps into--

           INT. RAYMÓN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The place is in disarray. Ransacked.

           Sofa pillows, chairs strewn about. Scattered papers. The air
           conditioner ripped from the wall.

           Steve crosses into--

           THE DINING ROOM

           Another mess. Broken glass. Framed pictures askew.

           In the far corner on a rocking chair, Raymón's mother weeps.

                                 STEVE
                        What happened?
                                 RAYMÓN'S MOTHER
                        They took him! They took him away!

           She loses herself in a fit of tears.

           And before Steve can process this--

                                 GUSTAVO (O.S.)
                        Steve Santos.

           Steve whirls around to see Gustavo standing there, holding a
           pistol aimed at his chest.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Hands up. No sudden movements.

                                 STEVE
                        Let's talk about this.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Shh. No slick talk.

           The gun pokes Steve towards the sofa.

           Steve sits slowly. Gustavo sits on a chair opposite, gun
           still trained in Steve's direction.

                                 STEVE
                        What happened to Raymón? Where is he?

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Cold. Bleeding somewhere... running
                        out of teeth to knock out.

           Gustavo clicks his tongue, shaking his head, as Steve
           processes all of this.

                                 STEVE
                        You work for the government.

           Gustavo strikes a smile.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        You know what Cuba's best natural
                        resource is? Its people. So when I
                        see a foreigner come and try to steal
                        our homegrown talent--

                                 STEVE
                        I'd like a lawyer.

           Gustavo scoffs.
                                 GUSTAVO
                        I think you should have looked up our
                        laws before you came here.

                                 STEVE
                        I can just leave. Send me out on the
                        next plane and we'll call it even.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        You know, the internet is such a
                        wonderful tool. And to think it was
                        invented by an American...

                                 STEVE
                        The Web. Of course. So you found out
                        I'm an agent. Big surprise.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        That’s not all I found.

           From his pocket, Gustavo produces a crumpled-up piece of
           paper, worn with time. He presents it to Steve.

           It's a stamped document marked CERTIFICACION DE NACIMIENTO.

           The name on it: ESTEBAN SANTOS

                                 GUSTAVO (cont'd)
                        Seems you were born in Cuba, Esteban.

           Steve takes the paper from Gustavo in a daze. His
           incredulous eyes running over the text.

                                 STEVE
                        What? No, this is impossible. I was
                        born in Miami, Mercy Hospital. Two
                        months after my parents left...

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Your parents would risk an escape
                        when your mother was seven months
                        pregnant?

           Steve continues staring at the paper. Dumbfounded.

                                 STEVE
                        This thing is a fake.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        This country takes great pride in
                        keeping track of its people. Why
                        would you be an exception?
                                 STEVE
                        My U.S. birth certificate--

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Forged, likely. Your mother and
                        father must have really hated Cuba.

           Steve looks like he's going to vomit.

                                 GUSTAVO (cont'd)
                        If you attempt to go to the airport.
                        You'll be detained. As a citizen.

           Steve takes this in. Reality dawning.

                                 STEVE
                        What do you want from me?

                                 GUSTAVO
                        A confession.

           A beat.

                                 GUSTAVO (cont'd)
                        Did you come to Cuba with the
                        intention of aiding Hector Gonzalez
                        in defecting from our country?

           The question hangs in the air.

                                 STEVE
                        Yes.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        And you arrived in Cuba with an
                        excess amount of dollars?

                                 STEVE
                        There's nothing illegal about that.

           Steve looks around, seeing how thoroughly the house has been
           torn apart, realizing--

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        You're just looking for the money.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        It's been hidden quite well.

                                 STEVE
                        And I thought you actually cared
                        about your country.
                                 GUSTAVO
                        Government jobs pay shit. Tell me
                        where the money is.

           Steve is silent.

                                 GUSTAVO (cont'd)
                        Tell me where the fula is, and I let
                        you go. You might even have enough
                        time to carry out your plan.

                                 STEVE
                        Why would you let me go? The police--

                                 GUSTAVO
                        The police only know what I told
                        them. They have no idea Hector is
                        involved. But I give it less than an
                        hour before your friend gives you up.
                        So: the money.

           Steve weighs this. No leverage.

                                 STEVE
                        Refrigerator. Broken tile.

           Gustavo breaks into a smile. Almost warm.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        I hope you enjoyed your stay in Cuba.

           EXT. HECTOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Hector and Celia sleep soundly. Iván asleep in his crib.

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

           Hector and Celia sit up instantly--

           INT. STATE TAXI - NIGHT

           A FEMALE CAB DRIVER (50s) guns it down the highway, a
           Santeria Changó dangling from her rear-view mirror.

           Steve sits shotgun. In the back, Hector's Panama hat tilted
           down to obscure his face as Celia comforts the wailing baby.

           INT. ADRIAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Adrian lays in bed, out cold.
           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

           EXT. ADRIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Steve bashes at the front door. KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

           No answer.

           He cocks his right elbow, and stops, seeing his bandage. He
           cocks his left elbow... and CRASH! -- smashes the window.

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        What the fuck?!

           Adrian flings the door open, wearing only underwear.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You broke my window you asshole!

                                 STEVE
                        We have to go right now.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Get the fuck out of here! It's the
                        middle of the night!

                                 STEVE
                        Adrian. Listen... I will double your
                        pay if we leave now.

           A beat. Adrian tries to calm himself.

                                 ADRIAN
                        That's eight thousand.

                                 STEVE
                        Yes. Eight thousand dollars.

           Adrian considers this. Then nods.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Good! Throw on clothes and we'll go.

           Adrian doesn't move.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You pay me. Then we go.

                                 STEVE
                        I don't have the money right now.

           Adrian looks at him like he's crazy.
                                 ADRIAN
                        Money first.

           Hector jumps out of the taxi, hat shielding his face.

                                 HECTOR
                        The police took the money.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Police?

                                 STEVE
                        It's our problem. Not yours. When we
                        get to the island, you get paid.

                                 ADRIAN
                        I have tour appointments in the
                        morning. What will they think when
                        they see I'm gone? 

                                 STEVE
                        What can I do to make you leave right
                        now? Please, I'm begging you!

           Steve gets down on one knee, hands clasped. His eyes focus,
           eye level, at his own wrist. The watch.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        See this? Twenty-four karat gold. Muy
                        raro. Only fifty made, from the Cuba-
                        USA game. Collector's item!

           He wiggles it off his wrist.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        A down payment for your trust. Once
                        we get to the island, you get paid.

           Adrian weighs this as Steve mentally prays.

                                 HECTOR
                        Hey! I'm not spending the rest of my
                        life in jail! Let's go! Now!

                                 ADRIAN
                        Real gold?

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - HAVANA JAIL - NIGHT

           A low-lit room. Crumbling cement walls.
           Raymón sits in the corner, naked. Shivering. A purple bruise
           on his left cheek. A SECURITY OFFICER stands above him.

                                 SECURITY OFFICER
                        The names, please.

           EXT. DOCK - OCEANFRONT - NIGHT

           Steve, Hector, Celia and Iván wait on the dock, two
           suitcases at their feet. Adrian unties his boat from a post.

                                 STEVE
                        You'll lay down in there until we
                        pass the Coast Guard.

           Adrian pulls a latch and opens the luggage compartment on
           the floor. It's maybe four feet long, two feet wide.

                                 HECTOR
                        We can't fit in there.

                                 STEVE
                        No time for debate. We're doing this.

           Hector and his wife look to each other, then get in. Laying
           fetal, tight. Iván has started to lightly cry again.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        And whatever you gotta do to quiet
                        the baby... now's the time to do it.

           Celia gives Steve a look.

           Steve looks down the harbor. The ocean entirely black.

           EXT. WATER TAXI - GULF OF BATABANO - NIGHT

           The boat motors into the foggy mist, the bay now just a
           distant speck in plain sight.

           Steve crouches on the deck. Beside him, Adrian pilots the
           boat, momentarily admiring the gold watch on his wrist.

           Suddenly, a FOGHORN rattles Steve. Coast Guard.

           Steve and Adrian look to each other. As--

           UNDERNEATH THEIR FEET

           Hector, Celia and child are packed like sardines. Terrified.
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - HAVANA JAIL - NIGHT

           Raymón sits at the table. Clothed. A mug of coffee in front
           of him. Still shaken up. The security officer sits opposite.

                                 RAYMÓN
                        The others are... an American. His
                        name is Steve Santos. And--

           A long beat.

                                 RAYMÓN (cont'd)
                        Hector Gonzalez. 

           The news, like a firecracker--

                                 SECURITY OFFICER
                        Shit!

           The officer springs from his chair.

           EXT. WATER TAXI - GULF OF BATABANO - NIGHT

           The Coast Guard ship's ladder DROPS onto the deck of the
           water taxi, CLANGING loudly.

           A COAST GUARD OFFICER descends the ladder and steps onto the
           boat, which rocks slightly.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Miguel, is there a problem?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        I've never seen you out this late.

           The water taxi's motor is so loud, the men have to shout.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Special arrangement for my customer.

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        Howdy!

           The officer eyes Steve, who sits in a reclining position.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Why are you out this far?
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Turn off the engine.
           UNDER THEIR FEET

           Speckles of wood crumble through the cracks onto Hector's
           face. The officer's boot inches away.

           ANGLE ON: Iván, hysterically crying on her shoulder. The
           boat motor still RAT-TAT-TATs, only decibels greater.

           BACK ON THE BOAT

           The officer walks the boat from front to back. RAT-TAT-TAT.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Please. He pays good money for this
                        trip. This is bad for business.

           RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT. Steve takes out a cigar from his pocket.

                                 STEVE
                        Miguel, you have a light?

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        This is a Coast Guard inspection, not
                        a Disneyland ride. You are to be
                        silent unless spoken to.
                                to Adrian
                               (
                                         )
                        And I said to cut that engine!

                                 ADRIAN
                        It takes a long time to start. And if
                        I can't start it, we'll be stranded.

           A beat. RAT-TAT-TAT. The officer eyes the floor compartment.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Are you transporting any contraband?

                                 STEVE
                        Sure, if cigars count.

           The officer lunges to the bow. Cuts the engine dead.

           Steve and Adrian wince. Their futures dependent on the
           silence of the night.

           --but the only sound to be heard is the officer's crunching
           footsteps on the deck.

           The officer squats by the floor latch. Hand reaching for it.

           Through the cracks, Celia clutches the baby close... Hector
           holds his breath, closes his eyes ... silently prays, when--
           The officer stops. Pulls his hand back. Turns to Steve.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Cigars are only contraband in your
                        country.

           After a beat, the officer walks back toward the ladder.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER (cont'd)
                        Don't go out too far.

           The officer climbs up the ladder and off the water taxi.

           INT. COAST GUARD SHIP - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is empty as an emergency telephone rings.

           It rings. And rings. And rings.

           No one there to pick it up.

           EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - FIRST LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

           The Coast Guard Officer steps off the ladder onto the deck.

           ANOTHER OFFICER watches through binoculars as the water taxi
           cruises out of view.

                                 COAST GUARD OFFICER
                        Crazy fucking Americans.

                                 OFFICER #2
                        Rich people...

           They share a laugh, as they make their way towards--

           INT. CONTROL ROOM - COAST GUARD SHIP - CONTINUOUS

           --where the phone seems to ring LOUDER, more urgent. Ringing
           for minutes by now. Blocked by soundproof glass.

           CLOSE ON: the shaking phone-- which could well ring forever.

           And ever.

           And ever.

           Until... finally... the ringing stops.

           And the control room door opens.
           EXT. WATER TAXI - OPEN WATER - LATER

           Steve pulls open the luggage latch, revealing the family.

                                 STEVE
                        We're in the clear!

           Steve and Adrian extend their hands, bringing Hector and
           Celia to the surface. Everyone smiling.

           Hector removes the hat that's been masking his face.

           Adrian looks at Hector, something suddenly familiar about
           him. Then, with not an ounce of uncertainty:

                                 ADRIAN
                        El Coco...

           Adrian stands up, in utter awe of the national icon, who is
           just inches away. He shakes Hector's hand.

                                 ADRIAN (cont'd)
                        I didn't know we were taking him!
                        You're the meanest hitter I ever
                        seen. I watched all of your games!
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        What's all this about?

                                 HECTOR
                        I'm gonna play baseball in America.

           Adrian takes this in.

                                 ADRIAN
                        You're defecting.

           A beat. Steve and Celia exchange uneasy looks.

                                 ADRIAN (cont'd)
                        How am I supposed to go back to Cuba
                        when I helped Hector Gonzalez escape
                        the island? They'll throw me in jail!

           Adrian snaps his head to Steve, who's at a loss for words.

                                 ADRIAN (cont'd)
                        What did you think would happen to
                        me? I'm talking about my life.
                                 STEVE
                        Let's just... get to where we're
                        going first... and we'll figure
                        something out. I won't leave you
                        hanging. I will fix this. Please.

           Adrian shakes his head, steaming mad. He steps to the bow.

           EXT. WATER TAXI - ISLA DE LA JUVENTUD - DAWN

           Hector, Celia, and Iván are huddled together, sleeping.
           Steve sits against the side, nodding in and out of sleep.

           Adrian reaches down and nudges Steve, who snaps to.

           Steve stands. Looks to the horizon: land.

           EXT. DOCK - ISLA DE LA JUVENTUD - DAWN

           GLORIA and GERARDO wave as the boat slides into the dock.

           Gloria (40, Latina) is effortlessly fit, cosmopolitan.
           Gerardo (45, Latino) is dressed like he's on vacation. Both
           speak English without an accent.

                                 GLORIA
                        Hello, welcome!

           Gloria tosses a mooring line to Adrian, which he ties to a
           cleat. Hector and Celia kiss, jubilant.

           EXT. DOCK - ISLA DE LA JUVENTUD - LATER

           Waiting on the dock, everyone but Hector has disembarked.
           Gerardo helps Hector off the boat, firmly clasping his hand.

                                 GERARDO
                        There he is. Our star.

           Hector pats him on the arm.

                                 STEVE
                        I can’t believe you guys are here...
                        I was sure we’d have to wait.

                        Well, we're very grateful. Thank you.

                                 GERARDO
                        It's no problem at all, really.

                        When do I get paid?

           Gloria and Gerardo look at Adrian a moment.

                                 STEVE
                               (to Gloria)
                        The “trouble” you referred to... it
                        involved losing some of our...
                        upfront cash. It was stolen.

                        --Hey, let's not talk business here.

                                 ADRIAN
                        No. I was told I'd be paid upfront.
                        He never told me I was taking a
                        celebrity. They are probably already
                        looking for him. Now he's a fugitive!
                        If I go back, they'll arrest me! The
                        Coast Guard saw me!

                                 ADRIAN
                        Eight thousand dollars.

           Gloria looks at Gerardo. Nods. Gerardo digs into a pouch
           near his feet and produces a wad of cash, counts off bills.
           He hands the cash to Adrian, who stares wide-eyed at the
           money, before pocketing it.

                                 GLORIA
                        And we'll make sure you get back

                                 ADRIAN
                        Really?

           Gloria nods, giving a comforting smile.

                                 GLORIA
                        We've been doing this for years.
                        Besides, they would never admit to
                        letting a boat sail past them.

                                 GERARDO
                        Never. We'll call them today.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Gracias!

           Steve looks like a thousand pound weight was lifted off him.

           Adrian points to the watch on his wrist.

                                 ADRIAN (cont'd)
                        You want it back?

                                 STEVE
                        I broke your window. Keep it.

           Adrian nods his thanks. Gloria leads him by the arm.

                                 GLORIA
                        Come. I'll get you some supplies for
                        the trip back.

           Adrian follows Gloria, and they disappear around a trail.

           Steve plops down in the sand. Hector drops next to him.

                                 HECTOR
                        You lucky motherfucker.

           Steve and Hector share a laugh.
           EXT. FAR CORNER OF THE DOCK - ISLA DE LA JUVENTUD - DAY

           Steve, Hector, Celia and baby follow Gerardo onto the cabin
           cruiser. Astonished by the natural amenity of seating space.

                                 STEVE
                        Some boat you got here.

                                 GERARDO
                        Beats the hell out of a timeshare.

           Gerardo leads them to a counter, where there are cans of
           soup, a platter of rice, cuts of beef, chips and drinks.

                                 GERARDO (cont'd)
                        There's a microwave to the side. Milk
                        in the fridge for the little one.

           EXT. SHORELINE - ISLA DE LA JUVENTUD - DAY

           Gloria and Adrian walk along the sand, as waves lap gently.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Thank you again. For everything.

                        tiny island just above the horizon.

                        I still don't see it...

           And with her other hand, Gloria pulls a small pistol from
           her belt and--
           BANG! Shoots Adrian in the back of the head. His body slumps
           to the sand.

           Gloria kneels down and digs her hand into Adrian's pocket.

           ANGLE ON: Her neck where her collar droops. A tattoo of a
           snake, huge fangs jutting out, swallowing a hawk.

           Gerardo looks at her until her eyes meet his... and Gloria
           nods ever-so-subtly.

           EXT. CABIN CRUISER - GULF OF MEXICO - NIGHT

           Gerardo at the bow, the boat cuts through deep black water.

           INT. CABIN CRUISER - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

           Steve, Hector and family sleep peacefully on two pull-outs.

           EXT. CABIN CRUISER - GULF OF MEXICO - DAY

           On the horizon, we can make out the high rise hotels of
           downtown Cancún along the Yucatán Peninsula.

           UP AHEAD: a MEXICAN COAST GUARD CUTTER heads directly for
           the cabin cruiser, COAST GUARD OFFICIAL at the bow.

           Gerardo, at the bow, doesn’t move the wheel an inch--

           He instead removes his sunglasses, making clean eye contact
           with the official-- who, at the last moment, shifts the
           cutter's angle, just missing the cabin cruiser.

           INT/EXT. TAXI CAB - HIGHWAY 307 - MORNING

           A green taxi van blows past an exit sign for Cancún. The
           party of six from the cruiser sits inside.
                                 STEVE
                        Wasn't that our exit?

                        We're set up on the outskirts.

           The taxi passes a small baseball field. Steve points at it.

                                 STEVE
                        We need a place like that where
                        Hector can work out for the scouts.

                                 GERARDO
                        Sure, I think we can arrange that.

                                 STEVE
                        He also needs some cleats. Size
                        sixteen. The more he impresses those
                        guys, the better contract we get.

           EXT. DIRT DRIVEWAY - OUTSKIRTS OF CANCÚN - DAY

           The group walks to a wooden structure with an angular-sloped
           roof, loft windows with "X"s, and alley doors.

           Steve trails in back, his pace oozing slower.

                                 STEVE
                        It's behind... whatever this is?

                        It's actually kinda nice. Rustic.

           INT. BARN (SAFE HOUSE) - MOMENTS LATER

           They enter the door, where inside, an empty space with wood-
           planked floors. Scattered beds. Clean, yet hardly welcoming.

                                 GERARDO
                        It's not exactly the Four Seasons,

           Silence. Celia and Hector look at each other, until a soft
           SCRATCHING sound breaks their daze.

           Their heads turn in sync as a field mouse teeters past.
           No one says a word.

           Nearby, ARTURO (20s, size rivaling Hector) fits sheets onto

                                 STEVE
                        Does he play baseball too?

                                 GLORIA
                        Since you arrived early, we didn't--

                                 STEVE
                        --Totally understandable. We were way
                        ahead of schedule. 

           Steve feels the firmness of one of the mattresses.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Box springs. Great.

           No one reacts.

                                 GLORIA
                        We'll let you get settled in.

           Gloria and Gerardo exit the room, joined by Arturo.

           Celia takes a tour of the premises, inspecting every corner.
           Finally she stops. Looks at Hector. The baby. Then Steve.

                                 CELIA
                        We can't stay here.

           EXT. BEHIND THE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Steve sits on a rotted bench opposite Gloria and Gerardo.
                                 GLORIA
                        One of our routes goes to Miami.
                        Celia and her child can stay at a
                        safe house there until Hector--

                                 STEVE
                        No. No more safe houses. There's
                        nothing closer? Like downtown Cancún?

                                 GLORIA
                        With all due respect, Mr. Santos, we
                        can't keep spending out of pocket.

                                 GERARDO
                        And it’s unclear how exactly you will
                        pay us the two hundred thousand we
                        are owed after the deal is made.

                                 STEVE
                        How much did the Professor explain to
                        you about baseball contracts?

           Their blank expressions give the answer.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        There's a signing bonus paid once a
                        deal is reached. That money gets
                        wired immediately. To you. Assuming
                        we play our cards right, I can get
                        Hector a bonus of two hundred grand.

           Gloria and Gerardo look at each other for a moment.

                                 GLORIA
                        And you are sure you can negotiate a
                        signing bonus for that amount?

                                 STEVE
                        I'm an agent. It's what I do.

           EXT. DIRT RUNWAY - NIGHT

           An unmarked jet sits on a runway. Its turbine engine WHIRS
           to life. On the tarmac, Hector hugs Celia tight, squeezes
           Iván's hand. Nearby, Steve gives them a moment.

           Arturo brings Celia's luggage up the jet stairs.

           Steve steps towards Hector.

                                 STEVE
                        Sure you wanna go through with this?
                                 HECTOR
                        America will be better for them.

           Steve nods, picking his battles.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Steve talks on a landline phone. Arturo looks on.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        You really pulled it off. Holy shit.

                                 STEVE
                        Not yet. I need you to call the front
                        office of every team in the league.

           INTERCUT STEVE WITH BRANDY IN STEVE'S OFFICE:

           Brandy scribbles notes on a pad.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        An exclusive invite to Hector's
                        workout for Sunday at one pm. Talk
                        only to the higher-ups. We don't want
                        the press blowing this thing up.

                                 BRANDY
                        No press, got it.

                                 STEVE
                        If anyone else calls... you don't
                        have me. We hold the cards. We're
                        gonna dangle Hector under their
                        noses, toy with 'em.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        What's the number we need? To pay the
                        legal debts and stay afloat?

           Brandy opens a ledger. Punches into a calculator...

                                 BRANDY
                        Well, factoring in my salary, your
                        mortgage, credit card debts and late
                        fees, just shy of five hundred thou.

           Steve takes a deep breath.

                                 STEVE
                        Okay. Five percent of... ten million.
                                then
                                    )
                               (
                        Anything else?
                                 BRANDY
                        Your mother called. I said you were
                        out of town. And Jackie kept calling.
                        I had to tell her about the whole
                        Cuba thing. Didn't go over so well.

                                 STEVE
                        Don't invite the Dodgers front
                        office. Only Jackie.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I'll set time aside for us to catch
                        up. Tell her we'll do something fun.

                                 BRANDY
                        Can I tell her which hotel you're at?

                                 STEVE
                        I'm not at a hotel.

           A beat.

                                 BRANDY
                        Is everything okay?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 BRANDY
                        No reason. Except a bunch of things
                        that sound vaguely... ominous.

                                 STEVE
                        Don't worry. We've got El Coco. And
                        when this thing pans out, you and me
                        are going to the next level, baby.

           INT. IMMIGRATION SERVICES - PROCESSING AREA - DAY

           Steve and Hector reluctantly tail Gerardo, who cuts a line
           full of MIGRANTS, maneuvering his way to a DESK CLERK (70s). 

                                 GERARDO
                        Excuse me. Is Carlos working today?

           INT. BREAK ROOM - IMMIGRATION SERVICES - CONTINUOUS

           Just feet from the clerk, behind a corridor, CARLOS (30s)
           chows on a chorizo torta he's not enjoying.

                                 GERARDO (O.S.)
                        Once again, my name is Gerardo.
           Carlos stops chowing. He springs up, throws on his work vest
           and turns the corner into the...

           PROCESSING AREA

           ...where, seeing Gerardo, he curls a smile.

                                 CARLOS
                        How can I help you today, sir?

           INT. PHOTO STATION - IMMIGRATION SERVICES - SHORTLY AFTER

           Hector sits on a stool, ear-to-ear grin on his face.

           FLASH. A photo is taken. Hector rises.

           Carlos pulls Hector's photo from a printer, slips it into a
           stack of documents, applies an ink stamp to the top of the
           pile. He hands everything to Steve, who scans it over.

                                 STEVE
                        Congrats Hector... you're a Mexican
                        ice vendor.

           Hector takes the stack from Steve. Looks at it, chuckles.

           INT. CAR - HIGHWAY - DAY

           Arturo drives, with Steve up front. Hector, in his Opening
           Day best, sits in back, twirling a baseball in his hand.

           Steve turns back to Hector.

                                 STEVE
                        You got nerves? Nervioso?

           Hector shrugs.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Everything you had to prove you
                        already proved in Cuba. They just
                        want to see that you're healthy.

           Steve turns forward, watching as the hotel skyline of
           downtown Cancún gets closer and closer.

           He smiles. Calm, relaxed. Arturo hits the radio: a pulse-
           pounding dance track by Real McCoy chimes on.
                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Alright! Western music. Turn it up!

           Arturo merges to the highway exit, turning up the radio. His
           fingers rhythmically drum the steering wheel.

           Steve's eyes focus on Arturo's forearm as he taps the wheel:
           a tattoo of a fangy snake sinking its teeth into a hawk.

           And then Steve's mouth hangs open as he sees it...

           On Arturo's wrist, in plain sight, a 24-karat gold watch,
           Cuban and American flags. Its face glaring at us.

           Steve sits there dazed, not daring to say a word, his mind
           racing in all directions, when--

                                 ARTURO
                        Should be there in five minutes.

           Steve can hardly nod.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

           A couple-dozen SCOUTS and a few suit-and-tie-clad EXECUTIVES
           are gathered on a set of bleachers. The old-timer scout from
           the Cuba-U.S. game is also present.

           Arturo's car pulls up. All in the bleachers eagerly watch--

           --as natural wonder Hector "El Coco" Gonzalez emerges.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL FIELD - LATER

           The mood in the bleachers is quiet, attentive. Steve sits
           among the crowd. They watch as:

           Arturo, on the mound, soft-lobs a pitch to Hector--

           POP! The ball sails way over the fence.

           A murmur in the bleachers. Excited energy.

           Steve turns to make eye contact with the old-timer, who
           nods. A YOUNGER SCOUT beside the old-timer chimes in.

                                 YOUNGER SCOUT
                        Looks a little famished to me.
                                 OLD-TIMER
                        How would you look if you just got
                        off a boat from Cuba?

           CLUCK! Another ball soars to another area code.

           Steve's eyes don't follow the ball. His eyes squarely beamed
           at Arturo's watch, when--

                                 JACKIE (O.S.)
                        Good form.

           Jackie, looking at once displeased and relieved to see
           Steve, is sitting next to him on the bench.

           For a moment, Steve can't even speak. Then:

                                 STEVE
                        You made it.

           Silence.

                                 JACKIE
                        All I needed was a phone call--

                                 STEVE
                        Can we talk about this some other--

                                 JACKIE
                        Would it have killed you to just--

                                 STEVE
                        Yes. It might have.

                                 JACKIE
                        What?

                                 STEVE
                        I'm sorry I didn't call, okay? I
                        didn't even tell anyone. And I feel
                        awful about skipping out on dinner.

           A beat.

                                 JACKIE
                        I'll let you make it up to me.

           She leans in. Close.

                                 JACKIE (cont'd)
                        I booked a hotel for the weekend.
                                 STEVE
                        Why would you do that?

                                 JACKIE
                        Your assistant led me to believe
                        you'd make time for me.

                                 STEVE
                        I can't go anywhere with you.

           Silence.

                                 JACKIE
                        Man, does your ego swell when you
                        find a shiny new toy--

                                 STEVE
                        It's not safe here.

           Jackie processes this.

                                 JACKIE
                        What's going on?

           Steve looks to the outfield where, behind the fences, Gloria
           and Gerardo watch Hector impress the suits.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm not sure yet. But whatever it is,
                        I don't want you to get involved.
                        Just watch Hector, take notes, and
                        leave when the other scouts leave.

           The crowd gushes over a smash from Hector.

                                 JACKIE
                        Leave with me. Now. We'll get a cab.

                                 STEVE
                        I can't.

                                 JACKIE
                        Then let me call the police--

                                 STEVE
                        Do not call the police.

           Steve grabs Jackie's hand for a second. Then pulls away.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        I need this.
           INT. SAFE HOUSE - ROOM UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

           A low-lit room. Confined, yet cozy. Arturo eats a bowl of
           cereal off his bed as his switch-dial TV plays the news.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...over in the sports world we have
                        some breaking news, star Cuban
                        baseball player Hector Gonzalez has
                        reportedly defected to Mexico.

           ON TV: A photo of Hector in an Industriales uniform.

           Arturo, only half attentive, suddenly sits up straight at
           the sight of Hector's photo.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (cont'd)
                        News of his defection came after
                        internal memos from Major League
                        Baseball circles were leaked.

           Arturo sets down his cereal, cranks up the volume dial.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (cont'd)
                        Experts predict Hector's value to be
                        in the multi-millions, with some
                        hinting at a record deal...

           Arturo reaches to a nightstand, snatches up a telephone.

           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY

           A TV telecasts the 7 o'clock news report on KTLA when--

           Brandy removes her headset, seeing Hector on TV.

                                 BRANDY
                        Oh shit...

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

           The lights are out. Steve and Hector sleep in adjacent beds.

           BOOM! The barn door FLIES open. Gerardo storms inside,
           Gloria and Arturo behind him.

           Gerardo grabs Steve by the shoulders. YANKS him out of bed.

                                 GERARDO
                        Steve, my good friend. Come with us.
           Now fully awake and terrified, Steve stumbles as Arturo
           forcibly drags him across the room, pushes him out the door.

           Gloria stays, her gun trained on the slowly-waking Hector.

           EXT. BEHIND THE SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Steve is led down an uneven path by Arturo and Gerardo.

                                 STEVE
                        Where are we going?

           As they come to a rocky ravine, Gerardo stops walking. He
           and Arturo look at each other.

           A stream of water is the only thing audible out here.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        What happened to Adrian?

           No response.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Tell me you didn't kill him. Please,
                        just tell me that.

           Steve is met with silence.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Please, guys... I'm on your side. If
                        your goal is to make a good profit,
                        that is. All those scouts who showed
                        up? They came because--

                                 GERARDO
                        They came because of Hector.

           Steve tries his best to appear calm.

                                 STEVE
                        They came because I'm the guy they
                        know they're going to be dealing with
                        if they want to buy Hector. I'm a
                        licensed Major League Baseball agent!
                        If you negotiate? They're gonna
                        laugh! That's if they take your call.

           Arturo pulls out a gun. Points it at Steve.

                                 GERARDO
                        You misled us about Hector's value.
           Arturo places his gun on Steve's forehead.

                                 STEVE
                        Hector doesn't have any value until
                        we -- until I -- expose him to the
                        marketplace.

                                 GERARDO
                        The news said he's worth millions.

                                 STEVE
                        With the right negotiator on your
                        side. Yes. Not with a goddamn bullet
                        in his head. I'll get you more money.
                        I'll get you more signing bonus. I'll
                        get you a bidding war. I promise.

                                 GERARDO
                        How much more?

           Arturo's finger hugs the trigger.

                                 STEVE
                        Signing bonuses can go up to a
                        million. Sometimes -- rarely -- even
                        more. You keep me alive, I can get
                        you a million dollars.

                                 GERARDO
                        That's enough.

           Arturo lowers his gun.

                                 GERARDO (cont'd)
                        Signing bonus of two million dollars.
                        That's the number. And if it isn't
                        the number, we'll come back out here.

           Steve nods. He'll take that deal.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Field mice scurry away as Arturo muscles an old wooden table
           into the room. Gloria and Gerardo stand by, arms crossed.

           Steve bakes, sweating in a rickety chair, his feet bound.
           Hector sits against the wall, hands bound.

           Steve looks to the wall clock: 2:33pm.

           Arturo plops a phone on the table, plugs it into the wall.
                                 STEVE
                        How many more phones can we get?

                                 GLORIA
                        You need more than one?

                                 STEVE
                        Want the two mil? Get me more phones.
                        And untie me. I like to kick my feet
                        up when I spit numbers.  

           A salty beat. Arturo tenses. Looks from Steve to Gloria.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                               (
                                                )
                                in total control
                        I said: do you want two million
                        dollars or what?

           Gloria signals calm to the room.

                                 GLORIA
                        Give him what he wants.

                                 STEVE
                        And a Nerf football. Get me a goddamn
                        Nerf football.

           QUICK CUTS OF THE SMUGGLERS SETTING THE ROOM:

           -- Gerardo and Arturo dragging in boxes of intercom phones.

           -- Setting the phones on the table, unfurling their cords.

           -- Flipping through phone instruction booklets.

           -- Running cables across the room.

           -- Gerardo sweeps a mouse out of the room, shuts the door.

           The clock shows 2:59pm.

           Arturo stands, handgun drawn, beside where Hector is bound.

           Untied, Steve kicks up his feet as he squeezes an off-brand
           squishy football. Five dormant phones in front of him.

                                 STEVE
                        Our target is ten million and two
                        million. Ten million a year. Two
                        million dollar signing bonus.

           Steve turns to Gerardo and Gloria.
                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Which goes to you. Ten million to
                        Hector, minus my five percent. Five
                        hundred thousand, enough to keep my
                        operations afloat. You guys get a
                        payday, Hector's family a new life,
                        and I keep my agency. Everybody wins.

           A beat. Steve looks to Gloria.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        We're gonna start.

           Steve grabs a phone. Dials a long number.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Hello, S-S-I...

                                 STEVE
                        We're all set up. Any calls waiting?

                                 BRANDY
                        Not yet. Stand by.

           Steve sits back in his chair.

                                 GERARDO
                        What's happening?

                                 STEVE
                        No one wants to be first.

           Gerardo absorbs this.

           Silence. Until finally...

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        I've got Carl Pohlad on line one.

           (Note: Lots of phone calls coming. Intercut as necessary.)

           Steve picks up phone two, keeping phone one to his ear.

                                 STEVE
                        Carl! How's the weather in Minnesota?

                        I don't doubt it.

                                 TWINS OWNER
                        With Kirby gone, we're looking for
                        another bat. You know what it's like
                        to raise a family in the Twin Cities?

                                 STEVE
                        What's your offer, Carl?

                                 TWINS OWNER
                        Five years. Three million a year.

                                 STEVE
                        Signing bonus?

                                 TWINS OWNER
                        Half a million.

                                 STEVE
                        Sorry Carl... that won't cut it.

                                 TWINS OWNER
                        What's your client think?

           Steve looks at Hector.

                                 STEVE
                        He thinks he trusts my judgment.

                                 TWINS OWNER
                        Okay, Steve.

           Steve places phone two back while talking into phone one.

                                 STEVE
                        Anyone on hold?

                                 BRANDY
                        No.

           Gerardo's focused on the phone that Steve just hung up.

                                 GERARDO
                        What was the offer?
                                 STEVE
                        It doesn't matter.

           Gloria pulls a Glock from her waist, and BANG! Fires it at
           the wall right behind Steve, who JUMPS.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Jeez!

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        The hell was that?

           A cluster of roaches trickles out from the blasted wood.

                        When Gerardo asks you a question, you
                        answer it.

           Steve's shaking now, but tries to play it cool.

                                 STEVE
                        Three million a year. Half a mil
                        signing bonus. They're always gonna
                        start low. It's how this works.

           Before Gloria can react:

                        John Hart, Indians. Line two.

           Steve grabs the phone.

                                 STEVE
                        John! Finally returning my call...

                        Yes, Steve. We are definitely
                        catching those vapors.

                                 INDIANS GM
                        It's about what I'd be giving Hector.
                        A spot in the best lineup in
                        baseball. A lineup that happens to be
                        full of Spanish-speaking players.

                                 STEVE
                        Give me a number.

                                 INDIANS GM
                        Three years. Four million a year.

           Steve's face falls.

                                 STEVE
                        No thanks.

                                 INDIANS GM
                        We'd give him a signing bonus, too.

                                 STEVE
                        I've got another call.

           Dejected, Steve hangs up.

                        Any other calls?

                        We're not getting shit.

           Gerardo crosses his arms, impatient.

                                 STEVE
                        Anyone, Brandy?

                                 BRANDY
                        Nope.

           A long silence.

                                 GERARDO
                        You said this would be a bidding war.

                               (
                                then, to Gloria
                                               )
                        I say let's waste this piece of shit
                        and do the negotiating ourselves.

           Steve braces himself, squeezing the base of the phone tight,
           readying to make a panic move.

           Gloria looks at Steve. She's thinking.

                                 HECTOR
                        Please.

           All eyes swing to Hector.

                                 HECTOR (cont'd)
                        Put your faith in Steve. He got us
                        this far. Just give him some time.

           Gerardo looks at Gloria...

           She looks at Steve... then at Gerardo... and back to Steve.

                                 GLORIA
                        Let's hurry this up.

           Steve can breathe again.

                                 STEVE

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Wally's on.

                                 STEVE
                        Say we're giving each team a chance
                        to bid. Then tell him the Cubs are
                        the high bidders. Then hang up.

                                 BRANDY
                        You want me to just hang up on the
                        Cardinals' front office?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes I do.

           Steve rests the phone on his shoulder. Squeezes at his foam
           football, absorbing the stares from around the room. 

           After a few moments, Steve puts the phone to his ear. Waits.
                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Done. Now what?

                                then

                        Oh shit, Wally's calling back.

           Steve picks up the phone.

                                 STEVE
                        Wally! Talk to me.

                                 DOYLE
                        You're that nut in Mexico I've been
                        hearing about.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm also the guy you low-balled at
                        the Winter Meetings.

           Doyle grimaces, recalling--

                                 DOYLE
                        Right. Nice hearing from you. What's
                        this I'm hearing about the Cubs?

                                 STEVE
                        I just spoke with Ed Lynch. He's
                        pretty excited about Hector.

                                 DOYLE
                        The Cubs can't afford Hector.

                                 STEVE
                        Could be a good fit. Plus, Hector's
                        got a hard-on for Chicago. He's
                        touring Wrigley on Monday.

                                 DOYLE
                        I'm trying to figure out if you're
                        looking to screw me.

                                 STEVE
                        How? By giving away free intel?

           A beat.
                                 DOYLE
                        The Cubs are actually serious?

                                 STEVE
                        They're all in.

                                 DOYLE
                        I'll call you back.

           Steve readies himself, gingerly picks up phone two.

           Steve pumps his fist quietly.

                                 STEVE
                        I appreciate the offer. But I can't
                        accept at this time--

                                 GEORGE STEINBRENNER
                        --it's New York, Mr. Santos. You
                        can't put a price on that.
                                 STEVE
                        Unfortunately, the price is all I'm
                        interested in right now. I hope I'll
                        hear from you again.

                                 GEORGE STEINBRENNER
                        You sure do.

           Steve regards the rest of the room.

                                 STEVE
                        Five and a half with a one mil bonus.
                        We're getting there.

           Gerardo and Gloria relax. Hector takes a breath.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Two calls. Cardinals and Red Sox.

                                 STEVE
                        Cardinals first. And just put all the
                        calls through. We're set up like a
                        telethon over here.

           Steve signals Arturo to assist with the phones. Arturo looks
           to Gloria, who nods. He pulls a chair beside Steve.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Line three.

           RINGGGGGGG.

           Steve reaches for phone three, as a tiny roach crawls on the
           table. He internalizes his disgust, snatches the phone.

                                 STEVE
                        Hello?

                        I wager the Cubs can't top six mil a

                        million dollar signing bonus.

           Steve relaxes. This is getting fun.

                                 STEVE
                        Lovely offer, but Cubs have you beat.

                                 CARDINALS GM
                        Really?

                        Guys like Hector come around once a
                        generation. Talk soon.

           Steve hangs up phone three as Arturo hands him phone two.

           INT. RED SOX OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

           The RED SOX GM (37) and an AIDE hover over a speaker phone.

                        How much did George offer you?

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 STEVE
                        With respect to George, I can't say.

                                 RED SOX GM
                        Fair enough. Seven million, three
                        year deal. One million signing bonus.

                                 STEVE
                        Hector's got a family. He needs a
                        longer-term deal at market value.

                                 RED SOX GM
                        George offered more than that?

                                 STEVE
                        I didn't say that.

                                 RED SOX GM

                        Best offer so far is six million a

                                 GERARDO
                        They offered two million dollars as a
                        bonus? That's for us. Take that deal.

                                 STEVE
                        Why take it when we can get more?

                                 GLORIA
                        More for you or more for us?

                        More for all of us.

           Gerardo looks at Gloria. She nods.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Brandy, let em loose.

           RINGGGGGG! Phone two and phone four.

           Steve snatches up phone two, as phone four rings twice,
           three times and...

           A fourth time. We're wondering why Steve and Arturo have
           their jaws wedged open, until we see--

           Perched on the handle of the phone, a plump, winged beetle.

           Arturo hovers his hand just above it, until--

           SPLAT! Gerardo bare-hands the receiver.

                                 GERARDO

                                 STEVE
                        Really?

           After a moment's hesitation, Steve takes the slimy phone,
           wiping the cockroach guts off his hand.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Jackie. Hey.

                        gonna work out for us.

                                 JACKIE
                        Do what?

                        The you-and-me thing. You asked if
                        we're dating. The answer is yes.

           A beat. Gloria and Gerardo are staring at Steve.

                        It's a negotiating tactic.

                                 JACKIE
                        Can we maybe table this conversation?
                        My bosses are gonna be calling you.

                                 STEVE
                        Great. Any idea what--

                                 JACKIE
                        I have no clue.

                                then
                        Please be careful.

                                 STEVE
                        I know what I'm doing.

                                 JACKIE
                        I really don't think you do.

                        Ed Lynch, line three. He's not happy.

                               (

                        I gotta get yelled at by the GM of
                        the Cubs. I hope I hear from you
                        again before the end of this.

           Steve exchanges phone two for phone three.

                        Ed! How's it--

                                 CUBS GM
                        Shut the fuck up with your phony
                        slick-speak. You goddamn used me.

                                 STEVE
                        C'mon man. It's not like that--

                                 CUBS GM
                        --don't "c'mon man" me. Everybody
                        knows how you got Hector. You'll get
                        a nice fee for this one, but it's all
                        dirty money and you know it.

                        Dodgers on the line. Fred and Peter.

           Steve hangs up one phone and grabs the other.

                                 STEVE
                        Fred, Peter! Talk to me.

           INT. DODGERS OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

           The GM FRED CLAIRE (late 50s), sits alongside owner PETER
           O'MALLEY (late 50s). They've waited for this.

                                 DODGERS GM
                        Ready to do some business, Steve?

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 STEVE
                        Let's.
                                 DODGERS GM
                        We all know Los Angeles is the place
                        for Hector. So let's say eight mil a
                        year for four years and a million
                        dollar bonus and call it a day.

           Steve looks at Gerardo and Gloria. Nods.

                                 STEVE
                        Love the numbers. We're almost there.

                                 DODGERS OWNER
                        Almost?

                                 STEVE
                        I need a solid ten and two.

           A beat.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Please. I don't have much time here.

                                 DODGERS GM
                        We think we put up a really generous
                        offer. Especially for you, man.

           This triggers something in Steve.

                                 STEVE
                        You're right. It's more than fair.
                        And I'm respectfully declining your
                        more than fair deal right now.

                                 DODGERS OWNER
                        Think it over.

           Click. Steve slams down the phone and sits back.

                                 STEVE
                        Here's the situation. We've got four
                        teams in play. Yanks, Cardinals, Red
                        Sox, Dodgers. They all got spending
                        power and a reason to want Hector.
                        Now it's about who gets us to the
                        magic number.

           Gerardo and Gloria take this in.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Any calls, Brandy?

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Nothing right now.
           Steve squeezes at his football.

                                 STEVE
                        Get me the Indians.

           After a moment:

                                 INDIANS GM
                        Stevie! Is Hector ready to play with
                        his compadres?

                                 STEVE
                        Um, he might be. I got a number for
                        you and if you match it, he's yours.

                                 INDIANS GM
                        Go ahead.

                                 STEVE
                        Eleven million per year, two and a
                        half million signing bonus.

                                 INDIANS GM
                        You're dreaming.

                                 STEVE
                        That's market value right now.

                                 INDIANS GM
                        Oh yeah? Then why call me?

                                 STEVE
                        Professional courtesy.

                                 INDIANS GM
                        Know what? I'm out of this.

                                 STEVE
                        John--

           Click.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Shit.

           Phone two rings. Steve perks up, grabs it.

                                 DOYLE
                        I can do nine and one.

           RINGGGG!
                                 STEVE
                        Wally, this isn't one of your
                        "standard deals." My best offer right
                        now is nine and two. Can you top it?

           Arturo picks up phone three.

                                 DOYLE
                        I think that's too steep for us.

                                 ARTURO
                        Someone named Steinburner.

                                 STEVE
                        Brenner. Steinbrenner.
                                back into phone
                               (
                                               )
                        Yanks wanna play. Call back if you
                        wanna play with them.

           Steve exchanges phones.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Mr. Steinbrenner!

                                 GEORGE STEINBRENNER
                        Santos. Listen up. I'm gonna give you
                        an offer. It is generous, and it is
                        final. Understand?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GEORGE STEINBRENNER
                        Eight and a half million a year for
                        five years, two mil signing bonus.

           Steve thinks a moment. Makes eye contact with Gloria.

                                 GLORIA
                        What is the offer?

           He tactfully waves her off.

                                 STEVE
                        Mr. Steinbrenner, while that is a
                        fantastic offer, I need ten million a
                        year with a two million dollar bonus.

           A brief, disbelieving beat, then:

                                 GEORGE STEINBRENNER
                        You stupid cocksucker. You'll never
                        do business with the Yankees again.
           Click.

           Steve puts the phone back slowly, his face ashen.

                                 GLORIA
                        What was the offer?

                        Are the Red Sox calling?

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        I don't think they're interested any
                        more now that the Yankees are out.

                        Two million.

           A longer beat.

                                 GERARDO
                        Two million is what we need.

                                 STEVE
                        What about what I need? We wouldn't
                        be here if I didn't get Hector off
                        that island. I left Cuba in a goddamn
                        love boat. I'm getting my fee.

           Silence.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Brandy! Anything?

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        No.

           Steve calms himself.
                                 GLORIA
                        Get the Yankees back on. Tell them
                        you'll take that deal!

           Steve sags his head.

                                 STEVE
                        I can't. They pulled out.

           A beat. 

           Gloria tosses a cordless phone to Arturo, who steps outside.

           Gerardo rises from his chair, withdraws his firearm and
           SWACK -- pistol-whips Steve. Blood streams from his nose.

           Steve writhes in pain, sleeving some blood off.

                                 BRANDY
                        I have, umm--

                                 STEVE
                        Which team?

                                 BRANDY
                        Not a team.

                                 STEVE
                        Who?

                                 BRANDY
                        Celia Gonzalez.

           A beat.

                                 STEVE
                        Put it through.

           Steve grabs phone one.

                                 CELIA (O.S.)
                        Please Steve. Finish the deal.

                                 STEVE
                        Great to hear from you.

           A heavy beat. Steve briefly hones his eyes at Hector.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Don't worry. We're real close.

                        Make the deal or they'll kill us--
           Click. The line goes dead.

           On the other end of the line, Brandy is sheet-white.

                        That was... a friend from the Expos.
                        He read the news. We're a huge story.

                                 GLORIA
                        No... that was Celia Gonzalez.

           Hector perks up. Looks at Steve.

                                 HECTOR
                        Celia? What did she say?

           A beat. Arturo returns, holding the cordless phone.

                                 STEVE
                        She said she’s okay.

                                 HECTOR
                        Don't you fucking touch her!

           Steve, avoiding Hector's teary glare, speaks into the phone:

                                 STEVE 
                        Get me the Cardinals. Wally Doyle.

           Steve slowly picks up phone two.

                                 DOYLE
                        This is Wally.

                                 STEVE
                        Hector likes what the Cardinals have
                        to offer.

                                 DOYLE
                        Good. We're in agreement there.

                                 STEVE
                        I need ten and two from you.

                                 DOYLE
                        George didn't get you there, huh.
                                 STEVE
                        Bright lights, big media market--
                        just not ideal for him--

                                 GLORIA
                        Less talking, get a number.

                                 HECTOR
                        Steve! Close the deal!

           Gloria places the barrel of her gun to Steve's temple.

                                 DOYLE
                        New York not "ideal?" Steve, what are
                        you up to--?

                                 STEVE
                        You've got the purse. Give me ten and
                        two and we'll get this done.

           A beat.

                                 DOYLE
                        No.

                                 STEVE
                        No?

                                 DOYLE
                        You sound desperate.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm not desperate.

           He eyes the handgun pushed against his head.

                                 DOYLE
                        Well, go make it with someone else.
                        The Cardinals are out.

           Click. Steve replaces the receiver, solemn.

           He looks at the rest of the room.

                                 STEVE
                        We're down to two teams.

           The room tenses.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        When I'm on the phone, trying to make
                        a deal, I have a modest request:
                        don't point a gun at me.
           Gloria and Steve are in a heated stare down.

           Gloria blinks, slowly lowers the gun.

           Steve rubs his temple, a barrel-sized imprint on his skin.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Brandy... get Jackie Stone.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Line two.

           Steve takes the phone.

                                 JACKIE
                        I don't think they can afford your
                        asking price.

                                 STEVE
                        I need you to try talking to them.

                                 JACKIE
                        They're in a closed meeting and if
                        they wanted my opinion, they would--

                                 STEVE
                        You're the only member of the Dodgers
                        to see Hector up close.

           No response. Steve turns to Hector. Fear in his eyes.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        I gotta close this thing. Please.

           A beat.

                                 JACKIE
                        I could lose my job over this.
                               (
                                                  )
                                then, after a beat
                        I'll take a walk down the hall.

           Click.

                               (
                                to Gloria
                                 STEVE
                                         )
                        I've got an insider in the Dodgers
                        organization. They'll go for it.

                                 GERARDO
                        Two million for us. Or we take over.
                        And you're in the ground.

           Steve nods.
                                 STEVE
                        Brandy, anything?

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        No.

           A beat.

                                 STEVE
                        Try the Red Sox.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Red Sox said they're pulling out.

                                 STEVE
                        Shit. Shit. Shit!

           Steve hammers the phone into the table.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Steve. Steve!

           Steve puts the phone back to his ear.

                                 BRANDY
                        Morgan Group is on. Andrew Sacks.

                                 STEVE
                        What the fuck?
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Put him through.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - THE MORGAN GROUP - CONTINUOUS

           Andrew leans over a speaker phone while a couple well-
           dressed PARTNERS linger.

                                 ANDREW
                        Cuba, huh? Hell of a move. I gotta
                        hand it to you, you've got hustle.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Steve straightens his posture.

                                 STEVE
                        I'm under the gun. What do you want?

                                 ANDREW
                        We want you back. With Hector. We'll
                        make it worth your while.
                                 STEVE
                        But... you sued me.

                                 ANDREW
                        What if we took care of all those
                        legal debts and made you partner?

           Steve thinks on this for a moment.

                                 STEVE
                        And if I say no?

                                 ANDREW
                        I know for a fact the Dodgers are
                        your best bet right now. But they
                        have the purse for just one right-
                        fielder. Which is why I'm dropping
                        the asking price for Nelson Rojas.

           Steve tightens his grip on the phone. Fuming.

                                 ANDREW (cont'd)
                        I make one phone call to Fred and
                        Peter and they'll pull your offer.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        So, whattya say?

                                 STEVE
                        I say: fuck off.

           He slams the receiver down, and brings it back to his ear.
           Gloria and Gerardo stare at Steve, quizzical.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Old business.
                               (
                                into phone
                                          )
                        Brandy, get me the Dodgers. Now.

           A beat.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Brandy--

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Tried them. We're on hold.

                                 STEVE
                        Shit.

           Gerardo stands. Takes out his pistol and walks to Steve.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        I'm asking you for time.
                                 GERARDO
                        You've been asking for that already.

                                 STEVE
                        We're close.

                                 GERARDO
                        Not close enough.

                                 STEVE
                        I need minutes.

                                 GERARDO
                        Last time you made a call you fucked
                        it up. Now no one is calling!

                                 HECTOR
                        Don't shoot!

           Gerardo wheels around.

                                 GERARDO
                        Speak one more time, and I'll slice a
                        finger off your throwing hand.

           INT. DODGERS OFFICES - WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dodgers BRASS, including the Owner and GM, huddle around a
           wood-laminate table, in serious talks, when they hear--

           --high-heels CLICK-CLONKING on the marble floor. All heads
           swivel to... Jackie, standing there.

                                 JACKIE

                        I just spoke with Hector's agent and
                        he says the Cardinals are all in at
                        ten and a half, but he'll settle for
                        ten so Hector can play in LA.

                        The Cubs? That story's just a plant.

                                 OWNER
                        We can have a proven All-Star in
                        Nelson Rojas for cheaper.

                                 JACKIE
                        Rojas is hiding a knee injury.

           The Owner looks to the GM, who can only shrug.

                        a physical. But he will need surgery.

           Jackie now has the room.

                                 JACKIE (cont'd)
                        Hector's got baseball in his blood.
                        He sleeps in his batting gloves. I
                        just scouted him. The guy's a tank!

                        He's not perfect. A raw talent. But
                        he's a grinder. Likable. Fan-
                        friendly. He's an investment, I know.
                        But we're going to lose him if you
                        don't get on the phone and bid now.

           The owner looks to the phone, poker-faced.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Gloria takes the phone from Steve's hand, sets it down on
           the table. Gerardo grips his pistol.

                                 GERARDO
                        Time's up. Let's go, start walking.

           Steve grips the foundation of a phone, tangles a cord around
           his neck with the receiver dangling at his mouth.

                                 STEVE
                        I just wanna know--

           Steve starts spinning, the cord now cocooning him.
                                 GERARDO
                        The fuck you doing? Drop it and--

                                 STEVE
                        --I wanna know your next steps after
                        you shoot me. Literally, what are you
                        going to do?

           Gerardo tries to pry the phone from Steve's hands.

                                 GERARDO
                        Drop the phone and start walking!

           But Steve is stuck, held hostage inside the phone's wires. 

           Gerardo haphazardly yanks at the cord around Steve's neck.

                                 GLORIA
                        Don't unplug it!

           JUST THEN: the faint sound of YELLING through the phone--

           --Gloria lifts the receiver, brings it to Steve's ear...

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        We've got the Dodgers on the line!

                                 STEVE
                        Dodgers! They called!

           Gerardo hesitates. Lowers his gun.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Is it Fred? Peter?

                                 BRANDY
                        The Dodgers aren't on the line.
                        Just... buying you some time.

           Steve tries not to react. Starts to untangle the wires.

                                 STEVE
                        Good. Put them through.

           He grabs phone two. Takes a seat, still untangling.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Now, about that signing bonus...

                                 BRANDY
                        Right, okay. Let's just say they're
                        thinking about it. Sell me.
                                 STEVE
                        He's got... a great spirit. Upbeat.

                                 BRANDY
                        Okay.

           Steve and Hector make eye contact.

                                 STEVE
                        He's a good guy, too. That I can
                        vouch for. I haven't always treated
                        him well, but he's a true class act.
                        And he doesn't deserve this.

                                 BRANDY
                        That was really nice, but the Dodgers
                        are on the line, for real.

           Steve tries to play it cool.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, the owner on line three?

           Gloria and Gerardo look at each other, puzzled.

           Steve frees his body from all remaining cords. He slams down
           phone two, grabbing phone three.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Hello.

                                 DODGERS GM
                        Steve. We've got an offer for you.

           Steve squeezes at the foam football, silently praying.

                                 DODGERS MANAGER
                        And it's a final offer.

                                 DODGERS GM
                        Ten million a year for four years.
                        One point five million signing bonus.

           Steve's face falls.

                                 DODGERS GM (cont'd)
                        How's that sound?

                                 STEVE
                        Lemme put you on hold a sec.

           He hits the mute button.
                                 GLORIA
                        What is the offer?

                                 STEVE
                        Bonus is one point five million.

                                 GLORIA
                        We need two.

           Steve unmutes the phone.

                                 STEVE
                        We need a two million dollar bonus.

                                 DODGERS GM
                        Not gonna happen. Sorry, Steve.

           Steve mutes the phone... and shakes his head.

           Gerardo steps to Steve, presses his gun against his head.

           Steve looks from the gun, to Gloria, to Hector. He knows
           what he has to do...

                                 STEVE
                        My share.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        It's half a million. I give you that,
                        plus the signing bonus, you get two
                        million.

           Gerardo looks at Gloria.

           She nods.

           Steve lets out an audible sigh. He unmutes the phone.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Okay, one point five. We have a deal.

                                 DODGERS GM
                        Fantastic, Steve! When you get back
                        to LA we'll celebrate.

                                 STEVE
                        Sure thing.

           Click. Steve turns to Hector.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        You're gonna be a Dodger.

           Relief fills the room. Guns fall.
           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Gloria and Gerardo watch as Hector steps onto a prop plane.
           Once inside the plane, Hector turns around.

                                 HECTOR
                        What's gonna happen to Steve?

           The question drifts in the air. The PILOT shuts the door.

           INT. AIRPORT GATE - DAY

           A sign comes into focus. The words: WELCOME TO LOS ANGELES

           Hector follows a sea of TRAVELERS as they dribble towards a
           barricade where LOVED ONES hold signs. His eyes scanning.

                                 CELIA (O.S.)
                        Hector!

           Hector turns to see Celia, healthy and unharmed, little Iván
           in her arms, wearing the biggest smile of her life.

           Hector dodges around the barricade, and they embrace.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Steve leans against the wall. Famished, eyes bloodshot. A
           full glass of water before him, untouched.

           In the corner of the room, Arturo babysits his every move.

           Gloria comes in. Rare smile.

                                 GLORIA
                        It happened this morning. One and a
                        half million to our account.

           Gloria tosses Steve a bottle of imported spring water. He
           quickly uncaps it and gargles it down.

                                 GLORIA (cont'd)
                        You can go.

           Steve stands slowly and slinks toward the door.

                                 GLORIA (cont'd)
                        Remember, the remaining five hundred
                        thousand. Or we'll send for you.

           Steve nods, goes out the door...
           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRLINER - DAY

           Wild turbulence. Jittery PASSENGERS. While...

           Steve sleeps soundly in his middle seat.

           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRLINER - LAX AIRPORT - DAY

           Steve watches the blur of the landscape as his plane lands
           on the runway, until the plane rolls to a gentle halt.

           INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - DAY

           Steve steps through the front door of his house. He looks
           around. It all feels... weird.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Steve takes the longest shower of his life.

           INT. STEVE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Steve sits there. Depressed. His answering machine blinks
           with messages.

           Brandy comes in. Looks at Steve, judging. Then hugs him.

                                 BRANDY
                        For a minute I thought you died.

                                 STEVE
                        So did I. Thanks for holding down the
                        fort. Listen -- I'll write you a
                        killer recommendation letter.

                                 BRANDY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 STEVE
                        I gave up our commission. Was this
                        not abundantly clear to you?

           A beat.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Before you pack up, I need you to
                        wire the five hundred thousand--
                                 BRANDY
                        Listen to your messages.

           Brandy hits the answering machine. Beep.

                                 ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
                        Hi Steve, this is Peter Sanders, VP
                        of Marketing for Adidas. Real quick,
                        does Hector have a shoe sponsor yet?

           Steve’s face lights up.

           Beep. Brandy presses the machine again.

                                 ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Mr. Santos, Tony Callahan from
                        Chevrolet here--

           She hits it again. Beep.

                                 MESSAGE
                        This is Roger Deeds from Meineke--

           Beep.

                                 STEVE
                        Endorsements.

                                 BRANDY
                        Eighteen offers so far.

           Steve takes this in.

                                 STEVE
                        Let's go out for lunch today.

           Brandy steps to the stairs. Steve follows, but stops.

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Go ahead. I just gotta do something.

           Steve returns to his desk. Picks up the phone, dials. After
           a moment:

                                 STEVE (cont'd)
                        Hi mom.

           EXT. CITY OF BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

           CLOSE ON: a Cadillac. So new its plates are blank.

           SUPER: Two Months Later
           Behind the wheel is Steve, who maneuvers the sedan into a
           parking garage beneath a sparkling structure off Wilshire.

           INT. OFFICES - SANTOS SPORTS INTERNATIONAL - SOON AFTER

           Steve and Brandy lug boxes into a spacious office where a
           silver plate on the door reads Esteban Santos.

           Steve marvels at a new fax machine, a smile on his face.

                                 STEVE
                        You like the view?

           Steve points to the neighboring building visible through the
           corner window: The Morgan Group.

                                 BRANDY
                        No shit.

           They step closer. Through the window they can see him:
           Andrew Sacks, toiling away in his TMG office.

           Andrew looks up, eye contact is made. He does a double take.
           Steve clicks a remote, and the curtains automatically lower.

                                 STEVE
                        Yes shit.

           EXT. DODGER STADIUM - MAIN ENTRANCE - DAY

           Opening Day. Swarms of FANS overwhelm TICKET-RIPPERS as
           VENDORS push Dodgers merch, cotton-candy, and team guides.

           Plastered on the stadium forefront are enormous cut-outs of
           Dodgers players, including our Hector Gonzalez.

           INT. DODGER STADIUM - LAWRY'S PRIME RIB - LATER

           Steve enters the restaurant, dressed in a flashy suit. Big
           dopey smile on his face. A HOSTESS (20s) greets him, and
           leads him through the restaurant towards a private area.

           As Steve tails the hostess, the sound of a phone ringing.
           Steve stops and pulls out his cell phone:

                                 STEVE
                        It's opening day.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        Your lawyer's on the line.
                                 STEVE
                        We paid him. Like, weeks ago.

                                 BRANDY (O.S.)
                        It's not that. He says it's urgent.

           Steve squeezes his face.

                                 STEVE
                        Put him through.

           After a beat:

                                 LAWYER (O.S.)
                        Steve. Where are you right now?

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED BETWEEN STEVE'S LAWYER (50) AND STEVE:

                                 STEVE
                        Dodgers Stadium. Opening day.

                                 LAWYER
                        Look... I've been getting some calls.
                        From the Department of Justice.

                                 STEVE
                        Huh?

                                 LAWYER
                        The Attorney General's office. Are
                        you aware that it's a federal crime
                        to smuggle illegal aliens into this
                        country?

           Steve sucks in a breath.

                                 LAWYER (cont'd)
                        Steve?

                                 STEVE
                        ...This is insane.

                                 LAWYER
                        This is not gonna go away on its own.
                        I just need to know, are there any
                        witnesses who might be willing to
                        testify against you?

           A long beat.

                                 LAWYER (cont'd)
                        Are you there, Steve?
           INT. LAWRY'S PRIME RIB - DODGERS STADIUM - JUST AFTER

           Steve sits at a curtained-off booth, almost zombie-like.
           Next to him-- Jackie. Her hand clasped with his.

           Behind them: a view overlooking the outfield.

           A DODGERS EXECUTIVE is saying something to Steve...

                                 STEVE
                        Huh?

                                 DODGERS EXECUTIVE
                        Your man is on deck.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh. Great.

                                 JACKIE
                        Also-- I wanted to tell you. Hector's
                        signing opened the floodgates.

                                 STEVE
                        Floodgates?

                                 JACKIE
                        We hired a couple of new scouts. To
                        help dig up new treasure.

                                 STEVE
                        New treasure...

                                 JACKIE
                        I invited them today so you guys can
                        talk shop. I told them to look to you
                        first for representation.

           The booth curtain peels open.

           Steve turns around, and is completely spellbound at the
           sight of Gloria and Gerardo standing behind him.

           Steve watches as they exchange quick kisses with Jackie.

           He mechanically shakes the hands of the new Dodgers scouts.

                                 GERARDO
                        Mr. Santos. Pleasure. Gerardo.

                                 GLORIA
                        Gloria, hi. Seems like you caught
                        yourself a big fish.
           Gerardo and Gloria take their seats, directly across Steve.

                                 GERARDO
                        It's a goldmine down there. But not
                        anyone can just start digging and
                        call themselves a miner. There will
                        be practical -- and legal -- hurdles
                        to encounter.

           Gerardo and Gloria drill their eyes into Steve.

                                 GLORIA
                        That's where we come in. We excel at
                        taking such challenges and helping to
                        make them... disappear.
                                    )
                               (
                                then
                        Great job with Hector, by the way.

                               (
                                 GERARDO
                                raising his glass
                                                 )
                        To Steve!

                                 DODGERS EXECUTIVES
                        To Steve!

           Everyone but Steve raises their glasses.

           Steve just stares blankly, stupefied, horrified, as--

           A POP! AND THE ROAR FROM THE CROWD breaks his concentration.

           He looks on in awe at the fans-- CHILDREN cheering in their
           FATHERS' ARMS, their starry eyed faces, hands raised high.

           Steve slowly rises, his attention now on the field below,
           where Hector is trotting the bases--

           Watching the baseball he just smashed sail through the cool
           April air...

           Arching over the wall, towards the restaurant window--

           As we--

           FADE TO BLACK.
