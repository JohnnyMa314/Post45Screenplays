           THE FOLLOWING WORDS: This is a true story.

           FADE IN:

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - ESTABLISHING (1988) 

           Mansions. Palm Trees. Bentleys in the drive. The dream.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTRY CLUB - DAY (1988) VARIOUS SHOTS

           A beautiful rolling golf course. Pristine tennis courts. 
           Pools. Cocktails. Rich WHITE PEOPLE living the life.  

           INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Inside, UNIFORMED STAFF vacuum opulent locker rooms. They 
           clean framed photographs lining the walls: 

           PRESIDENTS. CELEBRITIES. ANCIENT TENNIS GREATS who’ve played 
           these courts. TILDEN. KRAMER. AUSTIN. SHRIVER. All legends. 
           All white. All viewed by:

           RICHARD WILLIAMS (45.) A tall, powerfully built black man 
           with broken teeth, a graying beard, a black eye, and a 
           lifetime of rejection and resentment.  

           TITLE CARD READS:         1988

           A WASPY RECEPTIONIST eyes him warily as he sits in the lobby 
           in a dirty t-shirt, easily mistakable for a vagrant.

           She’s clearly relieved when a TENNIS PRO arrives, approaching 
           Richard with a SHOPPING BAG. 

                                 TENNIS PRO
                        Sorry, Richard. Grounds crew threw 
                        out most of ‘em. I got a few here 
                        but they look pretty dead. 

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s ok. They ain’t dead to me. 

           Richard speaks with a garbled Louisiana drawl. He looks in 
           the bag. It’s filled with RATTY OLD TENNIS BALLS. 

                                 TENNIS PRO
                        Go on, take this too. We had a few 
                        extras. 

           The Pro extends Richard a gift. An UNOPENED CAN OF BALLS. 
           Richard takes it thankfully, and without shame.
                                 RICHARD
                        Thank you.

                                 TENNIS PRO
                        No problem. But gotta ask. What 
                        happened to the eye?

           Richard offers only his crooked smile and --

           EXT. TENNIS CLUB HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Exiting with his bounty, Richard heads to a PARKING LOT lined 
           with LUXURY CARS. Beamers. Bentleys. Mercedes. Porsches. 
           Richard arrives at his own.

           A shit-box. A burnt-orange 1977 VOLKSWAGEN BUS. Rusting and 
           falling apart. Richard tosses his haul in the back and --

           INT. RICHARD’S VW BUS - DAY

           Richard at the wheel, smoking a cigarillo, driving through 
           postcard California. Mansions. Gardeners. Money.  

           Behind him, we see: this van is a character itself. 

           Part mobile tennis clinic, part mobile home, it’s filled with 
           school books, fast-food wrappers and a ridiculous 
           accoutrement of tennis shit. Drill cones. Broken Rackets. 

           One of the seats has been removed to accommodate a liberated 
           shopping cart filled with hundreds of collected USED BALLS. 
           Like Richard, it’s both charming and intentionally ratty.

           He drives on to --

           EXT. VARIOUS COUNTRY CLUB TENNIS COURTS - DAY (VARIOUS SHOTS)

           -- where Richard collects USED BALLS from TENNIS PROS and 
           GROUNDSKEEPERS. He even plucks them from the trash as 
           ASTONISHED WHITE CLUB MEMBERS shake their heads in disbelief. 

           Each time, once they’re gathered, Richard returns to his VAN, 
           parked amongst the BEAMERS and tosses the balls in the cart. 
           Off the slam of the door we CUT TO --                 

           EXT. COMPTON CALIFORNIA - DAY

           A different world. A working class neighborhood made infamous 
           by gangs, drug wars, and NWA. Liquor Stores on the corners. 
           Drug-dealers on the streets. Cops prowling like sharks. 

           It’s all seen passing out the window of --
           I/E. RICHARD’S VW BUS - DAY

           Richard smokes at the wheel, taking it all in. He’d like to 
           wash it all away. He drives through it as we find --

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL COMPTON STREET - DAY

           Two young BLACK GIRLS (7 and 8) lugging PHONE BOOKS down a 
           rough and tumble residential street. 

           Both girls are adorable, in wild braids and glowing smiles. 
           The taller one carries THREE BOOKS. Not to be out done, the 
           little one carries FOUR, barely seeing over the top. 

                                 VENUS
                        Serena, what are you doing? Those 
                        books are as big as you are. 

                                 SERENA
                        No they’re not. I can do it. I can 
                        carry more than you. 

                                 VENUS
                        And break your back while you’re at 
                        it.

                                 SERENA
                        Wanna bet?

           The little one takes off running but her sister lets her win, 
           laughing as she goes. This is VENUS AND SERENA WILLIAMS. 

           Venus is eight but already tall and regal and preternaturally 
           self-possessed. 

           Serena is seven, both a princess and a Pit bull. Small and 
           muscle bound, she’s a ball of energy, confidence, with an 
           insatiable need for attention. She idolizes her sister.

           Winded, she reaches their neighbors’ door first. 

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        See. I told you I’d win.

                                 VENUS
                        Yeah you did. Guess you’re right. 

           They deliver a PHONE BOOK to the door of a MIDDLE-AGE BLACK 
           WOMAN in a house-coat. MS. STRICKLAND. She pays them.

                                 MS. STRICKLAND
                        Thank you girls. 
                                 VENUS AND SERENA
                        You’re welcome, Ms. Strickland.

                                 MS. STRICKLAND
                        You tell your Daddy, he’s working 
                        you too hard. That man is crazy. 

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        That man is what?

           They are all surprised to see Richard pull up in his VW BUS. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Girls. Get in the car. 
                             (to Ms. Strickland)
                        I don’t wanna tell you again. Don’t 
                        talk to them kids.

                                 MS. STRICKLAND
                        They oughta be playing. Not 
                        working. You pushing ‘em too hard. 

                                 RICHARD
                        They work as hard as they need to 
                        to stay off those streets. What 
                        corner’s your daughter working, Ms. 
                        Strickland? 

           That shuts her up cold. She gives Richard the finger and 
           storms off inside, slamming the door. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Come on girls. Time to go. These 
                        balls ain’t gonna hit themselves.  

           I/E. RICHARD’S VW BUS - DAY (MOVING)

           Richard’s at the wheel. Behind him, the girls do homework in 
           the backseat. (Venus: Paleontology. Serena: French.)

                                 VENUS
                        Where we practicing today, Daddy?

                                 SERENA 
                        Yeah. Where we practicing, Dad?

           Richard eyes her in the rearview, unhappy with her tone.

                                 RICHARD
                        At the Club. Where you think? 

                                 VENUS
                        Momma said not to go back to those 
                        courts. 
                                 RICHARD
                        Well your momma ain’t here, now is 
                        she? Y’all wanna practice or not? 
                        We behind on our plan already. 

                                 SERENA
                        But what if those guys are back?

                                 RICHARD
                        Then I’ll beat ‘em off again. 

           The girls exchange a knowing look. Laugh. 

                                 SERENA
                        Daddy! Those guys beat YOU up.

                                 RICHARD
                        Maybe. But that’s part of my plan. 
                        I’m just wearing ‘em down. One of 
                        these days they’ll get so tired of 
                        beating old me they’ll need a rest. 

           The girls laugh. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        See. What’d I tell ya? Musta tired 
                        ‘em out already. 

           Richard’s smiling as they arrive at -- 

           EXT. LYNWOOD PARK, COMPTON - DAY

           A small, municipal park which Richard lovingly, ironically 
           has dubbed: EAST COMPTON HILLS COUNTRY CLUB.

           Basketball Courts. Concrete Playgrounds. And two of the worst 
           kept TENNIS COURTS you’ll ever see which thankfully --

           Right now, are not occupied by the BLOODS who use them as 
           their own personal drug bazaar.

                                 RICHARD
                        Who’s ready to get to work?

           In clown-car fashion, the Williams gang unloads their tennis 
           gear from the van. TWO OVERSIZED TENNIS BAGS for the girls, 
           each bigger than they are. But no matter how small they are, 
           the girls carry their own gear. Richard’s orders. 

           They wheel out the SHOPPING CART full of used balls from the 
           back and like a group of tennis carnies, they approach --
           THE TENNIS COURTS

           These courts have since taken on legendary status but in fact 
           they are: 

           TWO UNKEMPT TENNIS COURTS. Nets sagging. Surface pock-marked 
           with gunfire, littered with crack vials and beer bottles. 
           Homeless men asleep along the fences. 

           Impervious to it all, the GIRLS begin their peculiar, let’s 
           say unorthodox, business of warming up. 

           Still dressed in their jeans, they jog and throw FOOTBALLS 
           and toss BROKEN RACKETS from the baseline as far as they can 
           in an absurd drill Richard’s concocted. It looks ridiculous.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Keep tossing ‘em girls. You got it! 
                        More arc! That’s how we get great!

           They keep at it while Richard goes about methodically 
           cleaning the courts. He wakes the HOMELESS MEN and escorts 
           them off. He sweeps the vials and bottles away with a BROOM. 

           He sets up CONES for drills and hangs HOMEMADE SIGNS: 

           If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.                     
           You are a winner
           Be humble - Say “Thank you.”

           Finally, they are ready to practice and with great fanfare, 
           Richard presents the BRAND NEW CAN OF BALLS. 

                                 SERENA
                        Where’d you get those?

                                 RICHARD
                        I got my ways. You don’t worry. You 
                        got fans in high places.

           Richard cracks the can which the girls sniff like fine wine. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        All right. Backhands first. Go on. 

           They race to the baseline and Richard begins to feed. Ball 
           after ball, the girls swing their hearts out, giving it their 
           all but -- it doesn’t look like Wimbledon. 

           Their rackets are as big as they are. Their strokes are wonky 
           and Richard is a goofy coach. He swings the racket like a 
           broken old man who just picked up the sport (which really he 
           did). It all feels like amateur hour only --
           Unlike most TENNIS DADS, Richard has only encouragement. When 
           Serena sails a ball over the fence, Richard applauds. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Great muscles Serena. 

           When Venus nearly takes off his head -- 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Great aim there Venus. 

           Whatever they do, he instills them with exceptional 
           confidence and we see it. There is something intangible here. 
           Though technically raw, it’s clear that even at 7 and 8, the 
           girls’ athleticism and drive is stratospheric.

           After Venus booms one particularly impressive smash --

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Boom! There you go! That’s 
                        Wimbledon right there. Come give me 
                        a kiss. Let’s call it a day. 

           The girls run over, planting two on his cheek as --

           EXT. COMPTON TENNIS COURTS, LYNWOOD PARK - AFTERNOON

           Practice complete, Richard padlocks the SHOPPING CART to the 
           fence and walks the girls back to the car. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You look great Venus, but you need 
                        to move your feet more out there. 
                        You keep that stance open like I 
                        showed. If you down on your feet 
                        flat like a 97 year-old person, 
                        you’ll never win Wimbledon.

                                 VENUS
                        Yes, Daddy. 

                                 RICHARD
                        And Meeka --
                             (Serena’s middle name)
                        -- you need to use more topspin on 
                        your forehand, ok? That’s why you 
                        keep whacking it over the fe-- 

           Richard’s stopped because they’ve arrived at the curb where 
           FOUR HARD-LOOKING BLOODS are mugging outside their van. 

           The leader of the group is a tall, baby-faced banger with a 
           Jeri-Curl and 49ers HAT. They call him KING.
                                 KING
                        Nigga, I thought we told you. Those 
                        courts is ours. You’re trespassing 
                        on our shit. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Well we done now, so you can have 
                        ‘em. We don’t need no trouble. 
                        Girls. Get in the car.

           The girls hop to it. Richard’s following behind only -- 

                                 KING
                        Nigga, I ain’t done with you yet.

           He’s stopped when King spins him around. 

                                 KING (CONT’D)
                        This here’s my office and you 
                        fucking with my business. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Well maybe you oughta to get a 
                        different line of work. 

                                 KING
                        This motherfucker.

           King laughs then CRACKS Richard’s face, knocking him down. 

                                 SERENA
                        Don’t you hurt my daddy! 

                                 RICHARD
                        Meeka, get in the goddamn car. 

           The GANG laughs, impressed as Richard struggles to his feet.

                                 KING
                        Tough little bitch. Now I’ll tell 
                        you one last time. You come here 
                        again, you ain’t walking out. 
                        Training days are done. 

                                 DODGERS HAT
                        The fuck you gonna do with that?

           A young Blood in a DODGERS HAT eyes the BROOMSTICK Richard 
           grips in his hands. King just shakes his head.

                                 KING
                        This Nigga’s crazy. That’s how you 
                        want it? That’s the way it’ll be. 
                        Yo, jack this fool, man. 
           Off Richard, steeling himself as they approach and --

           I/E. RICHARD'S VW VAN - EVENING

           Richard’s driving home. SUNGLASSES on. He’s black and blue 
           underneath. Bleeding badly. 

           Serena eats McDonalds in the back, sees him in the rearview.

                                 SERENA
                        You were right, Daddy. It took ‘em 
                        awhile, but they sure got tired of 
                        beating on you. 

           Despite the pain, Richard can’t help but smile as finally 
           they arrive at -- 

           EXT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOME - NIGHT

           HOME. 1117 East Stockton Street. A quaint, green, stucco one 
           story house marred by black graffiti. 

           Richard pulls up to see POLICE SIRENS at his neighbors’ door. 

           The aftermath of a CRASH raid. LA’S INFAMOUS SWAT AGENTS 
           strong arming a YOUNG BLACK MAN out the door while his 
           PARENTS SCREAM from the porch. The whole neighborhood watches 
           from their stoops. 

                                 MOTHER
                        He’s a good boy! Let him go. He 
                        didn’t do nothing. 

                                 CRASH AGENT
                        We’ll see about that downtown. 
                        Let’s go. Get your ass in the car. 

           Richard watches behind the wheel. 

                                 VENUS
                        What’s happening, Daddy?

                                 RICHARD
                        Nothing baby. Get your things.

           Richard escorts his girls through the sirens to their door. 
           MS. STRICKLAND calls out to Richard from her porch. 

                                 MS. STRICKLAND
                        Somebody oughta call the cops on 
                        you. 

           Richard just continues to his house, meeting eyes with the 
           COP. Trouble brewing when -- 
                                 BRANDI (O.S.)
                        Richard Williams. Get these girls 
                        inside. Leave that nonsense alone.

           ORACENE “BRANDI” WILLIAMS calls from the door. Brandi’s 41. 
           Tall. Proud. Fierce. Richard knows better than to disobey. 

           He leads the girls to their house, kissing his wife who takes 
           one look at his glasses and immediately knows the score. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        I told you not to go back to those 
                        courts, didn’t I?

           Off Richard, not ready to concede. He heads inside and --

           INT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOME - NIGHT

           Immediately, Venus and Serena are bombarded by their 
           siblings. THREE HALF SISTERS. YETUNDE (Tundi) 14. A rebel. 
           LYNDREA. 12. A princess. ISHA. 10. An athlete. 

                                 TUNDI
                        Come on, Venus. We’re about to 
                        start the talent show. 

           Serena takes off immediately running.  

                                 SERENA
                        I get to go first. I know what I’m 
                        singing. 

                                 LYNDREA
                        Let me guess. 

           In unison, her older sisters chime in together singing -- 

                                 ALL THE SISTERS
                        Because the Greatest love of all --

                                 SERENA
                        What’s so funny? It’s a great song.  

           They bust out laughing as Serena chases them down the hall. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Half hour. Finish your homework, 
                        then it’s time for bed. 

           The girls run off. Once the parents are alone -- 

                                 BRANDI
                        How bad is it? Let me see. 
           Reluctantly, Richard lets her remove his glasses. Flinches as 
           Brandi touches his wounds. His face is raw. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        You lucky you married a nurse. Go 
                        on and get dressed. I’ll get you 
                        some ice. At least you can stop the 
                        swelling. 

           We follow Richard to their small bedroom, where he begins to 
           change from his tennis outfit into a SECURITY GUARD UNIFORM.

                                 BRANDI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I told you. I don’t want you 
                        practicing at those courts. It’s 
                        bad enough they beat on you. What 
                        happens when it’s the girls?

                                 RICHARD
                        You think I’d let that happen?

                                 BRANDI
                        Richard, that ain’t up to you. 

           Brandi’s returned with a FROZEN BAG OF PEAS. She slaps it on 
           his face, roughly.  

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        You know what that boy was doing 
                        next door? Do you? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Selling rocks. 

                                 BRANDI
                        He was selling guns. Next door to 
                        our girls. I don’t want them living 
                        like this anymore -- and don’t tell 
                        me it’s making them tough, cause I 
                        don’t care about that. I care if 
                        they’re safe.

                                 RICHARD
                        Where we gonna go? This is our 
                        home. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Well how long can you live like 
                        this? Working all night. Coaching 
                        all day. Getting yourself beat and 
                        what for? We’re still just scraping 
                        by. I can’t do it anymore. 
                                 RICHARD
                        Baby, we can’t quit now. We got a 
                        prodigy on our hands. We just 
                        getting started. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Richard --

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m telling you. Venus is a star. 
                        She’ll prove the whole world wrong.

                                 BRANDI
                        Richard, she’s eight-years-old. 
                        What the hell’s she gotta prove? 
                        Don’t make this about you.

           That staggers Richard for a moment. He heads for the door. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        You wanna fight the world, you got 
                        something prove, fine, but don’t do 
                        it through them. I’m not risking 
                        their lives for that. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Fine. Fine! We won’t go back to 
                        those courts. We can get ‘em a 
                        coach. Bud Collins or Vic Braden. 
                        It’s time for that anyway. Venus is 
                        ready. She can practice with them.

                                 BRANDI
                             (laughs)
                        Oh yeah? You win the lottery? How 
                        you gonna pay for that?

                                 RICHARD
                        We won’t gotta. They’ll coach her 
                        for free. These girls’re so good, 
                        they might even pay us. 

                                 BRANDI
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        Richard --

                                 RICHARD
                        Don’t believe me?

                                 BRANDI
                        It ain’t me who’s gotta believe. 
                        These coaches want a blond with a 
                        pony tail. Not some little black 
                        girl from the ghetto. 
                                 RICHARD
                        They don’t know that they want it, 
                        but they will. You’ll see. Venus 
                        and Serena gonna shake up the 
                        world. 

                                 BRANDI
                        They are? Or you? 

           That stops him. Stung. He puts his arms around her. 

                                 RICHARD
                        They are. I know it. Least they 
                        better -- cause they ain’t making 
                        it as no singers.

           He’s laughing now because Serena can be heard, singing at the 
           top of her lungs. She’s no Whitney Houston.  

           Brandi laughs, softening in his arms and --  

                                 BRANDI
                        Go tell ‘em good night. I’ll get 
                        you something to eat. Can’t fight 
                        the world on an empty stomach. 

           They kiss. Richard heads off. Brandi watches, both inspired 
           and exasperated. She loves him, but he makes it hard. 

           INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM, COMPTON HOUSE - NIGHT

           The girls are performing for each other in their cramped 
           little bedroom when Richard appears in the door -- 

                                 RICHARD
                        All right girls. Lights out. Time 
                        for bed. 

           They dutifully comply, a few of them taking books and 
           flashlights along with them into bed.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        D’yall finish your journals? Write 
                        your plans for tomorrow? 

                                 ALL THE GIRLS
                        Yes, Daddy. We did. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Cause you gotta have a plan, right. 
                        Everyday. Else what do I say? 

                                 ALL THE GIRLS
                        You fail to plan. You plan to fail. 
                                 RICHARD
                        That’s right. And we ain’t failing, 
                        are we? 

                                 ALL THE GIRLS
                        No, Daddy. 

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s right. We going all the way 
                        to the top. Now who’s sleeping with 
                        Serena?

           Groans around the room. We understand why. One room. Five 
           girls. Four beds. It’s like the Waltons. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Tundi? 

                                 TUNDI
                        I had her last night. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Isha?

                                 ISHA
                        Do I have to? She snores. 

                          SERENA
                                                      ISHA (CONT'D)
           No I don’t. 
                                              Yes you do. 

                          SERENA
                                                      ISHA (CONT'D)
           No I don’t. 
                                              Yes you do. 

           Venus chimes in, silencing the fight. A pacifier. 

                                 VENUS
                        I’ll take her, Daddy. Come on, 
                        Serena. You can sleep with me. 

           Serena hoots and hollers. She’s like a puppy.

                                 RICHARD
                        Thank you, Venus. It ain’t gonna be 
                        like this forever. I promise. One 
                        of these days, they’ll be mansions 
                        for all. 

           Then he turns out the lights and shuts the door, lingering 
           for a moment in the hall, listening to their laughter. Off 
           that we hear --

                                 BUD COLLINS VOICE
                        ... and that’s why you want to 
                        pronate at the point of contact.
           INT. RICHARD'S VW BUS - NIGHT

           Richard’s driving, smoking a cigarillo. Out his windows, 
           BLOODS lurk on stoops. Addicts wander like phantoms in the 
           night. Richard drives through it listening to a tape.

                                 BUD COLLINS VOICE
                        If you look at the biggest servers. 
                        Sampras. Lendl. Connors. You’ll see 
                        the break of their wrists is like a 
                        smack. Like a high five. That’s 
                        what you’re looking for when you 
                        hit it. That pop. 

           The tape ends. Richard ejects it, riffling through the mess 
           on the floor to find another. There’s dozens down here, 
           scrawled in Richard’s chicken scratch with names like:

           “Wimbledon ‘87.” “Tracy Austin.” “Zina Garrison.”

           Richard selects one. Sticks it in. Listens as he drives.

                                 SAMPRAS’ VOICE
                        ... well I know a lot of guys use a 
                        western or semi-western on their 
                        forehand, but I’ve got a heavy 
                        stroke. I like a big runway so for 
                        me an eastern grip is just fine.

           SAMPRAS’S VOICE CONTINUES OVER: A MONTAGE.

           RICHARD CHECKS ON SECURITY GUARDS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS

           Richard makes the rounds, checking in on SECURITY GUARDS at a 
           handful of Compton establishments. 

           - A DRY CLEANER.
           - A CONSTRUCTION SITE. 
           - A CHURCH. 
           - A BANK.

           At each, Richard checks the alarms. Empties the trash. Wakes 
           his sleeping employees. At turns, mundane and dangerous work, 
           and Richard is tired of it. Montage ends as -- 

           INT. COMPTON GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

           Richard enters a Compton grocery, nodding to the GUARD eating 
           chips at the door, and heads toward the back where --

           INT. GROCERY STORE OFFICE - NIGHT

           Richard enters the cluttered little manager’s office and 
           plops down at the desk, exhausted. 
           For a moment, it looks like he might fall asleep but he 
           fights the urge. Instead, he turns on a light, takes out his 
           things, and gets to work. 

           Not billing or paperwork for his security company, but 
           Tennis. MAGAZINES. ORDER FORMS. INSTRUCTIONAL DRILLS. 

           With occasional GUNFIRE rattling the windows, Richard combs 
           through his research and begins to make a LIST:

           COACHES AND STAR PUPILS: Vic Braden. Bud Collins. Nic 
           Bolleittri. Mary Pierce. Tracy Austin. Etc.

           He writes down the phone numbers and addresses for each as we 
           pan across his desk to a COPY OF: WORLD TENNIS MAGAZINE.

           AN INSTRUCTIONAL ARTICLE. A PHOTO.

           JOHN McENROE and his CALIFORNIA TENNIS COACH. Imagine Elliot 
           Gould if he had thighs like cannons and a forehand that could 
           put you on your ass. 

           The legend reads: “WINNING WAYS: McEnroe and his LA coach 
           PAUL COHEN.” Off Richard’s list and PAUL’s face --

           EXT. BEL AIR COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           A sparkling California Golf and Tennis Club where we find 
           Richard on a pay phone in the parking lot. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Hello? -- Yes, I’m trying to reach 
                        Paul Cohen --  Richard Williams. 
                        Yes. I left a message last night -- 
                        All right. I can hold. 

           INTERCUT NOW WITH:

           INT. PAUL COHEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           PAUL COHEN (40), the burly tennis coach seen in the McEnroe 
           magazine spread, now in a leisure suit, picking up the phone 
           in the foyer of a very nice Brentwood house.

                                 PAUL
                        This is Paul.

                                 RICHARD
                        Paul, my name’s Richard Williams. I 
                        read about you in World Tennis 
                        Magazine and I got a couple girls I 
                        think you oughta see. 
                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Richard. I got your message. 
                        My girls are champs. That was you? 
                        How’d you get my number?

                                 RICHARD
                        Ted Hodges. At Paramount sports. 
                        He’s a friend. If it’s ok, I’ve got 
                        a video I’d like to send you. A 
                        video and a brochure for my girls. 

                                 PAUL
                        A video and what? 

           Paul’s distracted by his ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WIFE. Suitcases at 
           her feet, tapping her watch indicating: we’ve gotta go. 

                                 RICHARD
                        A brochure. A prospectus. Of their 
                        future earnings.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m sorry. Mr. Wilson -- Williams? 
                        This isn’t a good time. We’re 
                        leaving for a tournament. Just send 
                        me the tape. I’ll try and look at 
                        it when I’m back. Thanks. 

           Paul hangs up. 

                                 PAUL’S WIFE
                        Who was that? 

                                 PAUL
                        Some nutcase, I don’t know. 

           They grab their bags, head for the door. We end on:

           RICHARD, hanging up the pay phone in the parking lot. This 
           might be harder than he thought as we now hear --

                                 RICHARD (PRE-LAP)
                        Now I know what you’re thinking. 
                        This family’s from the Ghetto. How 
                        they gonna pay old me? Well don’t 
                        worry, Bud, we ain’t here to rob 
                        ya. We’re here to make you rich.

           INT. BUD COLLINS’S TENNIS OFFICE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A HOMEMADE PAMPHLET FULL OF NUMBERS, GRAPHS, and 
           CHARTS. The girls’ “FUTURE EARNINGS.” It’s in the hands of:
           BUD COLLINS (60), the Bob Hope of Tennis, listening to 
           Richard pitch his case.

                                 RICHARD
                        What you’re looking at there is a 
                        brochure I made with the wife. 
                        Inside you’ll see future earnings 
                        potentials for both girls. One for 
                        Venus. And one for Serena. 

           Off Bud, flipping through it amused and -- 

           EXT. ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY

           Richard is COURT SIDE at another FANCY CLUB showing his 
           brochure to another INCREDULOUS PRO. On court, a HULKING 
           JUNIOR is pulverizing tennis balls. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Now, Venus, she’ll probably win 
                        Wimbledon. She’s tall and fast and 
                        mean. But Serena -- she something 
                        like a pet bulldog. She never lets 
                        go. See they got all the talent. 
                        All they need now is the training 
                        and environment and coach. 

           Beat. The incredulous (white) pro gives Richard a once over. 

                                 INCREDULOUS PRO
                        And you want all this for free? You 
                        sure you have the right sport?

           Off Richard, disrespected as we cut to:

           EXT. HOSPITALITY TENT, ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY

           A swanky California country club event. CELEBRITY TENNIS 
           TOURNAMENT underway. Richard, somehow snuck inside, has 
           cornered ANOTHER TENNIS PRO with his pamphlet.

                                 RICHARD
                        We need a club. Training. Clinics. 
                        Everything a prodigy needs to reach 
                        their potential which is number one 
                        in the world, I promise you that. 
                        There’s no doubt about it.

           The TENNIS PRO, eager to extract himself, shakes his head.  

                                 TENNIS PRO
                        If I had a dollar for every crazy 
                        parent who told me their kids’ll be 
                        number one, I’d be a rich man. 
                                 RICHARD
                        You look pretty rich to me. 

                                 TENNIS PRO
                        Well, there you go. 

           He hands Richard back the pamphlet and hurries off as --

           EXT. ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY

           --- the BEWILDERED PRO hands his pamphlet back too. 

                                 BEWILDERED PRO
                        You ever consider basketball?

           INT. BUD COLLIN’S TENNIS OFFICE - DAY

           --- and back in Bud’s office, Bud shakes Richard’s hand.

                                 BUD COLLINS
                        I’m sorry. Good luck. You seem like 
                        a good guy but --

           INT. ANOTHER TENNIS CLUB - DAY

           --- and ANOTHER COACH turns Richard down. 

                                 ANOTHER COACH
                        I’m sorry. This isn’t a welfare 
                        office. We don’t do Pro Bono. 

           Off Richard, anger rising. Enthusiasm evaporating as finally -

           INT. CLUB HOUSE, COTO VALLEY C.C - DAY. VARIOUS SHOTS

           Richard’s seated in the lobby of a tony club. Tired and 
           defeated, looking up at the PHOTOS OF THE TENNIS GREATS 
           lining the walls he saw earlier.  

           KRAMER. CONNORS. MCENROE. All white. All smiling with a 
           JOVIAL, PORTLY COACH. 

           The same WASPY RECEPTIONIST hangs up the phone. Coldly --

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Williams? Vic’ll see you now.

           Aware of her ire, Richard rises; one last chance as we hear --

                                 RICHARD’S VOICE  (ON TAPE)
                        A few more. Down the line. That’s 
                        it. Look good, Vic, don’t they?
           INT. VIC BRADEN’S OFFICE - DAY 

           CLOSE ON A TV: A video plays. Venus and Serena hit in jeans 
           on the ratty court. Richard narrates OC operating the camera.

                                 RICHARD’S VOICE
                        We have your tape - TENNIS ALL THE 
                        WAY - and we have been viewing it. 
                        However, the tape says, you’ll be 
                        good by Friday, but guess what, 
                        Vic. We’ve got good by Tuesday. 
                        That’s how good your tape is. 

           In the office, Richard mouths along with his joke on screen 
           as VIC BRADEN (60’s) the legendary Junior Tennis Coach (seen 
           in the lobby PHOTOS) watches, speechless as the video ends.

                                 VIC
                        I guess you made this yourself?

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes I did, yes. When the girls were 
                        young, I had bought me a camcorder. 
                        And I would film myself in the 
                        mirror asking questions and doing 
                        things like that. And that’s what I 
                        did with the girls, here. I call 
                        that their media training. 

                                 VIC
                        Oh I see. That’s very industrious. 
                        And did you grow up around the 
                        game, Mr. Williams?

                                 RICHARD
                        No I did not. Where we’re from, 
                        where I grew up, tennis was not a 
                        game that peoples played. 
                             (before Vic can weigh in)
                        But I’m a terrific athlete and if 
                        I’m interested in a thing, Vic, I 
                        learn it. How it works. How the 
                        best people do it. That’s how I did 
                        with tennis and the girls. I made a 
                        plan for ‘em before they were born. 

                                 VIC
                        Before they were born?

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes sir. One for Venus. And one for 
                        Serena. First one was 85 pages I 
                        think. See I’m a master planner, 
                        Vic. No one gonna out plan me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        And our plan says now it’s time we 
                        come to you, so you can turn these 
                        girls into champions. 

           Vic’s flabbergasted. He looks at Richard, at the brochure. 
           Unfailingly nice, he wants to soften the blow but there’s no 
           need. Richard feels the hit coming. He stands up on his own. 

                                 VIC
                        How bout a free piece of advice?
                             (sure)
                        This deal you’re asking for, all 
                        this for free, Richard, no one is 
                        going to take that bet. See tennis 
                        is a technical sport. Probably the 
                        most. If you haven’t grown up 
                        around the game then --
                             (looking Richard over)
                        It’s like the violin. It takes 
                        hours and hours a day, year after 
                        year, tens of thousands of dollars 
                        in precise, expert instruction just 
                        to hold the racket right, and then, 
                        even then, even for a family with 
                        unlimited financial resources, the 
                        chances of achieving the kind of 
                        mastery and success you’re talking 
                        about -- with one kid, let alone 
                        two -- well, it’s like asking 
                        someone to believe you got the next 
                        two Mozarts in your house. It’s 
                        just very, very unlikely. I’m 
                        sorry. That’s just my two cents. 
                        Maybe you’ll prove me wrong. 

           Vic offers his hand. Richard takes it, gutted and -- 

           EXT. PARKING LOT, FANCY CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Flush with defeat, Richard exits the building where he finds 
           Venus and Serena, sitting by the courts doing homework. 

           They look up at him expectantly. 

                                 VENUS AND SERENA
                        How’d it go in there, Daddy? 

           Richard does his best to hide his disappointment, but the 
           girls know the score. This isn’t their first rodeo. 

           They grab their books and follow their father to the CAR. The 
           lone beater in the lot. Their place in the world couldn’t be 
           clearer and -- 
           INT. MCDONALD’S - NIGHT

           The entire Williams clan, five girls, two parents, eat dinner 
           at a booth in McDonald’s. Most of the family is joking 
           around. But we don’t share their mood or hear what they say. 

           We’re pushing in on Richard, thoughts far away, simmering 
           with frustration and anger and resentment.

           INT. RICHARD’S VW VAN - NIGHT

           The family drives home. Richard distant at the wheel, taking 
           in the neighborhood. The crime and poverty. He slows as he 
           drives past the courts. Anger rising behind his eyes and --

           Suddenly, he pulls over and gets out of the car.

                                 BRANDI
                        Where you going?

           He doesn’t answer, just grabs his BROOM from the back and --

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        Richard, what the heck are you 
                        doing? 
                             (to the girls, herself)
                        I tell ya, this man. 

           She’s shaking her head as she watches --

           EXT. PARK - THAT MOMENT

           -- Richard approaching the courts where he’s seen HIS 
           SHOPPING CART knocked over and crushed. His collection of 
           BALLS scattered across the courts in every direction.

           Fuming, Richard begins to pick them up when he spots:

           The BLOODS who beat him up earlier, clearly responsible for 
           this mess, gathered in the park by the courts, laughing. 

           Richard stares at them in fury. Enough’s enough.

           IN THE CAR: Brandi lights with fear as she watches -- 

                                 BRANDI
                        Richard don’t you do it.  

           -- Richard crossing the park toward THE BLOODS who mack on 
           some GIRLS. King turns as Richard approaches with the BROOM. 

                                 KING
                        Nigga, whatchu gonna do with --
           CRACK! Before he gets the rest out, Richard breaks the 
           broomstick across his jaw. King goes down hard as Richard 
           wails him again. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! A few more shots before-

           The OTHER BLOODS jump in, dropping Richard to the ground, 
           leveling him with HAYMAKERS. Stomping him senseless as --

                                 BRANDI
                        RICHARD!

           Brandi comes running from the car. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        Leave him alone. Get your hands off 
                        my husband!

           She pushes through the crowd to find Richard bleeding and 
           struggling to get to his feet. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        Richard, oh my god!

           She looks up at King who stands over them, fuming. 

                                 KING
                        I warned him. This ain’t a place to 
                        play.
                             (leaning over Richard now)
                        You hear me now, motherfucker. Stay 
                        - the - fuck - away.

           And then King rears back and CRACKS Richard a final time and 
           BOOM! LIGHTS OUT. Richard drops to the ground and we --

                                                              FADE OUT.

           FADE IN ON:

           YOUNG WHITE FACES LOOMING ABOVE US. 13-YEAR-OLD BOYS PUNCHING 
           AND YELLING. WE DON’T KNOW WHERE WE ARE AS WE FADE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           A new blur of faces hovering above us. Above Richard, 
           demolished in a HOSPITAL BED. Face like a punching bag. The 
           blurry figures float above, warping in and out of focus. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        ...his jaw is broken. At least five 
                        or six ribs. There’s blood in his 
                        urine. We need to sedate him. 

           A face leans into view. Brandi comes into focus. Crying. 
                                 BRANDI
                        Richard. Richard. Can you hear me? 
                        Richard, can you hear me?

           But she’s floating away. Richard’s mind’s faraway in --

           EXT. WOODS - DAY (RICHARD’S FLASHBACK DREAM) - 1955

           A Louisiana forest where EIGHT-YEAR-OLD RICHARD, tattered and 
           dirty, is getting the shit kicked out of him by a gang of 
           WHITE BOYS. 

           Young Richard puts up a fight but it’s futile. The boys CRACK 
           him with sticks, hit him with rocks, and scream in his face -- 

                                 WHITE BOY
                        This is what you get when you steal 
                        from my Daddy, boy!

           A fist flies violently toward his head as --

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Adult Richard jolts at the memory, drifting in and out of 
           consciousness.  His face, black and blue. His teeth broken. 
           He’s frightened and breathless, remembering --

           EXT. RICHARD'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 1955

           It’s dark by the time YOUNG RICHARD arrives home to a 
           tattered three room shack in a blighted part of town where --

           His mother, JULIA METCALF WILLIAMS, a cotton picker and a 
           titanic figure, spots him from the door. 

           His clothes are dirty. His face is bloody. From the look in 
           her eyes, we know they have been here before as --

           INT. RICHARD'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 1955

           Young Richard’s mother washes his wounds from a bucket on the 
           floor. No running water. No electricity. No father. No hope. 
           Just his mother and FIVE SISTERS watching from the door.

                                 RICHARD’S MOTHER
                        I don’t know what to tell you Sonny 
                        but you don’t let go of that anger, 
                        either this world’s gonna tear you 
                        up or you gonna tear up it.

           Young Richard looks at his mother, silent and defiant. She 
           goes on cleaning his wounds as --
           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Richard final wakes to find Brandi there, watching over him. 

                                 BRANDI
                        You OK? It’s just a dream. 

           But Richard’s not ok. He’s badly bruised, missing several 
           teeth, simmering with a lifetime of pain.

           I/E. RICHARD'S VW BUS - EVENING (A FEW NIGHTS LATER)

           Brandi drives a broken Richard home through Compton. 
           Richard’s eyes fixed out the windows. A reckoning brewing as -

           INT. WILLIAMS'S COMPTON HOME - NIGHT

           Gingerly, Brandi escorts him through the front door. But 
           Richard doesn’t waste any time --

           As soon as he’s home, he heads to the bedroom, riffling 
           through his closet. On the very top shelf, he pulls down a 
           SHOTGUN, loading it with shells as -- 

                                 BRANDI
                        Richard! What are you doing?

                                 RICHARD
                        Putting an end to this. I ain’t 
                        getting kicked around anymore.

           EXT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Richard blows out his door, into his van. Tossing the shotgun 
           beside him as he peels down the street. Brandi arrives at the 
           front door, desperate, but too late to stop him and -- 

           EXT. COMPTON COURTS - NIGHT

           The dealership’s open. The BLOODS are still here. King and 
           his CREW holding down the courts when -- DODGERS HAT shoots 
           King an elbow. Look over there. He’s pointing to:

           The street. Where the VW BUS pulls up. Richard getting out. 

                                 KING
                        This motherfucker. Nigga, you 
                        crazier than I thought. You sure 
                        you want more? You ain’t got your 
                        girls to protect you this time. 

           They’re laughing until they see the 12-GAUGE rise up in 
           Richard’s hand. CA-CHCK! They dive as he cocks the pump and --
           KABOOM! -- Richard fires a shot that screams past the 
           dealers, shattering a WINDSHIELD on the street.  

           The DEALERS scramble to their feet. Dodger’s Hat pulls out 
           his own GUN and levels it at Richard only - it jams! 

           And Richard’s still coming, pumping again. CA-CHCK! 

           Holy shit. The dealers take off running. As fast as they can. 
           Richard lumbering after them like a goddamn monster. 

           EXT. COMPTON STREETS - NIGHT

           Escaping the park, the GANG tears through the residential 
           streets of Compton.  

           Richard’s on their heels, Frankenstein-style. Stalking like a 
           killer as --

           The BOYS skid into an alley, bolting between houses. They 
           knock over trash cans that clatter in Richard’s way.

           They sprint toward a CHAIN LINK FENCE, all of them flipping 
           over it as --

           Richard’s stopped in it’s path. Too old to jump over. He 
           makes a decision. Cuts through the alley as --

           The bangers burst through a BACKYARD, coming to an 
           intersection. They seem to have lost him, but just to be safe 
           they split up. Three different directions. We stay with --

           DODGERS HAT who runs down another darkened alley. Alone. 
           Getting away. Feeling safe when --

           A PIT BULL leaps in his face. He stumbles back, about to be 
           mauled until the dog’s collared by its chain. 

           DODGERS HAT composes, catching his breath. Almost laughing to 
           himself. Then he turns a corner when --

           CA-CHCK! He looks up to see Richard in the mouth of the 
           alley, bearing down on him with his gun. Nowhere to run. 

           Richard closes in. 

                                 DODGER’S HAT
                        YO YO YO! Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! 
                        I’m sorry. We was playing. 

                                 RICHARD
                        We ain’t playing now.
           Richard steadies the gun. Fury in his eyes. About to jam the 
           trigger when from somewhere in the darkness --

           PTPTPTPTPPTPT! A MACHINE-GUN cracks, ripping like fireworks. 

           A DRIVE-BY in the night. Richard jolts at the sound, 
           listening as the BULLETS RIP and the TIRES SQUEAL AWAY and 
           then it’s silent. For a long moment until --

           A SCREAM shatters the night. Grief stricken and horrible.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        NOOOOOOOOOOO!

           It shakes Richard’s core. He turns back to his target only to 
           find -- he’s gone. The alley is empty. DODGERS HAT’s escaped. 

           On Richard, alone in the alley, catching his breath and --

           EXT. COMPTON STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard’s walking home. Concealing his weapon. Dawning with 
           relief when he arrives upon -- 

           THE SOURCE OF THAT SCREAM. THE AFTERMATH OF THE DRIVE-BY. A 
           BLOODBATH ON THE STREETS. 

           A BODY lays lifeless on the asphalt. Families gather around 
           as the first SIRENS arrive, swirling in the mist. 

           Richard watches from afar as A MOTHER pushes through the 
           crowd and falls at the feet of the BOY, crying inconsolably.

                                 MOTHER
                        NO NO NO. MY BABY. MY BABY. THEY 
                        SHOT UP MY BABY!

           And now Richard sees who it is. It’s KING. Richard staggers, 
           backing away, slowly at first, then running now, fleeing the 
           tragedy which he was very nearly the cause of and -- 

           INT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOME - NIGHT

           The house is dark and the family’s asleep. Richard creeps 
           back in. Moving to his closet to replace his gun when --

           Brandi turns on the lights. Awake and waiting. 

                                 BRANDI
                        What did you do? Richard --

           Slowly, once the GUN’s safely away, he turns. 
                                 RICHARD
                        Nothing. But I almost did.

           Exhausted, he sits on the bed and hangs his head. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        It’s over. I’m done. 

           He lights a cigarette as Brandi comes to his side. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Nothing’s over, baby. We’ve been 
                        through this before. The cleaning 
                        company. The car wash. The cement 
                        trucks. Things fall apart, you 
                        think of something else. This time 
                        ain’t no different. You’re an 
                        entrepreneur. There’s a million 
                        ideas.

                                 RICHARD
                        Ain’t no other idea. This was it. 
                             (then)
                        Just once in my life, I wanted a 
                        shot. To prove once and for all 
                        Richard Williams ain’t no fool. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Baby, you worrying about that and 
                        you letting them win. Don’t. 

           But Richard can’t hear that yet. He smokes, shaking his head.

                                 RICHARD
                        I shoulda never started this in the 
                        first place. I let them girls down.

           Brandi tries to console him, but Richard stands, exiting to -

           INT. RICHARD’S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

           A small room with a desk covered with Richard’s various get-
           rich-schemes. A car wash. A cement mixing business. His  
           TENNIS PLANS. 10 YEARS OF IT. Magazines. Schedules. Drills. 

           Richard regards it with a very heavy heart. Years of work. 
           Years of effort. Over. Richard despairs and then he notices:

           A LIGHT BLINKING ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE.

           Richard presses it. The voice that comes out is a life raft. 
                                 PAUL (ON TAPE)
                        Richard. Paul Cohen here. Sorry 
                        it’s taken me a few weeks to get 
                        back to you. I’ve been in Wimbledon 
                        with Mac and well -- I just had a 
                        chance to look at your tape. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s raw. The girls need work but, 
                        looks like you might have something 
                        here. If you’re still looking for a 
                        coach, I’d be interested in taking 
                        a look. You got my number. Let me 
                        know if you wanna bring ‘em by. 

           The message ends. On Richard, floored. A second chance.

           INT. RICHARD'S VW BUS - DAY

           Dressed in their best tennis whites, Venus and Serena look 
           out the windows as Richard drives through a HARD SCRABBLE 
           NEIGHBORHOOD.

                                 VENUS
                        Where is this place, Daddy? I 
                        thought we were going to play. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I wanna show you something first.

           EXT. SKID ROW - DAY

           Street life. JUNKIES. VAGRANTS. HOMELESS. HOOKERS occupying 
           pre-cool downtown LA. It might as well be NEW JACK CITY. 

           Richard pulls his van over to a corner and the girls look out 
           like they are on safari. 

                                 RICHARD
                        See these people here? You see how 
                        they living? You see their hair? 
                        You think this was their plan? You 
                        think they got dignity or respect?

                                 VENUS AND SERENA
                        No, Daddy. 

                                 RICHARD
                        No. They broke down. Used drugs. 
                        Now they don’t got no hope. You 
                        gonna live like that? 

                                 SERENA AND VENUS
                        No, Daddy!
                                 RICHARD
                        That’s right. Good. Now let me show 
                        you something else.

           I/E. RICHARD'S VW BUS / PARKED - LATER

           Another location. Richard and the girls look out the windows.

                                 RICHARD
                        Now how about this? You wanna live 
                        like that?

           Reveal that they are parked in Beverly Hills. Palm Trees 
           overhead. Mansions all around. LANDSCAPERS in the yards. 

                                 SERENA AND VENUS
                        Yes, Daddy. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You like these houses? Big, aren’t 
                        they? How about that one? You think 
                        they got respect?

                                 SERENA AND VENUS
                        Yeah Daddy. Real nice.  

                                 RICHARD
                        Well one day, you’ll have it. 
                        Beverly Hills. Hollywood Hills. 
                        Any of these hills. You want 
                        respect, you gonna get it, cause 
                        you got a plan. Wanna show these 
                        people that?

                                 SERENA AND VENUS
                        Yes, Daddy. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Good. So what we waiting for then? 
                        Let’s go out there and show ‘em. 

           Off the girls, spilling over with determination and --

           EXT. BEL AIR SANDS HOTEL - DAY

           A sprawling Bel Air Golf Resort, nestled in the hills beneath 
           the Getty. (NOTE: This is now the LUXE SUNSET.) 

           On Richard’s van as it rolls through the gates and -- 

           EXT. BEL AIR SANDS HOTEL - DAY

           Amped with nerves, Richard and the girls approach the tennis 
           courts where they find:
           TWO MEN sweating in the midst of a heated practice, crushing 
           the ball with absolute fury. The Williams’ slow in awe as 
           they realize what they’re watching:

           JOHN MCENROE getting all he can handle from a tall, curly-
           haired TEENAGER with a serve like Howitzer. 

           The drill ends when the teen blasts an ace down the T, 
           leaving John whiffing at the air. Paul watches close-by. 

                                 PAUL
                        Told ya. He’s a smoker. All right. 
                        Get some water. Take ten.

           The players break as Paul approaches the Williams’ family, 
           watching with their jaws dropped. 

                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        You must be Richard. Paul Cohen. I 
                        guess these are the champs. 

           They all shake hands. The girls smile ear to ear. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You girls know Mac right? Young 
                        buck here’s Pete Sampras. Not so 
                        bad himself.  

           The famous players wave from the bench. 

                                 MCENROE
                             (to the girls)
                        Paul says you’re pretty good. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh they’re better than good. 
                        They’ll be number one in the world. 

           McEnroe laughs, walking away. 

                                 MCENROE
                        OK. Call me in ten years. Nice to 
                        meet you girls.
                             (to Paul)
                        See you in a few. 

           Paul watches as Mac walks away, toward his stunner of a WIFE 
           and their TWO YOUNG SONS by the pool. (This is Tatum O’Neil).

                                 VENUS
                             (star-struck)
                        That’s - that’s - I know her.
                        She was in Bad News Bears!  
                                 PAUL
                        She’s bad news all right. You wanna 
                        hit a few? I don’t have much time. 

           The girls head to the court where Richard leads them through 
           their curious routine, throwing their rackets into the sky. 

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s great, Venus! Great!

           SAMPRAS joins Paul, watching this absurdity in silence. 

                                 SAMPRAS
                        This guy for real? 

           Paul has no idea. One way to find out. He steps on the court. 

                                 PAUL
                        All right, Richard, that was -- 
                        interesting. Have a seat. Let’s see 
                        what you girls got. 

           Reluctantly, Richard abides but before he does, he pulls the 
           girls aside for one last pep talk. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Just go out there and have fun.
                             (of Mac)
                        Few years from now, he’ll brag 
                        ‘bout meeting you. 

           The girls smile and Richard steps off as they take the court. 

                                 PAUL
                        All right. Let’s start off with 
                        some forehands. First one’s down 
                        the line. 

           Paul feeds them balls and the GIRLS begin to practice. They 
           come out smoking. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Venus cracks a heater. 
           Serena cracks another. Venus unleashes a winner. Serena 
           unfurls another. Again and again and again as --

           All around the court, attentions begin to tune to the CANNON 
           BLASTS exploding from these little girls. 

           Mac watches. Pete watches. Tatum watches. Richard watches. 
           Paul watches as - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! - the girls smash balls. 

           The last ones hit the fence. Paul’s hopper is empty. A long 
           silence then -- 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Let me ask you something girls.
           The girls jog to the net, unclear of his reaction.  

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        What do you want from all this? I 
                        know what he wants (Richard) but 
                        what about you? 

           The girls look at each other. It’s Venus who speaks up.

                                 VENUS
                        I wanna win Wimbledon, I guess. As 
                        many times as anyone’s won it. 

                                 PAUL
                        And you think you can do it?

                                 VENUS
                             (nods)
                        I know I can. 

                                 SERENA
                        I do too!

                                 PAUL
                        I bet you do. Go pick ‘em up. I’m 
                        gonna talk to your Dad. 

           The girls hop to it, collecting the balls as Paul approaches 
           Richard with the verdict. His face is a mask, unreadable. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You taught ‘em all this?
                             (Richard nods)
                        Well, I gotta be honest. Their 
                        strokes are a mess. Their 
                        footwork’s raw. They’re behind on a 
                        lot but --
                             (on Richard as he waits)
                        You’re not crazy, Richard. I’ve 
                        seen a lot of young players and 
                        I’ve coached some of the best and 
                        your girls -- they’re probably the 
                        best raw talent I’ve ever seen. 

           On Richard, as that lands. A flood of emotion and vindication 
           pouring out as -- 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        We can figure out the financials 
                        later, but if it sounds good to 
                        you, I’d love to help you turn 
                        these girls into champs.
           Richard meets eyes with the girls, unable to contain his 
           emotion, already starting to cry, as --

           INT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOUSE - DAY

           Brandi’s cooking dinner for the older sisters when Richard 
           and the girls arrive home. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Well?

                                 RICHARD
                        Looks like we got a coach. 

           The whole room jumps up and down, exploding in celebration. 

           Richard and Brandi find each other and embrace. A long 
           awaited moment of relief. Out of earshot from the kids:

                                 BRANDI
                        He’s gonna take ‘em for free?

                                 RICHARD
                        Well -- almost. There is one thing. 

           Off Richard, eyes falling to Serena and -- 

           EXT. COMPTON STREETS - MORNING

           A new day breaking over the quiet streets of Compton where --

           EXT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOME - MORNING

           Richard and Venus load their tennis gear into the van. 
           Serena, dressed for practice too, watches sadly at the door.

                                 SERENA
                        It’s not fair. I wanna come too.

                                 RICHARD
                        I know you do, Meeka but you just 
                        gotta wait. Mr. Cohen can’t do two 
                        for free. Don’t worry -- we’re 
                        gonna tape everything. You’ll watch 
                        ‘em at home. Won’t miss a thing. 
                             (Serena is furious)
                        Now go on. Practice with your mom 
                        and don’t forget to move your feet. 

                                 SERENA
                        Where we even supposed to play?

           Richard yells back on his way to the car. 
                                 RICHARD
                        At the club! I talked to them boys. 
                        We ain’t got no problems anymore. 

           Serena’s in disbelief as Richard joins Venus, waving in the 
           car. They pull off. Serena watches them go as Brandi appears, 
           wearing TENNIS ATTIRE herself. She knows how Serena feels.

                                 BRANDI
                        Your sister’s older. She’s gonna 
                        get things first but don’t worry. 
                        Your time’ll come. 
                             (Brandi pulls her in)
                        Now come on. Let’s hit the courts. 
                        We got work to do.

           Off Serena, who smiles despite her frustration as we hear --

           EXT. PRIVATE BRENTWOOD HOME - DAY (TO ESTABLISH)

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Cannon-like blasts echoing above --

           A beautiful, Brentwood Ranch House. Richard’s BUS outside. 
           The POUNDING STROKES and SQUEAKING SNEAKERS sound from --

           THE BACKYARD COURT

           -- where Paul leads Venus through grueling drills. Cones. 
           Suicides. Lob retrieves. Venus sweats as Paul barks orders.

                                 PAUL
                        What you’re going through is the 
                        Paul Cohen First Strike Strategic 
                        Tennis System. It’s gonna make you 
                        a killer. First time Mac tried it, 
                        he didn’t last 10 minutes. 

           Venus sees why -- chasing down a lob -- gasping for air as --

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Come on! Don’t wait! Again!

           Venus looks to Richard, smoking by the courts. He nods - you 
           got it. She wipes away sweat, sprinting back to the net and --

           FOREHAND DRILLS

           Paul’s feeding Venus at the baseline. Forehand down the line. 
           Sprint back to the T. Forehand down the line. Sprint back to 
           the T. Again and again and again. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Keep that stance open, Venus. 
                        Remember open stance. 
                                 PAUL
                        Richard - don’t. My time. My rules. 
                        If you want, maybe wait outside. 

           Richard puts up his hands, deferring for now.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                             (to Venus)
                        You listen to me. When you’re here, 
                        I’m the coach. Forget open stance. 
                        Hold your head right at contact. 
                        Now go. 

           He tosses the ball and Venus bolts after it and -- 

           BACKHAND APPROACH DRILL

           Paul leads Venus through a classic backhand approach shot, 
           attack the net drill, feeding one after another.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna turn you into the 
                        ultimate competitor. Don’t sit back 
                        on the baseline. You’re not here to 
                        dance. Put these girls away. 

           And Venus does -- crashing the net -- crushing a volley and --

           SERVE AND APPROACH DRILLS

           Venus smashes serves from the baseline. Paul’s in her ear. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You wanna be the best? You wanna be 
                        Tracy Austin? You will. You’re a 
                        killing machine. You’re a goddamn 
                        attack dog, so bite! 

           Venus does, obliterating a serve. Richard watches as it 
           scorches the line and --

                                 RITA (O.S.)
                        Looking great. Hungry anyone?

           RITA CORNYN, the home owner, LA PHILANTHROPIST, and Paul’s 
           friend, calls from the Pool house. 

                                 RITA (CONT’D)
                        I made up some sandwiches.

           EXT. PRIVATE BRENTWOOD HOME - LATER

           Paul, Richard and Venus have lunch by the pool. A TV in the 
           POOL HOUSE plays a TENNIS MATCH. Richard keeps looking over --
                                 PAUL
                        -- so we gotta keep hammering those 
                        forehands, right. Tracy Austin. 
                        Tracy Austin. You get a chance, end 
                        the point. These girls you’ll be 
                        playing -- they play patty-cake. 
                        Don’t engage. Now, have you thought 
                        about which tournaments you want to 
                        play first? I’ll look at the 
                        schedule. I’ve got friends in the 
                        SCJ’s so --

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s Juniors? I’m not sure we 
                        interested in that. 

                                 PAUL
                        Why not? You gotta play matches. 
                        Get experience. Get your ranking 
                        up. See some competition. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Yeah, but she’s got church and 
                        school and her sisters -- they’ll 
                        be time for matches when she’s pro. 

           Long beat as Paul processes this and then -- 

                                 PAUL
                        Well Richard -- that’s just the 
                        dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. She 
                        doesn’t play matches, she’ll never 
                        get tested. She’ll never get 
                        ranked. She’ll never get great. 
                        It’s as simple as that.
                             (to Venus)
                        You wanna just practice or you 
                        wanna go beat some girls?

                                 VENUS
                        Can I play, Daddy? Please?

           But Richard doesn’t answer. His focus glued to the TV WHERE:

           A TENNIS MATCH PLAYS. THE FRENCH OPEN JUNIOR CHAMPIONSHIPS. A 
           brown-haired, 12-year-old American girl is pulverizing the 
           ball, blowing her opponent out of the water.  

                                 RICHARD
                        Who the heck is that?

                                 PAUL
                        Jennifer Capriati. Now she’s a 
                        freaking killer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Won the Orange Bowl last year in 
                        San Diego. US 18 and Under -- she 
                        was twelve. 

           That gets Richard’s attention. They all watch in awe for a 
           moment as Jennifer destroys the other girl on the court. Her 
           BOX cheers in the stands. Among them --

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        That’s her coach, Rick Macci. He’s 
                        in Florida. Nice guy. Not as dumb 
                        as the rest. 

           On screen, RICK MACCI jumps up and down. Rick’s 35, with a 
           mustache and a bowl cut and the demeanor of a Labrador 
           Retriever. He’s seated next to STEFANO CAPRIATI. The 
           opposite. Tennis Dad numero uno. A villain. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Word is she’s joining the tour next 
                        year, but she already signed a big 
                        deal with Diadora. Two Million 
                        bucks. Without a single pro match.
                             (beat, pointed)
                        She played Juniors.

           Off Richard, point taken. Hard to argue with that as we’re --

           EXT. LOS ANGELES HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           CLOSE ON A BANNER announcing: 

               SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUNIOR OPEN TENNIS TOURNAMENT

           It flaps above an LA HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT packed with --

           RICH WHITE TENNIS PARENTS escorting little PRODIGIES toward 
           the courts where a TOURNAMENT is underway. A few of them 
           gawking in curiosity as they pass --

           A growling VW BUS, idling loudly beside the luxury sedans.

           I/E. RICHARD'S VW VAN - SAME

           Inside, the entire Williams family, looks out nervously at 
           their surroundings. Venus, dressed in her best tennis outfit, 
           listens stoically to her father at the wheel. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Now don’t be surprised if people be 
                        staring. They ain’t used to being 
                        around good looking people like us 
                        and they sure ain’t seen no little 
                        girl with a backhand like you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Just keep your head high and your 
                        feet on the move. Let them worry 
                        bout the rest. Y’all wanna show 
                        them what’s what?

           Venus nods, steeling her nerves. Here goes nothing as -- 

           EXT. LA HIGH SCHOOL TENNIS COURTS, JUNIOR TOURNAMENT - DAY

           Richard and the ENTIRE WILLIAMS CLAN approach the HIGH SCHOOL 
           TENNIS COURTS where a JUNIOR TENNIS TOURNAMENT is under way 
           and as Richard predicted -- the record scratches. 

           TENNIS PARENTS and their TENNIS KIDS stop dead at the sight 
           of the Williamses. The only black faces in the crowd. 

           Richard, undeterred, leads his family to the SIGN IN TABLE.

                                 RICHARD
                        Richard Williams. This is my 
                        daughter, Venus. She’s playing her 
                        first match here today. 

           The TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR double takes at the family. Recovers.

                                 TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR
                        Well, welcome Venus. Good to meet 
                        you. Let’s find your draw. 

           The director flips through files as Richard cops the scene:

           Stern parents. Serious kids. Not youthful fun, but high 
           stakes, high pressure competition. Richard takes note. 

                                 TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        All right Venus, you’re all set. 
                        You’re on Court 4. It should be 
                        open if you wanna warm up. 

           Venus smiles thanks and the family heads off through the 
           still staring crowds toward Venus’s court. When they arrive -- 

                                 BRANDI
                        Good luck, honey. Just go out and 
                        have fun. 

                                 SERENA
                        Kick her butt. 

           Venus smiles and enters the court as Serena remains behind 
           with her family, flashing with envy as --
           EXT. TENNIS TOURNAMENT TENNIS COURT - DAY

           Venus enters the court where her opponent, STACEY, a TALL TEN-
           YEAR-OLD BLOND, in high-end TENNIS GEAR unpacks a racket from 
           her pricey tennis bag that holds six identical others.

           Venus unpacks her secondhand bag and beat-up racket on the 
           bench. She’s clearly intimidated. 

           Richard beckons her over to the fence where he’s set up. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Don’t you be scared. You just go 
                        out there and have fun. You Venus 
                        Williams. You gonna win Wimbledon. 
                        These people got nothing on you.

           He blows her a kiss and then joins Brandi, sitting with the 
           other parents in the bleachers. Both of them nervous as -- 

           A LINE JUDGE approaches the players with a new can of BALLS. 

                                 JUDGE
                        All right, girls. Meet at the net. 
                             (as the girls arrive)
                        Once more to go over the rules. 
                        Best of 3 sets. I’m covering three 
                        courts, so keep your own score and 
                        call your own shots. Other than 
                        that, just have fun and good luck. 

           The Judge departs leaving Venus and Stacey at the net. 

                                 STACEY
                        Ok. Up or down? 

                                 VENUS
                        What?

                                 TRACY
                             (the racket you idiot)
                        Up or down?

                                 VENUS
                        Oh. Up, I guess.

           Tracy spins the racket. Probably cheats. 

                                 TRACY
                        Down. I choose. You can serve. 

           She hands Venus the balls and heads to her side of the net, 
           already playing head games. Venus takes it personally.  
           She heads to the baseline, mad, trying to gather herself. The 
           noise of the MATCHES on the neighboring courts is deafening. 
           The eyes of white parents, intimidating. It appears that -- 

                                 STACEY’S DAD
                        She’s nervous Stacey. Take a step 
                        up. Probably doesn’t have much of a 
                        serve. 

           Richard glares at STACEY’S DAD, a COUNTRY CLUB A-HOLE, 
           goading from the stands. Brandi puts a hand on her husband. 
           Don’t. Richard restrains. For now. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Have fun out there V. That’s why 
                        we’re here.  

           Venus breathes deep. This is what she’s been training for. 
           Finally ready, she steps up the baseline, tosses a serve and -

           BANG! She unleashes an ace that nails the corner so fast 
           Stacey barely even sees it. She doesn’t even swing.

           Richard cheers in the stands. 

           Venus smiles in relief, stepping back up to the line where --

           She uncorks another, ripping an ace passed Stacey so fast it 
           nearly scares her to death. Who is this girl?

           The whole crowd is stunned. Stacey’s father included. He 
           looks over at the Williamses cheering to see --

           Richard, meeting his eyes. A shit-eating grin on his face --

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Maybe she oughta take a few more 
                        steps up. 

           This time, Stacey’s father says nothing. He shrinks away as 
           Richard turns back to the court, smiling proudly at Venus.  

           No denying it now. A star has arrived. 

           She steps up to the line, full of confidence and swagger, 
           about to blow the ball off the court as we smash into: 

           A MONTAGE OF JUNIOR TENNIS TOURNAMENTS

           -- where Venus storms the Southern California Junior Tennis 
           Circuit, kicking LILY WHITE ASSES up and down the coast. 

           -- She plays a PRETTY BRUNETTE who’s got feet like cement. 
           Venus drop shots her savagely and takes the match. 
           -- She plays a STOCKY REDHEAD who chases balls like a 
           terrier. Venus wrong foots her cleverly, taking the match. 

           -- She hits forehands, backhands, overheads, volleys, 
           destroying all comers with an all court game that is complete 
           and annihilating and has --

           -- Venus raising trophies at tournaments after tournament. 
           UCLA. USC. Palas Verdes. San Diego. At each and every stop, 
           her family’s there for the ride. 

           -- They cheer from the stands among ever-growing crowds. 

           -- They ride through the night like a traveling band, 
           sleeping little, doing homework, eating McDonalds, rolling 
           eyes as Richard sings Motown at the wheel. 

           -- They celebrate as a family as the victories rack up but --

           -- It isn’t all gravy. As the season goes on, Serena grows 
           angry. Hitting solo on walls, impatient for her chance to 
           compete and --

           -- As the competition toughens and the pressure increases, 
           Richard grows unsettled with the world they have entered and 
           the parents around them. Hyper-engaged maniacs who live or

           state. The SC JUNIOR SECTIONAL 10 and UNDER Championships.

           THE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH AT THE PALAS VERDES COUNTRY CLUB.

           -- where Venus is locked in an endless rally with a strong 
           TOWERING BLOND (Jamie) who looks like she’s 17-years-old. 

           The CROWD hangs on every stoke, finally exploding when --

           Jamie shanks a forehand wide, gifting away the game, the 
           match, and the tournament. 

           Venus jumps up and down, shakes her hand at the net, and 
           raises the trophy to the applause of the crowd. 

           Richard cheers with his family. He couldn’t be prouder or 
           more confident of his goal but when his eyes fall on --

           Jamie, crying on the bench, berating herself furiously --

           Richard’s unease is clear. This isn’t how it should be and --

           EXT. PALAS VEDRES COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - LATER

           Venus is carrying the CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY as the Williams 
           family walks back to the van. Everyone is excited only -- 

           Richard is unsettled. Unsettled by this place. Unsettled when 
           he alone spies:

           Jamie and her tennis-suited FATHER arguing by their car. 

                                 FATHER
                        If you’re not gonna try, then why 
                        the hell are we here? You think 
                        you’re gonna get into college like 
                        that?

                                 JAMIE
                        I was trying, Dad.

                                 FATHER
                        Really? Well you coulda fooled me. 
           That brings the tears. Jamie gets in the car, slamming the 
           door. Her father’s left outside, exasperated. Full of regret.

           Richard watches as he moves to his car, deeply troubled and -

           INT. RICHARD’S VW BUS - DAY

           Still uneasy, Richard drives home. His family is piled in the 
           back, passing around the trophy, giddy for Venus. 

                                 SERENA
                        Were you nervous out there?

                                 VENUS
                        No! That last girl was probably 18 
                        and I still whooped her anyway. 
                        Why’d I be nervous? 

           Most of the family laughs. Richard does not. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Winning’s enough. You don’t gotta 
                        brag. 

                                 VENUS
                        I’m not bragging, Daddy, it’s the 
                        truth. Want the proof?

           She shows him the TROPHY, dancing around. The girls laugh. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Yeah, you won. She lost. We were 
                        there. Now it’s over. Important 
                        thing is, you done your best. Same 
                        as her. Now I don’t wanna hear 
                        another thing about it, understand?

                                 VENUS
                        Yes, Daddy. OK. I just -- 
                             (can’t help herself)
                        If that was her best, she needs to 
                        practice some more.  

           That gets a few laughs. Even a ha-ha from Richard who spots a 
           7-11 ahead and pulls into the lot.

                                 RICHARD
                        All right, big shot. Here’s 10 
                        bucks. Go practice getting your 
                        sisters something to drink.

           The girls shout out their orders and Venus takes the money 
           and runs off. As soon as she’s out of the car, Richard throws 
           the van in reverse, backs out, and starts to drive away. 
                                 BRANDI
                        Richard. What are you doing?

                                 RICHARD
                        She wants to brag, let her brag how 
                        she walked home three miles. We 
                        don’t do that in this family. 

           Brandi shakes her head.

                                 BRANDI
                        Richard. RICHARD! 

           Finally he stops the car, still seething. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter with you?

           Richard’s not ready to say. Running after them, Venus finally 
           catches up with the car and climbs inside.  

                                 VENUS
                        Where you going? I thought you were 
                        leaving without me. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I tried. Thank your mom. Don’t be 
                        bragging again. Now give me my Coke 
                        and my change.

           She does. Richard pulls out. Brandi watches him, concerned.  

           INT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOME - NIGHT

           It’s night by the time the VAN arrives home. The Family’s 
           unloading when a car pulls up behind. THE POLICE. 

                                 OFFICER 1
                        Richard Williams.

           Richard turns as TWO LAPD OFFICERS approach from their car. 

                                 OFFICER 1 (CONT’D)
                        Can we talk to you a minute?

                                 RICHARD
                             (to Brandi)
                        Go on, take the girls inside. 

                                 OFFICER 2
                        Actually, ma’am. We need to speak 
                        to them too. Might be better if we 
                        all go in together. 
           Aware of the NEIGHBORS now watching from their porches. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Whatever it is, you can speak to us 
                        here. We got nothing to hide.  

           The OFFICERS share a look. Whatever you want.

                                 OFFICER 1
                        We got a call that there’s some 
                        trouble in this house. That you’ve 
                        been rough with these kids. We’ve 
                        come to take a look. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Gotta call from who?

                                 OFFICER
                        I’m not at liberty to say. 

           But Richard already knows. The OFFICER eyes the rackets. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Little late for practice, isn’t it?

                                 BRANDI
                        We’re coming from a tournament. 

                                 OFFICER
                        What about school?

                                 RICHARD
                        What about it? Girls, tell these 
                        men how you doing in school? You 
                        can brag about that. 

                                 VENUS
                        I get all A’s. 

                                 RICHARD
                        And what about you?

                                 SERENA
                        I get all A’s too. 

                                 RICHARD
                        And what are you are gonna be when 
                        you grow up?

                        I’m gonna be a Veterinarian. Or 
                        maybe teach French.

                                 VENUS
                        I’ll be an Astronaut or 
                        Paleontologist, I guess.  

                                 OFFICER 2
                        A Paleo-what?

                                 RICHARD
                        Thank you girls. A Paleontologist. 
                        The scientists who dig up those 
                        dinosaur bones. Now I know you 
                        gotta do your job, even if some 
                        crazy ass neighbor calls you, so I 
                        don’t mind you coming over here and 
                        telling me I’m tough on them kids, 
                        cause I am. That’s my job. To keep 
                        them off the street. You wanna come 
                        here and arrest me for that - fine. 
                        What’s not gonna happen is you 
                        coming here one day to tell me 
                        you’re sorry you had to blow my 
                        daughters’ damn heads off because 
                        they was on drugs or running around 
                        stealing cars or hanging with them 
                        hoodlums. Now you wanna talk to 
                        these girls, talk to them, but you 
                        won’t ever tell me that.

           Off the Officers, slowed in their tracks and --

           EXT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOME - NIGHT

           A short time later, Richard and Brandi are on their porch 
           watching the Cops pull away. As soon as they are gone --

           Richard bounds across the street to his neighbors’ house and 
           pounds on the door. Ms. Strickland (the lady in the house 
           coat from earlier) opens up to find Richard fuming.

                                 RICHARD
                        Try that nonsense again, I’ll kill 
                        ya. I mean it. Those are my kids.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        You keep your goddamn mouth shut or 
                        I’ll knock off your head.  

           And Richard storms off, leaving Ms. Strickland shaking. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t no one gonna tell me how to 
                        raise my kids. 

           Brandi watches as he slams inside. She’s shaken as well so --

           INT. WILLIAMS'S COMPTON HOME - CONTINUOUS

           -- when Richard enters, Brandi follows, hot on his heels. 

                                 BRANDI
                        What’s the matter with you? You 
                        can’t talk to people like that. 

                                 RICHARD
                        What’s the matter with me?

                                 BRANDI
                        You’re acting crazy! Threatening 
                        our neighbors. Driving off without 
                        our daughter. You’re angry that she 
                        won --

                                 RICHARD
                        I ain’t angry that she won. I’m 
                        angry she was bragging. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Well where you think she gets that? 
                        You’re out there telling everyone 
                        who will listen that she’s the 
                        world’s greatest. Gonna make a 
                        million dollars. How you think 
                        she’s gonna act?

           Richard doesn’t respond, just heads to the bedroom to change 
           into his security guard uniform. Brandi follows, still hot.

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        Richard, I don’t understand you. 
                        This is what you said you wanted.

                                 RICHARD
                        I never said like this. You can see 
                        it out there? At these tournaments? 
                        Call the cops on me? Those tennis

                        all that pressure. 

                                 BRANDI
                        And what you’re doing is better?

                                 RICHARD
                        I ain’t living through my kids.

           Brandi bites her tongue. A long beat. 

                                 BRANDI
                        I know you’re trying to do it 
                        different this time but --

                                 RICHARD
                             (immediately, angry)
                        That ain’t what it’s about.

                                 BRANDI
                        -- picking fights with everyone 
                        don’t win you votes for world’s 
                        greatest father. 

           Richard cuts her a look. He does not like this subject. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        Richard. What happened with Betty 
                        and those kids -- you don’t have to 
                        prove to us that you’re a different 
                        man now. 

           Richard shrinks. This wound is raw. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re trying to be there 
                        for them. But you keep acting like 
                        that and they might not be there 
                        for you. 

           Richard considers that solemnly, and then heads off to work 
           leaving Brandi behind in his wake as -- 

           INT. GIRLS’ BEDROOM, COMPTON HOUSE - NIGHT

           The girls are all in their beds, but no one’s asleep. They’ve 
           heard the whole thing. Hold on Serena, distressed and --

           EXT. COMPTON COURTS, LYNWOOD PARK - DAY

           A short time later, Brandi practices with Serena on the 
           courts. (Occasionally, the Bloods now cheer her on.) But 
           Serena’s in a surly mood. Slapping at balls. Knocking them 
           over the fence. Brandi just stops. 
                                 BRANDI
                        You gonna fetch that? 

           Serena folds her arms. Immovable.

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        Ok. Then you gonna tell me what’s 
                        wrong or you just gonna pout?

                                 SERENA
                             (after a long beat)
                        It isn’t fair. Venus gets to do 
                        everything. Train with Paul. Play 
                        in tournaments. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Baby, Venus is older. She’s always 
                        gonna do things first. You’re gonna 
                        have your turn. 

                                 SERENA
                        But I’m ready now.

                                 BRANDI
                        I know you feel that way but your 
                        father has a plan. You might not 
                        like it. Sometimes I don’t like it 
                        either. Sometimes I think he’s lost 
                        his mind but I know he’s trying to 
                        do you right.

           After a long beat, Serena musters her courage and --

                                 SERENA
                        What happened with Daddy and his 
                        family before us? You all never 
                        talk about that.

                                 BRANDI
                        Well, it ain’t easy for him.
                             (takes a beat)
                        Your daddy was young when he had 
                        those kids. He wasn’t ready to be a 
                        father, but now he is. 

                                 SERENA
                        He left them?

           Brandi takes a minute with this one.

                                 BRANDI
                        He’s not proud of it. But, the way 
                        he grew up -- he didn’t know how to 
                        be a father. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRANDI (CONT'D)
                        Never had one around to show him 
                        what it meant. Never had much hope. 
                        Never had much of anything. 
                        Whatever he’s doing now, however 
                        much you don’t like it, he’s trying 
                        to do better this time. In his 
                        heart it’s all to give you and your 
                        sisters better. I know one thing, 
                        he may be crazy, but he won’t ever 
                        leave you. 

           Serena softens but isn’t appeased. Brandi knows Serena well. 
           When her teeth are set, she doesn’t let go. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        You really think you’re ready?
                             (of course she does)
                        Well your Daddy may be stubborn, 
                        but he’ll change if he’s wrong. You 
                        know you’re ready, then show him.  

           Serena smiles. Brandi’s already walking back to the net. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        Now go get those balls. Don’t make 
                        me ask twice. 

           Serena smiles and takes off running and --

           INT. WILLIAMS’S COMPTON HOME - NIGHT

           Richard and the family are watching a Tennis Match on TV.

                                 RICHARD
                        You see how deep she’s hitting it? 
                        See how she’s moving her around the 
                        court. Can’t do that with a closed 
                        stance. Open, right? Like a dancer.

           Venus nods. Serena’s biding her time, sensing her moment and -

                                 SERENA
                        Is it OK if I go to the bathroom?

           Brandi nods of course. Richard’s preoccupied as we follow --

           Serena, out of the room and creeping down the hall. She 
           passes a collection of VENUS’S TROPHIES, growing larger by 
           the day as she reaches --

           HER FATHER’S STUDY. Forbidden territory. You get a whooping 
           if you’re caught in here but Serena steels herself. Enters. 
           Stealthily, she moves to her father’s desk, flipping through 
           his business and tennis files until she finds:

           A SCTA ENTRY FORM. 10 and Under. Filled out for Venus. 
           Beneath it, Serena finds another form. BLANK. 

           She looks to the door, steeling herself and --

           INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM, COMPTON HOUSE - NIGHT

           While her sisters sleep, Serena works by the light of a 
           flashlight, filling out the FORM. Printing out her name and -- 

           EXT. ANOTHER LA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Another tournament. Richard is checking in with Venus at the 
           registration table. Serena is milling about behind them. 

                                 TOURNAMENT OFFICIAL
                        All right, Venus. You’re all set. 
                        Court Four. Good luck out there.

                                 VENUS
                        Thank you.

           Richard and Venus start to head off. Serena lingers. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You coming or what?

                                 SERENA
                        I’m gonna hit against a wall or 
                        something. I’ll find you later. 
                             (to Venus)
                        Good luck. 

           But as soon as her family is gone, Serena approaches the sign-
           in table. The OFFICIAL looks up.

                                 SERENA (CONT’D)
                        Serena Williams. Ten and Under. I’m 
                        signing in. 

           The OFFICIAL looks at her curiously. 

                                 TOURNAMENT OFFICIAL
                        Let me just find your form. 

           EXT. TENNIS COURT, ANOTHER LA HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           ON COURT: Venus is mid-match, trouncing a GIRL (as expected).  
           She drills a winner, putting her opponent out of her misery. 

           Richard claps in the stands. 
                                 RICHARD
                        Great shot, Venus. Great decision. 

           Another FATHER approaches Richard. 

                                 FATHER
                        Girl looks good out there. 

                                 RICHARD
                        A little tight but not bad. 

                                 FATHER
                        I don’t mean Venus. I mean your 
                        little one. Looks like a champ too.
                             (off Richard’s confusion)
                        You coulda warned us man. I didn’t 
                        know you had two. 

           Off Richard, realization and anger beginning to surface as --

           EXT. ANOTHER TENNIS COURT - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard hurries through the grounds to another COURT where a 
           small crowd has begun to gather. He can’t see it yet, but the 
           POP coming off the balls doesn’t sound normal. Not at this 
           age. It’s FEROCIOUS. He arrives as the crowd APPLAUDS to see:

           Serena, playing a match. Richard’s first instinct at being 
           disobeyed is to physically pull her off the court but Brandi, 
           watching at the fence, stops him. 

                                 BRANDI
                        May as well let her finish. 

           Richard’s slowed for a moment as -- he watches Serena race 
           around the court, finally let off the leash. 

           She CRACKS overheads. Chases every ball. Plays every angle. 

           The racket’s as big as her, but she’s a natural in her 
           element, and there’s magic here that even Richard can’t deny.

           Serena ends a beautiful point at the net, then spots her 
           father in the crowd and -- the music stops. The magic, over. 
           Believing she’s in trouble, Serena starts off the court when -

                                 RICHARD
                        Where you think you’re going? 
                             (as Serena pauses)
                        You’re out there now. Go ahead and 
                        finish. We’ll talk about it later. 

           Surprised, Serena smiles, hustling back to the court. Richard 
           turns to his wife. 
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Did you know about this?

                                 BRANDI
                        No. Not exactly. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t even know I want Venus out 
                        here no more. Now we got ‘em both?

                                 BRANDI
                        Don’t look at me. You’re the man 
                        with the plan.

           Off Richard, watching as Serena tosses the ball and...CRACK. 

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB CAFE - LATER

           Venus and the family are celebrating with ICE CREAM. Serena, 
           holding a small SILVER TROPHY of her own, eyes Venus’s 
           towering GOLD TROPHY enviously. Venus sees. 

                                 VENUS
                        You want it? -- we can swap. I like 
                        silver better anyway. 

           Serena beams, swapping the trophies before her sister can 
           change her mind. Venus is all smiles as --

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        Excuse me. Mr. Williams. Venus. 

           The family turns to see a young, studious NEW YORK WOMAN (30) 
           approaching with a note-pad. 

                                 REPORTER
                        My name’s Robin Finn. I’m a 
                        reporter with the New York Times. 
                        I’ve been following your season. 
                        It’s been really remarkable. I was 
                        wondering if I could ask you some 
                        questions?

           Venus lights up. She looks to her parents for approval. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You wanna talk to this white lady, 
                        talk. She ain’t here to see me. 

           A beat as Venus considers, then eagerly nods as -- 
           INT. WILLIAMS'S COMPTON HOUSE - DAY

           Several weeks later. WIMBLEDON (1990) is on TV. Venus is on 
           the couch with a copy of the NY TIMES, reading from the 
           article aloud. The headline reads:

              TENNIS; STATUS: UNDEFEATED. FUTURE: ROSY. AGE: 10.

                                 VENUS
                             (reading)
                        “At a time when tennis prodigies 
                        seem to be surfacing every week, 
                        the latest hot prospect is a 10-
                        year-old Californian, Venus 
                        Williams. Last weekend, Williams 
                        captured her 17th singles title in 
                        less than a year by winning the age-

                        That’s from Dorothy Cheney.

                        All right. One step at a time.

           Serena scowls in disbelief as the PHONE RINGS.

                        I’ll get it. 

           She stomps off to the KITCHEN and picks up the phone.

           Richard gives Brandi a troubled look.

                                 BRANDI
                        What? Isn’t this what we’ve been 
                        waiting for?

           It was, but now Richard’s not so sure as -- 

           EXT. PRIVATE BRENTWOOD HOME - DAY

           Richard and Venus exit the van, heading toward the Cornyn 
           residence with their gear as Paul greets them at the door. 

                                 PAUL
                        I swear. It wasn’t me.

           EXT. TENNIS COURT, BRENTWOOD HOME - DAY

           Richard and Venus approach the court to find Rita sipping 
           iced tea with a smarmy suited HUCKSTER who can only be --

                                 RITA
                        Richard, this is my friend, Laird 
                        Stabler. He’s an Agent at Pro 
                        Serve. He read about you two in the 
                        paper and wanted to meet.

           Laird sticks out his hand. 

                                 LAIRD
                        Great to meet you, Richard. You got 
                        quite a girl on your hands. I’d 
                        like to talk to you about taking 
                        her to the next level.

                        I’m not advocating she goes pro at 
                        12 or 13 -- unless that’s something 
                        you want to talk about. What’s 
                        important right now is that she 
                        maximizes her potential. It’s time 
                        to ramp it up. Practice. Coaching.

                        ready to turn pro.  

           EXT. ANOTHER PRIVATE TENNIS COURT - DAY

           Venus plays on a distant court with ZINA GARRISON, while in 
           the foreground, Richard speaks to NIC BOLLETIERI and a 
           REPRESENTATIVE from Adidas.

                        Venus is ready to go pro, you’ll 
                        remember the investments we’ve 
                        made. 

           Richard’s eyes are on his daughter on the court. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You mean when she’s twelve? 

           The REP nods, why not? Richard’s disapproval is clear.

                                 NICK
                        Pretty special thing to hit with 
                        Zina, right? That’s the kind of 
                        experiences these relationships can 
                        provide. I mean, the sporting gods 
                        have smiled on you, Richard. You’re 
                        going to be a rich man. But if you 
                        wanna cash in, it’s time to put 
                        your foot on the gas.

           EXT. RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           A BANNER FLAPS BY THE BAND STAND: “JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS.”

           A CHARITY TENNIS EVENT underway in the posh Pacific Palisades 
           Tennis Club. Celebrities. Pros. Even PRESIDENT REAGAN is here 
           in support of his wife NANCY’S EVENT. 

           On the courts: Venus and Serena play an exhibition match 
           against TWO NOTABLE PROS. 

           Watching from the crowd is tennis legend JACK KRAMER. He’s 
           speaking with an AGENT we’ll meet in a moment.

                                 AGENT
                        What do you think?

                                 KRAMER
                        She’s quick. Serves a goddamn 
                        rocket. I’d say for 14, she’s about 
                        the best I’ve ever seen. 

                                 AGENT
                        She’s ten. 

                                 KRAMER
                        Ten. Oh. Geez. Then... 

           Off that, as Venus smashes another across the net --

                        This slogan -- “just say no.” That 
                        wasn't something we just sat down 
                        and dreamed up, that came about by 
                        accident.

                        I was at a clinic in Oakland when a 
                        young girl asked me, 'But what do 
                        we do when our friends pressure us 
                        to do drugs?' and, without 
                        thinking, I said, 'Just say no!' 

           LAND ON RICHARD

           -- who’s seated at a table with that same BLUE BLOOD AGENT, 
           JOHN (Everett) and a sixty year-old named MARK (McCormack), 
           the head of his agency, who looks and dresses like a Kennedy. 

                                 JOHN 
                        Richard. Thanks for coming. You 
                        know Mark, the head of our agency, 
                        right? Can we get you a drink?

                                 RICHARD
                        Sure. Coke-a-cola be fine. Thanks.

                                 MARK
                        It’s nice to meet you, Richard. 
                        What do you think of the club? 

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s great. Real nice of everyone 
                        to take off their hoods before we 
                        came in.
                             (Richard enjoys watching 
                              them freeze then --)
                        I’m kidding. Everyone’s very nice. 
                        We’ve been here many times. 

           John and Mark exchange a look -- this guy is nuts. 

                                 JOHN
                        Well Richard, first, we just wanna 
                        congratulate you on the great job 
                        you’ve done with these girls so 
                        far. With your resources and 
                        experience, honestly, it’s 
                        astonishing. We’d like to help you 
                        with what’s next. 

                                 MARK
                        Now I’m sure you know, but John 
                        here is the best. He signed 
                        Capriati when she was 12. Mary Jo 
                        Fernandez. And we believe Venus can 
                        be bigger than both. With her 
                        talent. Her length. Her --

                        Race. 
                             (that stops them)
                        It’s OK. We get it. Poor black girl 
                        in an all white sport is a pretty 
                        good story. Ghetto Cinderella. Why 
                        you think we picked it?
                             (they laugh nervously)
                        You know my momma used to say, 
                        Richard, you are not a negro. 
                        You’re not a nigger. You’re just a 
                        man. And as far as you nationa-you-
                        know-what-nality, she would say, I 
                        don’t know what the hell you are. 
                        Times going through life, black 
                        people been a little bit of 
                        everything. Used to call colored. 
                        Then used to call boy. Then 
                        African. Now they call ‘em African 
                        American. Be honest with you, we 
                        don’t know what in the hell we are. 
                        All we know is -- we are.

           Feigning understanding, the white men nod. Mark’s starting to 
           grasp what he’s up against. A huckster and a master. 

                                   MARK
                        Well -- Richard, that’s exactly 
                        what we’re talking about. We think 
                        Venus could be very inspirational 
                        to a whole group of people, who 
                        frankly, as an industry, we have 
                        not done enough to reach. Venus 
                        could open a lot of doors and we’d 
                        like to help her do it. 

                                 RICHARD
                             (cutting to the chase)
                        So what are you offering?

                                 JOHN
                        Whatever you need. Shoes. Coaches. 
                        Rackets --

                                 RICHARD
                        They got rackets don’t they? That’s 
                        how you heard about ‘em, ain’t it? 

                                 JOHN
                        What are you looking for then? 
                        Money? A new house? A car? 
                                 RICHARD
                        I’m wondering why should we sign 
                        with any of you? Venus is 10. She 
                        can’t go pro or get a sponsorship 
                        for a couple years anyway. 

                                 JOHN
                        There’s ways around that. We did it 
                        with Jennifer. Venus can go pro as 
                        young as you want. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You all think we care about 
                        youngest. Buddy, we interested in 
                        longest. I don’t want these girls 
                        to burn out at sixteen with no 
                        education. No idea how to handle 
                        their money. You all are talking 
                        ‘bout putting her foot on the gas. 
                        I’m out here thinking we need to 
                        pump the breaks. 

                                 JOHN 
                        Richard, that’s a bad idea. Now is 
                        not the time to slow down. 

                                 RICHARD
                        What about school and their 
                        childhood?

                                 JOHN
                        I made deals for Jennifer when she 
                        was twelve that’ll pay for ten 
                        colleges. Leave that down the road. 
                        Don’t you wanna make a million 
                        dollars? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh, I’ve made a million dollars. 
                        Couple times before. Know how I 
                        know? I’ve seen the mansions of the 
                        white people I was working for when 
                        I made it for ‘em. 
                             (seen all their cards)
                        You think I’m just some nigger from 
                        the Ghetto, don’t you? Gonna hand 
                        over my kids to the first fool with 
                        a Cadillac. I’m trying to give 
                        these girls a lifetime, not a 
                        moment.

           John throws up his hands. Mark now steps in. 
                                 MARK
                        We understand that, Richard and we 
                        are too. Now can I be frank?

                                 RICHARD
                        You can be whoever the hell you 
                        want. 

                                 MARK
                        Slowing down now would be a 
                        catastrophic mistake. You’ve done 
                        an amazing job but there’s a long 
                        way to go and if you pull back 
                        right now, you risk losing 
                        everything.
                             (beat)
                        Success like Jennifer’s, that 
                        doesn’t happen by chance. That 
                        talent’s gotta be nurtured. You 
                        need the right training. Coaches. 
                        Hitting partners. You gotta play 
                        the right tournaments. Get the 
                        right exposure to sponsors. These 
                        next few years are crucial. Hingis. 
                        Kournikova. These other prospects 
                        Venus’s age, they are turning up 
                        the heat. You pull Venus back now, 
                        she won’t just fall behind. She 
                        won’t develop at all. 
                             (once that lands)
                        Between John, myself, our company -- 
                        we are this sport. We have a 
                        hundred years of experience. We’ve 
                        taken dozens of players to the top. 
                        Let us do that for you. Let us make 
                        this a sure thing. You don’t wanna 
                        risk all that, do you?

           Off Richard, condescended and steaming and --

           EXT. RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Storming through the event, Richard’s looking for the girls. 
           Making a bit of a scene. Finally he spots them:

           BY THE POOL -- eating hamburgers and french fries with a few 
           WASPY GIRLS from the club, having the time of their life. 

           Richard arrives with a head full of steam. 

                                 VENUS
                        Hey, Daddy! How you doing? 
                                 RICHARD
                        Where’d you get all this food?

                                 SERENA
                        You want something, Daddy? You can 
                        put it on my tab. 

           The girls laugh. Richard does not. He boils, grabbing the 
           girls, pulling them away. 

                                 VENUS
                        But I’m not done eating. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You can eat the lunch I packed. And 
                        don’t ever let me hear this “it’s 
                        on my tab” crap again. 

                                 SERENA
                        It was just a joke, Dad. It’s free. 

                                 ANOTHER GIRL
                        She’s right, Mr. Williams. They’re 
                        just handing it out.

                                 RICHARD
                        Ain’t nothing for free. Somebody’s 
                        paying for it. I promise. Now I 
                        said let’s go. Now. 

           Embarrassed, the girls comply, leaving their friends and 
           following their father who’s caused quite a scene and --

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           They get back to the van. Everyone’s silent. Serena, furious. 

                                 SERENA
                        It was just a joke. It’s not fair. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Don’t talk back to me, Serena. I’m 
                        not in the mood. Just get in the 
                        goddamn car. 

           They do as Richard gets behind the wheel in a fury. He tries 
           to start the car, but it stalls. He tries again but still 
           nothing. Again. Nothing. He pounds the wheel. 

           Fighting back tears, Richard puts down the keys. Humiliated. 
           Underestimated. The story of his life. 

           The girls watch him in back, confused and afraid, as we hear:
                                 NEWS REPORTER (PRE-LAP)
                        The three police officers facing 
                        felony criminal charges were among 
                        a group of 15 who stopped a 25-year-
                        old black man last Saturday Night 
                        then beat him, kicked him, and 
                        clubbed him, unaware that an 
                        amateur photographer was recording 
                        the incident on videotape.

           EXT. COMPTON STREETS - NIGHT / VARIOUS SHOTS

           A city on the brink. Police on patrol. Young men on their 
           stoops. A powder keg about to be lit as --

                                 NEWS REPORTER (PRE-LAP)
                        Los Angeles Police Chief Darrell 
                        Gates looked at the tape and said 
                        he thinks, assault with a deadly 
                        weapon will be one of the charges. 

           INT. WILLIAMS'S COMPTON HOUSE - NIGHTS

           Richard, Brandi, and a young, well-dressed, African American 
           man - KEVEN DAVIS (35), watch the notorious assault on TV. 

                                 BRANDI
                        My lord. It’s unbelievable. 

           There’s a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Crying, Brandi answers it and 
           Paul Cohen enters, taking stock of the somber faces. 

                                 PAUL
                        What’s going on? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Didn’t see this in Brentwood?

           He gestures to the television where the NEWS BROADCAST PLAYS:

           RODNEY KING. The infamous beating at the hands of the LAPD. 
           It’s ferociously violent. Paul is stunned.

                                 PAUL
                        Jesus. 

                                 KEVEN
                        Terrible, right? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Paul, this is Keven Davis. He’s a 
                        lawyer. A family friend. He’s been 
                        helping with these agents. 
           They shake hands, but everyone’s eyes are on the screen. 

                                 BRANDI
                        We need to leave this place -- 
                        before we don’t have a choice. 

           Hold on Richard as he watches, rage still simmering as --

           EXT. WILLIAMS'S COMPTON HOUSE - EVENING

           Venus and Serena are playing dress-up with their DOG in the 
           backyard where Richard smokes a cigarette, sitting with Paul, 
           Brandi, and Keven. All of them solemn. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Richard says you’re moving?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. We’re having a baby. My 
                        wife’s got some family up north so -

                                 KEVEN
                        What about McEnroe?

                                 PAUL
                        He’s done. Tatum’s not behind 
                        another run for number one. It 
                        takes too much outta everyone. And 
                        I’m not interested in less.

                                 BRANDI
                        What will you do? 

                                 PAUL
                             (serious)
                        I’m thinking about arm wrestling. 
                        There’s a guy up there, he’s like 
                        the Agassi of arm wrestling. I can 
                        take him to the top. There’s 
                        nothing I can’t coach. 
                             (turning to Richard)
                        Question’s what’re you going to do?

           Richard takes a long pull of his cigarette. A big decision.

                                 RICHARD
                        We ain’t signing with these agents. 
                        I want these girls to be kids and 
                        we sign, that’s all over. They’ll 
                        push her fast as they can and I 
                        don’t want her to peak at 12 just 
                        to fall to pieces at 15.
                                 PAUL
                        I get it but it’s risky. You’re 
                        leaving money on the table.

                                 KEVEN
                        They are. But if she turns out to 
                        be as good as we think, in four, 
                        five years, the deal they sign will 
                        be a lot bigger. 

                                 PAUL
                        That’s a big if. Lot of things have 
                        to go right. What’s your plan? 

           A long beat, cause Richard knows how this will land. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m pulling ‘em out of juniors. 

                                 PAUL
                        What?!

                                 RICHARD
                        I heard all the risks, but I made 
                        up my mind. The junior circuit’s 
                        worse than the ghetto. Kids 
                        cracking-up. Burning out. Their 
                        parents oughta to be shot. 

                                 PAUL
                        Richard, what are you talking 
                        about? Your girls are fine. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Yeah. Sure, they fine now. Playing 
                        these jokers, but as they move on --
                        nationals. Internationals. It’s 
                        just like the pros. That 
                        competition and pressure - it ain’t 
                        good at their age. No, we’re doing 
                        it different. We’re going to 
                        Florida. Getting a coach where they 
                        can train, go to school and be 
                        kids. 

           Paul’s incredulous. It’s hard to overstate how big a bomb 
           Richard’s just dropped. 

                                 PAUL
                        Richard, you’ll ruin them. You hold 
                        out for some payday, it won’t be 
                        there. No coach is gonna take ‘em 
                        for free if they aren’t playing 
                        juniors. They’ll never get paid. 
                                 RICHARD
                        They will when they see her. 

                                 PAUL
                        Does Venus know about this?

                                 RICHARD
                        Of course. She’s on board. 

           But we see Venus eavesdropping from afar, not looking sold. 

                                 PAUL
                             (in disbelief)
                        Every American player who’s ever 
                        done anything got good playing 
                        juniors. Mac. Traci. Sampras. 
                        Agassi. Capriati. Those just are 
                        the facts. You’ve got a stallion  
                        but, she’s doesn’t play juniors, 
                        she’ll die on the vine.

                                 RICHARD
                        I appreciate your help and all your 
                        advice, Paul but I’ve made up my 
                        mind. I know what I’m doing.  

                                 PAUL
                        You have no fucking idea. You’re 
                        talking outta your ass cause some 
                        people insulted you and now you’re 
                        gonna fuck all this up. 

           It’s a stalemate. Paul folds first, throwing up his hands. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I swear to god, you’re the most 
                        stubborn person I ever met in my 
                        life. You’re really doing this, 
                        aren’t you? 
                             (of course he is)
                        Well if you’re going to go to 
                        Florida, at least don’t go to 
                        Nick’s. He’s a hack. Talk to Macci. 
                        He’s a little nuts but he’s good. 
                        But, Richard, you tell him you’re 
                        not playing juniors, I really don’t 
                        know if he’ll say yes. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Who says we gotta tell him?

           Paul laughs in disbelief, looking at the girls fondly. Sadly.
                                 PAUL
                        I hope you don’t fuck this up. 

           That’s it. The end of an era. Time now for another. CUT TO:

           EXT. RICK MACCI’S TENNIS ACADEMY - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

           Grenelefe Country Club. A golf and tennis resort situated in 
           the swamps of Haines City, Florida. A steaming, athletic 
           paradise where:

           A JUNIOR TENNIS TOURNAMENT is underway in a 1700 seat sunken 
           court. TWO ELITE 17-YEAR-OLDS belt it out in the burning sun 
           until one of them snaps a backhand like a firecracker 
           screaming down the line and we meet:

           RICK MACCI, the boyish, bowl-cut Tennis coach, whooping it up 
           in the stands like a kid! 

                                 MACCI
                        Sherman Williams, baby! Paint those 
                        lines!

           The crowd all cheers as we CUT TO:

           LATER AT THE GRILL

           A post-tournament reception. Rick’s mingling with the PARENTS 
           when an ASSISTANT approaches. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        No way! He’s too soft. He’s a 
                        marshmallow. You know what happens 
                        to those, right? They get roasted.

                                 ASSISTANT
                             (waiting through laughter)
                        Rick. Sorry to interrupt. You got 
                        another call. Richard Williams. He 
                        said it’s urgent.

                                 MACCI
                        Richard who?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        That father out in California. He’s 
                        been calling. Got those girls. 

           Macci’s drawing a blank.

                                 ADVANTAGE AGENT
                        You haven’t heard of Venus 
                        Williams? I’d take that call if I 
                        were you. 
           Reveal the European ADVANTAGE AGENT we met before in CA.

                                 ADVANTAGE AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Venus is the real deal. Good as 
                        Hingis. She’s 63-0. Hasn’t lost a 
                        match. She won the SC Sectionals 
                        last month without dropping a set. 
                        Her sister’s not bad either. 

                                 MACCI
                        63-0? These girls are so good, 
                        why’ve I never heard of them?

                                 ADVANTAGE AGENT
                        They’re from Compton.
                             (then)
                        Word of warning, put your guard up. 
                        Their father’s a tough one.  

                                 RICK
                        Controlling? 

                                 ADVANTAGE AGENCY
                        That’s not the half of it. He makes 
                        Stefano look like a push-over. 
                        Watch your back. 

           Off Macci, both wary and intrigued. 

           INT. RICK MACCI’S OFFICE, GRENELEFE GOLF & TENNIS CLUB - DAY

           THE SOUND OF A PHONE DIALING as we see Tennis kitsch on the 
           walls. Trophies. Rick’s photos with Capriati. Tommy Ho. 
           Trump. Rick sits on his desk on the phone as finally --

                                 MACCI
                        Mr. Williams? Hi, this is Rick 
                        Macci. I heard you’ve got a heck of 
                        a player out there. I thought maybe 
                        I’d come take a look. 

           EXT. COMPTON HOTEL - DAY

           PAN DOWN from a California sky and California Palm trees to 
           the facade of a budget Compton hotel where -- 

           Macci waits outside with his Tennis Bag, failing to hide his 
           shock as Richard’s VW pulls up beneath the carriage port. 

                                 RICHARD
                             (through the window)
                        Mr. Macci? Richard Williams. Toss 
                        that stuff in the back. Let’s take 
                        you to see the club.
           Off Macci’s surprise. What the hell did I get in to? He 
           climbs in the car. Sees the girls in the back. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Girls. Say hi to Mr. Macci. 

                                 VENUS AND SERENA
                        Hi, Mr. Macci. 

                                 MACCI
                        Nice to meet you girls. Call me 
                        Rick. Now which one of you’s who?

           INT. RICHARD’S VAN - MOVING - MORNING 

           Macci sits shotgun beside Richard, watching rough Compton 
           streets pass-by out the windows. In the car --

           Macci recoils. Seats covered in dirt. Tennis balls. Coke 
           bottles. Fast food wrappers line the floor. Macci jolts 
           uncomfortably as --

                                 RICHARD
                        Watch out for those springs. 
                        They’re lose. Might poke ya. 

           Macci shifts, pulling a wadded t-shirt from the cushion. 

                                 MACCI
                        You sleep in here? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Sometimes. Depends on the wife. 

           Richard winks. Macci soaks it all in. Venus and Serena 
           crammed in the back doing homework in their tennis skirts. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Here we are. East Compton Hills 
                        Country Club. 

           They’ve arrived at the Compton Courts. Macci’s taken aback. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I’ll make sure you 
                        don’t get shot. 

           EXT. COMPTON TENNIS COURTS - DAY

           Macci watches the whole strange procedure as Richard and the 
           girls unload their tennis crap from the car. He follows them 
           to the courts where --
           THE BLOODS wait like bouncers at the gate, welcoming the 
           family in like celebrities. 

                                 DODGER’S HAT
                        Here he is. King Richard. 

           They smile at the girls but stop Macci at the door. 

                                 DODGER’S HAT (CONT’D)
                        Where the fuck you think you’re 
                        going, McEnroe? 

                                 MACCI
                        Excuse me?

                                 DODGER’S HAT
                        Richard -- this Jimmy Connors 
                        looking motherfucker with you?

                                 RICHARD
                             (inside the court)
                        Yeah, let him in. White boy’s with 
                        us.

           The Bloods step aside allowing Macci to pass. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        See. What’d I tell ya. Promised you 
                        wouldn’t get shot. 

           Macci’s just speechless as the girls take the ratty courts, 
           throwing footballs, tossing rackets, while Richard sweeps up 
           broken glass and crack vials. What a freaking joke. 

           As they begin to warm up, Macci watches Richard hit, thinking 
           he’s made the biggest mistake of his life. Out of expedience 
           more than anything --

                                 MACCI
                             (taking the court)
                        Do you mind if I hit? I’ll get a 
                        better feel. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You’re the boss. Have at it. I’ve 
                        got some business calls anyway.

           Richard steps off with his CELLPHONE, taking a FAKE CALL.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Richard Williams here. World’s 
                        greatest. 
           Macci shakes his head, then begins to drill with the girls. 
           His skill and professionalism couldn’t be more different.

                                 MACCI
                        Ok, Venus. Let’s start off with 
                        some backhands. Cross court. 
                        Serena, you hit em down the line. 
                        Let’s do 20. 

           Macci feeds them balls. The girls whacking from the baseline. 
           Richard yells encouragement from the sidelines. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Great shot, Serena. Lotta power. 
                        Move those feet, Venus, there you 
                        go.

           ANOTHER DRILL. Macci watching the girls serve. Pop. Pop. Pop. 

           ANOTHER DRILL. Macci feeds the girls volleys. He feeds them 
           overheads. He feeds them lobs. Macci’s reaction is hard to 
           read. When he’s finally had enough -- 

                                 MACCI
                        All right. Nice work. Take a break. 

           Macci watches, considering, as the girls run over to Richard.

                                 VENUS
                        Daddy, can I use the bathroom?

                                 RICHARD
                        Course you can, Venus. 

                                 SERENA
                        Me too, Daddy?

                                 RICHARD
                        Go on. Hurry up. 

           He kisses the girls and they run off the courts. Richard 
           heads over to Macci, who’s watching them go. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Well -- what do you think, Rick? 
                        They better than Capriati or what?

           But Macci doesn’t answer. His attention still tuned to Venus, 
           walking through the park to the bathroom -- ON HER HANDS. 

           She walks ten yards like that - like it’s nothing - then she 
           goes another ten doing HANDSPRINGS like she’s SIMONE BILES. 

           Macci’s slack jawed. He turns to their father. 
                                 MACCI
                        How tall are you, Richard? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Me? I’m six-four. 

                                 MACCI
                        And your wife? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Brandi. She’s bout six one. She was 
                        a college athlete too you know.

                                 MACCI
                        Really? Well Richard -- let me tell 
                        you. Forget Capriati. She gets as 
                        big as that, I think you might have 
                        the next Michael Jordan on your 
                        hands. 

           Richard just puts his arm around Macci and smiles. 

                                 RICHARD
                        No brother man. I got the next two. 

           In the distance, Macci finds Serena joining her sister, 
           walking upside down like the laws of gravity don’t apply. 
           Macci can hardly believe his luck. 

                                 MACCI
                        How the heck’d this happen?

                                 RICHARD 
                        Well. I’ll tell you. I had a plan.
                             (pre-lap now)
                        It was 1977. I was watching TV.

           INT. MCDONALDS - LATER

           Buzzing with excitement, Macci sits with Richard and the 
           girls in a booth. The family eats hungrily. Macci hasn’t 
           touched his. Too excited to eat as --

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t remember who was changing 
                        the channels for me but a tennis 
                        match came on and I said, hold it 
                        right there cause a man, I didn’t 
                        know him at the time - but it was 
                        Bud Collins, he was handing this 
                        girl a check and he said, “That’s 
                        not bad. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        Forty Thousand Dollars for four 
                        days work” and I said, that little 
                        girl never done that before had 
                        she?  

           The girls just smile and eat. They know this story by heart. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        So the next day, it woulda been a 
                        Monday, I went out and got a 
                        newspaper and looked in the back 
                        and it was true. So I went to the 
                        wife and said -- we gotta make two 
                        more kids. 
                             (eats his burger)
                        That night, I wrote up a plan. One 
                        for Venus. One for Serena. Covered 
                        it all. Their tennis. Educations. 
                        Language studies. Media training. 
                        All of it and that’s how we’re 
                        sitting here with you.

           Macci still has his burger in his hand, untouched. 

                                 MACCI
                        And you never played tennis before?

                                 RICHARD
                        Nope. I’m a terrific athlete. Lotta 
                        people said the best ever came out 
                        of Louisiana but tennis --
                             (beat)
                        Mostly I just watched some tapes. 

           Richard takes a big bite. Off Macci, in utter disbelief as -- 

           INT. MACCI’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Macci’s sitting on a bed in a towel, still wet from the 
           shower, talking to his assistant on the phone. 

                                 MACCI
                        I know it sounds crazy. It’s 
                        insane, but this girl -- I mean 
                        she’s built like Olive Oyl, just 
                        all arms and legs, but their 
                        athleticism, both of em. I mean, 
                        fasten your seat belts, these girls 
                        are fast. They get in the system, 
                        juniors, coaching, the sky is the 
                        limit.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        How’s the dad? Crazy as they say? 
           INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. GRENELEFE TENNIS CLUB - NIGHT

           Macci’s assistant, on the phone in the steamy Florida night. 

                                 MACCI
                        Worse. But I like him. He’s self-
                        taught. Self-made. Kinda like me. I 
                        can work with him. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        All right. Just be careful. Don’t 
                        want another Stefano on your hands.  

           Off Macci, considering that omen and then --

           INT. WILLIAMS’ COMPTON HOUSE - DAY

           Rick’s sitting in the living room, across from the entire 
           Williams’ family. Richard’s in the center, a lion with his 
           cubs as Macci presents them with a PAPER. His offer. 

                                 MACCI
                        That’s my standard agreement. Same 
                        one I made with Jennifer. Basically 
                        it says — you sign with me as your 
                        coach, I’ll assume all the costs. 
                        Instruction. Housing. Food. 
                        Education. You won’t pay for a 
                        thing. Tickets to Disney World, 
                        which is right down the road. But 
                        mostly my personal time, which I 
                        promise is what you’ll get. When 
                        you train at Rick Macci, you train 
                        with Rick. That’s not how it works 
                        with my competitors. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Sounds expensive. What’s in it for 
                        you?

                                 MACCI
                        Well, a lot I hope but it’s all 
                        about trust. I like your family. I 
                        believe in your daughters. I think 
                        they can be champions and I’m 
                        willing to take that risk. In 
                        exchange, my fee is 15% of their 
                        future earnings. If you make 
                        nothing, I make nothing. We’re in 
                        it together, but I promise, we’re 
                        not gonna make nothing.
           Macci’s excited. Everyone’s impressed. Everyone but Richard. 

                                 RICHARD
                        What do you know about Nick 
                        Bollettieri? He’s been calling too. 

                                 MACCI
                        Nick? Well -- Nick’s a good coach. 
                        He’s had a lot of success. But you 
                        go to Bradenton, you won’t get him, 
                        you’ll get whatever hitting coach 
                        he’s got available. You’ll get a 
                        factory. You come to me, I’m your 
                        coach. One on one er -- one on two, 
                        as it were.

                                 RICHARD
                        Lotta people say Nick’s the best. 

                                 MACCI
                        I’d ask Andre what he’d say about 
                        that? Lotta people say he’s not the 
                        happiest guy in the world. Doesn’t 
                        love it on the court. I think you 
                        gotta love it. Kids gotta drive 
                        this thing. If it’s their dream to 
                        be a champ, there’s a chance. If 
                        it’s yours -- either they’re gonna 
                        lose, or you’ll lose them. Maybe 
                        both. But look -- if you wanna go 
                        with Nick then --

                                 RICHARD
                        No. We want to go with you. We just 
                        wanted to hear that first. 

           Macci sighs relief as Richard extends a paper of his own.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        That’s our standard agreement. You 
                        take these girls, you take us all. 
                        We ain’t breaking this family up.

                                 MACCI
                        You all want to come to Florida?

                                 RICHARD
                             (nods, re: his contract)
                        And we’ll need the rest of that 
                        too. A house. The best school. A 
                        job at your academy. A --
                                 MACCI
                             (reading)
                        -- mobile home?

                                 RICHARD
                        Gotta get there don’t we? You 
                        believe in these girls or what?

           Despite their crazy father, Macci does. Here goes nothing. He 
           extends his hand for Richard to shake it and we -- CUT TO:

           EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - DAY

           A RIBBON OF HIGHWAY cutting through the Arizona desert where 
           a brand new MOTORHOME speeds down the road. Behind the wheel:

           I/E. BRAND NEW MOTORHOME - DAY AND NIGHT / VARIOUS SHOTS

           Richard Williams drives, moving his family cross country. 

           They pass the GRAND CANYON. The TEXAS PLAINS. They stop at 
           Truck stops and Diners. Richard smokes. Serena sleeps. Venus, 
           focused as ever, watches the country pass by out her windows, 
           more clear than ever about where she’s headed as --

           INT. BRAND NEW MOTORHOME - NIGHT 

           Richard’s at the wheel on a Louisiana Highway. Everyone else 
           asleep when a FREEWAY SIGN grows in his window: SHREVEPORT.

           Richard blooms with emotion, moving toward an exit and --

           EXT. SHREVEPORT - DAWN

           The Williams’s motorhome sweeps through poor, urban streets. 
           Deep south poverty. Compton, minus the palm trees. 

           Richard drives through it like in a dream, taking in his 
           past. Brandi wakes beside him, looking at the city.

                                 BRANDI
                        Where are we? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Home. 

           Richard’s emotional as the girls begin to stir awake and -- 

           EXT. RICHARD’S CHILDHOOD HOME - MORNING

           We’ve been here before. In Richard’s memories. The Motorhome 
           is parked in a blighted, rural neighborhood. The family 
           watches Richard walk the yard of the small clapboard house 
           showing years of neglect. The poverty is striking.
           Richard’s saddened by the condition. 

                                 SERENA
                        This is where you grew up?

                                 VENUS
                        Where’d you go the bathroom? Didn’t 
                        you have running water?

                                 RICHARD
                        Venus, we didn’t have nothing. 
                        Lotta bad happened here. All we had 
                        was Momma. 

           The girls are young and they struggle to grasp what this 
           means to him, why their father is crying and --

           EXT. SHREVEPORT CEMETERY - DAY

           Brandi and the girls wait at a respectful distance as Richard 
           visits the grave of his mother -- MS. JULIA METCALF WILLIAMS.

           He’s silent for a long, reverent time. Finally --

                                 RICHARD
                        I miss you Momma. You with me 
                        everyday, in these girls. Everyday. 
                        I wish you could see what they 
                        gonna do. I hope I’m doing them 
                        right. I hope we making you proud. 

           Richard wipes his eyes, tries to compose, then returns to his 
           family, heading for the car. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        All right. Time’s a wasting. Let’s 
                        get this show on the road. 

           With a last look back, they follow him into the car and --

           EXT. HAINES CITY, FLORIDA - ESTABLISHING

           Soaring over Central Florida swamp lands until we arrive at --

           EXT. GRENELEFE COUNTRY CLUB -- ESTABLISHING

           The beautiful home of the Rick Macci Tennis Academy. Golf 
           courses, pools, and tennis courts as far as the eye can see.

           The MOTORHOME pulls through the gates and parks in the lot. 
           Rick greets the family as they step out the doors.

                                 MACCI
                        Here they are. How was the trip? 
           But everyone’s just staring mouth agape at the club.

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Not too shabby, huh? Wanna take a 
                        look around?

           Off their excitement. 

           EXT. AND INT. GRENELEFE COUNTRY CLUB - VARIOUS SHOTS / DAY

           Moving at his naturally quick, puppy-dog clip, Macci gives 
           the family a tour of the facilities, showing off:

           A BEAUTIFUL GOLF COURSE. 

                                 MACCI
                        Here’s the Golf Course. Richard, 
                        you got a membership. Cart included 
                        of course. Hear you’re pretty good.

           A SPARKLING POOL. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        You’ll wanna live in here. It’s a 
                        hundred most days. Just watch out 
                        for the gators.

           THE CAFETERIA, where a dozen young TENNIS PLAYERS eat. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Cafeteria’s all you can eat. 
                        Seafood buffet every Friday.  

           THE WORKOUT FACILITY 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the gym, weight center, 
                        locker room and finally --

           EXT. TENNIS VILLAGE, GRENELEFE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           -- they arrive at last at Macci’s headquarters. 

                                 MACCI
                        Here’s the tennis village. That’s a 
                        1700-seat stadium and thirteen 
                        pristine practice courts that 
                        you’re going to get to know very, 
                        very well.  

           It’s just as impressive as he says. Thirteen immaculate 
           courts filled with OTHER TEENAGE HOPEFULS drilling away, all 
           aware and jealous of Macci’s new arrivals. The buzz in the 
           air is electric and envious. 
                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Now, this won’t happen everyday, 
                        but by chance since she’s here - I 
                        thought you might like to hit. Jen! 
                        Come on over. 

           The girls turn in instant recognition to see 15-YEAR-OLD, #6 
           in the world, JENNIFER CAPRIATI jogging over. 

                                 CAPRIATI
                        Hey girls. Nice to meet you. Rick 
                        says you’re really good. Wanna hit?

           Venus and Serena look at Richard, smiles bursting. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Have fun. Just go easy on her. 

           The girls follow Jennifer to a court and begin to play. We 
           stay with Richard and Macci, watching from a far. 

                                 MACCI
                        That’s the model right there. We 
                        follow Jennifer’s path. We got some 
                        work to do before the Easter bowl.

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s fine. She ain’t playing the 
                        Easter Bowl.

                                 MACCI
                        You got another tournament in mind? 

                                 RICHARD
                        No. They’re done playing Juniors. 
                        No more matches till they’re pro. 

           Macci laughs. 

                                 MACCI
                        You’re kidding? And when’s that?

                                 RICHARD
                        When I say they’re ready. We ain’t 
                        rushing this thing, Rick. 

           Macci realizes Richard’s serious. He’s not laughing anymore.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        What the heck do you think they’re 
                        gonna do for the next couple years?
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Go to school. Go to church. And 
                        practice with you. 

                                 MACCI
                        Richard, the whole thing is 
                        juniors. Competition. Adversity. 
                        That’s where they learn to compete. 

                                 RICHARD
                        They know how to compete. These 
                        girls’ll run over broken glass to 
                        get a ball. You don’t worry about 
                        that. What they need is to be kids. 

                                 MACCI
                        To be kids? Richard, you’re nuts. I 
                        can’t mold ‘em like that. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Sure you can, you’re the best. 
                        Ain’t nothing you can’t do. But if 
                        you want us to talk to Nic then --

           Macci is furious, realizing he’s been played. Venus, 
           distracted from her match, watches the argument with concern. 

                                 MACCI
                        I guess you don’t wanna talk about 
                        sponsorship either?

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s just more pressure. We take 
                        it slow. We get ‘em smart. We let 
                        ‘em be kids, and these girls’ll be 
                        playing when your old ass and me is 
                        in the grave. I guarantee.

                                 MACCI
                             (livid)
                        You might have mentioned all this 
                        in Compton. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I might have I guess. 

           For Richard, the conversation is over. He starts to head off.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Excited to be here, Rick. Thanks 
                        for Jennifer. That’s a treat.

           He walks over to his girls, leaving Macci in the wake of the 
           bomb he just dropped. Barry, the hitting coach comes over. 
                                 BARRY
                        No tournaments?

                                 MACCI
                        He’ll come around. We got time. 

                                 BARRY
                        Hope so. Pretty big bet you made. 

           Off Macci. Only day one and already behind the eight ball as 
           the first beats of KENDRICK LAMAR’S KING KUNTA take us into:

           A MONTAGE: THE GRENELEFE YEARS

           - NEWS FOOTAGE SHOWS: an ESPN REPORTER outside Macci’s club.

                                 ESPN REPORTER (PRE-LAP)
                        Richard Williams, the outspoken 
                        father of two of junior tennis' top 
                        prospects, is no stranger to 
                        controversy. 

           - Richard’s interviewed by a REPORTER for the NY TIMES. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Next time you see a 14-year-old go 
                        professional, someone should shoot 
                        the parents. 

           - Richard’s interviewed on camera by a EUROPEAN NEWS CREW.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        How good can they be? They’ll be 
                        the greatest players ever cause 
                        they got the greatest coach. Me.

           - THE ESPN REPORTER continues, strolling Grenelefe’s grounds.

                                 ESPN REPORTER
                        His unorthodox coaching and 
                        bombastic claims have raised quite 
                        a few eyebrows, but nothing 
                        compared to what he’s saying now.

           - Richard’s interviewed on NIGHTLINE by TED KOPPLE.

                                 RICHARD
                        When somebody come to me and tell 
                        me how good my daughter is, the 
                        only reason they see good is cause 
                        they see money that could go in 
                        their pocket.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        I've been broke all my life, and 
                        Venus doesn't want to be poor, but 
                        nobody going to push our daughter 
                        into anything.

           - THE ESPN REPORTER now strolls across Macci’s tennis courts.

                                 ESPN REPORTER
                        Despite having no tennis background 
                        himself, Richard’s ignored the 
                        advice of experts and taken the 
                        extraordinary step of pulling his 
                        talented kids out of junior 
                        tournament tennis, which is the 
                        normal conduit to tennis’ big time. 
                        So while other top prospects like 
                        Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova 
                        rack up experience on the sport’s 
                        most prestigious stages --

           - 13-year-old Swiss prodigy MARTINA HINGIS raises the 
           trophies at JUNIOR WIMBLEDON and the JUNIOR FRENCH OPEN and --

           - 12-year-old ANNA KOURNIKOVA, tennis’ Lolita, destroys 
           opponents in the EUROPEAN JUNIORS --

                                 ESPN REPORTER (V.O.)
                        -- and sign lucrative endorsement 
                        deals --

           - Hingis hocks Yonex. Tacchini. Kournikova, Adidas.

                                 ESPN REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Richard Williams’ daughters 
                        practice here, in isolation, at the 
                        Rick Macci Academy.  

           - 40 hours a week. 52 weeks a year. For three long years. 
           Venus and Serena hone their skills in seclusion at Grenelefe.  

           - They work their volleys on court while Macci barks orders. 

                                 MACCI
                        Get low or you’re gonna get 
                        tattooed.

           - They throw their rackets over the net like footballs as 
           Richard applauds. Capriati watches them, dying with laughter. 

           - They hula hoop, kick box, and spar in a sand pit with SWEET 
           PEA COWART, Florida’s welter weight champ.

           - They practice on clay and on grass but never play a match.
                                 ESPN REPORTER  (V.O.)
                        And while his coaching ideas have 
                        pros shaking their heads, Richard 
                        remains adamant that he alone knows 
                        what’s best, putting church, 
                        education, and childhood first. 

           - They attend church as a family.

           - They do homework at Grenelefe with Brandi at lunch as --  

                                 ESPN REPORTER (V.O.)
                        The real question remains, is 
                        Richard William’s right?

           - Richard’s interviewed at Grenelefe by an o.s. REPORTER.

                                 ESPN REPORTER (O.S.)
                        You think these kids will make a 
                        million dollars?

                                 RICHARD
                        There’s no question about it. 
                        They’ll make one million look 
                        small. They’ll both be number one 
                        in the world. I don’t see anything 
                        that can stop ‘em. 

           - The Reporter wraps his package up back where he began.

                                 ESPN REPORTER
                        The words of a proud father, or a 
                        shrewd hype-man building a myth? 
                        For now, no one knows. But sooner 
                        or later, it’s not Richard, but his 
                        girl’s who’ll have to answer that 
                        question on the court. 

           KENDRICK’S SONG ENDS as we close the MONTAGE ON: 

           - Venus, serving at the line, with Macci at her side, like 
           Ivan Drago, pounding balls like they’re the faces of her 
           detractors. Chomping at the bit like an angry, caged animal.

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Again and again and again until we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           14 YEAR-OLD VENUS SMASHING A SERVE OUT OF THE SKY AS --
           EXT. TENNIS COURTS, GRENELEFE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Now it’s three years later. Venus is three years older. A 
           foot taller. Muscled. Lean. Her braids are gone, replaced 
           with BEADS and BRACES as she blows the ball of the court. 

           TITLE CARD READS:  THREE YEARS LATER

           Macci stands at her side at the service line, handing her 
           balls, still sporting the same puppy-dog energy and style. 

                                 MACCI
                        Nice one. Nice one. Now high five 
                        the giant and get to the net and 
                        remember stay low unless you wanna 
                        get tattooed.

           Venus laughs then crushes the serve, crashing the net, 
           putting away a volley that nearly takes off her head.  

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        What’d I tell you. Almost had a 
                        PENN 1 tattoo on your forehead. 
                        That’s one way to get sponsored.

           Venus laughs as Macci gives her a high five. It turns into a 
           hug. In the time that’s passed, these two have grown close. 

           As they walk off the court, Venus becomes aware of --

           A buzz in the air. MEDIA, AGENTS, OTHER KIDS at the academy 
           all moving toward the large stadium court. A MATCH UNDER WAY. 

                                 VENUS
                        What’s going on?

                                 MACCI
                        Big junior tournament. Continental 
                        Cup. Kournikova’s here. 

           That gets her attention. She hurries to the match to see -- 

                                 VENUS
                        She’s so little in person. I would 
                        killer her. 

           She’s eyeing 12-year-old Anna Kournikova, preening around the 
           court. Venus brims with envy. 

                                 VENUS (CONT’D)
                        You know she’s going pro next month 
                        at a Fed Cup event in Russia? 
                        Hingis announced too. That oughta 
                        be me. 
                                 MACCI
                        You wanna go to Russia?

                                 VENUS
                        I’m serious. How long I gotta wait?

                                 MACCI
                        Hey, you know what I think. You’re 
                        preaching to the choir. I know  
                        you’re ready.

                                 VENUS
                        Will you talk to him again? He 
                        won’t listen to me. 

           Macci nods, but knows it won’t be easy as --

           EXT. LOW INCOME FLORIDA COURT - ANOTHER DAY

           REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS swarm a low income TENNIS COURT 
           where Venus and 12-YEAR-OLD SERENA (still small and bulldog-
           ish) are running a TENNIS CLINIC for inner-city kids.

           Macci watches from the fence as Richard speaks to a REPORTER.

                                 RICHARD
                        -- and that’s why we ain’t rushing. 
                        With no education, as good as they 
                        are, they won’t keep their money. 
                        They’ll be broke by 18 and have 50 
                        more years to live like a fool. Now 
                        if you’ll excuse me, I got a 
                        meeting.

           Richard heads off to meet Macci. The Reporter is speechless.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        How we doing there, Rick? You come 
                        to help out?

                                 MACCI
                        Maybe later. We gotta talk. I’ve 
                        been chatting again with Venus and -

           Richard turns away - here we go again. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Rick, I told you before. I’m not 
                        having this conversation again. 

                                 MACCI
                             (following)
                        Richard, she’s ready. Time to let 
                        her off the leash.

                        I talked to the organizer, there’s 
                        a tournament in LA in September and 
                        they’ll give her a wild card if she 
                        -- 

                                 RICHARD
                        You talked to who? You don’t tell 
                        me when it’s time. 

                                 MACCI
                        Richard, she’s already fourteen. 
                        Hingis is gone. Kournikova’s going 
                        soon. Jennifer’d already been 
                        playing a year by now. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You mean Jennifer who just dropped 
                        off the tour? 

                                 MACCI
                        She didn’t drop off. She’s taking a 
                        break. 

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s not what I hear. I hear 
                        she’s burnt out. Now, that’s what 
                        I’ve been saying. You have these 
                        girls in juniors, you push ‘em too 
                        fast and they all fall apart -- 

                                 MACCI
                        Richard, Jennifer’s fine. Stop 
                        making excuses. We’ve been playing 
                        these games for three years. 

                                 RICHARD
                        These games?

           Macci shoots him a look - are you serious?

                                 MACCI
                        You pull ‘em out of juniors. You 
                        pull ‘em out of practice for music 
                        lessons or homework or church or --

                                 RICHARD
                        They gotta get A’s if they wanna 
                        play tennis. That’s the rules. 

                                 MACCI
                        -- or you pull ‘em out to train 
                        with other coaches behind my back --
                                 RICHARD
                        They needed work on their volleys. 

                                 MACCI
                        I’M WORKING ON THEIR VOLLEYS! I’m 
                        their goddamn coach. Stop jerking 
                        me around!

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m just rounding out their game, 
                        Rick. They ain’t gonna get there 
                        doing drills that ever junior in 
                        America is doing. I’m sorry. I’m 
                        just looking out for my kids. 

           Macci just shakes his head. Unbelievable. 

                                 MACCI
                        You’re not looking out for them. 
                        You’re looking out for yourself. 
                        Wanna talk about pressure, what do 
                        you think you call that?

           Macci’s pointing to the reporters crowding the courts. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Everyday, on TV, know what I see? 
                        The Richard Williams show. A 
                        million dollars. Number one. The 
                        greatest ever. You don’t think 
                        that’s pressure?

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s confidence. 

                                 MACCI
                        It’s bullshit. And it’s about you. 

           Pissed, Richard starts off. Macci stops him. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it, Richard. Wait. You 
                        wanna jerk my chain around, fine. I 
                        don’t understand it, but don’t do 
                        it with them. She’s worked too 
                        hard. It’s her life, and you don’t 
                        let her play, you could lose her. 
                             (beat)
                        She’s ready. Think about it. 
                        Please.  

           Richard’s left with a lot to consider as Macci heads off, 
           passing Venus on the court, waiting eagerly for an answer. 
           Macci shoots her a thumbs up - we got this. Don’t worry. He 
           thinks he’s got through to him only a few days later --

                        At 14 years-old, Jennifer Capriatti 
                        was America’s rising superstar but 
                        four years later, Capriati’s life 
                        appears to have changed 
                        dramatically.

           A NEWS REPORT IS ON TV. Richard watches it through cigarette 
           smoke, his dentures resting on a little dish on the table.

           ON SCREEN: Police lights swirl outside THE GABLES INN. A $50 
           a night fleabag motel in Southern Florida.

                        Capriati was arrested and charged 
                        with possession of marijuana while 
                        two of her companions faced more 
                        serious legal consequences relating 
                        to crack cocaine and heroin. It was 
                        the second arrest for the troubled 
                        tennis star in only six months. 

           Capriati’s infamous MUGSHOT fills the screen. A troubled 18-
           year-old kid, lost and screaming for help. 

           Richard views it through smoke, decisions forming and --

           Arriving for practice, Macci walks on the court to find his 
           assistant serving balls by himself. 

                                 MACCI
                        Where are they?

                        Disney World. Richard said they 
                        needed a break. 

           Macci hangs his head in disbelief. This fucking guy. 
           EXT. WILLIAMS’S HAINES CITY HOUSE - DAY

           Macci leans against the hood of his car, parked outside, 
           waiting as -- A BRAND NEW RED CADILLAC pulls up the drive. 

           Richard, Brandi, Venus, and Serena get out of the car. The 
           girls wear MICKEY MOUSE EARS. 

                                 MACCI
                        Everyone have fun? 

                                 SERENA
                        I rode on Magic Mountain. 

                                 MACCI
                        That’s great. Richard, a minute. 

                                 BRANDI
                        Come on girls. Let’s finish your 
                        homework.

           Brandi leads the girls away leaving Richard with Rick. 

                                 MACCI
                        Disney World? Richard --

                                 RICHARD
                        I made up my mind. She’s not 
                        playing that tournament. 

                                 VENUS
                        What?! Daddy, but you said --

                                 RICHARD
                        I know. And I’m sorry. But I’m your 
                        father and I ain’t burning you out 
                        like he did with Capriati. 

                                 MACCI
                        Like I did?

                                 RICHARD
                        You coached her didn’t you? That’s 
                        all you been saying. Look at 
                        Jennifer. Look at Jennifer. Well 
                        look at her now. Robbery. Arrested. 
                        Venus ain’t ending up smoking crack 
                        in some alley with her mugshot on 
                        TV. That’s what happens when they 
                        don’t get to be kids. 

           Boiling with anger, Venus turns and storms off, not wanting 
           her father to see her cry.
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Venus! -- Venus!

           But there’s no stopping her. Richard’s left with Macci. 

                                 MACCI
                        I’ll tell you what, man. You gotta 
                        better curve ball than Greg Maddox. 
                        I told you this would happen. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Nothing personal, Rick. Just gotta 
                        keep ‘em off balance. 

                                 MACCI
                        Not your teammates, you don’t. 

           Macci heads off passing Richard’s new Cadillac on the way. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Nice car. Who’s paying for that? 

           Macci gets in his car. SLAMS the door. Peels out, leaving 
           Richard alone in the shadow of his home.

           INT. VENUS AND SERENA’S ROOM, WILLIAMS'S FLORIDA HOME - NIGHT

           Brandi is braiding Venus’ hair, consoling her as she cries in 
           her bed, surrounded by dolls, looking very much like a kid. 

                                 VENUS
                        It’s not fair. It’s my life. 

                                 BRANDI
                        You don’t need to tell me that your 
                        father’s a hard man. I married him. 

                                 VENUS
                        Why?

           Brandi and Serena, sitting on her bed, laugh as Richard 
           arrives in the door. They turn on him immediately. 

                                 VENUS (CONT’D)
                        You’re not fair. Why’d you start 
                        this in the first place if you 
                        weren’t gonna let me play? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Maybe I shouldn’t have. Maybe it 
                        was a mistake. 
                                 VENUS
                        Why? Because you think I’m not 
                        ready?

                                 RICHARD
                        Cause I think y’all are kids and 
                        you go pro, that’s all over. The 
                        pressure. The reporters. That’ll 
                        all be on you. 

                                 VENUS
                        You mean instead of on you?

                                 RICHARD
                        Watch it girl.

           Richard looks like he might snap.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        I’m still you’re father. Long as 
                        you live in my house, you gonna 
                        respect what I say. 

                                 VENUS
                        Maybe I don’t wanna live in this 
                        house no more. Least then I’d have 
                        a life of my own. 

           Venus storms out of the room. Serena lingers a beat, then 
           follows her sister, leaving Richard and Brandi alone.

           After a long silent moment -- 

                                 BRANDI
                        You know that she’s right. This 
                        can’t be about you. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I ain’t changing my mind. I’m done 
                        talking about this. 

                                 BRANDI
                        You may be done talking, but you 
                        sure ain’t done listening. You know 
                        your problem Richard? For all your 
                        ego, and bragging, I think you’re 
                        just scared. All these years being 
                        broke, people cutting you down and 
                        beating you up, saying you nothing, 
                        now I think you believe ‘em. 

           Richard laughs, just shaking his head only --
                                 BRANDI (CONT’D)
                        You think I don’t see it? You maybe 
                        fooling those people on TV with 
                        your hype and your anger and your 
                        Richard know best but you’re not 
                        fooling me. You got a chip on your 
                        shoulder so big, I could see it 
                        from space but you gotta let that 
                        go. How you gonna prove the world 
                        wrong, you don’t believe in 
                        yourself?

           Richard slows, his target struck. 

                                 BRANDI (CONT'D)
                        I know you love those girls and you 
                        wanna protect ‘em but you don’t 
                        figure that out, you’re just gonna 
                        hurt ‘em.
                             (beat)
                        You scared of the world and the 
                        only thing you’re doing by telling 
                        her no is saying she should be too 
                        and I won’t have it. 
                             (beat, both emotional)
                        Now, I didn’t want this for her in 
                        the first place and I don’t want to 
                        let them go either but we raised 
                        these girls to think for themselves 
                        and be proud and at some point, 
                        Richard, you’re gonna have to let 
                        ‘em, cause you don’t, then Macci is 
                        right -- you’re gonna lose ‘em.

           With that Brandi goes, leaving Richard alone, grappling with 
           unfamiliar feelings. Uncertainty. 

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDY, WILLIAMS'S HAINES CITY HOUSE - LATER

           Alone with his doubts and his lifetime of wounds, Richard 
           enters his study just steaming with anger. 

           Like many years before, he finds his desk littered in decades 
           of tennis research and plans and clippings about his girls. 

           Quite distraught, Richard smokes, flipping through it. SPORTS 
           ILLUSTRATED. The NY TIMES ARTICLE. Then something stops him. 

           Hidden among the clutter and fast food wrappers -- is a VHS. 
           Richard considers it, heavy with emotion as: 

           MOMENTS LATER
           Richard smokes in the flicker of the TV as the video starts. 
           We recognize it immediately. 

                                 RICHARD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hi Vic Braden. This two girls that 
                        you see in the picture here is er -- 

           ON A TV: 8-year-old Venus and 7-year-old Serena, bubbly and 
           free, wave at the camera from Lynwood park. 

                                 RICHARD’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Serena Williams. Raise your hand 
                        Serena. Venus Williams. Serena is 7-
                        years-old. Venus is 8-years-old. 

           They couldn’t be more adorable or carefree as they play in 
           the park. 

           Richard watches, overcome at the sight them. Little girls. 
           Unafraid. In love with their Daddy. A long time ago.

           His eyes mist as they hug him on screen, remembering the 
           past, afraid of the future, but time to let go as -- 

           INT. GRENELEFE COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Bathed in sweat, Macci finishes a run. He looks like William 
           Hurt in Body Heat. His assistant is waiting for him. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Rick. Just got a fax from Anne 
                        Worchester at the WTA. Think you’re 
                        gonna wanna see this.

                                 MACCI
                             (catching his breath)
                        What’s it say?

           EXT. WILLIAMS'S HAINES CITY HOUSE - DAY

           Macci is seated with Venus, Brandi, Richard, and Serena at a 
           picnic table outside their house. He’s showing them the FAX. 

                                 MACCI
                        They’re calling it “The Capriati 
                        Rule.”

           He waits a minute to acknowledge Richard’s eye roll. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Basically it says a player can no 
                        longer turn pro at 14. 

           Richard is delighted only --
                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Not so fast. For this one time 
                        only, they’re offering waivers to 
                        Hingis, Anna, and Venus. If they 
                        turn pro this year, the new rules 
                        don’t apply. If they don’t --

           Richard now sees what’s coming.  

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        -- the WTA will limit when, where, 
                        and how much you can play for the 
                        next four years. Until you turn 18, 
                        Venus, they’ll be in control. 
                        Martina and Anna won’t have those 
                        limitations. 

           The weight of that hits Venus hard. It hits all of ‘em. 

                                 SERENA
                        What’s it mean for me? 

                                 MACCI
                        Unfortunately, for you, there’s no 
                        way around it. By the time you’re 
                        ready, those will be the rules. 

           Serena scowls as Macci returns to the matter at hand. Venus. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        Now I know it’s ironic, but if you 
                        don’t want them telling you what 
                        you can and can not do, you need to 
                        do what they want.
                             (that hangs there a bit)
                        Four years is a long time. You 
                        don’t know what could happen. 

           INT. VENUS’S BEDROOM, WILLIAMS'S FLORIDA HOME - NIGHT

           Venus is on her bed, playing with her DOLLS when Richard 
           appears in the doorway. He watches her for a moment, taken 
           with her innocence, before announcing his presence.

                                 VENUS
                        Why don’t you believe in me?

                                 RICHARD
                        Is that what you think?

                                 VENUS
                        I don’t see any other reason you 
                        don’t want me to play. 
                                 RICHARD
                        I thought I raised you smarter than 
                        that, girl. 

           Richard takes a seat beside her. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Move over. Make room for your old 
                        dad. 
                             (after she does)
                        Venus, I don’t want you to rush 
                        this now because I do believe in 
                        you. Four years. Ten years. It 
                        doesn’t matter. Whenever you start, 
                        you are gonna win. 

                                 VENUS
                        It’s not cause you think I’m gonna 
                        let you down?

                                 RICHARD
                        You could never let me down, not if 
                        you never swing another tennis 
                        racket again in your life. The girl 
                        you are now, that’s what I’m proud 
                        of. That’s all I’m trying to 
                        protect. It’s hard enough out there 
                        for these other girls and they 
                        don’t have one tenth of the weight 
                        on their shoulders as you. Part of 
                        that’s my fault, but part is who 
                        you are. Truth is, because you’re 
                        black, you don’t just represent 
                        yourself. You gonna represent all 
                        of us, all the hopes of those 
                        little girls whose doors you gonna 
                        open. That’s a lot of pressure.

                                 VENUS
                        You don’t think I can handle it?

                                 RICHARD
                        Truth -- I don’t know if I can.
                        But it ain’t gonna be me on the 
                        court.
                             (beat)
                        V, you know how I feel, but if it’s 
                        what you want, I ain’t gonna stand 
                        in your way. This ain’t about me 
                        anymore. 

           Venus starts to cry, overcome with gratitude. 
                                 VENUS
                        Daddy, I’m ready. You taught us to 
                        be strong and believe in ourselves. 
                        I’m not gonna let you down.  

           Richard considers his daughter. Confident and strong. 
           Everything he wants to be as we hear --

                        Venus Williams, the 14-year-old 
                        tennis prodigy who hasn't played a 
                        competitive match since leaving 
                        Compton, California three years ago 
                        will make her professional debut at 
                        the end of this month in Oakland, 
                        California, at the $400,000 Bank of 
                        the West Classic.

           FOOTAGE CUTS TO AN INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD. 

                                 RICHARD (ON SCREEN)
                        She wants to test the waters and 
                        see where she is on a professional 
                        level. It's my feeling that a 14-
                        year-old shouldn't play, but this 
                        is her decision, so she's going to 
                        turn professional on her home 
                        ground in California. We’ll see you 
                        there soon!

           A car horn honking. Macci’s outside, laying on the horn of 
           his car. Looking at his watch as --

           INT. WILLIAMS’S HAINES CITY HOME - DAY

           Richard’s moving through the house, rounding up the troops, 
           shepherding everyone to the door with their LUGGAGE. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. Gravy 
                        train won’t wait.

           He arrives at Venus’s room to find her packing her bags. 
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Make sure you don’t forget nothing 
                        now. Won’t be me out there playing 
                        naked if you do.

           Venus laughs, just shaking her head. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        You seen your sister? She gotta 
                        pack too. 

           Off Venus’s knowing look we hear:

           EXT. GRENELEFE, TENNIS COURTS - DAY

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Balls exploding with a fury off of -- 

           Serena’s racket as she crushes backhands down the line, alone 
           on the court, taking out her problems on the ball machine. 

           Richard approaches as she obliterates the last ball with an 
           anger he should find familiar. She kneels over, steaming and 
           exhausted. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Looking good. Where’s your bag? 
                        We’re gonna miss the flight. 

           Serena shoots him daggers, then begins refilling the machine.

                                 SERENA
                        I gotta practice. I’m not going. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh, you’re not? Well OK. I hope you 
                        know how to cook for yourself cause 
                        there ain’t gonna be no one here. 

           Bluffing, Richard starts to walk off. 

                                 SERENA
                        You would leave me here, wouldn’t 
                        you? Like anyone would notice. You 
                        left those other kids. 

           That stops Richard cold. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Is that what this is about? You 
                        think I’m leaving you?

           Serena doesn’t answer, just lets that simmer. 
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t proud, but you right. I 
                        made a mistake with that family. 
                        I’ve made a lot. You wanna judge me 
                        for that, I can’t stop you, but I 
                        hope you’ll remember I done a bit 
                        of good too.

                                 SERENA
                        Like what? 

                                 RICHARD
                        Like you. 

                                 SERENA
                        Yeah, right. All anyone cares about 
                        is Venus.

           She returns to baseline to keep hitting. Richard understands. 

                                 RICHARD
                        What? You think you’re ready too?
                             (of course she does)
                        And you feel like no one’s 
                        listening? No one’s watching? No 
                        one cares? Is that right? 
                             (it is of course)
                        I know you love your sister, but 
                        it’s hard being in someone’s 
                        shadow, ain’t it. Specially hers. 
                        Means you gotta work a little 
                        harder, don’t it. Be a little 
                        tougher. Fight a little longer just 
                        to make yourself seen. Almost, 
                        makes you want it even badder, 
                        don’t it?

           Serena nods, maybe starting to realize what he’s up to. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Serena, what’s the one thing I been 
                        telling you all your life? 

                                 SERENA
                        I gotta move my feet. 

                                 RICHARD
                             (smiles)
                        What else? -- You fail to plan --

                                 SERENA
                        -- “you plan to fail.” So?  
                                 RICHARD
                        You ever know me to get out 
                        planned?
                             (no)
                        Your sister will be number one in 
                        the world. There’s no doubt about 
                        it. But you -- you gonna be the 
                        best there ever was. The greatest 
                        of all time. And you know how I 
                        know? Cause I planned for it. 
                        You’ve been in Venus shadow on 
                        purpose, cause I knew you were 
                        tough. Cause I knew it would make 
                        you a fighter and look at you now.

           Serena is smiling and fighting back tears. 

                                 SERENA
                        That really what you been doing?

                                 RICHARD
                             (nods)
                        I might tell a lot of tales, but I 
                        don’t tell ‘em to you. 
                             (she believes)
                        Whatever I do, I will never leave 
                        you. Now go on and grab your bag. 
                        Your sister’s got a match. It’s 
                        time to go home. 

           Off Serena, seeing the plan. Seeing her future and --

           EXT. CALIFORNIA SKY - DAY

           A PLANE unzips a crystal blue sky above Oakland, California 
           where two enormous SPORTING ARENAS hover like spaceships.

           THE OAKLAND COLOSSEUM and the OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA.

           EXT. THE OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - DAY

           The ARENA looms above an absolutely packed parking lot. FANS, 
           MEDIA, and PRESS are everywhere. 

           Venus, Richard, Brandi, Serena, and Macci step out of a CAB 
           into the heart of the spectacle. Venus is wide-eyed. 

                                 VENUS
                        Don’t tell me all this is for me?

           Brandi laughs. 
                                 BRANDI
                        Easy honey. You’re not a Rock Star 
                        yet. 

           She directs Venus’s eyes to a big BUDWEISER SIGN flashing 
           overhead. It reads: ROLLING STONES - TONIGHT - 7PM

           BANK OF THE WEST TENNIS CLASSIC flashes a distant second.

           The family laughs. Venus’s brought down to earth. Not for 
           long as --

           INT. THE OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - DAY

           Venus and her team enter the basketball arena which has been 
           transformed into an indoor tennis cathedral. 

           20,000 seats ring a blue-floored hard court where PRESS, TV 
           CREWS and PLAYERS mill prepare for the upcoming event. Their 
           heads all turning as the Williams family arrives. 

           Venus and Serena look up in awe at the size of their stage. A 
           young, Madonna-esque BLEACHED HAIRED WTA OFFICIAL approaches. 
           (This is ANNE PERSON WORCESTER - CEO WTA TOUR.)

                                 ANNE WORCESTER
                        Hi there! Hi Rick. 
                             (then to the family)
                        I’m Anne. We spoke on the phone. 

           She shakes hands with the Williamses. Ending on Venus.

                                 VENUS
                        Hi Anne, I’m Venus. 

                                 TOURNAMENT OFFICIAL 
                        Of course you are, honey. We’ve 
                        been expecting you. I think they 
                        have been too. 

           She gestures behind her, where a hush has fallen over the 
           crowd, all eyes trained on Venus, who perhaps only now 
           realizes just how big her spotlight is. 

           EXT. OUTDOOR PRACTICE COURT - DAY

           THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE (Fans, Press, Sponsors, and Agents - a 
           few we’ve met before) surround the fence of the tournament’s 
           PRACTICE COURTS, getting their first look in three years at 
           VENUS AND SERENA IN ACTION. 

           And they are putting on a show, hitting the ball like a 
           fucking sledge hammer, covering the court like gazelles. 
           Venus’s blue-beaded-braids CLICKING and SWINGING beneath a LA 
           RAIDERS HAT as she SMASHES a lob out of the air like Jordan, 
           just fucking dunking on people.

           We see it on the faces of the crowd. She looks like nothing 
           else on the tour. A lion finally let out of her cage.

           Angle on Macci, Richard, and Keven Davis watching giddily. 

                                 MACCI
                        Last year they gave out 24 media 
                        credentials. This year, over 200. 

                                 KEVEN
                        And this is all for her? 

                                 MACCI
                             (looking at Richard)
                        Guy knows how to start a fire. 

           They return to watching Venus and Serena ooh and ah the 
           crowds when two POLO SHIRTED MEN approach.

                                 GIACCO
                        Richard. Bill Giacco from ProServe. 
                        We’ve spoke on the phone. Good to 
                        see you.
                             (Shaking Richard’s hand)
                        I wanted to introduce you to a 
                        friend. Mike Williams. He’s with 
                        Nike. He was hoping you might have 
                        a minute to talk. 

           Off Richard, who can practically see their mouths watering.

           EXT. OAKLAND HOTEL - NIGHT, ESTABLISHING

           A simple business hotel by the stadium lit up in the night.

                                 NIKE REP (PRE-LAP)
                        I hope it’s clear from what you’re 
                        reading, how highly we regard your 
                        daughter. We’d like to take her off 
                        the table right now.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Richard, Venus, Macci, Brandi, and Keven Davis are seated 
           across from MIKE WILLIAMS, the NIKE REP. They’ve just been 
           handed an offer. 
                                 MIKE WILLIAMS
                        That’s THREE MILLION DOLLARS and 
                        the promise to create a signature 
                        line, a signature shoe -- to build 
                        our women’s brand around Venus and 
                        make her a marquee player. How does 
                        that sound to you?

           The Rep looks for an answer from Richard, but he defers.

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t know why you’re looking at 
                        me. She’s the one you’re pitching.

           Mike’s shook. He recalibrates. Turns to Venus. 

                                 MIKE WILLIAMS
                        What do you think, Venus? That’s a 
                        generous deal. That’s one million 
                        more than Capriati got before she 
                        went pro, plus a real commitment to 
                        invest in all the charity and 
                        outreach programs I know you and 
                        your family support. We believe you 
                        are going to have a tremendous 
                        career and we’d like to help you 
                        start building it today. 

           This sounds pretty good. Venus is silent, but Mike thinks 
           he’s got her. Macci chimes in. 

                                 MACCI
                        That’s a good looking deal, V. Very 
                        fair. You want my two-cents, I 
                        think you should sign. 

           But Venus isn’t jumping. A long beat. Keven turns to the rep. 

                                 KEVEN
                        Maybe give us a minute. 

                                 NIKE REP
                        Of course. Think it over. You got 
                        my number, but just so we’re clear. 
                        That deal’s for tonight only. It’s 
                        off the table tomorrow. 

           The rep shakes hands and leaves. Once he’s gone -- 

                                 MACCI
                        Am I missing something here? What’s 
                        the problem? This is it. Sign the 
                        deal. Take the money. 
                                 VENUS
                        They haven’t even seen me play. 

                                 MACCI
                        Exactly. They don’t need to. 
                        Richard, I thought you were crazy, 
                        but you did it. You’ve already won. 

                                 VENUS
                        But it’s just the first offer. They 
                        want me to cash out before they’ve 
                        even seen what I can do. 

           Macci looks at Richard, sending him daggers. 

                                 MACCI
                        Venus. Listen -- 

                                 VENUS
                        I understand. It’s a good offer for 
                        never having played but --

                                 MACCI
                        It’s an unbelievable offer. 

                                 VENUS
                        -- but if I win, it’ll be higher 
                        won’t it? Won’t it?

                                 MACCI
                             (conceding)
                        Yes. If you win, it might be 
                        higher. But this is money in your 
                        pocket that can change your life no 
                        matter what. Don’t risk that.

           For the first time, Venus waivers. She turns to Richard who 
           does not. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You’re asking this girl to take all 
                        the hard work she done did for ten 
                        years and take the first damn offer 
                        they give her? That ain’t right and 
                        you know it. She wants a chance to 
                        compete. 

                                 KEVEN
                        Richard --

                                 MACCI
                        The draw’s not even out yet. We 
                        don’t know who she’s playing! 
                                 RICHARD
                        It ain’t about that. 
                             (to Venus)
                        You care who you play? 

                                 VENUS
                        No, Daddy.

                                 RICHARD
                        You gonna beat whoever it is? 

                                 VENUS
                        Yes, Daddy. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Do you wanna take this deal right 
                        here?

                                 VENUS
                        No, Daddy. 

                                 RICHARD
                             (to the others)
                        Well that’s it. She ain’t signing. 

           Off Macci, left absolutely speechless as --

           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Richard, Brandi and Venus head out of the room. Macci follows 
           them into the hall. 

                                 MACCI
                        Richard. Hold on. Wait. 

           Richard stops. Macci waits till Venus is out of earshot then -

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        I know we’ve had our disagreements, 
                        but that’s all in the past. Forget 
                        my deal. Take this money. You can 
                        change their lives tonight. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You don’t think she’s good enough?

                                 MACCI
                        I do. You know that. But the truth 
                        is, it’s been three years -- when 
                        she gets on the court, in a real 
                        match against a pro, with all the 
                        cameras and pressure -- you just 
                        don’t know what’s going to happen. 
                                 RICHARD
                        She ain’t other players. She’ll be 
                        fine.

                                 MACCI
                        You don’t know that. That’s why you 
                        play juniors. That’s why you get 
                        tested. 
                             (Richard turns away)
                        Listen to me, damn it. You are a 
                        good father, but you’ve put her in 
                        a spot. You’ve spent the last three 
                        years building this myth -- all the 
                        Wimbledons. All the titles. The 
                        greatest ever -- you set the bar so 
                        high that if she goes out there and 
                        does anything less than set the 
                        goddamn world on fire, she’s gonna 
                        be a disappointment. 

           That gets Richard’s attention. 

                                 MACCI (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. It’s true. 
                             (now quieter)
                        And if she goes out there and gets 
                        tight and can’t keep the ball on 
                        the court or gets the yips, that 
                        bubble you built is gonna pop very 
                        fast and that deal won’t just go 
                        down, it will go away all together. 
                        They all will. You will lose 
                        everything. And it won’t be her 
                        fault. It will be yours. You always 
                        talk about pressure, take it off 
                        her now and sign the fucking deal. 

           With that, Macci goes. Leaving Richard in the hall, the 
           weight of the world on his shoulders. 

           He joins Brandi and his daughter at elevator, feigning calm.

                                 RICHARD
                        You’ve got nothing to worry about. 
                        Tomorrow’s just a game. 

           But this time, no one is buying that as we -- DISSOLVE TO:                  

           INT. GYMNASIUM, CASTLEMONT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A HUNDRED BLACK TEENAGERS filling the bleachers, listening 
           with a mix of inspiration and confusion to --
           Venus, standing behind a mic at center court, holding a 
           tennis racket as a prop, addressing them with quiet poise. 

                                 VENUS
                        -- I guess I’m younger than a lot 
                        of you but if I could give one 
                        piece of advice I guess it would 
                        be, make a plan. Plan for your life 
                        and be the best you can be and -- 
                        that’s it, I guess. Thanks for not 
                        talking and laughing when I talk. 
                        Because, a lot of people do that.

           The KIDS applaud. Shooting their hands up for questions. The 
           first one that comes is -- 

                                 FEMALE STUDENT
                        Who you playing tomorrow Venus?

           EXT. CASTLEMONT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Venus signs a last few autographs as the Williams’s entourage 
           exits the large OAKLAND PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL and heads to --

           THE PARKING LOT where they find Macci waiting by their CAR.

                                 MACCI
                        Am I getting daffy or did you have 
                        a different car yesterday? 

                                 RICHARD
                        I switched, case we being followed. 
                        Gotta keep ‘em guessing. 

                                 MACCI
                        Well we don’t have to guess 
                        anymore. I got the draw.  
                             (to Venus)
                        You got Shaun Stafford in the First 
                        Round. She’s a real player. 58 in 
                        the world. Won the NCAA Title a few 
                        years ago from Florida. She’s 
                        tough, but so are you. 

                                 VENUS
                        And who I play next?

                                 MACCI
                        Easy killer. One match at a time. 

           Venus heads to the car, heart pounding so loud we can hear 
           it. Richard remains with Macci and the draw. 
                                 RICHARD
                        She wins, who she get?

                        Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. 

                                 KEVEN
                        She’s number two in the world. 

                                 MACCI
                        Number one when the new rankings 
                        come out. You wanna shock the 
                        world, here’s your chance.

                        Just under the wire, 14-year-old 
                        Venus Williams will take the court 
                        tonight in what’s certainly the 
                        most anticipated tennis debut in 
                        years.

           EXT. OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Crowds begin to stream toward the night’s main events. At the 
           outdoor COLOSSEUM - THE ROLLING STONES. At the indoor ARENA - 
           the MARQUEE READS: 

            BANK OF THE WEST CLASSIC - FIRST ROUND - OCTOBER 31st, 1994

                                 TENNIS ANNOUNCER (PRE-LAP)
                        Shrouded in mystery like the 
                        distant planet that bares her name, 
                        crowds have come in force to see 
                        the herald phenom from Compton, 
                        California play her first match at 
                        any level in over three years.

           INT. OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT (VARIOUS SHOTS)

           The FANS are taking their seats. The PRESS are primed in 
           their boxes as high above the court --

           THE TV REPORTERS broadcast from the booth -- 

                                 TENNIS ANNOUNCER
                        It was their father, Richard 
                        Williams, who made the 
                        controversial decision to pull his 
                        daughters out of competition, a 
                        move he’s defended with an us-
                        against the world abrasiveness that 
                        has earned him few fans. 
           Back stage behind the courts, Richard, Venus, Brandi, Serena, 
           and Macci, arrive in the tunnels --

                                 TENNIS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Dogged by allegations of abuse, 
                        he’s been called everything from a 
                        genius to a villain to an 
                        overbearing tennis parent in love 
                        with the spotlight. Well, tonight, 
                        we’ll finally see. Is his dream all 
                        hype or is this family, in fact, 
                        what tennis has been waiting for?

           Head up and defiant, Richard leads Venus to the locker room, 
           like she’s Muhammed Ali, flashbulbs exploding all around her.

           This moment is iconic. 

           INT. LOCKERROOM OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Like Rocky before a fight, Venus bounces in place, spinning 
           her racket. Head full of nerves. She wears a plain pink t-
           shirt. A pleated floral skirt. Her racket has no stencils.

           The rooms silent when Macci enters. 

                                 MACCI
                        It’s time V, you ready?
                             (she is)
                        Is that what you’re wearing?

           All smiles, Venus spins to present it. 

                                 VENUS
                        Do you like it? My mom sewed the 
                        skirt herself. 

                                 MACCI
                        You look great. 
                             (sotto Richard)
                        Why don’t you just put a for sale 
                        sign on her?
                             (back to Venus)
                        I’ll see you out there. You’re 
                        gonna kill. Have fun. Don’t forget 
                        to bend your knees.

           Macci goes. We remain with Venus and her family. The moment 
           they’ve all been waiting for. Ten years in the making. The 
           magnitude isn’t lost on anyone. They’re all holding hands as -

                        Returning to her native California 
                        tonight to play in her first ever 
                        professional match --

           INT. OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Venus bounces in the mouth of the tunnel beside her 25-year-
           old opponent, SHAUN STAFFORD, waiting to take the court.

                                 ANNOUNCER (FILTERED)
                        Please give a warm, Bay Area 
                        welcome to Venus Williams. 

           The CROWD applauds as Venus steps into the spotlight, hit by 
           a wall of sound and light. She waves as she heads to the 
           court, unpacking her bag, trying to contain her emotion as --

           IN THE STANDS: Serena and Brandi take their seats with Macci 
           and Keven. 

                                 SERENA
                        Oh my god, look. There’s 
                        Navratilova!

           And she is. MARTINA. PAM SHRIVER. MARY JO FERNANDEZ. All the 
           stars and top seeds of the tournament have come out to watch. 
           Even ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO, the Mexican Superstar and 
           presumptive favorite, is lounging in street clothes as --

           Venus and Stafford warm-up ON COURT. Stafford looks strong.

                                 KEVEN
                        Does she have a chance? 

                                 MACCI
                        It’s gonna be tough. 

           Richard meanwhile, is found SMOKING in a doorway, full of 
           nerves and excitement. A REPORTER sees him and approaches. 

                                 REPORTER
                        Mr. Williams. Can I get you on 
                        Camera? Can I ask you how you’re 
                        feeling?

           For the first time, Richard, in the eye of the camera is 
           nakedly frazzled. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You start the day shaking. Nervous. 
                        You’ve been working for this day 
                        for nine long hard years and you be 
                        saying, well, we gonna get there. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        We gonna get there and finally you 
                        get there like tonight and you find 
                        out - WOW! - we don’t belongs here. 
                        We belongs someplace else. We 
                        belongs back in the ghetto!

           BACK IN THE STANDS

           The match is about to begin. Macci turns to Brandi. 

                                 MACCI
                        Where’s Richard?

                                 BRANDI
                        He’s watching on a TV. He didn’t 
                        want Venus to see his nerves.

           Macci shakes his head in disbelief. Across the arena, he 
           spots MIKE WILLIAMS, the NIKE REP, watching in the stands. He 
           shoots Macci a smug, knowing smile. 

                                 CHAIR UMPIRE
                        Time!

           The players take the court. The crowd erupts. Venus to serve 
           first. Her moment’s finally here. 

           INT. STAGING ROOM, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Alone in a small room, Richard chain smokes, watching his 
           daughter on a small TV. Venus steps up the line. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN RICHARD AND THE COURT WHERE --

           INT. OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Venus steadies her breath in the flash of the cameras, tosses 
           the ball and BOOM! - she cracks her first serve. LONG. She 
           sets up again - WHACK! Into the net. Double fault. LOVE-15. 

           HER TEAM REACTS. Just nerves. THE CROWD REACTS. Oh no.

           RICHARD lights another cigarette as --

           Venus sets up again - serves - BOOM! - she cracks a giant but 
           Stafford returns it. Venus shanks an error. LOVE-30. 

           Now Venus is tight. She pushes a serve. Stafford hammers it 
           wide, moving Venus off the court, putting her away at the 
           net. LOVE-40.

           VENUS LOOKS TO HER TEAM. They shout encouragement but --
           When she serves again, STAFFORD cranks off a WINNER and just 
           like that, Venus is down a break. 0-1.

           She can hear the crowds murmur as she goes to the changeover. 
           She looks to her TEAM. Her FATHER’S NOT THERE. THE NIKE REP’s 
           shaking his head. The OTHER PROS whispering. 

                                 PRO
                        What is she doing?

           Because Stafford is drinking water in her seat, while Venus 
           is standing, bouncing at the sidelines like a boxer in the 
           ring. Stafford, the Agents, the whole place thinks she nuts.

                                 KEVEN
                        Why isn’t she sitting?

                                 MACCI
                        Never been in a match. Richard 
                        doesn’t let her sit down during 
                        practice. 

           Venus can feel all their eyes on her, already writing her 
           off. Already ruling her a bust. It’s not making her nervous. 
           It’s making her mad. 

           INT. STAGING ROOM, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Richard can see it too. He’s angry. He’s stuffs out his 
           cigarette and -- 

           INT. OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Venus is bouncing on the sidelines, trying to calm her 
           thoughts when she spots --

           Richard, weaving through the crowd, arriving at the seats. 

           He meets eyes with Venus who she knows feels the same. They 
           hold each others gaze. On the same page. Fuck that. 

           Venus retakes the court and in four quick points - FOREHAND 
           RETURN WINNER. BACK HAND RETURN WINNER. VOLLEY. SMASH. - 
           Venus breaks Stafford right back and notice is served. 

           To Stafford. To Nike. To everyone here. This girl is for 
           real. And now we:

           MONTAGE THROUGH THE MATCH:

           Venus going 100 the whole time. Running like Bambi. Smashing 
           serves. Crashing the net. Putting away a tough volley. 
           Stafford grinding at the baseline, moving Venus around, drop-
           shotting her at net. 

           Venus smacks her head, sailing a forehand long. Stafford 
           hangs her head, shanking another double fault. Venus rips a 
           backhand winner. Unleashes a 115 MPH serve. Stafford puts 
           away an overhand at the net.

           The CROWDS APPLAUSE. THE WILLIAMSES CHEER. THE OTHER PROS, 
           nonchalantly impressed. Maybe they under-estimated her.

           It’s hard fought and evenly matched until 4-3 in the first. 
           Stafford is serving at 30-30.  

           She kicks a serve out wide which Venus just gets her racket 
           on - slicing a return - Stafford tears a backhand screaming 
           toward the other alley. To everyone in the crowd this looks 
           like a winner only -- 

           Venus is freak. She covers the court like a cheetah, reaching 
           the ball, stabbing it back for a winner that leaves Stafford 
           speechless. No one else on the tour makes that shot. 

           And now Stafford’s shook. 30-40. Shaun bends in a serve. 
           Venus returns, gets to the net where Stafford hits a cannon, 
           trying to knock Venus over but instead --

           Venus surprises everyone with a deft backhand drop volley 
           that dies at Stafford’s feet. Broken.

           The crowd and Stafford are stunned. Venus serves out the set 
           with an ACE and heads to the chair.

                                 CHAIR UMPIRE
                        First set to Miss Williams. She 
                        leads One Set to None. 

           Stafford takes her seat, dumbfounded, watching this 14-year-
           old kid, bouncing on the sidelines with out taking a rest. 
           Stafford’s face says what the rest of the crowd is feeling. 

           HOLY FUCKING SHIT

           Venus looks to her box. Their excitement’s infectious and --

           WE’RE NOW IN THE SECOND SET

           Much like the first, it’s hard-fought. 1-2. 2-2. 2-3. 3 All. 

           Stafford’s not quitting and Venus is showing no nerves. 
           Chasing down impossible balls. Skying off the ground for 
           overheads. Playing aggressive, open stance, full court tennis 
           and then finally --
           It’s 4-4. 30-40. Stafford’s serving. They’re locked in a long 
           rally, but Venus takes charge and ends it, roping an 
           unconscious backhand down the line for a winner!

           Stafford hangs her head. Venus pumps her first. HER TEAM 
           EXPLODES. She’s serving for the match and there’s no little 
           girl here. She goes for fucking broke. 

           First point - BANG! Ace down the T. Second point - BANG! Ace 
           in the corner. Third point - BANG! Body shot. 115 right in 
           Stafford’s grill. She barely gets her racket up to defend 
           herself and -- 

           Just like that, it’s Match Point. 40-LOVE. Venus won’t be 
           slowed. She steps up to the line and BOOMS a serve. 

           Down the T. Stafford gets her racket on it but sends it 
           flying long and just like that -- it’s over. 

           Venus is running to the net. Jumping up and down. Shaking 
           Stafford’s hand as the CROWD GOES NUTS. No one more than --

           Her family, hugging through tears in the stands. 

           Vicario just gets up and leaves, smiles incredulously at -- 

           Venus, her next opponent, signing autographs and tennis balls 
           for starry-eyed kids like she’s already a champ. Vicario’s 
           look says -- we’ll see. 

           Venus’s family joins her on the court. She hugs Brandi and 
           Serena and Macci and Keven and finally --

           She finds her father and Richard and Venus embrace. A 
           celebration a decade in the making. Huge smiles and tears. 
           Uncontainable joy. All caught by the cameras and -

           INT. TUNNELS, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           A gauntlet of TV REPORTERS catch the STARS as they exit. 
           Right now, they’ve caught PAM SHRIVER in the lens. 

                                 PAM SHRIVER
                        I was impressed. For a first match, 
                        there were some green parts to her 
                        for sure, but she’s 14. What do you 
                        want?

           Pam moves off as the REPORTERS spot Vicario heading out.

                                 REPORTER
                        Arxantas! Wait! Any thoughts? You 
                        play her next. What did you think?
           Vicario, wishing she’d escaped, stops in front of the camera. 

                                 VICARIO
                        I think, you know, she a big girl 
                        and she hit the ball, you know, 
                        pretty strong. I guess tomorrow 
                        I’ll see. 

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           A PRESS CONFERENCE under way. Venus makes her way to the 
           stage, hugging Richard, shaking hands as she goes. 

           She takes her seat at the mic.

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        You were great tonight Venus. How’d 
                        you handle your nerves?

                                 VENUS
                        I really wasn’t sure how I was 
                        gonna do. I knew I was gonna go out 
                        there and play the best I could. 
                        And play as hard as I could. And -- 
                        it turned out really good. 

           Venus can’t help herself. She breaks out a giddy smile. 

                                 ANOTHER REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Why didn’t you sit down during the 
                        change-overs? We’re you trying to 
                        send a message?

                                 VENUS
                        A message. No? I didn’t know I was 
                        allowed. At the academy you can’t. 
                        I wasn’t sure who that chair was 
                        for.

           The reporters LAUGH. Eating her up. Then it turns serious.

                                 ANOTHER REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Venus, tomorrow you play the number 
                        one seed. A three time Grand Slam 
                        champ. How do you think you’ll hold 
                        up?

                                 VENUS
                        I think I have the game to beat 
                        anyone out there. I just have to 
                        play it. 

           ANGLE ON RICHARD - watching proudly from the wings. He’s 
           taught her well. Macci approaches. 
                                 MACCI
                        We gotta talk. Nike called again. 
                        They’re upping their offer. Five 
                        Million. I think you should take 
                        it. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Venus don’t wanna sign. She wants 
                        to play this thing out. 

                                 MACCI
                        Richard -- she can’t beat Vicario. 
                        Cash in now while she’s perfect. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Nah, she can beat her. We’ll keep 
                        our money on the table. 

           Richard leaves, passing Bud Collins (the Bob Hope of Tennis 
           who Richard pitched many years ago.) 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Nice to see you again, Bud. Told 
                        you so. 

           It takes a minute after Richard’s gone for Bud to remember. 
           Holy Shit. That was him. Off Bud’s shock.  

                                 MACCI
                        You know him?

                                 BUD
                        Rick. If that girl beats Vicario -- 
                        I mean a 14-year-old who’s never 
                        played a match just walks off the 
                        street and beats the top player on 
                        the planet -- forget Ali-Frazier. 
                        It’ll be the greatest upset in the 
                        history of sports.

           Macci smiles, just laughing at the thought of it and -

           INT. OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Pan down from the rafters to a PACKED HOUSE. TITLES READS:

                                        ROUND TWO
                       VENUS WILLIAMS VS. #1 ARANTXA SANCHEZ VICARIO
                                       NOV. 2, 1994

           The court is empty. The anticipation is electric.
           INT. TUNNELS, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Venus and Richard make their way through the tunnel. When 
           it’s time to part, Richard gives her a hug and a kiss. 

                                 RICHARD
                        I love you, Venus. Have fun out 
                        there tonight. 

                                 VENUS
                        I love you too, Daddy. 

           Richard heads off to his seat, passing Vicario waiting in the 
           mouth of the tunnel. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Good luck tonight. I hope you win. 

           Vicario is stupefied. 

                                 VICARIO
                        Thank you - I guess.

           Richard goes. Venus arrives at her side. They acknowledge 
           each other politely and then --

           BANG! CLOSE ON VENUS SMASHING AN OVERHEAD AND WE’RE --

           INT. OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           INTO THE MATCH. And Venus shows no signs of slowing down. 

           She pounds a SERVE for an ACE, leaving VICARIO whiffing. 
           Venus pumps her fist to her box. SCORE READS: 1-0.

           With Vicario serving down 15-40, Venus waits five feet inside 
           the baseline for the return, saying WHAT DO YOU GOT.

           Then she sizzles a backhand return down the line for a 
           winner. Vicario’s stunned. 2-0. 

           At the end of a rally, Vicario tries to get clever with a 
           slick little drop shot but Venus gets to the net on long legs 
           in two strides and puts it away. Vicario throws up her hands. 
           3-0. 

           The rest of the first set continues the same. Venus 
           blistering Vicario with an aggressive, open stance, full 
           court game, covering the lines like an animal. Vicario’s left 
           flat footed. Before she knows it -- 

           It’s 4-2. Venus’s serving. Ace. Ace. Ace. Winner! She holds 
           serve at Love. The CROWD EXPLODES. 5-2.
           Vicario serves to stay in the set but she’s down 30-40. She’s 
           moving Venus side to side, cornering forehands but Venus gets 
           to everything. Vicario’s got no answers. She forces her next 
           shot, going for a winner but sends a backhand sailing long, 
           handing Venus the set.

           The Players head to the chairs. The CROWD is ROARING. The 
           Williams’s Box, Serena mostly, is jumping out of their seats. 

           Vicario sits, searching for answers in her towel while Venus 
           once again, just bounces at the line like a Heavy Weight 
           Champ who can’t wait for the toll of the bell. Here it is. 

                                 CHAIR UMPIRE
                        Time!

           And they’re back at it. And to Vicario’s dismay, it’s more of 
           the same. Venus serves - ACE! 1-0. Vicario barely holds serve 
           when Venus’ forehand just misses the line. 1-1. Venus serves, 
           crashes the net, overhead volley - WINNER! 2-1. 

           Vicario’s serving, drop-shotting Venus’s return. V races to 
           the net and digs out a BACKHAND VOLLEY down the line. WINNER! 
           3-1. The CROWD GOES FUCKING NUTS.

           Richard and his family explode. Venus is on the brink, up a 
           set and a break on the number one player in the world, three 
           games away from the biggest upset in the history of the 
           sport. 

           Bud Collins looks to Macci. Holy shit, she’s gonna do it. 

           And that’s when it happens. Vicario speaks to the umpire and 
           disappears into the tunnel, leaving Venus confused, bouncing 
           on the court by herself. 

           Serena turns to her mother. 

                                 SERENA
                        Where’d did she go?

                                 BRANDI
                        Bathroom, I guess. 

           But Richard knows better. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh, that’s some sleazy shit. 

                                 MACCI
                        That’s some professional shit. 

                                 SERENA
                        What?
                                 RICHARD
                        She’s icing her. 

           And she is. Venus hops up and down, alone on the court, with 
           nothing but her thoughts for what seems like an eternity. A 
           lifetime to consider and to start getting tight. 

           Venus looks at the CLOCK on the scoreboard. 8. 9. 10 Minutes 
           pass until finally --

           Vicario races out of the tunnel and back onto the court, 
           feigning apologies. 

                                 CHAIR UMPIRE
                        Time! Let’s go. 

           Venus readies to serve, but it’s clear that she’s tight. She 
           pockets the first one into the net, and carves in a slow 
           second which --

           BOOM! -- Vicario blasts it off the court for a winner. A 
           message shot. Venus gets it. So does the crowd. The air goes 
           right out the building. Richard and Macci feel it. 

           Venus steps back up to the line, preparing to serve, to 
           regain her composure but her mojo is gone. Vicario’s taken 
           it. She’s waiting on the other side of the net with a scowl.

           Venus tosses her serve, smacks it clean but Vicario’s there -- 
           winding up, salivating, ready to knock the cover off the ball 
           and --

           WE CAN FREEZE RIGHT THERE. Because Venus doesn’t win another 
           game for the rest of the match. 

           In what feels like no time - the score reads: 6-2. 3-6. 0-5. 
           Venus is serving but it’s match point Vicario. After the 
           return, Venus sails a forehand long and like that it’s done. 

           She’s walking to the net, shaking Vicario’s hands, the rug 
           pulled right out. It feels like a dream. Venus has no idea 
           what’s just happened. 

           The crowd’s all applauding but the bubble’s been burst. For 
           our team, the defeats feels enormous. They bet the house and 
           they lost.

           Land on Richard, clapping stoically, applauding his daughter, 
           but knowing her hurt and -- 

           INT. TUNNELS, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Richard, Serena, and Brandi, escort Venus through the tunnels 
           to the locker room, through a swell of silent faces. 
                                 REPORTER
                        Venus! Venus! What happened out 
                        there? How’s this compare to your 
                        other losses? Any tougher?

                                 SERENA
                        How should she know? She never lost 
                        before. 

           It takes everything Venus has to hold it together and then --

           INT. LOCKERROOM OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           Once she’s inside and the door is closed, she’s lets go and 
           cries, like a 14-year-old kid. 

                                 VENUS
                        I’m sorry. I couldn’t do it. I 
                        wasn’t good enough. I let you down. 

                                 BRANDI
                        What you did out there, Venus, you 
                        could never let us down.

                                 VENUS
                        But the deal? The respect? You were 
                        counting on me and --

                                 RICHARD
                        Don’t you worry about those deals. 
                        I bet outside out that door, the 
                        whole hallway is full of fools 
                        fighting just to hand you a check 
                        but that ain’t what’s important. 
                             (beat)
                        You wanna talk about respect -- if 
                        after what you did tonight, you 
                        don’t got it for yourself, you 
                        ain’t never gonna have it. You a 
                        champion, Venus and now the whole 
                        world knows it. Walk out there with 
                        your head up. You’ll see.

           Venus smiles for her father sake, but she can’t hold it long. 
           Pretty soon, the tears return and she’s crying her heart out. 

           Richard, Brandi, and Serena surround her, holding her close. 

           A FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Dressed in street clothes, Venus returns from the dressing 
           room and joins her family and Macci waiting to leave. 
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

           Venus nods, shouldering her bag as they open the door to find-

           INT. TUNNELS, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           The tunnels are empty. No sponsors wait with her deal. No 
           fans wait for her autographs. No cameras for her picture. 

           It’s as if the whole circus has packed up and left and all 
           that remains in this family. Venus is crushed. 

           Richard cloaks her in his arms and leads his family down the 
           hall to the exit where they open the arena doors to discover -

           EXT. PLAYERS EXIT, OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

           A MASSIVE CROWD OF FANS, many of them YOUNG BLACK GIRLS are 
           waiting outside just for a chance to see VENUS. They explode 
           in applause as she appears, chanting her name. 

                                 CROWD
                        VENUS! VENUS! VENUS! VENUS! 
                             (and then seeing --)
                        SERENA! SERENA! SERENA!

           Venus is moved to tears at the sight of it. Serena is too.

                                 RICHARD
                        What did I tell you? Looks like 
                        they know. Don’t keep ‘em waiting. 

           Full of gratitude, Venus kisses her father and heads out to 
           meet her fans. Serena follows too. 

           Richard and Brandi watch in amazement as their little girls 
           shake hands, sign autographs and inspire. 

           They are moved to tears themselves. And to cap it all off, 
           Keven Davis appears, flushed with excitement. 

                                 KEVEN
                        Phone’s ringing off the hook. I got 
                        Nike on the line. 
                             (long beat)
                        They doubled their offer. Puma 
                        called too. Reebok’s in for sure. 
                        They all wanna meet and they wanna 
                        meet first. What do you want to do?

           But Richard’s not in a hurry. He watches his daughters, 
           swelling with pride, everything he’s predicted’s come true.
                                 RICHARD
                        You tell ‘em to wait. There’s more 
                        where that came from. They ain’t 
                        seen nothing yet. 

           FREEZE ON RICHARD as the following words appear on screen. 

           Nine months later, Venus signed a contract with Reebok for 
           twelve million dollars. She was 14 years-old. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           heart of NEW YORK CITY, hitting balls at a promotional event.

           THE FOLLOWING WORDS OVER BLACK

           Serena joined her on the tour two years later and with 
           Richard as their coach, continuing to place patience, family, 
           and education above early success, nearly everything he 
           predicted for his daughters back in Compton came true. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE FOLLOWING WORDS OVER BLACK

           And while Capriati, Hingis, Kournikova, and the rest of the 
           junior tennis stars of their era retired from injuries and 
           fatigue years ago, Venus and Serena remain at the pinnacle of 
           the sport today, still competing for Grand Slams Titles 25 
           years later. 

           Venus is 38. Serena is 37 and considered by many to be the 
           Greatest Female Player in the History of the Sport. Just like 
           Richard predicted.
