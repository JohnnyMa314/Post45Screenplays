           INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT - 1985

           Two identical twin sisters, ELIN and JOSEFIN NORDEGREN (5),
           sit on a shag carpet, watching Sleeping Beauty on TV, dubbed
           in Swedish. The twins speak Swedish with English subtitles.

                                 ELIN
                        When I grow up, I'm going to be a
                        princess like Aurora.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        You can't be a princess. Daddy's not
                        a king. He's a...
                               (
                                fumbles for the word
                                                    )
                        ...piece of shit.

           Elin looks up at the sound of ARGUING in the kitchen. She
           SNAPS a red hair tie against her wrist. A coping mechanism.

                                 ELIN
                        I'll marry a prince like Cinderella,
                        then. Live happily ever.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        What prince would want to marry you?
                        You're stupid. And this movie stinks.
                        Let's watch that show about those
                        weird Americans.

           Josefin flips the TV dial to a subtitled re-run of the
           American reality show, That's Incredible. Plates CRASH to
           the floor in the kitchen. Elin SNAPS her hair tie. HARD.

                                 ELIN
                        I'll marry a prince one day. You'll
                        see.

           The twins' mother, BARBRO (34), bursts into the room. Her
           eyes are red from crying. She picks up a suitcase.

                                 BARBRO
                        Come on, ladies. Time to go.

                                 ELIN
                        I don't want to.

                                 BARBRO
                        I don't either, Elin. Please don't
                        make this harder than it is. We have
                        to go.

                                 ELIN
                        Why?
                                 BARBRO
                        You'll understand when you're older.

           Their father, THOMAS (34), enters. He's a blubbering mess.

                                 THOMAS
                        Please. Just one more chance. It
                        won't happen again. Barbro, wait...

           But it's too late. Barbro is already dragging the twins out
           the front door. Elin kicks and screams.

                                 ELIN
                        Mommy, no!

           Thomas hurries after them. Instead of going with him, we
           REMAIN here, zeroing in on the...

           TV

           ...where That's Incredible still plays. A young TIGER WOODS
           (5) sits on the lap of host FRAN TARKENTON (40), looking
           dazed by the bright lights and live audience (real footage).

                                 FRAN TARKENTON (TV)
                        This is Eldrick "Tiger" Woods. And
                        Eldrick is an accomplished golfer. He
                        wins tournaments on a regular basis,
                        and has shot close to par on an
                        eighteen hole course. Incredibly,
                        Tiger here is only five years old.

           They cut to a clip of Tiger CRUSHING a ball down a fairway.

                                 FRAN TARKENTON (TV, V.O.)
                        Tiger has the kind of poise and
                        confidence that would be the envy of
                        most golfers ten times his age.

           They cut to an interview with his parents, EARL (48) and
           KULTIDA WOODS (36), in front of a trophy case. Kultida is a
           stoic Thai immigrant of few words; Earl, a blowhard Army
           Colonel, does more than enough talking for the both of them.

                                 EARL WOODS (TV)
                        When he wants to hit something, he
                        hits it where he wants to hit it and
                        how he wants to hit it.

           As Earl lets that sink in, we...

                                                            CUT TO:
           A FOUND FOOTAGE MONTAGE

           ...charting Tiger's rise to global superstardom. We see:

               --HIGHLIGHTS from his six Junior World Championships:
               booming drives, clutch putts, celebratory fist pumps.

               --APPEARANCES on The Today Show, Good Morning America,
               SportsCenter -- always with Earl by his side...

               --HIGHLIGHTS of Tiger taking the PGA by storm: perfect

           EXT. AUGUSTA NATIONAL - DAY - 2002

           Home of the Masters. Tiger marches up the fairway in his
           Sunday red, the GALLERY at full roar. He's in the heart of
           his prime. The sun hits him just right. He looks immortal.

           EXT. GALLERY - CONT.

           ELIN, now 22, cheers him on behind the ropes. She's grown
           into a beautiful young woman since we saw her last, with a
           sporty girl-next-door vibe that makes her easy to root for.

                                 ELIN
                        Go Tiger! Woooo! You got this--

                                 GROUPIE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.

           Elin is SHOVED aside by a harem of GROUPIES. They squeeze
           their silicon-enhanced, spray-tanned bodies to the front.

                                 FAKE TITS
                        Hey, Tiger!

                                 BOTTLE BLONDE
                        God, he's gorgeous. So intense.

                                 BAD SPRAY TAN
                        Hey, where's his playing partner,
                        Goosen, on the money list?

           The groupies check a list. Behind them, Elin quietly stews.
           EXT. EIGHTEENTH GREEN - DAY

           Tiger addresses his ball in reverent silence. If he feels
           the weight of the world's gaze, he doesn't show it. He's a
           finisher. A murderer. A stone-cold winner to the bone.

           As he begins his backstroke -- BRRRING! A cell phone goes
           off in the gallery.

           Tiger stills himself. He steps back from the ball.

           His caddie, STEVE WILLIAMS (39), turns and glares into the
           crowd, growling in his Kiwi accent.

                                 STEVE WILLIAMS
                        Quiet, please.

           EXT. GALLERY - CONT.

           A groupie silences her bedazzled phone. Behind her, Elin
           curses under her breath. She looks out at Tiger, worried.

           EXT. EIGHTEENTH GREEN - CONT.

           There's no cause for concern. Tiger steps back up to the
           ball, his famous nerves of steel on display.

           Tiger strokes the putt. It dies on the lip of the hole.

           The gallery GROANS.

           Tiger is unfazed. He stares the ball down, demanding its
           submission.

           KL-KLICK. It falls into the hole. Just like that.

           The gallery GOES NUTS.

           Tiger unleashes his trademark uppercut fist-pump. He high-
           fives Steve and his AGENT (whom we'll meet shortly).

           Tiger hugs Kultida, now 58. Earl is nowhere to be seen.

           Tiger ventures into the gallery, searching for someone.

           EXT. GALLERY - CONT.

           The unwashed masses grope him, copping a feel of greatness.
           He rebuffs the groupies. Ignores young AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS.
           Shoulders past hysterical GOLF DADS. And finally locates...

           ELIN
           ...who, for your information, has been low-key dating Tiger
           since the Buick Invitational.

                                 ELIN
                        You did it!

                                 TIGER
                        We've got to get you a red polo.

           Tiger kisses Elin. She swoons. The groupies stare enviously.
           Elin feels all the eyes on her.

                                 ELIN
                        Everyone is looking at us.

                                 TIGER
                        Welcome to my world.

           Tiger kisses her again, like he means it. Elin melts in his
           powerful arms, cameras flashing all around them.

           It would seem she's found her prince.

           INT. TIGER'S PRIVATE JET - CABIN - NIGHT

           POP! Golf superagent, MARK STEINBERG (34), uncorks a bottle
           of Cristal. He raises it to TEAM TIGER: sponsors, handlers,
           coaches, bodyguards, lawyers, Steve Williams, Kultida, etc.

                                 MARK STEINBERG
                        To Tiger effin' Woods, the best damn
                        client, spokesman, boss, son,
                        friend -- dare I say boyfriend? And
                        golfer in the universe!

                                 STEVE WILLIAMS
                        Seven majors down, eleven to go!

           A GOATEED MAN chimes in. His Masters VIP pass and swoosh-
           covered outfit indicate he's Nike founder PHIL KNIGHT (64).

                                 PHIL KNIGHT
                        Watch out, Jack!

           Team Tiger clinks and drinks. We make our way through the
           revelers to the back of the cabin...

           ...finding our couple sharing a private moment and a bottle
           of champagne. Elin gazes into Tiger's big brown eyes.

                                 ELIN
                        How do you do it?
                                 TIGER
                        How do I do what?

                                 ELIN
                        Make a putt with the entire planet
                        watching.

                                 TIGER
                        I just do it. That's why they pay me
                        the big bucks.

           Tiger nods in the direction of Phil Knight. Elin laughs.

                                 ELIN
                        Easy as that?

                                 TIGER
                        I mean, first you have to read the
                        green and practice everyday for
                        twenty years. But yeah. When you're
                        out there, it all comes down to...
                               (
                                taps his temple
                                               )
                        ...what's up here. You shut the little
                        voices up, and do it. Easy as that.

           Tiger hands Elin the bottle. She demurs.

                                 ELIN
                        I shouldn't. I have class tomorrow.

                                 TIGER
                        Skip it. Come and spend the night at
                        my new place in Isleworth. Let's have
                        a little fun.

                                 ELIN
                        I wish I could. I really do. I have a
                        test.

                                 TIGER
                        A test? Come on. If my old man can
                        check himself out of the hospital and
                        fly across the country, surely you
                        can miss a test. I won the Masters.

           Tiger smiles his perfect smile. Elin doesn't stand a chance.

                                 ELIN
                        I mean, it would be cool to meet your
                        dad...

                                 TIGER
                        He's been dying to meet you, too.
           INT. ISLEWORTH COUNTRY CLUB - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           EARL WOODS, now 70, checks out Elin's toned body over the
           rim of his vodka gimlet. The years haven't been as kind to
           him. He's bald, obese, and on the mend from bypass surgery.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        Tiger showed me some of your modeling
                        shots. You're very photogenic.

           Kultida rolls her eyes. Elin blushes.

                                 ELIN
                        It's just a part-time job to pay for
                        school.

                                 TIGER
                        Elin is studying psychology at
                        Rollins, dad. She wants to work with
                        kids.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        You don't say. I used to work in the
                        psychology field myself.

                                 ELIN
                        Doing what?

                                 EARL WOODS
                        Interrogations mostly. Psychological
                        warfare and the like.

           Elin sips her wine uncomfortably. Tiger swells with pride.

                                 TIGER
                        Pop was a Green Beret in 'Nam. You
                        have to hear some of his stories.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        I'm afraid they aren't appropriate 
                        for dinner, save the one where I use
                        all my Jedi mind tricks to pick up
                        this hot young mama-san in Bangkok.

           Earl drapes an arm around Kultida. She remains as stiff as a
           statue. Elin leans in, a sucker for romance.

                                 ELIN
                        Was it love at first sight?

                                 EARL WOODS
                        I laid eyes on her, and everything
                        was history.
                                 KULTIDA
                        Including his first wife back in the
                        States. He forgot to mention her.

           Elin isn't sure she's heard right.

                                 ELIN
                        I'm sorry. What?

           Before Kultida can explain, a starstruck golf dad, JIM
           CORMIER (38), taps Tiger on the shoulder.

                                 JIM
                        I'm so sorry. I don't mean to
                        interrupt, but we heard you just
                        moved in down on Deacon Circle. We
                        live up the street. I'm Jim.

           His golf skort-clad wife, JEN (35), and tween daughter,
           HAILEE (12), join him. Both preen, twirling their hair.

                                 JAN
                        Jan.

                                 HAILEE
                        Hailee.

                                 TIGER
                        Nice to meet you guys. I'm Tiger.

           Elin sips her wine. Jim honks out a laugh.

                                 JIM
                        We know. Hey, this is rude, but could
                        we maybe get a picture with you,
                        neighbor? It'd mean everything.

           Tiger defers to Earl. The old man sighs.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        Be discreet.

                                 JIM
                        You got it, Mr. Woods. You've raised
                        a fine young man here, by the way.

           Jim raises his camera, snapping a solo pic of Tiger. Elin is
           weirded out. Jim beckons over another GOLF DAD.

                                 JIM (cont'd)
                        Hey, Jerry, would you mind taking our
                        picture?
                                 GOLF DAD
                        Holy crap. It's Tiger Woods. Hey, can
                        we get a picture too?

           A THIRD GOLF DAD notices, nudging his own DAD.

                                 THIRD GOLF DAD
                        Well, I'll be damned. Look who it is.

           A whisper of excitement spreads through the restaurant. Earl
           sighs again. He struggles to his feet, addressing everyone.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        I'll tell you what. Who wants a photo
                        with the "Chosen One"? Just form a
                        line right here and give your cameras
                        to my wife. Let's get this over with.

           Half the place rises, flocking to Tiger. Kultida assumes
           camera duty, leaving Elin alone with Earl at the table. Earl
           lights a menthol cigarette, watching Tiger pose with Hailee.

                                 EARL WOODS (cont'd)
                        We had a saying back in PsyOps: "The
                        more you hide, the more they seek."
                        It's best to give them what they
                        want -- but on your terms.

           Elin smiles and nods. Earl takes a pensive drag.

                                 EARL WOODS (cont'd)
                        Say, how do you feel about prenups?

           Elin chokes on her wine.

           EXT. SANDY LANE RESORT - WEDDING GAZEBO - SUNSET

           Elin cries tears of joy on the altar.

                                 ELIN
                        I do.

           The PASTOR turns to Tiger. It's a fairytale wedding. The
           golfer's yacht floats on the crystal Caribbean in the b.g.

                                 PASTOR
                        And do you, Eldrick Woods, take Elin
                        Nordegren as your lawfully wedded
                        wife, to have and to hold, in good
                        times and in bad, for richer or
                        poorer, keeping yourself solely unto
                        her for as long as you shall live?
           Tiger keeps Elin in suspense for a moment.

                                 TIGER
                        Damn right I do.

                                 PASTOR
                        By the power vested in me, I now
                        pronounce you man and wife.

           Bride and groom kiss. The GUESTS cheer. Among them are Earl,
           Kultida, Elin's sister JOSEFIN...

           ...plus famous faces: DEREK JETER, MICHAEL JORDAN, CHARLES
           BARKLEY, OPRAH, and DONALD TRUMP.

           A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture of the newlyweds. We FREEZE
           on them. They look so young and happy.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO...

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - REC ROOM - NIGHT

           ...a blow-up of the photo. PULL BACK to reveal it squeezed
           in on a crowded shelf in Tiger's obscenely big trophy case.

           SUPER: "SEVEN YEARS LATER"

           Elin and Tiger's kids, SAM (3, girl) and CHARLIE (9 months,
           boy), sit on a leather sofa, playing with a makeup kit.

           Sam hands a wet brush to Elin, who's putting on eyeshadow.
           She's still stunning, but the bloom is off the rose a bit.

                                 ELIN
                        Take it easy with the eyeshadow. We
                        don't want Momma looking like a...
                               (
                                "hussy" in Swedish
                                                  )
                        ...slampa.

                                 SAM
                        What's a slampa?

                                 ELIN
                        A girl who wears too much eyeshadow.
                        The trick is less is more. Just
                        enough to pop the eyes and hide the
                        wrinkles.

                                 SAM
                        Hide from who?

           Elin isn't sure how to answer that. She's saved by the
           triumphant entrance of Steinberg. He's holding a new trophy.
                                 STEINBERG
                        Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls,
                        please give it up for this year's
                        winner of the Australian Masters...
                        your dad!

           There's no sign of Tiger. Then, he hobbles in with an ice
           pack on his back. At age 34, he's creeping past his prime.

                                 TIGER
                        We don't celebrate the Australian
                        Masters, Steiny. I'm supposed to win.

                                 SAM
                        Daddy!

           Sam rushes at Tiger, squealing with delight. Elin winces.

                                 ELIN
                        Careful.

                                 TIGER
                        It's just pain. Give Daddy a kiss to
                        make it better.

           Tiger picks up Sam, grimacing. She pecks him on the lips.
           Elin's heart melts. She gets up to do the same.

                                 ELIN
                        Welcome home.

           The instant their lips come apart, Tiger's phone RINGS in
           his pocket. He silences it. Elin notices.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Who is it?

                                 TIGER
                        Who cares? Probably just business.

                                 ELIN
                        What if it's important?

                                 TIGER
                        They'll call back.

           Tiger tickles Charlie.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Hey there, little man. Did you behave
                        while I was gone?
                                 ELIN
                        He missed you. All of us did. Did you
                        miss us, too?

           Before Tiger can respond, his phone RINGS again. Elin waits
           for him to get it. He checks the caller. Looks at Steinberg.

                                 TIGER
                        It's Ray at Gatorade again. I bet he
                        wants me to do re-shoots.

           Steinberg tries to find room for the trophy in the case, but
           it's packed. He takes the wedding photo down to make space.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Let me handle him. You crushed that
                        stupid ad.
                               (
                                to Elin
                                       )
                        I'm telling you, he can make anything
                        convincing.

                               (
                                to Tiger
                                 ELIN
                                        )
                        Did you miss us?

           Tiger gets in character.

                                 TIGER
                        Like my muscles miss electrolytes.
                               (
                                beams at her
                                            )
                        What's for dinner?

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger pats his washboard stomach, topping off dinner with a
           cocktail of supplements, painkillers, and sleeping aids.

                                 TIGER
                        That gravlax really hit the spot.
                        Nutritious and delicious. You're too
                        good to me.

           Elin rubs stretch mark cream on her belly, eyeing Tiger in
           the mirror as he dry-swallows some Ambien.

                                 ELIN
                        I like to make you happy. Though it
                        looks like you don't really need my
                        help. Don't make you hallucinate?

                                 TIGER
                        They also make me fall asleep. I
                        haven't had eight hours in forever.
                                 ELIN
                        I thought maybe we could stay up for
                        a while... if you wanted.

           Elin makes eyes at Tiger. He glances at her stretch marks.

                                 TIGER
                        Wish I could. I really do. I have to
                        fly out to Trump National at six.

                                 ELIN
                        You just got home.

                                 TIGER
                               (
                                shrugs
                                      )
                        The Donald wants to play a little
                        golf. For what it's worth, he says
                        he'll give to my foundation. Could be
                        huge for our new learning center.

                                 ELIN
                        Sweet.

           Elin feigns excitement. Tiger detects something is off.

                                 TIGER
                        I'll tell you what. I'll come back
                        early on Thanksgiving, and then block
                        off the whole weekend. Maybe we can
                        take the kids out on the yacht.

                                 ELIN
                        That sounds perfect. I can't wait.

           Elin turns back to the mirror with an agreeable smile. She
           lets her hair down. Slips a RED HAIR TIE onto her wrist.

           INT. ALBERTSONS GROCERY - DAY

           A happy Woods women outing to the supermarket. Elin pushes
           Charlie in a cart. Kultida struts beside her in designer
           sunglasses. Sam brings up the rear, skipping merrily along.

           Elin steps up to the meat counter.

                                 ELIN
                        Hello. I ordered a turkey.

           A scary female BUTCHER (mid-40s) with a neck tattoo stares
           back at Elin, trying to place her.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Am I not in the right place?
           The butcher's face softens unexpectedly.

                                 BUTCHER
                        I'll getcha turkey for ya, sweetie.
                        Be right up. Just wait right here.

           The butcher signals to her CLERK.

                                 BUTCHER (cont'd)
                        Yo, hook up Mrs. Woods here with some
                        giblet gravy. On the house.

                                 ELIN
                        Oh. Wow. Thank you.

           Elin grins at Kultida.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        It must be my lucky day.

           As if on cue, Sam toddles up holding a supermarket tabloid.

                                 SAM
                        Look, it's Daddy!

           Elin's grin collapses. It's the National Enquirer. The
           banner headline blares "TIGER WOODS CHEATING SCANDAL" next
           to a nondescript close-up of his face.

           Kultida grabs it away from Sam.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Stupid gossip rag. Ignore it. People
                        love to tear down heroes.

                                 ELIN
                        May I have it?

           A lump rises in Elin's throat. Kultida clocks it, refusing.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Hold your head up. We don't let them
                        see us weak.

           Elin looks up. Several SHOPPERS by a tabloid rack are
           gawking. Elin swallows the lump.

           INT. CHECKOUT LINE - SAME

           The neighbors, Jim and Jen Cormier, sneer down their noses
           at the spread in the Enquirer. It features a photo of a
           plastic-looking woman in a nightclub. Jim scoffs, dubious.
                                 JIM
                        It's the National Enquirer. Who's he
                        sleeping with? The Octomom?

                                 JEN
                        Some "party girl" named "Rachel Uchi-
                        something" who he met through "Derek
                        Jeter." This according her "friend."

           Their daughter, Hailee, stares at something behind them.

                                 HAILEE
                        Hey, guys.

                                 JIM
                        He oughta sue 'em. They don't have a
                        shred of proof.

                                 HAILEE
                        Guys. GUYS.

           The Woods women get in line. Jen and Jim hide the tabloid.

                                 JEN
                        Howdy, Elin.

                                 JIM
                        Happy Turkey Day.

           Elin twists her mouth into a smile, keeping up appearances.

                                 ELIN
                        You too.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A Thanksgiving feast fit for a king. Tiger holds court with
           Sam in his lap, Elin sitting at the far end with Charlie.
           Between them are Kultida, Steinberg, Phil Knight, and the
           two men's WIVES. Everyone eats in stilted silence, until...

                                 STEINBERG
                        This casserole's the bomb.
                                                  )
                               (
                                re: Elin, with awe
                        How does she do it?

                                 WIVES/PHIL KNIGHT
                        Ugh, I know, right?/It's amazing.
                        You're a superstar.

           Elin refills her wine glass, watching Tiger gnaw at a turkey
           leg with his hands. He seems perfectly at ease, sucking
           juice off his thumb. Tiger taps his beer mug for attention.
                                 TIGER
                        I'd like to say a little something.

           Eyebrows go up, cutlery goes down. Tiger rises, digging out
           some talking points written down on Nike-branded stationery.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        First of all, to our guests, thanks
                        for coming down to Isleworth. You
                        guys know you're like family to us
                        here. I mean, Steiny, my consigliere,
                        you and all the fellas at the agency
                        have had my back since I was using
                        training clubs.

                                 STEINBERG
                        And we'll have it 'til you're using a
                        walker -- as long as you're still
                        winning.

           A smattering of laughter. Tiger turns to Phil Knight.

                                 TIGER
                        And, Mr. Knight -- who am I kidding?
                        Uncle Phil. Nike saw something in me
                        before any other sponsor.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Giant dollar signs.

           More laughter. Elin abstains. Tiger motions for quiet.

                                 TIGER
                        Thanks, ma. Now, I think I'd be
                        remiss not to address the, how to
                        term it... "invisible elephant."
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        And by that, of course, I mean the
                        massive absence of my father. I won't
                        lie, it's been a tough few years
                        without him. Miss you, Pops.

           Everyone drinks in Earl's memory -- save for the notable
           exception of Kultida, who just lifts her wine halfheartedly.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        That said, I think his legacy lives
                        on in my foundation and his scholar
                        program. And today, I got some
                        awesome news about a project of ours,
                        which, and this may come as a
                        surprise, I'd like to dedicate to
                        someone in this room.
                                 (MORE)
                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        A person who, like our scholars,
                        didn't come from much, but has always
                        made the most of what she's given.
                               (
                                pauses for effect
                                                 )
                        Ladies and gentlemen, next spring,
                        the Tiger Woods Foundation will be
                        breaking ground on the Elin Woods
                        Learning Center of Greater Orlando.

           Elin is stunned. The applause of the dinner guests seems
           canned, like they were in on the surprise.

                                 WIVES
                        Wow!/What an honor.

                                 STEINBERG
                        You deserve it.

                                 PHIL KNIGHT
                        Nike'd love to help out any way we
                        can. Just let us know.

           Elin struggles to find the words.

                                  ELIN
                        I'm sorry. I'm just... speechless.
                        Are you sure you want to name it
                        after me? I didn't ask for that.

                                 TIGER
                        You didn't have to, Elin. When it
                        comes to my foundation and my life,
                        there's no one else I'd rather share
                        it with.

                                 WIVES
                        Awww.

                                 TIGER
                        Without family, you have absolutely
                        nothing. Happy Thanksgiving, my love.

           Tiger smiles that perfects smile. Everybody lifts their
           drinks to Elin.

           She hides behind her wine glass, knocking it back.

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger downs his nightly cocktail of pills. Elin pads in,
           working on another glass of wine. She sounds tipsy.
                                 ELIN
                        Well, that was certainly unexpected.
                        Growing up, we only gave each other
                        buildings on our birthdays.

           Tiger isn't sure if he's supposed to laugh.

                                 TIGER
                        Just be happy that you didn't get a
                        golf club. Every year...

           He shakes his fist at the heavens. Elin chuckles, putting
           him at ease. He applies Rogaine to his receding hairline.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Hey, thanks for being cool about this
                        tabloid stuff. It'll all blow over.

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, of course. I mean, we trust each
                        other, right? If it were true, I know
                        you'd tell me.

                                 TIGER
                        It's not true.

                                 ELIN
                        I didn't say it was. And even if it
                        were, we'd work it out. Together. How
                        bad could it be?

           Tiger flickers with guilt. He snuffs it out.

                                 TIGER
                        Let's just put this shit behind us.
                        Come to bed.

           Tiger kisses Elin on the lips. He shuffles off into the...

           MASTER BEDROOM - CONT.

           Tiger plugs his phone into a charger. Elin emerges from the
           bathroom. She sips her wine for courage.

                                 ELIN
                        It is funny, though.

                                 TIGER
                        What's funny?

                                 ELIN
                        How this Rachel woman Derek used to
                        date in New York City...
                                 TIGER
                        "Date" is strong.

                                 ELIN
                        ...just so happened to be staying at
                        the same hotel as you...

                                 TIGER
                        I didn't see her.

                                 ELIN
                        ...on the very same floor...

                                 TIGER
                        Big floors.

                                 ELIN
                        ...in Australia...

                                 TIGER
                        Small world.

                                 ELIN
                        ...after her own friend had tipped
                        off the Enquirer that you had flown
                        down there. Isn't that funny?

                                 TIGER
                        I'm not sure if that's the word I'd
                        use, but...

                                 ELIN
                        What word would you use?

                                 TIGER
                        Defamation. Plain and simple. Rachel
                        called me to explain.

           Tiger holds up his phone. Elin's stomach drops.

                                 ELIN
                        You two are talking?

                                 TIGER
                        She just wanted to apologize. Turns
                        out this so-called "friend" of hers
                        is some, like, two-bit junkie. Guess
                        she somehow found out we were staying
                        at the same hotel -- by coincidence,
                        and made some story up that she could
                        sell for her next fix. Can you
                        believe that?
           Elin studies Tiger. If he's lying, he's fantastic at it.

                                 ELIN
                        No.

                                 TIGER
                        Me neither. God, some people have no
                        shame. Now come to bed.

           Tiger pats the bed invitingly, letting out a yawn. Elin
           glances at the pills in the bathroom. Then at his phone.

                                 ELIN
                        Don't wait up. I need to catch up on
                        some texts.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - GUESTHOUSE - NIGHT

           Elin drops the kids off with Kultida at a guesthouse that
           would likely dwarf your real house.

                                 ELIN
                        Thanks for taking them tonight.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Is this because of that fake story?

                                 ELIN
                        No, it's nothing. Really. We just
                        need some time to ourselves.

           Kultida doesn't buy it.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Let this go.

                                 ELIN
                        I'm sorry, what?

                                 KULTIDA
                        Let this go. It isn't true. And even
                        if it were, would you want to know?

           Elin opens her mouth, then stops. She isn't sure. Kultida
           gazes out at moonlit Isleworth Lake behind the house.

                                 KULTIDA (cont'd)
                        There's a saying back where I come
                        from: "The lily doesn't argue with
                        the lake." You have a good life here.
                        Why risk it? Let this go.

           Kultida whisks the kids into the guesthouse.
                                 KUTILDA
                        Come on, babies. Who's excited for a
                        sleepover with Grandma? It'll be fun.

           They disappear inside. Elin starts back for the main house,
           Kultida's words ringing in her ears. Let this go.

           But she can't. Elin curses under her breath. She reaches
           into her pocket...

           ...and pulls out Tiger's phone. Elin scrolls through his
           contacts. Stops at "Rachel Uchitel."

           Elin types a text: "I miss you." She hits send before she
           can second-guess herself.

           It's done. Elin draws a shaky breath. She shuts her eyes,
           awaiting a response. It's unbearable.

           Elin SNAPS the red hair tie on her wrist. SNAPS its again.

           The phone CHIRPS. "1 New Message from Rachel Uchitel."

           Elin stares, paralyzed. She braces herself. Opens it.

           Her jaw drops.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger snores in bed. All else is silent. Then, a SMOKER'S
           COUGH rattles through the room, followed by a RASPY VOICE.

                                 RASPY VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Tiger. Tiger, look.

           A hand emerges from the shadows, holding Tiger's phone. His
           eyes peel open. He finds himself lying face-to-face with...

           ...his father, Earl. Well, the husk of him. The old man is
           dying in a hospital bed. He reads a text on Tiger's phone.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        You got a message from that biddy.
                        Says she's waiting for you.

                                 TIGER
                        Dad?

                                 EARL WOODS
                        You'd better double-time it, Tiger.

                                 TIGER
                        Huh?
           Earl GRABS Tiger.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        RUN.

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger's eyes snap open. Earl is gone. It was all just a
           nightmare. Or maybe a hallucination.

           Or maybe not. A hand JUMPS out of the shadows and grabs
           Tiger, shaking him awake.

                                 ELIN
                        Tiger, wake up! Hey, I said wake up!

           It's Elin. She's holding his phone. He slurs, stupefied.

                                 TIGER
                        Huh?

                                 ELIN
                        I texted Rachel from your phone. She
                        says she misses you.

                                 TIGER
                        You wha'?

           Tiger's phone CHIRPS. Elin reads a new text.

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, wait. There's more. She says she
                        misses you inside her. And, how nice,
                        she sent a picture of her anus.

           Elin holds up the phone. Tiger squints at it, cockeyed.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Here, take a closer look.

           Elin chucks it, PLUNKING Tiger in the lip. Drawing blood.

                                 TIGER
                        Ow!

                                 ELIN
                        Are there others?

                                 TIGER
                        Wait. Go back. You took my phone?
                                 ELIN
                        Who's Jaimee?

                                 TIGER
                        Wha'?

                                 ELIN
                        She's all over your call log. Who.
                        Is. Jamie?

           Tiger gives a slow, bovine blink.

                                 TIGER
                               (
                                like the boys name
                                                  )
                        You mean Jaime? Did I spell it wrong?
                        He's Steiny's new assistant.

                                 ELIN
                        Let me call him.

                                 TIGER
                        It's the middle-a the night.

                                 ELIN
                        Hey, where are you going?

           Tiger stumbles into the bathroom, phone in hand.

                                 TIGER
                        Gonna take a quick cold shower. Then
                        we'll get right to the bottom of
                        this, K? Prolly jus' a stupid prank.

           He drags the door shut behind him. Elin watches the lock
           TURN. She's incredulous.

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - CONT.

           Tiger makes a phone call.

                                 TIGER
                        C'mon, c'mon, pick up, pick up. Shit.

           He leaves a panicked voicemail.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Hey, it's, uh, it's Tiger. I need you
                        to do me a huge favor...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONT.

           Elin paces, SNAPPING her hair tie. HARD. Repressed anger
           rising to the surface.
                                 ELIN
                        Open up! I'm not playing around!

           INT. MASTER BATHROOM - CONT.

           Tiger steadies himself on the bathtub, ending his message.

                                 TIGER
                        You gotta do this for me. Huge.
                        Quickly. Bye.

           He hangs up. Begins pecking out a text, one-eyeing the
           screen. The floor spins. He's high out of his mind.

           BANG! The door explodes open. Elin staggers in, glaring.

                                 ELIN
                        Give me your phone.

           INT. GUESTHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Kultida's phone BEEPS on the nightstand. She yawns awake,
           reaching over the sleeping kids for it.

           Her brow knits in confusion. It's a text from Tiger --
           "HELP" -- followed by a bunch of random characters.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

           Tiger and Elin grapple for the phone, mashing random keys.

                                 TIGER
                        You're gonna break my pinkie. I'd be
                        out for weeks.

                                 ELIN
                        Good!

           Tiger gasps, shocked and appalled.

                                 TIGER
                        How can you say that?!

           Tiger RIPS his phone away. It flies from his grip. Bounces
           across the room. Thuds into a golf bag.

           Tiger and Elin trade a look. They both TAKE OFF.

           Elin gets there first, reaching for the phone as --

           OOF! Tiger inadvertently collides with her.

           Elin spills headlong into the golf bag. Clubs CLATTER out.
           Tiger is mortified.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Holy shit. E, are you OK?

           Elin's nose drips blood onto the white silk rug. She stares
           at Tiger in disbelief.

                                 ELIN
                        Are you seriously texting right now?

           Indeed he is.

                                 TIGER
                        No.

                                 ELIN
                        Give me the phone.

           Elin's hand finds its way to a swoosh-emblazoned NINE-IRON.
           She pulls herself to her feet. Tiger backs away.

                                 TIGER
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's with
                        the iron?

                                 ELIN
                        GIVE ME THE PHONE!

           Tiger escapes into the hallway. Elin follows with the club.

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

           Kultida scuttles through the house, hearing a commotion in
           the foyer. She rounds a corner, coming face-to-face with...

           ...a framed poster of Tiger. He stands on water, chipping a
           ball off a lily pad. It's a (real) print ad for EA Sports.

                                 ELIN (O.S.)
                        I trusted you. We all did!

           Tiger stumbles by as -- SMASH! Elin takes the club to the
           poster. Tiger pleads.

                                 TIGER
                        Not my artwork. Please. You're
                        ruining it.

                                 ELIN
                        Screw your stupid artwork. You've
                        ruined my life!
           Kultida hurls herself in front of Tiger, barking at Elin.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Woman, what the hell's the matter
                        with you? Tiger's given you
                        everything!

                                 ELIN
                        We both know that's not true. For
                        God's sake, he won't even let me have
                        his phone.

           Tiger hold his phone like a walkie-talkie.

                                 TIGER
                        She's goin' ghetto on me, Steiny.

           Elin lunges for it, falling to the floor. Kultida pins her.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Tiger, run!

           Tiger grabs his keys and flees out the front door.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - CONT.

           Tiger zags down the driveway, slurring into his phone.

                                 TIGER
                        You gotta handle Rachel for me, man.
                        Just keep her quiet. Find her price.
                        I don' care what it is.

           He clambers into a...

           INT. BLACK ESCALADE - CONT.

           Tiger locks the doors. He brings his phone to his mouth.

                                 TIGER
                        OK, I'm secure. She can't get in
                        here.

           He rubs his eyes, the pills taking hold again.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        One more thing. We need a Jaime. Any
                        Jaime.

           CRUNCH! A back side window buckles from an impact. Tiger
           yelps, his eyes shooting to the side-view mirror.

           In it, Elin winds up the nine iron to take another swing.
           INT. CORMIER HOUSE - HAILEE'S BEDROOM - SAME

           The SHATTERING of the window jars Hailee awake.

           She hears the engine REV. The tires SQUEAL. The car JUMP a
           curb, CLANG over a fire hydrant...

           ...and CRASH into a tree outside her house.

           Hailee rushes to her window. She sees Elin running toward
           the wreckage. Kultida chases her, screaming bloody murder.

                                 KULTIDA
                        What happened?!

           He bumps into Hailee. She's gaping up at the choppers. As
           the ROAR of their rotors drowns out everything...

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - TV ROOM - DAY

           A quiet gloom. Tiger watches the news with his back to us.

                                 WFTV REPORTER (V.O., ON TV)
                        ...the world's most visible athlete
                        now in hiding, leaving all of us, the
                        cops included, asking what went wrong.

           Tiger turns around. The greatest winner in golf looks like
           the tough-luck loser of a cage match. His face is bruised,
           his top lip fat and sutured. He speaks with a slight lisp.

                                 TIGER
                        We need to make this go away.

           Steinberg REELS off some duct tape, covering the windows
           with butcher paper while putting out fires on his phone.

                                 STEINBERG
                        I'm working on it.

                                 TIGER
                        Call Obama if you have to. I don't
                        care. Just pull some strings.
                                 STEINBERG
                        I'm pulling more strings than a
                        sweatshop here. The State Attorney
                        doesn't want to touch us.

                                 TIGER
                        What's the problem, then?

                                 STEINBERG
                        The guy won't have a choice if the
                        police inspect this...
                               (
                                re: Tiger's mouth
                                                 )
                        ...divot, and drive a goddamn Nike
                        nine iron through our story.

                                 TIGER
                        I can't get a DUI.

                                 STEINBERG
                        That's just the start of it. Don't
                        panic, but the lawyers think that
                        Elin may be looking at assault.

           Tiger face-palms, the gravity of the situation sinking in.

                                 TIGER
                        Jesus Christ. So, it isn't just my
                        ass that's on the line here.

                                 STEINBERG
                        It's your image, too. For chrissakes,
                        you're supposed to be a family man.

                                 TIGER
                               (
                                through gritted teeth
                                                     )
                        Goddamnit, Tiger!

           Tiger WHACKS his chest, self-flagellating. Steinberg waits
           for his star client to gather himself.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        We can't let them see my face.

                                 STEINBERG
                        It's a minor miracle none of your
                        neighbors took pictures.

           Steinberg finishes with the windows. They head into the...

           INT. FOYER - CONT.

           ...taking down the smashed poster. They hang a painting in
           its stead: Tiger staring down an actual Indochinese tiger.
                                 TIGER
                        What do we do when the police get
                        here?

                                 STEINBERG
                        You get upstairs and hide. I'm 
                        talking Anne Frank. Not a single peep.

                                 TIGER
                        Can you get rid of them?

                                 STEINBERG
                        No. But we think maybe Elin can.

           Tiger balks. Steinberg shrugs. They have no choice.

                                 STEINBERG (cont'd)
                        We have to show at least a semblance
                        of compliance. Guild the turd so
                        it'll flush without a stink.

                                 TIGER
                        I don't know if she'll play ball.

                                 STEINBERG
                        She is the ball. And last I checked,
                        you can hack your way out of
                        anything. Go get her. They'll be here
                        in forty-five.

           Tiger looks up the staircase, steeling his famous nerves.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Elin bawls, scrubbing the bloodstained carpet like Lady
           MacBeth. It's not pretty. Her makeup is a disaster. Tiger
           slinks in, putting on his best hangdog expression.

                                 TIGER
                        Don't bother with the carpet. I'll
                        replace it. This place needs a fresh
                        start anyway. Don't you think?

                                 ELIN
                        Can I help you.

                                 TIGER
                        The police are coming by. They want
                        to ask you a few questions.

                                 ELIN
                        Let me guess. You want me to lie for
                        you.
                                 TIGER
                        No.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I want you to lie for us.

           Elin rises, crossing her arms.

                                 ELIN
                        I want the truth first. Every detail.
                        How many women?

                                 TIGER
                        One. Just Rachel.

                                 ELIN
                        What about Jaimee?

                                 TIGER
                        Hand to God, his name is Jaime. And
                        he works on Steiny's desk. You can go
                        downstairs and ask him if you want.

           Elin desperately wants to believe him. So she does.

                                 ELIN
                        Do you love her? Rachel?

                                 TIGER
                        No. She means nothing to me.

                                 ELIN
                        Clearly she means something. So what
                        is it? Is she prettier than me?

                                 TIGER
                        No.

                                 ELIN
                        Thinner?

                                 TIGER
                        Please don't do this.

                                 ELIN
                        More fun?

                                 TIGER
                        I don't know.

                                 ELIN
                        Just tell me why. Just tell me why!

           Elin nearly breaks down. Tiger hangs his head.
                                 TIGER
                        I don't know. She was just in the
                        right place at the right time, I
                        guess: this nightclub, on the
                        anniversary on my dad's death. I was
                        drunk as shit and miserable. I needed
                        someone. Anyone.

                                 ELIN
                        What's wrong with me?

                                 TIGER
                        Nothing. You were here. With the
                        kids. Where I should have been.

           Elin's face softens just a bit. Tiger sniffles.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        I made a huge mistake.

                                 ELIN
                        You made a choice. It's not the
                        cheating, it's the lying. And the
                        cheating too. But mostly just the
                        lying.

                                 TIGER
                        I wanted to tell you. Swear to God. I
                        almost did.

                                 ELIN
                        What stopped you?

           Tiger starts to say something, then stops himself.

                                 TIGER
                        I don't know. It's stupid.

                                 ELIN
                        Tell me.

                                 TIGER
                        I guess I was scared.

                                 ELIN
                        Scared of what?

           Tiger says nothing, letting his injuries answer for him.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Me?

           Elin is blindsided by guilt.
                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Oh my God. What have I done?

                                 TIGER
                        Hey, now. Hey. It's my fault, too. We
                        both messed up. But all of that is in
                        the past. What matters now is that we
                        fix it. We are stronger than your
                        parents. Don't give up on me.

           Tiger takes Elin's hand in his. She gazes up at him, her
           eyes glistening with remorse.

           Hole in one.

           INT. TV ROOM - DAY

           Tiger swaggers in, performing his trademark fist-pump.

                                 TIGER
                        Now that, my friends, is how you save
                        a marriage...

           He trails off. Steinberg and Kultida are glued to the TV,
           watching a SPORTSCENTER ANCHOR break a story.

                                 SPORTSCENTER ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        And then there were two. A second
                        woman, cocktail waitress Jaimee
                        Grubbs, claims that she and Tiger
                        Woods had a three-year-long affair.

           Steinberg and Kultida turn and stare at Tiger. He gulps.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

           Elin gapes at a small TV, half-dressed and absolutely gut-
           punched. JAIMEE GRUBBS (23) is interviewed on Extra! (real
           footage). She's a tan Vegas shot girl with a pierced cheek.

                                 JAIMEE GRUBBS (ON TV)
                        The second I did hear about Rachel...
                        that was the hardest... realizing
                        that I may never be the only woman.

           INT. TV ROOM - SAME

           Tiger raises his right hand to Kultida.

                                 TIGER
                        Hand to God, Mom, I have never met
                        that person. You have to believe me.

           Kultida falters, then recovers. Her loyalty is unshakable.
                                 KULTIDA
                        I believe you.

                                 SPORTSCENTER ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        ...and she has him dead to rights.
                        Here's a voicemail Tiger left her on
                        Thanksgiving.

           ESPN runs the damning audio with a word-for-word transcript.

                                 TIGER (V.O., ON TV)
                        "Hey, it's, uh, it's Tiger. I need 
                        you to do me a huge favor. My wife
                        went through my phone and may be
                        calling you..."

           Kultida closes her eyes in disappointment. Tiger turns off
           the TV. He looks like he could crawl into a hole.

           There's a violent THUMP upstairs. Steinberg looks up at the
           trembling chandelier.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Let me talk to her.

           INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Steinberg FLEES down the grand staircase. Elin chases him,
           the bedroom TV raised above her head.

                                 ELIN
                        Why would I want to talk to you?!

           Tiger pleads from the foyer.

                                 TIGER
                        It was doctored. They just spliced
                        together sound bites. Hand to God.

                                 ELIN
                        Go to hell, you-- you-- you SLAMPA!

           Elin HURLS the TV. It cartwheels though the air...

           ...and SMASHES into the painting of Tiger and the tiger. It
           remains there, lodged in the wall.

           Elin stomps back upstairs. Steinberg and Tiger get to their
           feet, surveying the damage.

                                 STEINBERG
                        All right, listen. This is not as bad
                        as it seems.
                                 TIGER
                        Yeah, it's worse.

           Tiger stares at a SECURITY MONITOR by the door. It shows a
           Florida Highway Patrol cruiser pulling up the driveway.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        They're early. If they see this...

                                 STEINBERG
                        It might give the wrong idea.

           Steinberg thinks on his feet.

                                 STEINBERG (cont'd)
                        Change of plans: We don't let them
                        through that door.

                                 TIGER
                        Won't they be pissed?

                                 STEINBERG
                        It doesn't matter. They don't have a
                        warrant. They can't do jack shit.

           A curdled WAIL issues from the master bedroom.

                                 STEINBERG (cont'd)
                        Unless we give them cause to enter.
                        Shut her up.

                                 TIGER
                        Wait. Me?

                                 STEINBERG
                        It's either that or we dip out in a
                        white Bronco, pal. 'Cause door three
                        is one walk of shame we just can't
                        have you making. Take your pick.

           Tiger hesitates, those famous nerves of his coming undone.
           He pulls out a pill bottle. Pops a couple in his mouth.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Elin paces like a caged animal, ranting over Skype to her
           sister. Josefin is now a rising corporate lawyer. She's
           plainer-looking than Elin, lacking the cosmetic perks that
           come with marrying a superstar.

                                 ELIN
                        How could he do this to me? I gave
                        him the best years of my life.
                                 JOSEFIN
                        You're only thirty.

                                 ELIN
                        You don't understand.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        We were born ten minutes apart.

                                 ELIN
                        But I gave up my twenties for him. I
                        quit school to have his babies. How
                        could I be so stupid? I thought he
                        was perfect.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        No one's perfect. This is why I told
                        you not to sign that godforsaken
                        prenup. You could get nothing.

                                 ELIN
                        Wait, the prenup? I don't want to
                        leave him. I just want to murder him!

           KNOCK-KNOCK. Tiger enters, holding his hands up in defense.

                                 TIGER
                        Look, I know you're pissed, and
                        rightly so. But the police are here.
                        We have to keep it down.

           Elin gets a crazy look in her eyes. Hell hath no fury.

                                 ELIN
                        No. You know what? I'm done playing
                        on your terms.

                                 TIGER
                        My what?

                                 ELIN
                        The more we hide, the more they seek.
                        It's time we get ahead of this.

           She puts on a robe. Tiger and Josefin try to talk her down.

                                 TIGER
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up a
                        second. They'll arrest us.

                                 ELIN
                        Maybe we deserve it.
                                 JOSEFIN
                        Elin, you're not thinking straight.
                        Just take a deep breath, sister.

           It's too late. Elin is already storming out into the...

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONT.

           Elin marches, seeing red. Tiger finally catches up to her.

                                 TIGER
                        Hey, you want to hurt me? Take
                        another swing. But if you do this,
                        you hit all of my employees, my
                        foundation, all my sponsors...

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, the press will have a field day
                        with "Just Do It."

                                 TIGER
                        They will drop me. We are talking
                        fortunes, Elin -- down the drain.

                                 ELIN
                        You can afford it.

                                 TIGER
                        Can you?

           Elin stops cold.

                                 ELIN
                        What are you, threatening to "cut off
                        my allowance?"

                                 TIGER
                        I'm just saying, don't go cutting off
                        your nose...

                                 ELIN
                        If I start cutting things, my nose
                        will be the least of your concerns.

           Elin continues on the warpath, leaving Tiger sputtering in
           her wake.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - PORTICO - DUSK

           Two Florida Highway Patrol investigators, DETECTIVE ROY
           GROSS (42), power-tripping pig, and DETECTIVE JASON QUESADA
           (29), dumb rookie, stare skeptically at Steinberg.
                                 DET. GROSS
                        Just to get your story straight: Mr.
                        Woods hit both a fire hydrant and a
                        tree while leaving his own driveway
                        at 2:30 in the morning. Stone sober.
                        Mrs. Woods came to his rescue, broke
                        his back side window for some reason,
                        squeezed herself inside the car, and
                        dragged his limp one-hundred-eighty-
                        five pound body out to safety.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Like I told you, she's a hero.

                                 DET. QUESADA
                        Lucky her, I bet those cameras up
                        there caught it all on tape.

                                 STEINBERG
                        The what now?

           Det. Quesada points out two SECURITY CAMERAS on the house.
           Steinberg blanches. He didn't know about those.

                                 STEINBERG (cont'd)
                        Say... you fellas golf fans?

           Doesn't look that way. Elin opens the door.

                                 ELIN
                        Please come in.

                                 STEINBERG
                        No, wait a second. They don't have a
                        warrant. What are you doing?

           The detectives enter. Steinberg tries to follow, but the 
           door SLAMS in his face. He curses to himself.

           Steinberg rushes off around the side of the house.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - FOYER - CONT.

           Elin leads the way upstairs, her robe revealing more leg
           than she realizes.

                                 ELIN
                        He should be up here somewhere. Sorry
                        for the mess.

                                 DET. QUESADA
                        Looks fine to me.
           Det. Gross cuts Det. Quesada a look, neither noticing the
           hole in the drywall right behind them.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM BALCONY - SUNSET

           Tiger leans over the balustrade, gauging the drop to the
           backyard below. He sees Steinberg jiggling a locked door.

                                 TIGER
                        Psst. Steiny. Psst.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Tiger. Thank God. Give me your keys.

           Tiger throws his keys down to Steinberg.

                                 TIGER
                        OK, throw me up the garden hose.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Why?

                                 TIGER
                        I'll rappel into the pool.

                                 STEINBERG
                        What? No. What? Just find somewhere
                        to hide. No rappelling.

           Steinberg darts inside. Tiger hears something: the WHINE of
           boat engines. He shades his eyes, peering out at Isleworth
           Lake. An armada of PAPARAZZI is invading.

                                 TIGER
                        Shit.

           He has no choice but to retreat into the...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONT.

           Elin shows the investigators in.

                                 ELIN
                        The camera footage? Sure. I'll make a
                        copy when we're done.

           Elin looks around. Tiger is nowhere to be seen.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Tiger?

                                 DET. QUESADA
                        Mr. Woods?
                                 DET. GROSS
                        Check your six.

           Det. Gross motions to a closed door. Someone on the other
           side turns the handle. The door creaks open...

           ...revealing Kultida in the children's bedroom, Sam and
           Charlie cowering behind her legs.

                                 KULTIDA
                        What the hell is going on?

           Sam sobs, waddling into Elin's arms.

                                 SAM
                        Momma, Daddy's being weird again.

                                 DET. GROSS
                        Did she say daddy?

                                 SAM
                        I don't like when Daddy's weird.

                                 DET. GROSS
                        Where's your daddy, sweetheart?

           Det. Gross touches Sam's bare foot. Sam screeches. Elin
           jerks her daughter away.

                                 ELIN
                        Please don't touch my daughter.

                                 DET. GROSS
                        Whoa, are we gonna have a problem?

                                 ELIN
                        No. I'm sorry. It's just-- please
                        stop crying, Sam.

                                 SAM
                        I'm scared.

                                 ELIN
                        Me too.

           Elin sees the fear in Sam's eyes. She hold her close,
           maternal instinct overriding her rage. Like her own mother
           all those years ago, Elin realizes what she has to do.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        But Momma won't let anything happen
                        to you. Promise.
           Elin turns to the investigators.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        I'm sorry, officers. I wasn't
                        thinking straight. I need a lawyer.
                               (
                                realizes
                                        )
                        Several lawyers.

                                 DET. GROSS
                        I won't lie, I'm feeling kind of
                        jerked around here.

                                 ELIN
                        Join the club.

           INT. REC ROOM - MEDIA CLOSET - SAME

           Steinberg scrolls through the security footage. He finds
           what he's looking for. DELETES it.

           He dashes out of the rec room. Then returns, remembering
           something. He grabs the wedding photo off the floor.

           INT. GRAND STAIRCASE - SAME

           The investigators exit, Det. Quesada shrugging resignedly.

                                 DET. QUESADA
                        State's Attorney doesn't want to
                        tangle with his lawyers. Whaddaya do?

                                 DET. GROSS
                        The same thing Tiger's done to us.
                        Pull him down a peg while everyone is
                        watching.

                                 DET. QUESADA
                        We can't even pull a warrant.

                                 DET. GROSS
                        No. But guess which agency can?

           Det. Gross starts to explain, then pauses, staring ahead.

                                 DET. GROSS (cont'd)
                        What is that?

           Below in the foyer, Steinberg steps aside, revealing the
           photo hanging over the hole.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Eternal love.
           INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Elin pulls the lid off a laundry hamper.

                                 ELIN
                        I want a divorce.

           Tiger emerges from soiled bibs and onesies.

                                 TIGER
                        What?

                                 ELIN
                        Lawyer up. My sister's on her way
                        from Stockholm.

                                 TIGER
                        You don't actually want a divorce.

                                 ELIN
                        No, what I actually want is a gun.
                        But I'll settle for a divorce.

           Tiger steps out of the hamper.

                                 TIGER
                        Look, I know I've made a couple of
                        mistakes. I'm sorry. Choices.

                                 ELIN
                        How many?

                                 TIGER
                        Just a couple.
                               (
                                off her look
                                            )
                        Granted, several times apiece. And
                        I'm just sick about it...

           Tiger trails off. Elin is holding up her phone, showing him
           the latest gossip. She reads it aloud.

                                 ELIN
                        "Tiger's Triple Bogey. Three more
                        women say they've played 'a round'
                        with Tiger -- and one of them
                        allegedly has naked photos of him of
                        passed out drunk."

           Elin hands the phone to Tiger.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        If I were you, I'd have Steinberg get
                        in contact with her.
                                 TIGER
                        Wait...

           But Elin is already walking out. Tiger stares at the phone,
           his shoulders slumping in defeat.

           For the first time, he actually looks human.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DEACON CIRCLE - DAY

           Ten days later. The unwashed masses have descended upon
           Isleworth, tearing up the Bermuda grass. Over fifty news
           trucks line the curb. GAWKERS hold signs with suggestive
           comments. A cheeky BBC REPORTER brings us up to speed.

                                 BBC REPORTER
                        While the Woodses may be legally out
                        of the rough, so to speak, Tiger's
                        steamy scorecard just keeps filling
                        up with extra playing partners...

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS

           A parade of TIGER'S MISTRESSES comes forward (all real
           footage), INTERCUT with brief reactions:

                A) INT. NEW YORK FRIARS CLUB - DAY

                   Escort JOSLYN JAMES and feminist superlawyer GLORIA
                   ALLRED hold a press conference.

                                 JOSLYN JAMES
                        After his father died, and after the
                        birth of his children, he was with me.

                B) INT. TIGER'S OFFICE - DAY

                   Steinberg and Tiger watch the presser on TV. Gloria
                   Allred gives the camera a meaningful look.

                                 GLORIA ALLRED (ON TV)
                        He has to contact Joslyn and
                        apologize for lying to her.

                   Steinberg sighs, reading between the lines. He nods
                   at Tiger, who grudgingly cuts a hush money check.

                C) INT. TODAY SHOW SET - DAY

                   MEREDITH VIEIRA interviews stripper JAMIE JUNGERS.
                                 MEREDITH VIERA
                        Tiger never paid you anything?

                                 JAMIE JUNGERS
                        Not even a birthday card. I got
                        nothing from him but a broken heart.

                                 MEREDITH VIEIRA
                        Would you sell your story?

                   Jamie thinks about it.

                D) INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

                   Elin lies in the bathtub, gulping wine between sobs.
                   She slides herself underwater. Doesn't resurface.

                E) EXT. VIVID ENTERTAINMENT - DAY

                   Porn magnate STEVEN HIRSCH talks to a PAPARAZZO.

                                 STEVEN HIRSCH
                        We were approached by someone who has
                        a Tiger Woods sex tape.

                F) INT. CORMIER HOUSE - DAY

                   Jim, Jan, and Hailee watch the video on TMZ.

                                 JEN
                        Holy moly. There's a sex tape?

                                 JIM
                        I'll believe it when I see it.
                               (
                                    )
                                then
                        Set a Google alert.

                G) INT. VIVID ENTERTAINMENT - DAY

                   Steinberg slides a check to "STEVEN HIRSCH" (shot
                   from behind) and a BUSTY BABE (20s). Porno posters
                   line the walls. The babe surrenders a memory card.

                H) INT. BADDA BING - DAY

                   Steinberg slides a check to "JAMIE JUNGERS" in the
                   back of a strip club. She surrenders the nude pics.

                I) INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

                   Steinberg slides a check to "GLORIA ALLRED" and
                   "JOSLYN JAMES." James's G-string hangs out of her
                   suit pants. She signs a non-disclosure agreement.
                J) INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

                   Elin holds herself underwater. After a moment, she
                   emerges, gasping for air. Her heart is broken, but
                   she's still alive.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Josefin slams down a copy of the PRENUP. She's flanked by
           Elin and grizzled divorce attorney DENNIS BELCHER (59). The
           dinner table has been transformed into a negotiation table.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        This prenup was exploitative to start
                        with. But in light of what your
                        client has put mine through, it's
                        just downright inhumane.

           Tiger sits surrounded by his eight-strong, power-suited,
           all-star LEGAL TEAM. His face is mostly healed. Steinberg
           and hot-shot divorce attorney MILES MARKHAM (42) run point.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        Look, I'm sorry, but nobody held her
                        hand and made her sign the thing.

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        The girl was twenty-three and thought
                        his marriage vows were sacred.

                                 STEINBERG
                        What about her vows? No offense, but
                        she's the one who's tapping out here.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Tapping out?

                                 STEINBERG
                        I'm just saying, Tiger thinks the
                        marriage has a fighting chance.
                        There's this therapist -- worked
                        miracles with Kobe and Vanessa.

                                 JOSEFIN
                               (
                                to Elin, in Swedish
                                                   )
                        What is he, autistic?

                                 STEINBERG
                        Think about your family.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        This is just insulting. Get the kids.
                        We're leaving.
           Josefin gets up, gathering her papers. Tiger looks at Elin,
           sucker-punched. She can't meet his eye.

                                 TIGER
                        Leaving? Where?

                                 ELIN
                        We'll wait things out in Sweden. This
                        place is a war zone.

                                 TIGER
                        Are you kidding?

                                 ELIN
                        It's what's best for Sam and Charlie.

                                 TIGER
                        You don't just get to decide that on
                        your own. They're my kids, too.

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, now you notice.

                                 TIGER
                        What is that supposed to mean?

                                 ELIN
                        You're always gone or so strung out
                        you might as well be.

                                 TIGER
                        I'm here now.

           Tiger bridles, but he knows she has a point. Steinberg pats
           his hand reassuringly.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Don't you worry, Ti. Your kids aren't
                        going anywhere.

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        I've got a dozen judges in my Rolodex
                        who'd strongly disagree.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        On what grounds?

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        What grounds?

                                 STEINBERG
                        He made a couple of mistakes. That
                        doesn't make him a bad father.
                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        No, "a couple" doesn't. Nine and
                        counting does.

                                 STEINBERG
                        We count a couple. Tiger still
                        maintains that there were only two.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        You can't be serious. Turn on the
                        news.

           Steinberg rolls his eyes.

                                 STEINBERG
                        If it's on the news, it must be true
                        right?

                                 ELIN
                               (
                                to Josefin, in Swedish
                                                      )
                        What is going on?

                                 STEINBERG
                        It's a witch hunt! I mean, come on,
                        you don't actually believe those
                        bimbos, do you? Where's the evidence?

           Elin gapes at Tiger. Now it's him who can't meet her eye.

                                 ELIN
                        You're buying them all off.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Says who?

           Elin looks like she might leap across and strangle someone.

           INT. PLAYROOM - DAY

           Sam mopes around a tub of sand in a bathing suit and
           goggles, gazing longingly at a papered-over window. Elin,
           Josefin, and Belcher take in the sad sight, regrouping.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        I knew they'd stop at nothing to
                        protect his public image, but to pull
                        that in a private mediation...

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        Got to hand it to them. It's a brazen
                        move, if nothing else.
                                 ELIN
                        It's nothing else, right? The entire
                        planet knows what Tiger did.

           Josefin and Belcher trade a troubled look.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        But can we prove it?

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        We can hurl headlines at him until
                        we're blue in the face, but push to
                        shove, we're soft on evidence.

                                 ELIN
                        Soft? No. Nine women isn't soft. It's
                        a softball team.

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        But they're all on his payroll. I
                        mean, maybe you could jump into the
                        bidding for the next one, but...

                                 ELIN
                        He'd crush me. He's a walking billion
                        dollar corporation. I'm a mom with
                        half a psych degree. I can't play on
                        his terms.

           Stumped silence. Then Josefin has an idea. But based on her
           expression, it's unpleasant.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        So give him what he wants -- on
                        yours, in exchange for a confession.

           Elin laughs.

                                 ELIN
                        What do you want me to do? Waterboard
                        him?

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Worse. I want you to go to therapy
                        with him.

                                 ELIN
                        Is that a joke?

                                 JOSEFIN
                        He's used to getting what he wants,
                        and he wants you. You heard his agent.
           Belcher nods, catching on.

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        Tiger still thinks he can turn this
                        thing around.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        So let him think it. Trick him into,
                        you know, "opening his heart" to save
                        his marriage.

                                 ELIN
                        What heart? I know he looks like us,
                        but there are pieces missing. He's a
                        different species.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        He's only human. You can break him.
                        Every single name you get gives us
                        more leverage.

           Elin wrestles with her conscience.

                                 ELIN
                        This is dark.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        What he's done to you is darker.

                                 ELIN
                        I'm not like him, though. I just
                        don't have that in me.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        You could find it for your kids.

           Off Elin coming around to the idea...

           INT. MAN CAVE - DAY

           CRACK! A cue ball knocks a striped ball into a pocket,
           Steinberg handling the pool stick.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Trust me, pal. A custody battle?
                        Blessing in disguise. She can't take
                        the kids away without your signature.

           Tiger scowls at the table, getting massacred. Charlie
           spectates from a high chair.

           CRACK. Steinberg sinks another stripe.
                                 STEINBERG (cont'd)
                        So we'll cut her a deal. Lock your
                        family up in Isleworth for three more
                        years to help rehab your image in
                        exchange for their eventual release.
                        Everyone wins.

           CRACK. Steinberg pots the final stripe.

                                 STEINBERG (cont'd)
                        She just wins a lot less. I think
                        we'll barely have to pay her.

                                 TIGER
                        I'm not giving up my children in
                        three years.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Don't be silly. It won't look like
                        that. We'll fly them out for photos
                        ops, foundation galas, majors...

                                 TIGER
                        Dude. No. They're my kids. And for
                        that matter, she's my wife. I'm still
                        in love with her.

           Steinberg chuckles, lining up a clear shot on the eight.

                                 STEINBERG
                        You've got a pretty funny way of
                        showing it. I'm sorry, but your
                        marriage is kaput. Corner pocket.

           Steinberg rips the eight. Tiger TRAPS it under his hand.

                                 TIGER
                        I can save it.

           Steinberg looks at Tiger like he's insane. As if on cue,
           Elin enters, cold and businesslike.

                                 ELIN
                        I've reconsidered my position. For
                        the sake of our family, we shall give
                        this couples counselor a try... on
                        two conditions. One: You move into
                        the guesthouse. Two: You never tell a
                        lie to me again. Do you accept?

                                 TIGER
                        Yes.
                                 ELIN
                        We begin tomorrow.

           Elin walks out, the conversation over as abruptly as it
           started. Tiger throws a look at Steinberg. Told you so.

           INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY

           The first therapy session. DR. PATRICK CARNES (65) clicks
           his pen, taking quiet stock of the Woodses. He's a bald man
           with a calculating gaze and a Minnesota accent.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        Have either of you ever been to
                        therapy?

           Tiger shakes his head. Elin nods soberly, in her element.

                                 ELIN
                        When I was young. My parents got
                        divorced. It was... contentious.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        How so? This is a safe space. There
                        are no wrong answers.

                                 ELIN
                        They fought. A lot. They couldn't
                        even be in the same room together.
                        Hell, they couldn't be in the same
                        city. My dad moved away and more or
                        less forgot about us.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        How'd that make you feel?

                                 ELIN
                        Angry, mostly. With my parents. With
                        the universe. Myself. But I got the
                        help I needed. I moved on.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Until my husband slept with half the
                        Vegas Strip. Hello, anger issues. Here
                        we go again. My life is one big
                        vicious cycle.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        It's called grief.

           Elin reflects on this.
                                 ELIN
                        I guess that's one way to put it. I
                        admit, I may have gone through some
                        denial. And some anger, like I said.
                        A little bargaining. A whole lot of
                        depression. Now, I'm ready to start
                        moving toward acceptance. But the
                        problem is, I don't know what to
                        accept.

           Dr. Carnes nods in understanding. They have a nice rapport.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        You need the truth.

                                 ELIN
                        Without it, we have no foundation to
                        rebuild on.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        Do you hear her, Tiger?

                                 TIGER
                        Yes.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        Why not just tell her the truth? Rip
                        the Band-Aid off and start the
                        healing process. It may hurt, but
                        we're in a safe space.

                                 TIGER
                        OK.

           Elin braces herself. Tiger draws a shaky breath.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Here goes nothing. There's no easy
                        way to say this, but the truth is...
                               (
                                hangs his head
                                              )
                        ...I'm a sex addict. I need help.

           Elin is stone-faced. Dr. Carnes looks moved.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        It takes a hell of a lot of courage
                        to admit that.

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, give me a goddamn break.

           Elin snorts, losing her cool. Dr. Carnes is taken aback.
                                 DR. CARNES
                        I beg your pardon?

                                 ELIN
                        I'm sorry, but that's such a lame
                        excuse. He's not a sex addict. This
                        isn't some disease he can't control.

                                 TIGER
                        I couldn't help myself.

                                 ELIN
                        Why would you? You were out there
                        banging porn stars, not exhaust pipes.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        There's a spectrum.

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, I'm sure. But famous athletes are
                        not on it.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        Beg to differ. I think someone so
                        accustomed to the spotlight must've
                        known he would be caught -- and deep
                        down, maybe even wanted to be.

           Tiger double-takes.

                                 TIGER
                        What?

                                 DR. CARNES
                               (
                                to Elin
                                       )
                        Does that not sound like a disorder?

                                 ELIN
                        No. It sounds like a whole 
                        smorgasbord of them. This man is
                        riddled with disorders. But I'm sorry,
                        sex addiction isn't one of them.

           Tiger scoffs.

                                 TIGER
                        What is?

                                 ELIN
                        Where to begin?
                               (
                                counting them off
                                                 )
                        You have your antisocial narcissism,
                        your messiah complex...
                                 TIGER
                        My messiah complex? Where did you get
                        that?

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, I don't know. For starters, how
                        about that EA Sports commercial where
                        you literally walk on water?

                                 TIGER
                        That was tongue-in-cheek.

                                 ELIN
                        Your dad called you the "Chosen One."

                                 TIGER
                        Yeah, my dad said a lot of things.
                        That doesn't make them true. Just ask
                        my mom.

                                 ELIN
                        What?

                                 TIGER
                        Forget it. Let's move on.

           Tiger clams up. Dr. Carnes and Elin try to pry him open.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        No, speak on that.

                                 TIGER
                        I'd rather not.

                                 ELIN
                        What did he do?

                                 TIGER
                        It's not important.

                                 ELIN
                        Then just say it.

                                 TIGER
                               (
                                to Dr. Carnes
                                             )
                        Did my agent have you sign an NDA?

                                 ELIN
                        I knew he wouldn't take this
                        seriously.

           Elin gets up, threatening to leave. Tiger caves.
                                 TIGER
                        Fine. He cheated on her -- left and
                        right. There. You happy?

           Bombshell. Elin returns to her seat. If she knew, she's
           never heard him open up about it. Dr. Carnes probes.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        Did they stay together?

                                 TIGER
                        He would always win her back. Say
                        what you will, my old man had a way
                        with women. Taught me everything I
                        know.

           Tiger chuckles grimly. Dr. Carnes senses a breakthrough.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        There's no winning this one, Tiger.
                        Learn to lose, and live to play
                        another day. Tell Elin everything.
                        She loves you. You can trust her.

           Elin flickers with guilt. She snuffs it out. Tiger turns
           inward, facing down his demons. After a moment, he gets up.

                                 TIGER
                        This was a bad idea. I'm sorry for
                        wasting your time.

           He walks out. Elin looks on, seeing the flaws in his armor.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Tiger's bodyguards patrol a makeshift fence blockading the
           lake.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - VERANDA - CONT.

           Josefin lights a hand-rolled cigarette. Elin gazes out at
           the eyesore, gathering her thoughts.

                                 ELIN
                        He doesn't trust me.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        That's rich.

                                 ELIN
                        He doesn't trust anyone. He didn't
                        even trust his dad.
                                 JOSEFIN
                        He trusted all these slampas not to
                        out him.

                                 ELIN
                        He forgot himself, I think. There was
                        no pressure to perform with them, to
                        be this perfect person. He could let
                        his walls down. Just have fun.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Or maybe he's just an entitled prick.

                                 ELIN
                        He's definitely that. But there's
                        another side. We used to get drunk
                        and just talk for hours. We had fun
                        together -- before we had kids.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        It sounds like Tiger never stopped.

                                 ELIN
                        I can still have fun.

           Elin has a plan. She steals a drag of Josefin's cigarette.
           COUGHS. Josefin pats her on the back, somewhat skeptical.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Stick to booze.

           INT. ISLEWORTH WINES & SPIRITS - DAY

           A CASHIER (20s) in a Santa hat listens to the STERN SHOW on
           the radio, featuring guest caller DONALD TRUMP (real audio).

                                 HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
                        Hey, look who's on the phone. Our old
                        friend, Donald Trump. Hey, Donald,
                        tell me. Have you been in touch with
                        Tiger Woods?

                                 DONALD TRUMP (ON RADIO)
                        Well, I know Tiger. I like Tiger a
                        whole lot. But I don't know what's
                        going on with with him and his wife.

           Elin browses the aquavit selection, her face hidden behind
           oversize sunglasses. She can hear the radio. Crystal clear.

                                 HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
                        She's hot. She's hot, though, right?
                                 DONALD TRUMP (ON RADIO)
                        Meh. She's fine. She's kind of past
                        her prime.

                                 HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
                        You don't think she's hot enough for
                        Tiger Woods? What are her flaws?

           Elin turns to flee -- bumping directly into Jen Cormier.

                                 ELIN
                        I'm sorry.

                                 JAN
                        Bless your heart. Wait. Elin?

           Jen peers hard into Elin's dark lenses. The Stern Show is
           still audible. This is Elin's personal hell.

                                 ELIN
                        Hello, Jen.

                                 JEN
                        Elin. As I live and breathe. How
                        are... things?

                                 ELIN
                        Oh, you know.

                                 JEN
                        All about it. Ugh, I mean, these
                        tabloids have no decency. I read that
                        you and Tiger are in counseling?

                                 ELIN
                        Uh-huh.

                                 JEN
                        I think that's great, hun. You just
                        do what's best for you. Tune out the
                        critics.

                                 ELIN
                        What critics?

                                 JEN
                        That's the spirit. They don't know
                        how hard it'd be to start life over
                        at our age. In this economy? Hold
                        onto what you've got.

           Elin can't even. This woman has a decade on her. Easy.
                                 ELIN
                        I really should be going.

           Elin turns to go -- startling as she bumps into Hailee.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 HAILEE
                        I'm sorry.

                                 ELIN
                        No, it's my fault. Merry Christmas,
                        Hailee.

                                 HAILEE
                        Wait--

           But Elin is already halfway gone. She throws some money at
           the cashier for her aquavit, the radio chasing her out.

                                 HOWARD STERN (ON RADIO)
                        ...rumor is, this stripper does a
                        position where Tiger Woods, I'm gonna
                        be a little bit graphic, Tiger stood
                        her on her head, listen to this...

                                 DONALD TRUMP (ON RADIO)
                               (
                                laughs
                                      )
                        Spun her around.

           And only now do we notice: Hailee is holding TIGER'S CELL
           PHONE from the night of the crash. She looks at it guiltily.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - REC ROOM - NIGHT

           THWOCK! Tiger lashes a ball down Augusta's first fairway on
           his state-of-the-art indoor golf simulator.

           Off to the side, the evening news plays on TV. CNN Host DON
           LEMON reports on the scandal (real footage).

                                 DON LEMON (ON TV)
                        We begin with a bombshell in the
                        sports world. Accenture, the company
                        behind this well-known TV ad, is the
                        first sponsor to drop Tiger Woods.

           THWOCK! Tiger spanks another ball, taking out his emotions
           on the impact screen. A clip from the Accenture ad plays on
           TV: Tiger being outdriven by a TEEN GIRL on a dusky range.

                        know where the next competitor is
                        coming from. Go on. Be a Tiger.

           THWOCK. Tiger creams another ball.

                                 DON LEMON (ON TV)
                        You can put a red mark next to that
                        one. Who'll fall next?

           THWOCK. CNN plays a speech that Earl gave at the 1996 Fred
           Haskins Awards for the best collegiate golfers.

                        He is the Chosen One.

           In a fit of fury, Tiger FLINGS his club aside --
           -- SHATTERING the glass front of his trophy case.

           Tiger heaves a sigh. It could be worse. All his precious
           cups and jackets look unscathed.

           Then something CREAKS. Tiger watches, helpless.

           Half the case COLLAPSES in a heap of twisted hardware,
           splintered glass, and broken ego.

                                 ELIN (O.S.)
                        Uh, Tiger?

           Elin is standing in the doorway. She just sighs.

                                 ELIN
                        I can't believe I'm saying this, but
                        it looks like we both could use a
                        drink. Christmas truce?

           Elin holds up the aquavit. Tiger is dumbfounded.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER

           Nostalgic alt-rock plays on the hi-fi. The aquavit sits
           half-killed on the simulator turf. Elin lines up a putt.

           Tiger bellies up to fix her form. He's already slurring.

                                 TIGER
                        Protip: Keep your hips over your
                        heels. Jus' like this.

                                 ELIN
                        Don't think even about it.

                                 TIGER
                        Sorry, sorry. My bad.

           Tiger backs away. Elin drains the putt. She fist pumps.

                                 ELIN
                        Come to Momma! What's that, five
                        holes in a row? I thought you were
                        supposed to be good at this.

                                 TIGER
                        You're makin' me play lefty.

                                 ELIN
                        Psh. Excuses.
                                 TIGER
                        With a blindfold on.

           Tiger lowers a Nike visor over his eyes. Elin pours a shot.

                                 ELIN
                        Did someone call the wambulance? Stop
                        crying. Take your shot.

           Tiger takes it. Elin gauges his drunkenness. He's hammered.

                                 TIGER
                        'Nother hole?

                                 ELIN
                        Why don't we raise the stakes a bit?

                                 TIGER
                        I'm listenin'.

                                 ELIN
                        If I win this next hole, you have to
                        answer any question that I ask you.

           A sobering pause. Tiger can't turn down a bet.

                                 TIGER
                        And if I win, I move back into the
                        house.

                                 ELIN
                        You do realize I'd just move into the
                        guesthouse, right?

                                 TIGER
                        Free country. But the kids stay here
                        with me.

           Tiger extends his hand. Elin makes herself shake it.

                                 ELIN
                        Bring it on.

           MOMENTS LATER

           THWACK. Elin slaps a runner down the fairway. She's not bad.

                                 ELIN
                        In the spirit of good sportsmanship,
                        I probably should apologize for what
                        I said in therapy.

           Tiger tees up, lowering his visor.
                                 TIGER
                        I know you didn't mean it.

                                 ELIN
                        No. I did. But I'm not qualified to
                        make a diagnosis like that... yet.

           PING! Tiger's lefty driving form is impressively fluid, but
           the shot hooks into the pines. He lifts the visor. Grimaces.

                                 TIGER
                        Yet?

                                 ELIN
                        My New Years Resolution is to finish
                        school.

                                 TIGER
                        You're kiddin'. Good for you.

                                 ELIN
                        Thanks. I figure I should make myself
                        employable in case you leave me
                        penniless.

           THWACK. Elin lays up, playing it safe. Tiger looks on,
           conscience-stricken. He drops a ball on a mat made of
           artificial pine straw, one of several imitation lies.

                                 TIGER
                        I'll tell ya what. If you're still
                        here at Rollins, your tuition 'n your
                        textbooks are on me.

                                 ELIN
                        My textbooks, too? In that case, call
                        off the divorce.

           Tiger chuckles. He lowers his visor. HACKS his ball into a
           fairway bunker. Lifts his visor. Grimaces.

                                 TIGER
                        My resolution's to take a break from
                        golf.

                                 ELIN
                        Ha.

                                 TIGER
                        No joke. I figure I should make some
                        time to hang out with the kids in
                        case you leave me childless. I'll
                        kick it for a while, just have fun.
           Elin covers her surprise. THWACK. She lays up again.

                                 ELIN
                        Trust me, not as fun as it sounds.

           Tiger sighs, plunking his ball in a box of sand.

                                 TIGER
                        What is? Outside of gettin' wasted
                        and, well, doing other stuff.

           He lowers his visor. Takes an unorthodox CHOP at the ball.
           It bounces down the fairway, skips onto the green...

           ...and rolls into the cup. Elin's jaw drops. Tiger smirks.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Except for winning. Nothin' beats
                        winning.

           Elin just stands there in shock. Tiger yawns.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Well, I think I may go check up on
                        the kiddos, 'n then hit the Tempur-
                        Pedic. That ol' box spring has been
                        torture on my back. Nighty night.

           Tiger ambles off with a little wave. Elin shuts her eyes,
           seething with frustration.

           She can't win.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY THE NEXT MORNING

           Tiger sleeps off the booze in the big comfy bed. Several
           pill bottles sit on the nightstand.

           DING-DONG. The doorbell rings. Tiger is out cold.

           DING-DONG. It rings again. Sam walks up, glancing at the
           pill bottles. She tries to shake her dad awake.

                                 SAM
                        Daddy, wake up. Daddy! Daddy?

           No luck. Sam lets out a sad sigh.

                                 SAM (cont'd)
                        Not again.

           Kultida bursts into the room, holding Charlie. She hurls
           some clothes at Tiger.
                                 KULTIDA
                        Wake up, Tiger! Put some clothes on.
                        The police are here.

           Tiger jerks awake, disoriented. The doorbell rings again.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - PORTICO - DAY

           Tiger opens the door, shielding his eyes from the sun.

                                 TIGER
                        Yeah?

           Detective Gross removes his finger from the bell. At his
           side is a harried-looking social worker, MRS. DIAZ (39).

                                 DET. GROSS
                        Mr. Woods, how big of you to grace us
                        with your presence. I'm Detective
                        Gross, and this is...

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Mrs. Diaz. Department of Children and
                        Families. Nice to meet you.

           Tiger blinks in confusion.

                                 TIGER
                        What is this about?

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        The safety of your children. We've
                        received a tip alleging that they're
                        living in a dangerous environment.

                                 TIGER
                        Wait, what? I don't understand. I
                        thought we weren't in trouble.

                                 DET. GROSS
                        DCF will have the final say on that.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Just need to ask you and your family
                        a few questions.

           Tiger looks ill.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - PLAYROOM - DAY

           Mrs. Diaz sits in a kiddie chair, a clipboard in her hand.
                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Quite the family you have here.

           Across from her, the Woodses sit in kiddie chairs with Sam
           and Charlie in their laps, surrounded by their legal teams.
           Steinberg, Josefin, and a FAMILY LAWYER (40s) are indignant.

                                 STEINBERG
                        With all respect, this is a cheap
                        shot and you know it.

                                 FAMILY LAWYER
                        Sour grapes.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Has Mrs. Woods not been humiliated
                        enough? This is outrageous.

           Miles Markham motions for them to calm down.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        What they mean to say is clearly
                        there's been some misunderstanding.
                        Mr. and Mrs. Woods are both devoted
                        parents.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Great. Then it's in their best
                        interest to be candid with me. Mrs.
                        Woods, may I resume? Or do you and
                        your lawyers need more time?

           Elin gives Josefin a look. She's got this. She turns to Mrs.
           Diaz with her game face on.

                                 ELIN
                        Ask away. I'm an open book.

           Mrs. Diaz scans her clipboard.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Where were we? Ah. Mrs. Woods, have
                        you ever struck your husband?

           The lawyers hold their breath. But Elin is a brick wall.

                                 ELIN
                        No.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Have you ever pushed, slapped, kicked
                        or intentionally caused him bodily
                        harm?
                                 ELIN
                        No.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Have you ever chased him with a
                        weapon?

                                 ELIN
                        No.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Threatened him?

                                 ELIN
                        Not that I recall.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Lost your temper with him?

                                 ELIN
                        I don't lose my temper.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Ever?

                                 ELIN
                        Nope.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Overall, would you say you have a
                        happy marriage?

                                 ELIN
                        Definitely.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Would you say he's a good father?

                                 ELIN
                        No.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I'd say he's a great one. Our kids are
                        blessed to have him as a role model.

                                 STEINBERG
                        My kids as well.

                                 FAMILY LAWYER
                        Mine too.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        Who wouldn't want to have a dad like
                        Tiger Woods?
           The lawyers nod at Elin, satisfied. Tiger shifts
           uncomfortably. Mrs. Diaz flips the page and turns to him.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Any drug use, Mr. Woods?

                                 TIGER
                        No.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Including medications?

           Tiger starts to speak, but Steinberg cuts him off.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Don't answer that. My client's
                        medical history is private.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Would you rather take a drug test at
                        our office, Mr. Woods? It'd probably
                        do you good to get out of the house.

           Tiger and Steinberg trade a look.

                                 TIGER
                        That won't be necessary. I just take
                        some things to help me sleep.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Such as?

                                 TIGER
                        Sleeping pills.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        That's it?

                                 TIGER
                        Pretty much. Maybe a painkiller every
                        now and then.

                                 STEINBERG
                        When he's in pain.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Are you in pain a lot?

           Tiger shrugs.

                                 TIGER
                        It's part of playing sports and
                        getting older.
           Mrs. Diaz looks Tiger over. His brow is beaded with sweat.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Would you say you have drug problem?

                                 TIGER
                        More of a solution. I've won seven
                        times this season. I'd say I'm doing
                        just fine.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        I'm not concerned about your golf
                        career. That isn't why I'm here.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Tiger takes his medication as
                        prescribed, if that's your question.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Do you always take the recommended
                        dose?

           A telling pause.

                                 TIGER
                        Yeah.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Ever lie about your use of
                        medication, Mr. Woods?

                                 TIGER
                        No.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Has anyone ever objected to it?

           Tiger glances at Elin. She's poker-faced.

                                 TIGER
                        Not that I recall.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Would you say it's had an impact on
                        your marriage?

                                 TIGER
                        I don't think so.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        How about on your ability to parent?

           Tiger swallows, looking down at Sam on his lap.
                                 TIGER
                        No.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Almost done.

           Mrs. Diaz flips the page. The lawyers nod at Tiger,
           satisfied. Mrs. Diaz takes a PILL BOTTLE out of her satchel.

                                 MRS. DIAZ (cont'd)
                        Do you know what drugs are, Sam?

           Sam nods. Tiger's heart stops. Steinberg intervenes.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Objection.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        This is not a court room, sir. Would
                        you please let me finish?

           Steiberg reluctantly stands down. Mrs. Diaz smiles at Sam,
           Tiger and Elin watching tensely.

                                 MRS. DIAZ (cont'd)
                        Sam, how do you know what drugs are?

                                 SAM
                        Daddy eats them.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Daddy eats them? Then what happens?

                                 SAM
                        He gets weird.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Weird in a good way or a bad way?

                                 SAM
                        Bad. It's scary.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Scary? How?

                                 SAM
                        He talks funny, then he goes asleep.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        What's scary about sleeping?

                                 SAM
                        I'm afwaid he won't wake up.
           Tiger lowers his head, a wave of guilt crashing over him.
           Mrs. Diaz stares.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Which one of you is telling me the
                        truth? You or your daughter?

           Steinberg points at Sam.

                                 STEINBERG
                        She's lying.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        She's confused. You can't expect a
                        kid to understand the difference
                        between drug use and abuse.

           Tiger mutters something under his breath.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        I didn't catch that, Mr. Woods? What
                        did you say?

                                 TIGER
                        I said he's right. You can't expect a
                        kid to understand the difference.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        Like I'm saying--

                                 TIGER
                        But I understand it perfectly. And if
                        I'm being honest with myself, I might
                        have a couple issues.

           Stunned silence. Steinberg glares at Tiger.

                                 STEINBERG
                        He's kidding.

                                 TIGER
                        I'm so sorry, Sam. I didn't think you
                        noticed.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Not the time.

           Tiger turns to Elin, taking her hand. She lets him.

                                 TIGER
                        I would never, ever put the kids in
                        danger, at least knowingly. But I
                        can't say the same about myself.
           Steinberg face-palms. The lawyers are speechless. Elin is
           astonished. Tiger turns to Mrs. Diaz.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Is that candid enough for you?

           Mrs. Diaz says nothing, taken aback by his honesty.

           INT. FOYER - DAY

           The Woodses walk Mrs. Diaz to the door.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        I'll be in touch with my decision.

                                 ELIN
                        Is there nothing you can tell us?

           Mrs. Diaz wavers. She decides to be candid in return.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        Look, your kids are healthy, happy,
                        and wear Ferragamo shoes. You aren't
                        the parents of the year, but you're
                        half-decent. You'll be fine.

           Tiger and Elin breathe a sigh of relief.

                                 TIGER
                        Let me guess. She's the decent half?

           Mrs. Diaz nods, pulling out a pamphlet on DRUG ADDICTION.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        You need to get some help. I'd start
                        with this. And also this.

           She pull out a pamphlet on SEX ADDICTION. Then ones on
           ALCOHOL ADDICTION, GAMBLING ADDICTION, and WORK ADDICTION.

                                 MRS. DIAZ (cont'd)
                        And this as well. This can't hurt
                        either. This one too.

                                 TIGER
                        That's probably good for now.

                                 MRS. DIAZ
                        All right. You guys have a Merry
                        Christmas -- but not too merry.

           With that, Mrs. Diaz exits. Elin suddenly realizes that she
           and Tiger are still holding hands. She jerks away.
                                 ELIN
                        That was monumentally stupid of you.

                                 TIGER
                        Yeah. I'm kinda still drunk from last
                        night.

                                 ELIN
                        Me too.

           An awkward silence. Elin admires what he did, but she can't
           bring herself to say it. So she simply walks away.

           Tiger watches her go, a curious look on his face. He felt a
           spark between them.

           Elin purses her lips, worried and confused. She felt it too.

           INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger reads Sam a bedtime story: Oh, The Places You'll Go,
           by Dr. Seuss. A night light projector illuminates the walls.

                                 TIGER
                        "Oh, the places you'll go! There is
                        fun to be done! There are points to 
                        be scored. There are games to be won.
                        And the magical things you can do 
                        with that ball will make you the
                        winning-est winner of all. Fame!
                        You'll be famous as famous can be,
                        with the whole wide world watching 
                        you win on TV. Except when they don't.
                        Because, sometimes, they won't."

                                 SAM
                        Daddy?

                                 TIGER
                        What?

                                 SAM
                        Why is Momma mad at you?

           Tiger bookmarks the page and sets the book on a nightstand.

                                 TIGER
                        It's complicated, sweetie.

                                 SAM
                        Why?
                                 TIGER
                        I won't get into specifics. God knows
                        you'll hear all about it when you're
                        older. All you need to know is: Daddy
                        hurt Momma's feelings. Very badly.

                                 SAM
                        Give her a kiss to make it better.

                                 TIGER
                        I'm not sure if she'd appreciate a
                        kiss. She's really mad at me.

                                 SAM
                        Will you and Momma ever kiss again?

           Tiger smooths Sam's hair.

                                 TIGER
                        I hope so, Sam. But to be honest, I
                        don't know. That's up to Momma.
                               (
                                pauses
                                      )
                        But I do know that whatever happens,
                        kisses or no kisses, I will always be
                        your dad. No matter what. You can't
                        get rid of me.

           A BABY MONITOR sits on the dresser, transmitting to...

           INT. GUESTHOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

           ...a receiver on the nightstand. Elin listens in bed.

                                 TIGER (ON BABY MONITOR)
                        I'll always love you, for as long as
                        I live. And that's a promise.

           Elin stares up at the ceiling, trying to block him out.

           INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger glances at the monitor. He knows it's there.

                                 TIGER
                        Goodnight.

           INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY

           Christmas morning. Tiger helps Sam unwrap a set of Fisher-
           Price golf clubs. Kultida takes photos.

           Elin watches from across the room with Charlie in her lap
           and a tall Bloody Mary in her hand.
           INT. GUESTHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Josefin slides a real estate flyer across a table to Elin
           and Charlie, talking up the pictured Stockholm penthouse.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Now presenting... the most darling
                        divorcée pad in the Östermalm! It's
                        child-friendly, paparazzi-proof, just
                        a skip away from Stockholm
                        University...

                                 ELIN
                        And hop, jump, and thirteen-hour red-
                        eye from their father.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        You know what they say: location,
                        location, location!

           Elin fakes a smile. Josefin sees through it.

                                 JOSEFIN (cont'd)
                        Don't get soft on me.

                                 ELIN
                        Excuse me?

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Don't get soft on me. I know that
                        face. You're having second thoughts.

                                 ELIN
                        Don't be ridiculous. If anyone is
                        "getting soft," it's Tiger.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Then how come he hasn't told you one
                        damn name? Not a one?

           Elin doesn't have an answer. Josefin does.

                                 JOSEFIN (cont'd)
                        He's playing you.

                                 ELIN
                        I'm playing him.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        And you're getting outplayed. This
                        was a bad idea. You've always had a
                        weakness for that prick.
           Elin bristles.

                                 ELIN
                        What can I say? I have a weakness for
                        tall, dark, and handsome superstars.
                        Who doesn't?

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Me.
                               (
                                off
                                    Elin's look)
                        I told you not to sign that goddamn
                        prenup.

                                 ELIN
                        Give it a rest. You would've signed
                        if you'd been in my shoes.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        I would've walked.

                                 ELIN
                        Easy for you to say.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        What's that supposed mean?

                                 ELIN
                        Come back and talk to me when Henrik
                        Lundkvist wants to start a family
                        with you. Then you'll understand.

           Elin laughs to soften the blow. But it sill lands. Josefin
           recoils, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        What can I say? You hit the jackpot.

                                 ELIN
                        Right back at you, sis.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        I'm sorry?

                                 ELIN
                        What's the finder's fee for my
                        "divorcée dream pad"? I'm just
                        curious. What's your cut?

           Josefin shrugs.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        A girl's got to keep the lights on
                        somehow. We all have our talents.
                                 ELIN
                        Let me guess. Mine is gold-digging.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        No. If you were good at that, we
                        wouldn't be here.

                                 ELIN
                        I'll take that as a compliment. I
                        loved him. That's the truth. But now?
                        I think I'll love cleaning him out.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        I hope you do. But without evidence,
                        it's never going to happen. And the
                        fact is, Tiger trusted all those
                        slampas more than you.

           Now it's Elin's turn to shrug.

                                 ELIN
                        If you can't beat them...

                                 JOSEFIN
                        What does that mean?

                                 ELIN
                        I know how to break him. Everybody
                        does.

           Elin struts out. Josefin reads between the lines.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        You're not saying what I think
                        you're... Elin, no! Do not get soft
                        on me!

                                 ELIN
                        Trust me, I'll be anything but soft.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - BOUDOIR - NIGHT

           A makeup brush paints glittery blue eyeshadow on eyelids.
           Delicate fingers glue on false lashes. Cherry red lipstick
           colors plump lips. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

           ...Tiger's face. Not Elin's. Sam is giving him a makeover.
           He looks completely terrifying. Sam can't stop cracking up.

                                 SAM
                        You're so pretty, daddy.

           Tiger examines himself in the mirror, a tad self-conscious.
                                 TIGER
                        Really? Do you think?

                                 KULTIDA (O.S.)
                        What the hell is going on?

           Kultida walks in. Tiger startles, wiping off the lipstick.

                                 TIGER
                        Huh? Nothing. Just, uh... having a
                        little fun.
                               (
                                clears his throat
                                                 )
                        What's up?

           Kultida decides not to ask any questions.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Elin needs to speak to you upstairs.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger enters, his makeup half smeared off. No sign of Elin.

                                 TIGER
                        Hello?

           The door SHUTS behind him. Tiger turns around. His jaw hits
           the floor.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Holy...

           Elin stands before him, dolled up in a skimpy cocktail dress
           and heavy makeup. In short, she looks one of Tiger's
           mistresses. Elin draws back at the sight of Tiger's makeup.

                                 ELIN
                        ...shit.

                                 TIGER
                        You look...

                                 ELIN
                        ...absolutely hideous. Is that
                        eyeshadow?

           Tiger starts to wipe it off.

                                 TIGER
                        It's kind of a funny story. Sam and I
                        were--

           Elin stops him.
                                 ELIN
                        Keep it on. The less you look like
                        you, the easier this will be.

                                 TIGER
                        What will...?

           Elin's dress falls to her stilettos. Tiger gulps.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Oh.

           Tiger moves in to kiss her. Elin SHOVES him back.

                                 ELIN
                        No kissing.

                                 TIGER
                        What?

           Tiger gropes at her. Elin SHOVES him onto the bed.

                                 ELIN
                        No touching.

                                 TIGER
                        Why?

                                 ELIN
                        I don't know where you've been. Until
                        I do, you won't lay a single finger
                        on me. Do you understand?

                                 TIGER
                        Not really. What am I supposed to...?

           Tiger is struck speechless. Elin's bra drops into his lap.

                                 ELIN
                        You were saying?

                                 TIGER
                        Nothing.

                                 ELIN
                        Spread your limbs.
                               (
                                off his hesitation
                                                  )
                        I said spread them!

           Tiger splays out. Elin grabs four sock-like golf club head
           covers from his golf bag. She ties him to the bedposts.

           Elin mounts him. She gyrates. Teasing and denying.
                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        It must be frustrating being stuck
                        inside this big, dark house with no
                        release. Has it been frustrating?

                                 TIGER
                        Uh-huh.

                                 ELIN
                        All that tension. All those little
                        urges. Can you feel them in you?
                        Rising? Building up? Ready to burst?

                               (
                                 TIGER
                                breathless
                                          )
                        Yeah.

                                 ELIN
                        Would you like me to release them,
                        Tiger? Would you?

           Tiger ogles her, his dick battling his brain.

                                 TIGER
                        Why are you doing this?

                                 ELIN
                        I thought you'd like it.

                                 TIGER
                        No, I do. You look amazing. It's
                        just... this isn't you.

                                 ELIN
                        That's the whole point.

           Tiger feels a twinge of guilt.

                                 TIGER
                        I want this to be real.

                                 ELIN
                        It's real.

                                 TIGER
                        Do you still love me?

                                 ELIN
                        You know it.

                                 TIGER
                        Say you love me.
           Elin falters. Then recovers. She looks Tiger in the eye.

                                 ELIN
                        I love you.

           And she means it. Maybe not in a romantic way, but Elin
           still cares deeply for him.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Do you love me?

           Tiger nods. Elin leans close, her breath hot in his ear.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        How much?

                                                      CUT TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK

           We hear the CRINKLING of paper.

           INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY

           Tiger unfolds a four-page handwritten list, Elin peeking at
           it with increasing dread. They're in therapy.

                                 TIGER
                        Are you absolutely, positively sure
                        you need to hear this?

           Elin steels her nerves.

                                 ELIN
                        Just do it.

           Tiger looks at Dr. Carnes for the go-ahead.

                                 DR. CARNES
                        Whenever you're ready.

                                 TIGER
                        OK.

           He begins, his voice low and tentative.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        The first one was this waitress.
                        Topless waitress. Bottomless, too. At
                        this strip club in Atlanta after the
                        WGC-Amex. Um, I think she said her
                        name was Chandelier? Probably fake.
                                 (MORE)
                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Anyway, it started out as just a
                        totally innocent lap dance...

           Elin shuts her eyes. This will be harder than she thought.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER

           Tiger soldiers on.

                                 TIGER
                        Number six. The order isn't
                        chronological. Theresa Rogers. She's
                        this older woman I met at the gym. I
                        later found out she was trying to get
                        pregnant -- with the blessing of her
                        husband, who's a fan of mine. Dodged
                        a bullet there.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER

           Tiger lowers the list. This one is seared in his memory.

                                 TIGER
                        Number eleven. Jamie Jungers. May
                        3rd, 2006.

           Elin looks up, recognizing the date. Tiger recounts a

                        I was with her when my father passed
                        away. I left his deathbed to meet up
                        with her. And while I was gone...

                        You'd think I would've learned my
                        lesson after that. But you'd be wrong.

           off Tiger's shoulders and place it onto Elin's.

           Tiger double-checks the list.

                        ...and the masseuse out at Trump

                        twenty. Might've missed a couple here
                        or there, what with the drugs and
                        stuff. But yeah. I'm not sure what to
                        tell you. I'm so sorry.

           Elin makes a sort of choking noise.

                                 ELIN
                        Why?

           Tiger thinks on it.

                                 TIGER
                        Because I could. I thought I was
                        special. That the rules didn't apply
                        to me. And, honestly, I needed an
                        escape. My life is a fishbowl. I
                        just... I had to escape.

           Dr. Carnes gestures to a covered window, the media outside.

                        Yet here you are, more trapped than
                        ever.

           Tiger shakes his head.

                                 TIGER
                        I'm not trapped. I'm just hiding. But
                        you know what? Not anymore.

           Tiger sets the list down by Elin and gets up. He seems
           liberated. Possibly unhinged. Elin can't quite tell.

                        So I say screw it. I'm right here.
                        Come and get me.

           Tiger RIPS the paper down, bright white sunlight pouring in.

           Blinding white snow. The buzzer BLARES. A Swiss SKI JUMPER
           zooms past, shooting under a banner for the Vancouver 2010
           Winter Olympics.

           The ski jumper FLIES off the ramp. She glides through the
           thin air. Lands gracefully. Pumps her arms in celebration...

           ...but is met with just a flurry of applause. The ski jumper
           looks over at the CROWD in confusion...

           ...and finds a sea of people's backs. They're all watching
           Tiger's famous PUBLIC APOLOGY (excerpted verbatim) on the
           Jumbotron. He reads haltingly into the camera from a podium.

                        Good morning. And thank you for
                        joining me. While I have always tried
                        to be a private person, there are
                        some things I want to say.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

           PEDESTRIANS gather under the big screens. Not since O.J.'s
           Bronco chase has America been so riveted by a broadcast.

                        I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I
                        cheated.

           Elin packs her things. Sam and Charlie watch Tiger on TV.

                        I understand people have questions.
                        They want to know the details of my
                        infidelity. They want to know if
                        Elin and I will remain together.

                                 SAM
                        Mommy, are you moving back home?

           Sam points out the window to the main house. Elin stops
           packing, trying to find the words.

           INT. TPC SAWGRASS RESORT - BALLROOM - DAY

           Tiger looks up from his notes, speaking from the heart.

                                 TIGER
                        As far as I'm concerned, these are
                        private matters between her and me.
                        For the sake of my family, please
                        leave them alone. They didn't do
                        these things. I did. I'm the one who
                        needs to change. I owe it to them to
                        become a better person. Thank you.

           He's met with funereal silence from the audience, save for
           the SHUTTERING of cameras. Phil Knight whispers something to
           Steinberg, who reacts as if he's hearing his death sentence.

           INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - DAY - MOVING

           Tiger gazes out the window as they enter gorgeous Isleworth.
           Steinberg juggles emails on his phone.
                                 STEINBERG
                        I hope you're happy. Gatorade is
                        dumping us. Gillette may sue for
                        moral breach of contract. And, no
                        biggie, but Phil Knight said Nike
                        might scale back its golf line.

                                 TIGER
                        They're all gone.

                                 STEINBERG
                        With that attitude, they will be. You
                        just have to get back out there on
                        the course. Winning takes care of
                        everything.

                                 TIGER
                        No, the press is gone. Look. They're
                        all gone.

           Tiger points outside. The media has packed up and left town.
           He opens the privacy glass, speaking to the driver.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Can you pull over?

                                 STEINBERG
                        What? Why?

                                 TIGER
                        'Cause the alternative is throwing
                        myself out of a moving vehicle. I
                        love you, man, but something I can't
                        stand you.

           The limo stops. Tiger exits, leaving Steinberg sputtering.

           EXT. DEACON CIRCLE - DAY

           Tiger strolls down the emptied out street, feeling like a
           new man. He stops to pick an orange from a tree. Peels it.

           A happy SENIOR COUPLE (80s) waves from a passing golf cart.

           Tiger waves back. He bites into his orange. Life is sweet.

           Tiger punches in the code to his gate. It swings opens,
           welcoming him home. As he starts down the driveway...

                                 HAILEE (O.S.)
                        Hey, douchebag!
           Tiger turns around -- SPLAT! An iced coffee explodes across
           his chest. Tiger blinks through the mess at --

           -- HAILEE CORMIER. She's livid.

                                 HAILEE
                        Yeah, you, you son of a bitch!
                        Remember me?

           Tiger draws a blank. Hailee gasps.

                                 HAILEE (cont'd)
                        Oh my God. You don't remember me? The
                        girl from down the street who you...

           She mashes her hands together in a sexual gesture.

                                 HAILEE (cont'd)
                        ...on the pull-out in your office?
                        And then never texted again?

           Tiger finally places her.

                                 TIGER
                        Shit.

                                 HAILEE
                        You told me I was the only woman
                        other than your wife!

                                 TIGER
                        I remember you. I'm just a little
                        fuzzy.

                                 HAILEE
                        Fuzzy?

                                 TIGER
                        Not sure if you've heard, but I've
                        been working through some things.

                                 HAILEE
                        Oh, I've heard all about it. Fourteen
                        other "things." You're a womanizer!

                                 TIGER
                        Look, from the bottom of my heart,
                        I'm really sorry.

           Tiger wrings out his shirt.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        What is this? Iced coffee?
                                 HAILEE
                        I wish it was hot!

           Hailee storms off toward the house. Tiger follows.

                                 TIGER
                        Where are you going?

                                 HAILEE
                        To tell your wife about us. I just, I
                        can't live like this.

                                 TIGER
                        Whoa, whoa, hold up a second. Wait.
                        Don't do that. Let me tell her.
                        Please. It has to come from me.

           Hailee shakes her head, inconsolable.

                                 HAILEE
                        I was there that night, you know.
                        After your accident? When you kept
                        passing out? I hid your phone, and
                        made sure nobody took pictures.

                                 TIGER
                        That was you?
                               (
                                off her look
                                            )
                        Why?

                                 HAILEE
                        I cared about you, asshole. Maybe I
                        was just another face in the crowd,
                        but I'm a person too. With feelings.
                        And so help me God, you'll never
                        forget that again.

                                 TIGER
                        Look, I'm sorry. Please just let me--

           Tiger pulls up gingerly, grabbing his lower back.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Ow, my back. Wait, I think I tweaked
                        my... Hey! Can you just...?

           Tiger hobbles after Hailee, limping up his front steps.

           EXT. TIGER'S HOUSE - PORTICO - CONT.

           He finds her reading a NOTE taped to the door.
                                 HAILEE
                        Elin took your kids to Stockholm.

                                 TIGER
                        What?

           Hailee rips the note down and hands it to Tiger. He reads
           it, his face going slack. Hailee laughs.

                                 HAILEE
                        Know what? This is even better. You
                        deserve it.

                                 TIGER
                        I said I was sorry.

                                 HAILEE
                        You aren't sorry. You're just sorry
                        you got caught. Everyone thought you
                        were special. Now they know you're
                        just a dirty old man.

                                 TIGER
                        Please.

                                 HAILEE
                        I hope you die alone.

           With that parting shot, Hailee stomps off. Tiger sinks to
           the steps, holding his back. He looks ruined and exhausted,
           a shell of the man we met in the beginning.

           We HEAR Elin read the note.

                                 ELIN (V.O.)
                        Dear Tiger. I wish things had turned
                        out differently between us. But we
                        can't turn back the clock. What's
                        done is done. Our marriage is over.

           EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           A dreary winter's day in central Stockholm, the city cold
           and cheerless.

                                 ELIN (V.O.)
                        I'm taking the children to my
                        sister's place in Stockholm. I intend
                        to seek sole custody and move there
                        once we've settled our affairs.
           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Elin pushes a double stroller up a steep, snowy hill, Sam
           and Charlie's little faces stinging in the frigid wind.

                                 ELIN (V.O.)
                        I know it's hard to swallow, but it's
                        for the best. Before Thanksgiving, we
                        were little more than burdens to you
                        on your path to greatness.

           She maneuvers the stroller into a drab apartment building.

                                 ELIN (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Now you can get back to it
                        unencumbered. Sam and Charlie will be
                        rooting for you. Elin. 

           INT. JOSEFIN'S APARTMENT - HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Josefin looks over Tiger's list at her desk. Elin stares out
           a picture window at the gloomy city.

                                 ELIN
                        You'd think technology would've
                        solved the whole cold weather thing
                        by now.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        It's called global warming. Give it
                        time.

                                 ELIN
                        That isn't what I meant.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Or even better, fire up your yacht
                        and pump out CO2 until you're nice
                        and toasty.

           Josefin smirks at Elin. Elin catches on.

                                 ELIN
                        So I take it...

                                 JOSEFIN
                        It's a smoking gun! You did it! This
                        is incredible!

           Josefin flings her arms around Elin. Elin remains stiff.

                                 ELIN
                        Woo-hoo.
                                 JOSEFIN
                        I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
                               (
                                                )
                                adjusts her tone
                        This is unconscionable.

                                 ELIN
                        Much better.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        And I can't even imagine what you've
                        been through. Jesus, nobody on earth
                        can.

                                 ELIN
                        All right, let's not overdo it.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Overdo it? This will go down as the
                        biggest cheating scandal in the
                        history of marriage.

                               (
                                         )
                                 ELIN
                                a warning
                        Truly, do not overdo it.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Sorry, sorry. What I meant to say is:
                        Elin, you're a warrior. You've been
                        through hell and back. And I missed
                        you.

                                 ELIN
                        Missed you, too. I'm sorry for being
                        such a bitch.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Right back at you, sis. Water under
                        the bridge. Come here.

           The sisters hug it out for real this time. Elin's phone
           PINGS. She checks it. One new text from Tiger.

                                 ELIN
                        Speak of the devil.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Let me guess...
                               (
                                impersonating Tiger
                                                   )
                        "Super sorry, babe. Can I get, like,
                        a hundred twenty mulligans?

           Elin stares at her phone in surprise.
                                 ELIN
                        Actually, no. He's going to rehab.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        To what?

           INT. GENTLE PATH REHAB CENTER - MEETING HALL - DAY

           Tiger sits in a group therapy circle with male SEX ADDICTS
           and a COUNSELOR (50s). His hair is noticeably thinner than
           the last time we saw him, save for an unfortunate goatee.

                                 TIGER
                        Hey, I'm Tiger. Sex addict and drug
                        addict.

                                 TIGER
                        Almost all of you have heard me share
                        my story, but for the newbie...

           A NEWBIE (30s) smiles sheepishly.

                                 NEWBIE
                        Big fan.

                                 TIGER
                        So much for Sex Addicts Anonymous.

           Everyone laughs. The newbie blushes. Tiger brushes it off.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        I'm kidding, man. I wouldn't be
                        anonymous if I went to a meeting on
                        the moon. Not that I'm complaining.
                        It's the path I chose.

                                then
                        I mean that literally. When I was a
                        kid, my father sat me down and told
                        me I could either be a golfer or a
                        soldier. That was it. And lately,
                        I've been wondering if I chose wrong.
                        Like, maybe I'd be just as happy if
                        I'd joined the Navy SEALs. Happier
                        even. Being just another cog in the
                        machine. Jacked and tatted.

                        Taking out high value targets in the
                        night, then coming home to my family
                        in the morning. I think I'd have made
                        a pretty decent seal.
                                pauses

                        ditch out in some desert. Who knows.
                        Either one would probably be better
                        than this.

           That's all he's got. The counselor scans the group.

           EXT. GENTLE PATH REHAB CENTER - ZEN GARDEN - DAY

           Tiger sits in lotus pose, a MEDITATION GURU (60s) leading
           him and the other sex addicts in a guided imagery session.

                                 MEDITATION GURU
                        ...and inhale, breathing presence
                        into every cell. Experience the
                        moment fully. Nothing can disturb
                        you.

           An ORDERLY (30s) taps Tiger on the shoulder.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Mr. Woods, you have a visitor.

           Tiger cracks an eye. Steinberg is pacing around with his
           phone in the air, trying to get a signal. Tiger just sighs.

           INT. GENTLE PATH REHAB CENTER - TIGER'S ROOM - DAY

           Tiger shows Steinberg his sad, little dorm room. The only
           decor of note is a photo of the kids on the yacht.

                                 TIGER
                        And this is where the magic doesn't
                        happen.
                                 STEINBERG
                        Lord have mercy. This is really where
                        they put you?

                                 TIGER
                        Costs me twice as much per evening as
                        a penthouse at the Bellagio.

           Tiger plunks himself down on a creaky twin bed, Steinberg
           eyeing him with concern.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        So, you here to bust my balls about
                        the list?

                                 STEINBERG
                        I'd rather never talk about your
                        balls again, if that's all right.

                        Yeah.

                                 STEINBERG
                        This is awkward, but I have to ask.
                        Did you stop using your hair stuff?

           Tiger shrugs.

                                 TIGER
                        What's the point? You can't fight
                        father time.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Shit, man, what's the point of
                        anything, then?

                                 TIGER
                        I dunno. Good question.

           Tiger gazes at his navel. Steinberg is disgusted with him.

                                 STEINBERG
                        What about golf?

                                 TIGER
                        What about it?

                                 STEINBERG
                        What's the story? It's been months.
                                 TIGER
                        I know, I'm leaving so much money on
                        the table.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Dude, forget the money.

                                 TIGER
                        Come again?

                                 STEINBERG
                        It isn't why you play. It never has
                        been. The money's my department... or
                        it was, at least.

           Steinberg sits down beside Tiger with a long face.

                                 TIGER
                        What happened?

                                 STEINBERG
                        They fired me. I'm out at IMG after
                        my deal is up. That's what I came to
                        tell you. If you stay there, it'll be
                        with a new agent.

                                 TIGER
                        Shit. I'm sorry, man. Are you OK?

                                 STEINBERG
                        I'll land on my feet. A job's a job.
                        But golf? It's something more to you.
                        It's a religion. It's a purpose. Why
                        God put you on this earth.

           Maybe not the only reason. Tiger glances at the photo of his
           kids. Steinberg notices.

                                 STEINBERG (cont'd)
                        And it's all that you've got left.
                        When you're ready to get back to
                        number one, give me a call. I'll be
                        cheering from the gallery -- not as
                        your agent, but your biggest fan. And
                        your best friend.

           Steinberg puts his arm around Tiger.

                                 TIGER
                        We're not best friends.

                                 STEINBERG
                        Just let me have this.
           Tiger chuckles, contemplating Steinberg's wisdom.

           EXT. GENTLE PATH REHAB CENTER - PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Tiger watches Steinberg drive off into the sunset.

           INT. GENTLE PATH REHAB CENTER - REC ROOM - NIGHT

           Sex addicts play foosball and Connect Four. Tiger and some
           guys sit around a TV, watching SportsCenter. They show a
           highlight of his old pal, Derek Jeter, mashing a home run.

           Tiger stares, unblinking. He feels the itch.

           INT. TIGER'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Tiger tosses and turns in bed, unable to sleep. He kneads
           his lower back. Flexes his reconstructed knee.

           He could really use some Ambien right now. But in lieu of
           it, he settles for a breathing exercise.

           Tiger finally gets comfortable. He closes his eyes. Waits
           for sleep to come.

           It doesn't. Tiger opens his eyes.

                                 TIGER
                        Fuck it.

           EXT. AUGUSTA NATIONAL - MAGNOLIA LANE - DAY

           Thousands of FANS descend upon Augusta National Golf Club,
           making their way down the magnolia-arched entrance.

                                 MEDIA CHAIRMAN (V.O.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.
                        It's my pleasure to welcome everyone
                        to Augusta National Golf Club and the
                        2010 Masters Tournament.

           INT. AUGUSTA NATIONAL - PRESS ROOM - DAY

           The MEDIA CHAIRMAN (50s) sits in front of a standing-room-
           only crowd of SPORTS REPORTERS.

                                 MEDIA CHAIRMAN
                        I'd also like to welcome back four
                        time Masters champion, Tiger Woods.

           Cameras FLASH as Tiger walks out and takes a seat. He seems
           cautiously optimistic. The chairman calls on a REPORTER.
                                 REPORTER
                        Tiger, with everything that's happened
                        since Thanksgiving, what'll be going
                        through your mind on that first tee?

                                 TIGER
                        What'll be going through my mind?

           Tiger pauses, remembering something.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        Sorry. Before I forget, I need to say
                        something. I missed my son's first
                        birthday when I was in treatment.

           INT. JOSEFIN'S APARTMENT - TV ROOM - SAME

           Elin fills out transfer applications to several Swedish
           universities. Sam and Charlie watch Tiger on TV.

                                 TIGER (ON TV)
                        If you're watching, happy birthday,
                        big guy. Daddy misses you.

                                 SAM
                        He's talking about Charlie!

           Elin looks up in surprise. Before she can speak, Josefin
           hollers from the foyer. She's standing with a DELIVERY MAN.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Uh, Elin? Did you order ninety-six
                        cupcakes?

           Elin is mystified. Then realizes. She scowls at the TV in
           grudging appreciation. Tiger turns back to the reporter.

                                 TIGER
                        Sorry, what was the question?

           INT. AUGUSTA NATIONAL - PRESS ROOM - SAME

           The reporter decides to reframe it.

                                 REPORTER
                        After everything that's happened, is
                        your head still in the game?

                                 TIGER
                        Yeah. I mean, I'm here to win. Same
                        as always. You just block out all the
                        noise and get it done. Easy as that.
           The prelapped voice of the COURSE ANNOUNCER summons us to...

                                 COURSE ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Fore, please. Now driving, Tiger
                        Woods.

           EXT. AUGUSTA NATIONAL - TEE BOX - DAY

           ...the first tee. Tiger walks up to CHEERS and APPLAUSE.
           Phil Knight, Steinberg, and Kultida are on pins and needles.

           Steve Williams pulls out a driver and hands it to Tiger.

           Tiger tees up. He addresses the ball. A hush falls, the
           whole world watching with bated breath.

           Then a NOISE cuts through the silence. The DRONE of a small
           plane. Everyone peers up at the sky.

           It's a heckler flying a banner: "SEX ADDICT? YEAH RIGHT."

           Tiger steps off the tee. The gallery buzzes. Steinberg and
           Kultida trade a worried look. Steve Williams steps in.

                                 STEVE WILLIAMS
                        Quiet, please!

           Order is restored. Tiger retakes his stance. But something
           is off. A drop of sweat rolls down his temple. Tiger wipes
           it. He swallows stiffly, feeling all the eyes on him...

           ...including Earl's. Tiger thinks he sees him in the crowd.
           He blinks...

           ...and Earl is gone. It's just a sea of strange faces. All
           staring expectantly at Tiger. People love a comeback story.

           Unfortunately, this isn't one.

           PING! Tiger finally drives the ball. The gallery ROARS...

           ...and then GROANS as the shot veers into the neighboring
           fairway, nearly striking several sunburned GOLF DADS.

           Off Tiger grimacing, we...

                                                            CUT TO:

           A LOWLIGHT MONTAGE

           ...charting his fall from golfing grace in 2010 (real
           footage where possible). It's the tonal opposite of the
           opening montage. We see:
               --UGLY SHOTS and UGLIER REACTIONS: shanks, duck hooks,
               slices, over-cooks, misreads, temper tantrums, curses,
               Tiger tweaking his neck at The Players Championship...

               --Steve shaking his head, Steinberg wincing, Kultida
               dying inside, Phil Knight turning away in disgust...

               --TROPHIES being presented to the next class of stars:
               RORY MCILROY, DUSTIN JOHNSON, JASON DAY...

               --TALKING HEADS bemoaning the state of Tiger's game.

               --And finally: Elin and the kids watching TV in dismay.
               It's undeniable; the Chosen One looks mortal.

                                                       END MONTAGE.

           INT. TIGER'S PRIVATE JET - CABIN - NIGHT

           Tiger gazes out the window, his neck and back on ice, a
           strange detached look on his face. Steinberg, Steve,
           Kutlida, and Miles Markham gather around him in concern.

                                 STEINBERG
                        You'll get back into the swing of
                        things in no time.

                                 STEVE WILLIAMS
                        Yeah. You're just dinged up.

           Tiger shakes his head.

                                 TIGER
                        I've been dinged up for years. This
                        is different.

                                 KULTIDA
                        You just need to get your head right.
                        I'll ask Elin if the kids can visit.
                        They can cheer you up.

                                 TIGER
                        Good luck with that.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        You're still their father. You have
                        rights. We can compel a visitation if
                        we have to.
                                 TIGER
                        How? By dragging them to court and
                        putting Sam up on the stand in what,
                        a booster seat? No thanks. I think
                        I've screwed them up enough.

                                 KULTIDA
                        You can't give up.

                                 TIGER
                        I'm not. She beat me, mom. I lost.
                        I'll take whatever visitation I can
                        get. Give Elin everything she wants.

           Miles Markham and Kultida exchange a pained look.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        Everything everything?

           EXT. NORTH PALM BEACH - OLD PORT COVE - DAY

           Tiger's yacht lies in harbor, dwarfing all the other boats.
           A moving truck rumbles up the dock.

                                 JOSEFIN (PRE-LAP)
                        That's the last of all the artwork
                        from the house...

           INT. YACHT - LOUNGE - DAY

           Josefin holds the door. A STEWARD lugs in the torn painting
           of Tiger staring down a tiger.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        ...or what remained of it.

           Elin looks up from tending to the kids.

                                 ELIN
                        You could've left that one with him,
                        you know.

                                 JOSEFIN
                                smugly
                                      )
                               (
                        I know.

           The steward sets the painting down among some other artwork.
           Josefin brings up an article on her phone. She shows Elin.
                                 JOSEFIN (cont'd)
                        Hey, you want to see something cool?
                        The Wall Street Journal is predicting
                        that the Krona will rise points
                        against the dollar once you sign the
                        papers and the transfer clears.

           Elin laughs in disbelief.

                                 ELIN
                        Holy shit.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        From mom with half a psych degree to
                        currency manipulator... I think this
                        deserves a drink.

           Josefin steps over to a wet bar. Elin demurs.

                                 ELIN
                        I need to finish up my applications.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Applications? Wait a second. You're
                        still going through with that?

                                 ELIN
                        Why wouldn't I?

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Oh, I don't know. A hundred million
                        reasons come to mind. You'll never
                        have to work a minute in your life.

                                 ELIN
                        What would I do all day?

                                 JOSEFIN
                        Exactly what you've always done. Just
                        live the dream. You won.

           Something doesn't sit right with Elin. There's a KNOCK at
           the door. Kultida enters. Sam and Charlie scamper over.

                                 SAM/CHARLIE
                        Grandma!/Yaya!

                                 KULTIDA
                        Babies! Give me a hug.

           Kultida smothers them in hugs and kisses. She turns to Elin.
                                 KULTIDA (cont'd)
                        Can we talk?

           EXT. YACHT - AFT DECK - DUSK

           Sam plays with her Fisher Price golf clubs. Charlie
           spectates. Elin and Kultida observe from deck chairs.

                                 KULTIDA
                        You probably think I'm here to give
                        you an apology. I'm not. You've taken
                        enough from me as is.

                                 ELIN
                        Just what I'm owed.

                                 KULTIDA
                        That might be true. It doesn't change
                        the fact that I'm losing my
                        grandbabies. I'm so mad I could throw
                        you off this boat. I hate your guts.

           Elin gets up.

                                 ELIN
                        Well, this was fun.

                                 KULTIDA
                        But I respect you.

           Elin sits back down, confused. Kultida stares out to sea.

                                 KULTIDA (cont'd)
                        You're doing what I never had the
                        balls to do: divorce my husband and
                        start over on my own.

                                 ELIN
                        It was a different time.

                                 KULTIDA
                        I could've kicked him out. Found a
                        job and made it work. But I was weak.

                                 ELIN
                        If it makes you feel better, everyone
                        thinks I'm a gold-digger.

                                 KULTIDA
                        Know what I think of everyone?
                        Nothing. They don't matter. Only they
                        do.
           Kultida points at Sam and Charlie.

                                 KULTIDA (cont'd)
                        There's a difference between moving
                        on and moving. Children need their
                        fathers.

                                 ELIN
                        I think I turned out all right.

           Kultida gives Elin a look. Elin gives it right back.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Please. Like Tiger turned out so much
                        better?

                                 KULTIDA
                        What he did to you is unforgivable.
                        Don't get me wrong. But he's brought
                        so much joy into so many lives.

                                 ELIN
                        Except the one that counted.

                                 KULTIDA
                        That's not true. You loved him once.
                        You rooted for him just like
                        everybody. Give him one more chance.

                                 ELIN
                        I gave him plenty. Where was my
                        chance?

                                 KULTIDA
                        Please. I'm begging you.

                                 ELIN
                        I'm sorry, but I can't root for a man
                        who doesn't root for me. I need to go
                        sign the papers.

           Elin gets up, gathering Sam and Charlie.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        Come on, guys. Time to say goodbye to
                        Grandma.

           Kultida fights back tears, mustering a smile for the kids.
           INT. TIGER WOODS HEADQUARTERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Tiger's legal team reeks of defeat, their star client
           nowhere to be seen. Across the table, Elin and her team
           review the settlement. Dennis Belcher nods, satisfied.

                                 DENNIS BELCHER
                        Everything looks good on our end. Put
                        your name right next to his, and
                        you're officially divorced.

           Elin stares at Tiger's signature on the page. Victory has
           never been so bittersweet. She signs her name. It's over.

           Belcher and Josefin exchange a look of triumph.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        If no one else has anything to add,
                        let's wrap this up.

           Elin and her team rise. Miles Markham remembers something.

                                 MILES MARKHAM
                        Oh, just a second. Tiger said he owes
                        you this as well.

           He hands Elin a blank check. The memo line reads "TUITION."
           Josefin looks over at her sister.

                                 JOSEFIN
                        What is it? Interest?

           Elin seems touched by the gesture.

                                 ELIN
                        You could say that.

           EXT. DEACON CIRCLE - DAY

           Tiger putters home from practice in a golf court, half his
           body wrapped in ice.

           Jim and Jan Cormier give him death-glares from their yard.

           Tiger leans back, ducking behind his golf bag.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

           Tiger shuffles through the door. He drops his bag. Strips
           down to his underwear. There's no one here to see him. No
           agents or handlers or family. Just a lonely middle-aged man.
           INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

           Tiger plods through his enormous empty mansion. The walls
           are bare. Most of the furniture is gone.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Tiger pours himself four fingers of scotch. He drinks two.

           He opens the freezer. Takes out a frozen pizza. Tears the
           box apart. Nukes the pizza in the microwave.

           INT. TV ROOM - DAY

           Tiger picks at the pizza, half-watching a Discovery Channel
           show about a Navy SEAL training class.

           A laptop sits in front of him on a ring-stained table. The
           Google cursor blinks. And blinks. Taunting him.

           Tiger finishes his scotch for liquid courage. He types his
           name into the search bar.

                                 EARL WOODS (O.S.)
                        Of all the hazards, insecurity's the
                        worst.

           Tiger looks up. Earl is seated in a seventies-era recliner,
           smoking a cigar.

                                 EARL WOODS
                        Just shut the voices up and play.
                        Mental toughness, son. It's ninety
                        percent of the game.

           But Tiger can't. He clicks the search button.

           We don't see the results. His face tells us everything we
           need to know. It's that same detached look from before.

           There's something troubling about it.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TWILIGHT

           Tiger trudges off to bed. He stops outside the kids' old
           room. A pop of color under the nightstand catches his eye.

           INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - CONT.

           Tiger pulls out a book -- Oh, The Places You'll Go --
           somehow forgotten in the move. He sinks to the floor. Opens
           to the bookmarked page. We HEAR him read it.
                                 TIGER (V.O.)
                        "Fame! You'll be famous as famous can
                        be, with the whole wide world
                        watching you win on TV. Except when
                        they don't. Because, sometimes, they
                        won't."

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DUSK

           Tiger lies in bed, once again praying for sleep to come. He
           checks the clock. It's not even 7:30. His reading continues.

                                 TIGER (V.O.)
                        "I'm afraid that sometimes you'll
                        play lonely games too. Games you
                        can't win 'cause you'll play against
                        you."

           Tiger gets up, crossing to a trashcan. He rummages through
           it. Digs out a half-full bottle of Ambien.

                                 TIGER (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        "All Alone! Whether you like it or
                        not, Alone will be something you'll
                        be quite a lot."

           Tiger scrapes out a pill. Then a second. He pauses. Tiger
           empties the entire bottle into the palm of his hand. He
           stares at them. It'd be painless. He'd quietly drift off.

                                 TIGER (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        "And when you're alone, there's a very
                        good chance you'll meet things that
                        scare you right out of your pants.
                        There are some, down the road between
                        hither and yon, that can scare you so
                        much you won't want to go on."

           Tiger steels his famous nerves one final time. He draws a
           deep breath...

           ...and stops. Hearing something. DING-DONG. The doorbell.
           Tiger dumps the pills back in the bottle.

           INT. GRAND STAIRCASE - DUSK

           Tiger walks downstairs.

                                 TIGER (V.O.)
                        "You'll get mixed up, of course, as 
                        you already know. You'll get mixed up
                        with many strange birds as you go. So
                        be sure when you step.
                                 (MORE)
                                 TIGER (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Step with care and great tact. And
                        remember that Life's a Great
                        Balancing Act."

           INT. FOYER - DUSK

           Tiger opens the door. His breath catches. Elin, Sam, and
           Charlie are standing on the porch.

                                 SAM/CHARLIE
                        Daddy!/Da!

                                 TIGER
                        Hey, guys.

           Tiger drops to his knees, overcome. He embraces the kids.
           Looks up at Elin, misty-eyed.

                                 TIGER (cont'd)
                        This is a nice surprise.

           Elin holds up the tuition check.

                                 ELIN
                        Can't say the same for this.

                                 TIGER
                        Oh, that? Remember that one night? I
                        said I'd pick up your tuition. Not
                        that you need any help now. But, hey,
                        a deal's a deal.

                                 ELIN
                        You said my books were on you, too.
                        But this is only for tuition. What's
                        the story?

                                 TIGER
                        Are you serious?

                                 ELIN
                        Hey, a deal's a deal.

           Tiger stands, glowering with resentment.

                                 TIGER
                        You've got a lot of nerve, you know
                        that? I think I've been more than
                        generous. And FYI, the deal was only
                        good if you stayed here. So
                        technically--
                                 ELIN
                        All right. I'll stay here.

                                 TIGER
                        What?

                                 ELIN
                        Well, not here here, but somewhere in
                        the area. Do we still have a deal?

           Tiger is lost.

                                 TIGER
                        What about Sweden?

                                 ELIN
                        I can't do another winter there. I'll
                        finish my degree at Rollins, and then
                        reassess.

           Tiger's heart leaps. He's happy beyond words. Elin checks
           the time, betraying no emotion.

                                 ELIN (cont'd)
                        I'm actually supposed to meet some
                        former classmates for a drink. Would
                        you mind taking Sam and Charlie until
                        ten or so?

                                 TIGER
                        Yes. I mean, no. I wouldn't mind. I'm
                        down to take them.

                                 ELIN
                        I appreciate it. Also, this is kind
                        of premature, but I'll have evening
                        classes several times per week...

                                 TIGER
                        Just let me know. We'll work it out.

                                 ELIN
                        Thank you, Tiger. Well, I have to hit
                        the road. You guys have fun.

           Elin turns to go. Tiger stops her.

                                 TIGER
                        Elin, wait. Has anything changed?

                                 ELIN
                        Let's see. Charlie got his molars. He
                        eats everything in sight now.

                        Oh, and Sam's been playing with her
                        clubs like crazy. She could use a
                        couple swing tips.

           Tiger thinks it over.

                                 TIGER
                        No. I think I'll teach her soccer.
                               (
                                shrugs
                                      )
                        Nice team sport.

                                 ELIN
                        Soccer it is.

           Elin walks off, leaving Sam and Charlie with their dad.

           INT. TIGER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

           Tiger carries the kids into the kitchen, the last rays of
           the sun setting on Isleworth Lake behind the house.

                                 TIGER
                        Now, most coaches probably start with
                        basic kicking drills. But I am not
                        most coaches. No. Success starts in
                        the stomach, not the leg, with good
                        nutrition. Who's hungry?

                                                     FADE TO BLACK.

           REAL FOOTAGE of the characters with postscript:

               INT. WHARTON BUSINESS SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY (2004)

               MARK STEINBERG gives a speech.

                                 MARK STEINBERG
                        Coca-Cola, Kodak, Nike -- those are
                        three of the largest international
                        brands. Tiger Woods is on par with
                        them. You can’t walk down a street in
                        Kuala Lumpur or New Zealand and say
                        "Tiger Woods" and not get a response.

               SUPER: Mark Steinberg was fired by IMG in 2011. Tiger
               left with him. "Steiny" remains his agent to this day.

               INT. ROLLINS COLLEGE - AUDITORIUM - DAY (2014)

               ELIN NORDEGREN delivers a graduation speech.
                                 ELIN NORDEGREN
                        When I moved here, I was twenty-five
                        and married without children. Today,
                        nine years later, I’m a proud
                        American, and I have two beautiful
                        children. But I’m no longer married.

               The audience laughs and applauds.

               SUPER: Elin graduated from Rollins College in 2014. She
               was awarded the Outstanding Graduating Senior Award for
               her nearly perfect GPA and her involvement in local
               charities. She still resides in the Orlando area.

               EXT. AUGUSTA NATIONAL - 1ST GREEN - DAY (2018)

               TIGER WOODS leaves an easy putt short.

               SUPER: Tiger hasn't won a major since his infidelity
               scandal.

               EXT. AUGUSTA NATIONAL - 18TH GREEN - DAY (2018)

               Tiger hugs SAM and CHARLIE WOODS after holing out. He's
               never looked happier.

               SUPER: He shares custody of his children with Elin.

               INT. GOOD MORNING AMERICA SET - DAY (2017)

               Tiger is interviewed on Good Morning America.

                                 TIGER
                        My priorities have changed a lot. My
                        kids now dominate my life and I think
                        that’s a good thing.

                                                           THE END.
