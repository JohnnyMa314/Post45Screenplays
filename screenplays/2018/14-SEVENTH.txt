           In 1876, the government of the recently reunified United 
           States sends word to the Lakota Sioux Nation, demanding the 
           Sioux retreat to the agreed-upon reservation boundaries. 

           The Sioux never respond. 

           The Seventh Cavalry regiment of the United States Army is 
           discharged to the Dakota territories to ensure the Sioux 
           comply with the order. 

           The Seventh is led by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong 
           Custer, a brilliant officer with 215 elite soldiers under his 
           direct command. These men had never lost a battle.

           On the banks of the Little Bighorn River, every single one of 
           these men will die, in a battle that will be remembered as 
           “Custer’s Last Stand.” Their final months on the plains are 
           shrouded in mystery. 

           All we are left with is the evidence -- that one of the most 
           renowned battlefield commanders of his time led his men into 
           one of the worst military defeats in history.

           ...So what happened?
           “There aren't enough Indians in the world to defeat the 
           Seventh Cavalry.”

                             -Colonel George Armstrong Custer
           A chyron informs us that we’re in: 

           THE DAKOTA TERRITORIES, Winter 1876

           OVER BLACK we hear --

           The occasional violin STRING PLUCK and short BLAST of air 
           from a trumpet. Instruments being tuned.

                                 VINATIERI (OVER BLACK)
                        The time to prep was yesterday, 
                        lads. Make ready. Garryowen to play 
                        us in.

           We open on a LOW SWEEPING SHOT over a DESERT, which we 
           quickly leave for a lush FOREST, which leads us to a LAKE -- 

           Exploring the geographical diversity of the land, all the 
           while the sound of an ORCHESTRA preparing for an epic piece --

           As we go faster and faster and start a climb over a HILL --

           The musical fidgeting begins to wind down as we come up and 
           over onto --

           EXT. SOUTHWESTERN DAKOTA TERRITORIES - DAWN

           A FULL REGIMENT OF THE U.S. ARMY. 

           An ARMED SIOUX FORCE staring them down. 

           We cut in close to --

           FELIX VINATIERI (50s, weathered, but with the twinkle of a 
           full life in his eye), standing at the head of a contingent 
           of TWENTY MUSICIANS.

           Vinatieri marches down the line, coming to stop in front of 
           the youngest, JOHN PATTON (19, slight, as green as they come) 
           looking concerned. He fusses with his TRUMPET.

                                 VINATIERI
                        Private, what are you doing? We’re 
                        going into battle any second. 

                                 PATTON
                        Sorry sir, my valve is stuck.

                                 VINATIERI
                        You should be oiling twice daily on 
                        the range. When you’re sleeping 
                        outside, the wind and the cold dry 
                        them out quicker. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINATIERI (CONT'D)
                        A little more thought to your 
                        instrument wouldn’t hurt, Patton. 

           Patton hangs his head, disappointed in himself. Vinatieri 
           softens, leans in --

                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        Slip to the back and just make sure 
                        the Colonel doesn’t see you. 

           Vinatieri steps out to the conductor’s spot in the middle of 
           the semicircle. 

           Patton’s gaze moves past Vinatieri to --

           Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER. His bushy auburn 
           mustache seems to glint with stolen light. Arms crossed, 
           famously long hair flapping against his neck. He looks regal.

           Custer stands behind a line of CAVALRYMEN, all of whom load 
           their rifles or pull their sabres out of scabbards. 

           He begins to trot his horse back and forth across the line. 
           He lifts his sword --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Uncle Sam gave us cause! The Good 
                        Lord fortified us, gave us purpose! 
                        Fate allowed us to send the Rebs 
                        back to Dixie in defeat! It is time 
                        to claim the land that is 
                        rightfully ours...

           We move to Patton, mouthing the words of the speech as Custer 
           says them. He’s heard this countless times.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        ...So that America may stretch on 
                        from sea to shining sea!

           The MEN OF THE SEVENTH cheer. Patton turns to the DRUMMER 
           standing next to him. 

                                 PATTON
                        I’m gonna miss this. 

                                 DRUMMER
                        I won’t. I can’t wait to go home. 
                        Don’t you have anyone waiting for 
                        you? 

           Patton reddens, but before he can answer --
                                 HARROW (O.S.)
                        Colonel, they’re charging --

           We move from Patton to Custer’s second-in-command --

           Sergeant Major WILLIAM HENRY HARROW is in his mid-30s, 
           buttoned-up, the quintessential company man. Scars all over 
           prove his service.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Sergeant Major Harrow! Take them 
                        into battle!

           Harrow nods to Vinatieri -- 

           Vinatieri raises his baton --

           Patton moves to the back --

                                 HARROW
                             (yelling to the men)
                        When I call for it, we break. We 
                        dodge their first volley, we’ll be 
                        okay. As always, watch the back of 
                        the man next to you. 

           Then, Harrow raises his saber and spurs his horse forward --

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        Garryowen!

                                 THE SEVENTH
                        GARRYOWEN!

           The band starts to play -- and with that, they CHARGE down 
           the hill to meet the onrushing Sioux.

           [Note: This fight will be bloodcurdling and violent, but 
           strangely we will experience the battle over an upbeat army 
           march, just as the men would have. Yes, in the 1800s, bands 
           would play as soldiers fought.]

           The young trumpeter, Patton, watches as the row of men move 
           to clash with the Sioux. Wishes he could join the fight.

           Colonel Custer doesn’t charge. He’s still. Straight-backed. 
           Observing.

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Harrow leads the regiment as they gallop down the hill. He 
           bounces in the saddle as he sees the SIOUX let loose a 
           barrage of arrows --  
                                 HARROW
                        BREAK!

           At Harrow’s command, the regiment splits into TWO GROUPS like 
           some gigantic beast opening its jaws. The ARROWS fall in-
           between the two groups. 

           Harrow leads the group on the left, as the regiment now 
           approaches the Sioux force in a pincer formation. 

           The cavalry thunders closer, closer, until both groups CRASH 
           into the Sioux force simultaneously with the raucous clatter 
           of sabers on tomahawks.

           They crest through the Sioux lines. Harrow swings his sword, 
           SLASHING the arm of a SIOUX BRAVE clean off --

           As he rides through, there’s a great NEIGH from his horse as 
           an ARROW buries in its neck. The horse bucks, and Harrow is 
           THROWN from the saddle -- 

           He lies on the ground, wind knocked out of him for a moment --

           A Young Sioux rushes at Harrow, ready to finish the job --

           But the blow never comes. 

           A BLADE blossoms from the Young Sioux’s chest. With a SQUELCH 
           it disappears, leaving only a hole. The Young Sioux looks 
           down, then falls dead. 

           In his place stands CAPTAIN THOMAS CUSTER (30s, gigantic, a 
           true warrior, with the fire of a rabid wolverine), blood 
           dripping from his saber. 

           Tom is Colonel Custer’s younger brother and a war hero in his 
           own right.

           Tom Custer puts a hand out to help Harrow to his feet as they 
           hear shouts from nearby --

           Harrow turns to see one of his MEN being ripped off a horse 
           by a female Sioux commander. This is MOVING ROBE (30s, strong 
           and athletic, war paint almost as ferocious as she is).

           She pulls the man to the ground, and quickly collapses his 
           throat with the THUNK of a GUNSTOCK WAR CLUB on flesh --

           Then she sees Tom Custer and Harrow.

           She starts towards them as a SIOUX WARRIOR nearby yells, 
           urging her on --
                                 SIOUX WARRIOR
                             (pointing at Tom Custer)
                        That’s his brother!

           [Note: Bolded italics will be translated from Lakota. These 
           lines will have subtitles.]

           Moving Robe roars, and SPRINTS straight at Tom Custer. Harrow 
           rushes around, looking for a weapon. 

           Tom Custer sets forward to meet her, and they clash. She 
           swings her club and he his saber, which buries in her club --

           They each try to yank their weapons back, and instead the 
           connected pieces BOTH go flying. 

           Moving Robe whips out two KNIVES as Tom Custer dashes after 
           his saber. She throws one at him, it BURIES into his leg, he 
           stumbles -- 

           Harrow finds a pistol, YELLS as he’s about to fire --

           But when Harrow pulls the trigger, the pistol fires NOTHING, 
           it’s out of ammo --

           Moving Robe turns, sees her window, charges at Harrow --

           Harrow tries to scramble away, but trips and FALLS BACK --

           Moving Robe is upon Harrow, about to stab him, when --

           HSSSS. A glint. Tom Custer slashes Moving Robe from shoulder 
           to hip. Her breathing becomes labored and she falls to her 
           knees. 

           Tom Custer and Harrow look up to see a contingent of SIOUX 
           WARRIORS rushing to avenge their fallen commander. No time to 
           escape, but then --

                                 MEN OF THE SEVENTH
                        GARRYOWEN!

           More than A DOZEN MEN on horseback gallop past Tom Custer and 
           Harrow, leaving them unscathed and scattering the Sioux. 

           Harrow goes to pick up his pistol from where it fell. He 
           stoops over as the Sioux retreat. The sounds of battle seem 
           to fade away into the distance. 

           He glances back up the hill, where Colonel Custer stands, 
           striking against the morning light. 

           The CHEERS begin. This was a rout. 
           INT. COLONEL CUSTER’S TENT - LATER

           Colonel Custer’s tent is crowded. HARROW, TOM CUSTER, and a 
           VARIETY OF OTHER OFFICERS stand in a loose circle. In the 
           center of that circle are THREE people --

           - A SIOUX BRAVE captured during the fight, tied up against 
           the central tent pole. He’s injured. Bleeding from his leg. 
           Woozy. 

           - COLONEL CUSTER. Standing above the Sioux. Menacing. 

           - ISAIAH DORMAN. An older black man who works for the 
           regiment as a Sioux interpreter. He stands next to Custer.

           The Sioux Brave mutters to himself in Lakota, proud and 
           defiant. He spits. 

                                 SIOUX BRAVE
                        Invaders. 

           Dorman crouches to the Sioux Brave’s level. 

                                 DORMAN
                        We are not invaders. The Sioux were 
                        gifted a plot of land by the 
                        government of the United States. 
                        Your leaders signed a treaty 
                        agreeing to sole ownership of the 
                        Black Hills. 

                                 SIOUX BRAVE
                        Not all of our leaders. Not Sitting 
                        Bull. 

           Dorman continues --

                                 DORMAN
                        In return, the Sioux were supposed 
                        to relocate to the reservation 
                        boundaries, but most never arrived. 
                        Your reservation lands are empty. 
                             (beat, then)
                        That was supposed to be your new 
                        home. 

           The Sioux Brave is losing so much blood he’s having trouble 
           focusing on Dorman. But he struggles through the pain -- 

                                 SIOUX BRAVE
                        Where we make our home is not a 
                        matter of compromise. The Black 
                        Hills do not belong to any man. 
                        They are not yours to give.
           Dorman turns to Custer.

                                 DORMAN
                        He says they don’t recognize the 
                        authority of the treaty. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Find out where his people are. 

           Dorman turns back to the Sioux Brave --

                                 DORMAN
                        Where are your people?

                                 SIOUX BRAVE
                             (ignoring him)
                        Sitting Bull had a vision. 

           There’s something disturbing about the way the Sioux Brave 
           just spoke. The whole tent goes silent.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        What did he say?

           Dorman is about to translate, but he’s cut off--

                                 SIOUX BRAVE
                        He saw the sun rise over our camp. 
                        Bright and peaceful. Like before.

           The Sioux Brave continues speaking, but his voice fades into 
           the background as Dorman translates for the assembly -- 

                                 DORMAN
                        “Sitting Bull had a vision. The sun 
                        rising over our camp. Bright and 
                        peaceful. Like before. But then the 
                        sun disappeared. It was drowned in 
                        darkness, as soldiers fell from the 
                        sky... thick as grasshoppers...” 

           The men in the room glance at one another. Harrow looks 
           skeptical.

                                 DORMAN (CONT’D)
                        “As the soldiers fell, we raised 
                        our spears to meet them...“

           The Sioux Brave coughs. A violent cough. Then continues -- 

                                 DORMAN (CONT’D)
                        “One after the other they kept 
                        falling. Impaling themselves on our 
                        weapons. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Finally, after it had been raining 
                        soldiers so long that we forgot 
                        what the sky looked like... it 
                        stopped. 
                             (beat)
                        And there was sun again.” 

           Dorman finishes his translation a few moments after the Sioux 
           Brave. 

           The Sioux Brave looks straight at Custer, who looks back, 
           eyes burning. 

           Harrow steps out from the crowd --

                                 HARROW
                        ...These sound like nothing more 
                        than the mad words of a dying man, 
                        Colonel. We may want --

           But Custer raises a hand to silence Harrow. 

           There’s a darkness in the room now. Nobody’s breathing. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Where is Sitting Bull?

           Dorman quickly translates. The Sioux doesn’t answer. Just 
           stares at Custer. 

           Custer takes a knife out of his boot and kneels before the 
           Sioux Brave.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                             (quiet, deadly)
                        Where. Is. Sitting Bull. 

           Dorman translates again. Still no answer. The Sioux Brave 
           smiles. Custer looks at his knife for a beat, then --

           PLUNGES it into the warrior’s wound and TWISTS. We hear it 
           SCRAPE BONE. The Sioux Brave CRIES OUT. 

           Custer leans forward, grabs the Sioux’s head in his hands and 
           WRENCHES it up violently so that they’re eye to eye. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        WHERE IS HE?

           Harrow steps forward --

                                 HARROW
                        Sir --
           But it’s too late. Custer rips the knife out of the leg and 
           stabs the Sioux Brave through the throat. 

           The Sioux Brave slumps over, dead. Harrow jerks involuntarily 
           from the sudden execution. The other officers turn away.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Harrow, go outside and do a 
                        headcount. Find out how many we 
                        lost. 

                                 HARROW
                        ...Do I ready them for the return 
                        march?

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                             (ignores the question)
                        Dismissed. 

           Custer walks away. All of the officers move to leave the 
           tent. And off Harrow, disconcerted, we cut to --

           EXT. BATTLEFIELD - LATER

           The aftermath. BODIES of Sioux warriors litter the field. 

           A young private, JAMES EZEKIEL PORTER (20s, well built, high-
           strung), lies on the ground groaning. 

           He’s approached at a jog by DR. GEORGE EDWIN LORD (40s, 
           respected by everyone). 

                                 PORTER
                        My leg...

                                 LORD
                        Let go.

           Lord slowly pulls Porter’s arms away from his leg. He 
           inspects Porter’s calf.

                                 PORTER
                        What’s wrong with it?

                                 LORD
                        Best I can tell, just a cramp. 

                                 PORTER
                        It feels like it’s going to fall 
                        off --

                                 LORD
                        It isn’t. Promise. 
                                 PORTER
                        Doc, I swear --

                                 LORD
                        Alright. Hold still...

           Lord holds Porter’s leg and takes a BONE SAW out of his bag. 
           He makes a motion like he’s going to CUT PORTER’S LEG OFF --

                                 PORTER
                        What the hell!

           Porter jumps to his feet and scrambles backwards.

           Lord gestures to Porter, standing on his “injured” leg. 

                                 LORD
                        See?

           They hear retching from further upfield. Lord looks at 
           Porter.

                                 LORD (CONT’D)
                        Go on then, Private. 

           Porter scowls. Embarrassed, he heads in the direction of the 
           other men. 

           Lord hurries towards the retching, and comes upon --

           Moving Robe, the Sioux warrior from the fight. Still somehow 
           holding on to life after Tom Custer nearly killed her.

           Lord stands there for a beat, looking down at her. A moment 
           of hesitation but --

           He sets his bag of supplies down. Crosses himself. 

           Moving Robe tries feebly to fight him off. But she’s too 
           weak.

                                 DR. LORD
                        Hold still. 

           And off the sight of the cavalry doctor administering aid to 
           his enemy, we cut to --

           EXT. ELSEWHERE, BATTLEFIELD - LATER

           Harrow approaches a young PRIVATE, whose HORSE is drinking 
           from a puddle on the ground. This is CHARLES SCHMIDT (20s, 
           German, impish).
                                 HARROW
                             (annoyed)
                        Glad to see you’re alive, Schmidt. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Far as I can tell...

                                 HARROW
                             (pointed)
                        You missed headcount. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        All due respect sir, Bessie here’s 
                        been whining to me for a drink 
                        since this morning. Eventually got 
                        to a point I couldn’t refuse her. 
                        You’re a married man, you get it. 

           Despite himself, Harrow laughs. Then --

                                 SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
                        Did we actually lose anyone?

                                 HARROW
                             (gets serious)
                        Lacy and Williams.

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Damn. And on the last day of the 
                        campaign... 

           Harrow nods. 

                                 TOM CUSTER (O.S.)
                        Harrow!

           Harrow looks up, sees Tom Custer striding for him. 

                                 HARROW
                        Captain. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        George said that we’re to start 
                        making camp now. 

                                 HARROW
                        But we’ve got six good hours of 
                        sunlight left. Weren’t we going to 
                        start marching home today? 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        No. 
                                 HARROW
                        No? 

           Schmidt frowns. Harrow looks surprised. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                             (low voice)
                        Is this about that “vision?” The 
                        Sioux was just trying to wind the 
                        Colonel up --

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        It doesn’t matter why we’re making 
                        camp. We’re making camp. 

                                 HARROW
                             (still pressing)
                        I should have been consulted. I’d 
                        have told the Colonel that --

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        My brother doesn’t need your 
                        opinion on every decision he makes. 
                             (beat)
                        You have your orders. 

           Tom Custer leaves. Up the hill, Colonel Custer can be seen 
           watching Tom head back his way. 

                                 HARROW
                             (to Schmidt)
                        Tell the men we’ll be making camp.  

           Harrow turns to go --

                                 SCHMIDT
                        When are we heading home?

           Off Harrow, not sure --

           EXT. 7TH CAVALRY CAMP, BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT

           It’s nighttime. Tents with “PROPERTY OF U.S. ARMY” stamped on 
           their sides are established where the battle took place 
           earlier that day. 

           Dozens of the men mix and mingle around a few, large 
           bonfires. Officers and privates alike hang out in the loosely 
           celebratory atmosphere. 

           We come onto a game of poker being played between Porter 
           (”injured” leg), Patton (trumpeter), Schmidt (thirsty horse), 
           Dorman (translator), and A MAN we don’t recognize. 
                                 SCHMIDT
                        I’ll raise. 

           He throws in a handful of DRIED BEANS (used as poker chips).

                                 PATTON
                        Fold. 

                                 PORTER
                        Why do you always do that? Don’t be 
                        a scared little boy. He doesn’t 
                        have anything.
                             (to Dorman)
                        I’ll call.

           DORMAN is the dealer. He discards Patton’s hand, and --

                                 DORMAN
                        Action’s to you. 

           He points to the final player at the table: YOUNGHAWK (20s, a 
           Sioux scout for the regiment, clever but often overlooked).

                                 PORTER
                             (accusatory)
                        What’s he saying to you, Younghawk?

                                 DORMAN
                        I’m just telling him that it’s his 
                        turn to play. Calm yourself.

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        Do you think Schmidt has him beat?

                                 DORMAN
                        I do. 

                                 PORTER
                        Come on. No funny business. 

                                 DORMAN
                             (holds up his hands)
                        We aren’t doing anything. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        I fold. 

                                 DORMAN
                        Wise choice. 

           Dorman takes Younghawk’s cards and looks around the table. 

                                 DORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Show ‘em boys. 
           Porter slaps down his five cards.

                                 PORTER
                             (Triumphant)
                        Three of a kind. 

           Schmidt looks sad as he rests his cards on the table. But as 
           he turns them over, his faux-sadness gives way to a grin. 
           Dorman reads --

                                 DORMAN
                        A straight. 
                             (pushes beans at Schmidt)
                        Hand to the German -- 

           Schmidt does a little dance. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Thank you for your contribution to 
                        my engagement ring fund. 

                                 PATTON
                        Guess I was right to fold...

                                 PORTER
                        Bullshit. 

           He stands aggressively and leaves the table. 

                                 DORMAN
                        This is going on your ledger. 

           Porter gives them the finger as he heads off.

                                 DORMAN (CONT’D)
                             (calling after Porter)
                        Pay by the end of the week or we’ll 
                        hold you out. Campaign’s ending. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Maybe.

                                 PATTON
                        What do you mean? Of course it is.

                                 SCHMIDT
                        We were supposed to be headed home 
                        today. We’re still sitting here. 
                        You do the math. 

           Schmidt raises his eyebrows at Patton. 

                                 DORMAN
                        Next hand. Ante up.
           And as Dorman finishes shuffling, we cut to --

           EXT. COMMAND TENT - A LITTLE LATER

           We follow Harrow as he walks away from the main camp and up 
           the hill to Colonel Custer’s tent. 

           BOSTON CUSTER (30s, Colonel Custer’s other younger brother, 
           regiment scout leader, shrewd) smokes a cigar outside. 

                                 HARROW
                             (as greeting)
                        Boston. 

           Harrow goes to pass him and enter the tent --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        He’s busy. 
                             (beat)
                        But maybe I can help you. 

           Boston takes a puff of the cigar. 

                                 HARROW
                        Do you know when we’re heading 
                        home? 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Whenever the Colonel says we are. 

                                 HARROW
                        Tomorrow?

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Maybe, maybe not. I don’t know.

                                 HARROW
                        Why I need to talk to him. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        He’s asleep. 

                                 HARROW
                             (lashing out)
                        Busy. Asleep. Which is it?

           Harrow immediately regrets saying that. 

           Boston sits for a beat. Anger rising. Then --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        I understand that you want to go 
                        home to see the birth of your son. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOSTON CUSTER (CONT'D)
                        Very touching. 
                             (then)
                        But some of us actually feel like 
                        there’s some good to be done on 
                        this land. 

                                 HARROW
                        I wasn’t implying that the Colonel 
                        is wrong to stay --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        You were. Even if you didn’t mean 
                        to... you were. 

           Boston stands. Harrow can’t help himself. One last time --

                                 HARROW
                        So we’re not going home.

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Not until he says so.

           Boston takes another puff.

                                 BOSTON CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight, Harrow. 

           Off Harrow, unsettled --

           EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER

           Harrow walks to the campfire and sits on a felled log nearby, 
           fiddling with an EMBROIDERED KNIFE. 

           A few feet from him, Vinatieri leans against the same log 
           with his eyes closed. Harrow clocks him before shifting his 
           attention to the men playing poker.

           He watches them. The men he’s sworn to lead and protect --

                                 VINATIERI (O.S.)
                        The finest force west of the 
                        Mississippi and they still can’t 
                        tell when they’re being hustled.

           Harrow startles. Looks over at Vinatieri, his eyes open now. 

                                 HARROW
                        I’m sorry, what? 

                                 VINATIERI
                        The men in that poker game. 
                                 HARROW
                        Hustled by who?

                                 VINATIERI
                        Dorman and the scout. Every night. 
                        Every game. Like clockwork. Split 
                        the winnings square even.

           As if on cue, Younghawk wins the next hand. A dejected 
           Schmidt slugs from a bottle of whiskey and passes it to 
           Patton. 

                                 HARROW
                        You watch this happen every night 
                        but you never say anything to them?

                                 VINATIERI
                        Correct.

                                 HARROW
                        Tax on the stupid? 

                                 VINATIERI
                        No, I don’t think so. Services 
                        rendered. 
                             (explaining)
                        Out here, just having the game to 
                        play... that’s worth something. 

           Harrow shrugs.

                                 HARROW
                        I suppose.

           Vinatieri clocks Harrow’s mood.

                                 VINATIERI
                        You alright?

                                 HARROW
                        We’re not going home yet. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        Ah.
                             (beat)
                        And your little one’s due soon.

           Harrow nods. 

                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        Have you thought about a name? 
                                 HARROW
                             (shaking his head)
                        I’m sure Anna has. She -- she’s the 
                        only one who can handle that sort 
                        of thing. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        What does that mean? 

                                 HARROW
                        I don’t know. I’m good at being a 
                        soldier. Being a father... that 
                        terrifies me.

           He stares off. Vinatieri puts a hand on his shoulder. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        It shouldn’t. 

           Harrow looks at him. Vinatieri grins.

                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                             (nodding at the men of The 
                              Seventh)
                        You’re already a father.

           Vinatieri gets up, and walks away. 

           Harrow watches him leave. Then turns back to watch his men. 

           EXT. POKER TABLE, CAMPFIRE - LATER

           Everyone’s gone off to sleep except for Dorman and Younghawk. 
           Dorman counts the beans from the various piles left. 

                                 DORMAN
                        So we add in Patton’s losses... 
                        that means we each take... five 
                        dollars. Not including the money 
                        Porter owes. 

           Younghawk whistles. Dorman grins. He counts out some coins 
           and hands them to Younghawk. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        What are you going to do with your 
                        share? When this is over.

           Dorman pockets the cash. Turns back to the fire. Slowly 
           burning down. 
                                 DORMAN
                        Years ago, I was property. I worked 
                        the same field in Missouri for more 
                        years than I could count. I knew it 
                        better than my master did. I would 
                        bury things in the field sometimes. 
                        Letters to myself, once I learned 
                        to write. It made it feel like the 
                        land was mine. 
                             (pause, then)
                        After a bad harvest he sold me off 
                        to fund a crop change, and from 
                        what I heard the farm fell apart. 

           He brushes the remaining beans off the table and into a small 
           pouch.  

                                 DORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Thirteen years ago, Lincoln brought 
                        us out of bondage. Said that we 
                        were all equal under the law. Said 
                        even black men can own land.
                             (then)
                        In a few weeks, I’m going to go 
                        back to Missouri and buy that 
                        field. Reclaim it. Make it mine. 
                        For real this time. 

           With that, Dorman stands and goes to put more wood on the 
           dwindling fire.

           Off Younghawk, impressed --

           INT. HARROW’S TENT - NIGHT

           Harrow is lying on his cot, restless. He sits up. Rubs his 
           eyes. Lights a candle. 

           He takes out a fountain pen and a piece of paper. He dips it 
           in an inkwell and starts writing --

           Anna, my love... 

           His hand starts to shake. He stops. Collects himself. 

           I’ve been thinking about names... 

           EXT. HARROW’S TENT - NEXT MORNING

           Harrow exits his tent to some commotion outside. He pulls a 
           PRIVATE hurrying by --
                                 HARROW
                        What’s going on? 

                                 HURRIED PRIVATE
                        The new additions are about to 
                        arrive, sir. 

                                 HARROW
                        New additions? 

                                 HURRIED PRIVATE
                        Sir, I’m supposed to --

                                 HARROW
                        Go. 

           The private runs off. 

           Harrow walks to the edge of camp. Holds his hand up to shield 
           his eyes from the sun. There are some FIGURES in the 
           distance. He shakes his head, confused.

           Then turns around to go prepare. 

           EXT. THE PLAINS - DAY

           A SMALL PARTY ON HORSEBACK. In the distance, we can see the 
           7th’s encampment. 

           Leading the party is Captain MICHAEL VINCENT SHERIDAN (30s, 
           open and fair, but a chip on his shoulder). 

           He’s followed by a dozen or so PRIVATES and a minimal wagon-
           full of supplies. 

           One of the horses from the back comes up to Sheridan --

           Riding it is HENRY “AUTIE” REED (17, Colonel Custer’s nephew, 
           arrogant, whiny, and proud of himself for no reason in 
           particular). 

                                 AUTIE
                        Are we there yet?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You have eyes, don’t you? You can 
                        see the encampment.

           Autie gives him a sour look. 

                                 AUTIE
                        Have you met my uncle? 
                                 SHERIDAN
                        I haven’t had the pleasure. 

                                 AUTIE
                        Did you know the Colonel hates 
                        General Sheridan?

           Sheridan glances back at him.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Everyone knows that.

                                 AUTIE
                        Yes but, I was just thinking... 
                        since General Sheridan is your 
                        brother, chances are good the 
                        Colonel will feel the same about 
                        you. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t you think?

           Autie gives a self-satisfied look and fades back into the 
           pack. 

           Sheridan rolls his eyes. 

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - DAY

           Harrow (on horseback) waits with a welcome committee. Tom and 
           Boston Custer approach Harrow. 

                                 HARROW
                             (to the Custers)
                        Did you know about this? 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                             (affirmative)
                        General Sheridan said he’d be 
                        sending a small contingent. 

           Harrow’s about to respond when Colonel Custer comes riding to 
           meet the new party. Harrow swallows his rebuttal. 

           The camp waits quietly. And as the party approaches --

           A grin spreads across Harrow’s face. 

                                 HARROW
                        I’ll be damned.

           Sheridan, leading the envoy, charges ahead towards Harrow --
                                 SHERIDAN
                        Will! 

           They dismount and embrace in a big, brotherly hug. 

                                 HARROW
                        Michael Sheridan, as I live and 
                        breathe.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        It was a last minute thing. 
                        Otherwise I would’ve written you.

           They step back to look at each other as the rest of the 
           welcome committee helps the new additions dismount and 
           unload. 

                                 HARROW
                             (seeing his rank)
                        You’re a Captain now. I had no 
                        idea.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Before you say anything -- not 
                        Phillip’s doing. 

                                 HARROW
                        Wasn’t even thinking it. 

           Lord comes over to them. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        Michael, this is George Lord. The 
                        doctor for the Seventh.
                             (then)
                        Lord, meet Michael Vincent 
                        Sheridan. 

                                 LORD
                        Pleasure. Any relation to General 
                        Phillip Sheridan? 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        My brother. 

           Lord raises his eyebrows. A moment. Then --

                                 LORD
                        Fantastic. Glad to have you with 
                        us, Captain. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Glad to be with such a legendary 
                        company. 
                                 LORD
                        Welcome to the Seventh. 

           Lord leaves. 

                                 HARROW
                        You need help setting up your tent? 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Actually... 

           He pulls a LETTER out from his jacket pocket. Emblazoned with 
           the seal of the US ARMY. Unopened.

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Is the Colonel around?

           Harrow nods towards Colonel Custer, surveying the new 
           additions to his camp. Sheridan begins walking over to him. 
           Harrow joins.

                                 HARROW
                        A good trip?

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (curt)
                        Not too hard. 

           Sheridan’s not engaging. Harrow notices. His friend is 
           singularly focused on Colonel Custer, as though trying to 
           read his mind on the approach. 

           When they finally get to the Colonel --

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Sir. 
                             (salutes)
                        Captain Michael Vincent Sheridan. 
                        At your service. 

           Colonel Custer seems to burn with a quiet intensity at the 
           mention of Sheridan’s name. He doesn’t dismount to greet 
           Sheridan. He just nods, slowly. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Phillip’s baby brother. 
                             (then)
                        I’m surprised to see you so far 
                        from West Point.

           Sheridan swallows the insult and proceeds --
                                 SHERIDAN
                        I have a letter, sealed by my 
                        brother in Washington. I was told 
                        to hand deliver it to you. 

           Colonel Custer nods. Leans down from his horse and takes the 
           letter from Sheridan’s outstretched hand. He pulls out a 
           hunting knife and cuts the letter open. Begins to read.

           Sheridan’s party continues unloading supplies while the 
           officers stand silently around the Colonel. 

           Harrow watches Sheridan, whose eyes never leave Colonel 
           Custer. 

           Colonel Custer’s face shows the slightest traces of a frown 
           as he finishes reading. Then --

           He trots his horse to the nearby embers of a FIRE from the 
           night before, and DROPS the letter into it. Sheridan’s jaw 
           clenches. 

           The paper quickly catches. It burns to ash in a matter of 
           seconds.

           Colonel Custer begins to trot back to the camp. Followed 
           closely by Boston Custer, Tom Custer, and a contingent of the 
           other officers.

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                             (calling after them, 
                              pointed)
                        What did it say, sir?

           Colonel Custer stops his horse. The others follow suit. 

           Slowly, Colonel Custer turns around and stares down Sheridan. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        That’s between me and Phillip. 

           Without another word, he turns back to camp and rides off. 

           Harrow glances at Sheridan and notices that his friend’s 
           expression is dark.

                                 HARROW
                        Everything alright?

           A moment. Sheridan regains his composure. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Everything’s fine. What were you 
                        saying about setting up my tent?
           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Harrow leads Sheridan over to the welcome committee. Then 
           beckons to John Patton, standing in the greeting line --

                                 HARROW
                        Patton, come here. 
                             (as Patton approaches)
                        This is Captain Sheridan. 

           Patton snaps to attention and salutes. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        If you could show him a spot to set 
                        up his tent --

                                 PATTON
                        Right away, sir.

                                 HARROW
                             (to Sheridan)
                        I’ll come see you after you’re 
                        settled --

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (a thought)
                        Actually, come help me set up, 
                        Will.

           Harrow looks confused, but nods.

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MINUTES LATER

           Patton leads Sheridan and Harrow to an open spot where 
           there’s a tent waiting to be set up. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Thank you, Patton. If you could 
                        just... 

                                 PATTON
                        Right away, sir. 

           Patton sets about putting the tent up. Sheridan’s nervous.

                                 HARROW
                             (to Sheridan)
                        What’s going on?

           Sheridan makes sure Patton is out of earshot. Then --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        We have a problem. 
           Harrow frowns. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        The letter I gave the Colonel. The 
                        one he burned...
                             (beat)
                        It was an order. Insisting that he 
                        turn the Seventh around and march 
                        back to St. Louis immediately. 

           Patton overhears this. Looks over. Neither Harrow nor 
           Sheridan notice.

                                 HARROW
                        How do you know that?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Because my brother wrote it in 
                        front of me. 

           Harrow’s silent.

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        This is what Phillip was afraid of. 
                        You saw the way Colonel Custer 
                        looked at me when he realized who I 
                        was. He isn’t going to follow 
                        Phillip’s orders...

                                 HARROW
                        The Colonel’s strong-willed, but I 
                        hardly think -- 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Explain why Phillip felt the need 
                        to send me to bring home a regiment 
                        that was supposed to be headed that 
                        way already. 
                             (beat, then)
                        Explain why it isn’t.

           Harrow doesn’t respond, so Sheridan presses.

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        The Colonel was sent here to ensure 
                        the Sioux were adhering to the 
                        terms of the reservation treaties. 
                        He wasn’t sent here to butcher 
                        them. 

                                 HARROW
                        We’re not butchering them. They’re 
                        attacking us when we try and 
                        relocate them.
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARROW (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        Colonel Custer is a commander in an 
                        active theater. You know as well as 
                        I do that the man on the ground 
                        knows more than the man behind the 
                        desk. And “in times of disputed 
                        strategy the man on the ground -- 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        -- Has every right to assert 
                        authority for the good of his men.” 
                        I know, but --

                                 HARROW
                             (resolute)
                        I’m going to pretend this 
                        conversation never happened.

           Harrow puts a firm hand on Sheridan’s shoulder. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                             (drop it.)
                        Good to have you here, Michael.

           And then, without waiting for a response, he leaves. Sheridan 
           watches him go for a moment, before --

                                 PATTON (O.S.)
                        I heard what you said. 

           Sheridan turns to find Patton waiting there. Sheridan looks 
           at him -- is this going to be a problem?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        That was confidential.

                                 PATTON
                        -- But Sitting Bull is leading the 
                        Sioux resistance. If Colonel Custer 
                        thinks we can get him, is it wrong 
                        to try?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        The Colonel is disobeying a direct 
                        order to chase a ghost. 

                                 PATTON
                        But if he finds Sitting Bull... why 
                        is that a problem?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        There was a report that Sitting 
                        Bull is amassing an army. Maybe a 
                        thousand men strong. 
           That lands. Patton is in shock.

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        We haven’t confirmed it -- but if 
                        it’s true, and this unit engages 
                        with a force anywhere close to that 
                        size, everyone here will die. 

                                 PATTON
                        Why didn’t you tell that to 
                        Sergeant Major Harrow?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Because it’s unconfirmed. Harrow 
                        always needs proof. 
                             (beat)
                        But that’s not what this is about. 
                        This is about Custer disobeying 
                        orders. Recklessly pushing his men 
                        past their limits. Everyone’s 
                        worried about this regiment.

           A moment. Patton awkwardly steps back.

                                 PATTON
                        I should finish setting up your 
                        tent, sir.

           And off Sheridan, alone --

           EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

           Harrow sits surrounded by his men (Schmidt, Porter, 
           Younghawk), eating dinner and drinking by the fire.  Having a 
           laugh. 

           We see Sheridan watching from a distance. Studying them. 

           Finally, he approaches with his bowl of food. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        May I join? 

           Harrow nods curtly. Then, opening up --

                                 HARROW
                        Men -- Captain Michael Vincent 
                        Sheridan. You’ve never seen such a 
                        man unleashed at a saloon. The 
                        women who have fallen to him... 
                        innumerable.  
                                 SHERIDAN
                        Seeing me in combat, on the other 
                        hand... travesty. 

           The men around the fire laugh. Sheridan smiles. Sits next to 
           Harrow.

                                 SCHMIDT
                        You think you’re useless in battle, 
                        you’ve clearly never seen Porter 
                        try to hit a target. 

           Oooooohs from the group. Off Sheridan, laughing along. And 
           off Harrow, studying him --

           EXT. CAMPFIRE - LATER

           It’s just Sheridan and Harrow now. The rest have gone to bed. 
           They share a pipe of tobacco. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        So I hear we’re marching tomorrow. 
                             (pointedly)
                        West.

                                 HARROW
                        I thought we were done with this, 
                        Michael. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Sorry. 
                             (then)
                        How’s everything with Anna? 

                                 HARROW
                        She’s well. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        And the pregnancy? 

                                 HARROW
                        Right on schedule. 

           Harrow nods.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        And you’re fine missing the birth 
                        because your commanding officer has 
                        a trophy he covets?

                                 HARROW
                             (rolls his eyes)
                        You mean Sitting Bull? 
                                 SHERIDAN
                        Have you heard that he’s gathering 
                        an army?

                                 HARROW
                        I’ve heard the rumor.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        But if it’s true, and this regiment 
                        ends up in a lopsided battle on the 
                        whim of an egomaniacal -- 

                                 HARROW
                        Jesus, Michael. You’re talking 
                        about the Colonel. Have some 
                        respect --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Here’s a question. Is Colonel 
                        Custer’s respect more important to 
                        you than that of your own son? --

                                 HARROW
                             (snapping)
                        Michael!

           Sheridan puts his hands up. Truce.

           A beat. He takes a drag of the pipe. Then --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I just don’t want this unit in a 
                        fight we can’t win. 

                                 HARROW
                        That fight doesn’t exist. 

           Harrow stands to leave. And off Sheridan, frustrated --

           EXT. MARCH TRAIL, DAKOTA TERRITORIES - NEXT DAY

           Midday. The whole of the Seventh marches across the plains. A 
           procession of wagons, horses and tenting supplies brings up 
           the rear. 

           EXT. SEVENTH CAVALRY ENCAMPMENT - EVENING

           A flurry of activity -- they’re making camp. Sheridan walks 
           through the tents, taking in his new regiment. 
           People don’t really acknowledge him as they pass. We get the 
           sense that he’s lost in his own head until he’s pulled out of 
           it by --

                                 AUTIE (O.S.)
                        Make sure the flaps are secured 
                        extra tight. Yesterday there was a 
                        terrible breeze and I could hardly 
                        sleep.  

           Autie Reed surveys from the side while a sweaty Patton 
           struggles to raise Autie’s tent alone.

                                 PATTON
                        Alright...

                                 AUTIE
                             (harsh)
                        Why is this so hard for you, 
                        private? 

           Sheridan notices that SOLDIERS are seeing this play out. A 
           general sense of indignation and discomfort at the whole 
           thing. He seizes the moment --

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (loudly)
                        Patton. What’s going on here?

           Patton looks nervously to Autie. Autie interjects --

                                 AUTIE
                        I just ordered this private to help 
                        me put up my tent --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Ordered? Patton, get up. 

           Patton stands up. 

                                 PATTON
                        I’m okay to do it, Captain. It’s 
                        fine --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        No it isn’t. 

           People are openly watching now. Sheridan gives them what they 
           want --

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ll set up your own tent, Autie. 

           Autie steps forward, incensed and blustery --
                                 AUTIE
                        I am a Custer --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You’re not even an enlisted man. 
                        You give orders to no one.   

                                 AUTIE
                        Now, see here captain --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Don’t you dare condescend me. 

           The soldiers watching look at each other -- oh shit. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        If you want to glom onto this 
                        regiment, that’s fine. You have the 
                        connections to make that happen, 
                        but make no mistake --

           He puts a threatening hand on Autie’s shoulder and pulls him 
           close. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t get special treatment. If 
                        you’re here, you follow orders, 
                        like anyone else.
                             (beat)
                        No matter what your name is.

           Sheridan releases Autie, a little more forcefully than what 
           would be comfortable. Walks past him --

           Up to the tent --

           And KICKS the main support beam, sending the whole thing 
           COLLAPSING into a heap. A few soldiers whistle. 

           Sheridan passes by Patton and puts a hand on his shoulder. 
           Patton looks at him gratefully. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Dismissed. 

           Patton nods and runs off. Autie goes to the tent and begins 
           picking it up, chastised. 

                                 HARROW (O.S.)
                        Captain Sheridan!

           Harrow stands a few feet away with Boston Custer and 
           Younghawk. He’s frowning. Waves Sheridan over. 
           Sheridan approaches tentatively.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Sir. 

                                 HARROW
                        What was that about?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Discipline. Need to make sure we 
                        aren’t allowing nepotism --

                                 HARROW
                        Captain, these are our scouts. 
                        Younghawk and Boston Custer. 

           Boston Custer extends his hand to shake. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        General Sheridan’s brother, right? 
                             (beat)
                        Thank you for making sure we avoid 
                        any nepotism in this army. 

           Touché. Harrow jumps in -- 

                                 HARROW
                        Younghawk and Boston found a Sioux 
                        encampment outside of the agreed 
                        upon reservation lands. A few miles 
                        west of here. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Sitting Bull? 

                                 HARROW
                        No.
                             (then)
                        Small village. Relatively 
                        unguarded. We don’t need another 
                        blood bath, of course. We’ll march 
                        with them to relocate. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 HARROW
                        Because the Colonel wants you to 
                        take point on the relocation. 

           Sheridan is surprised, but covers --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        ...Very good, sir. 
                                 HARROW
                        Boston and Younghawk will brief you 
                        on the situation. 

           Sheridan nods, gives a salute. Harrow leaves. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        How many men are we dealing with --

           But Boston Custer is already walking off. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Officer?

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        I’ll make sure you know what to do 
                        after I help my nephew set up his 
                        tent. 

           And off Sheridan, unsettled by the quick promotion --

           EXT. MEDICAL WAGON - THAT NIGHT

           It’s late. Lord sits in front of a small fire.

           From out of the darkness, someone approaches. 

                                 LORD
                        Schmidt. It’s been a long time 
                        since I’ve seen you. 

           Schmidt walks into the light. Takes a seat by the fire. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Yeah, God must be in a good mood. 
                        I’ve been lucky in battle. No 
                        arrows chose me as a lover.  

                                 LORD
                        Well, as my father used to say, 
                        luck and savvy tend to go hand-in-
                        hand... unfortunately he was 
                        neither lucky nor savvy. 
                             (beat)
                        What do you need? 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        I can’t sleep. I’m just... anxious. 

                                 LORD
                        Anything in particular? 
                                 SCHMIDT
                        I don’t know. Maybe my body is 
                        rebelling from sleeping in a cot 
                        for months on end.  

                                 LORD
                        You want me to give you something? 

                                 SCHMIDT
                             (nodding)
                        Opium, if you have it. 

           Lord frowns thoughtfully. 

                                 LORD
                        I believe we do. But I don’t like 
                        to prescribe it unless all other 
                        options have been exhausted...

                                 SCHMIDT
                        They have. I’ve counted sheep, 
                        drank herbal tea at night, I’ve... 
                        exerted myself in bed -- 

                                 LORD
                        -- Okay, alright. Let me go get you 
                        some.  

           He stands, and walks towards his wagon. Schmidt gets up and 
           follows him over, when --

                                 LORD (CONT’D)
                        Stop! 

           The outburst startles Schmidt. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        I -- what?

                                 LORD
                             (calming)
                        I’m -- I’m sorry. I just don’t like 
                        people in the wagon. Too many 
                        supplies have “gone missing” after 
                        I bring visitors back. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                             (hands up)
                        Alright. I can wait. 

                                 LORD
                        Thank you. 

           We follow Lord as he enters the --
           INT. MEDICAL WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           And we see the TRUE reason he didn’t want Schmidt inside: 

           In a pool of dried blood, carefully patched up but seemingly 
           comatose, lies MOVING ROBE. The Sioux commander from the 
           opening battle.

           Lord shuffles past her, careful not to wake her up, finds a 
           supply of opium in a marked medical container, and exits. 

           EXT. MEDICAL WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           Schmidt’s warming his hands by the fire when Lord emerges.

                                 LORD
                        Here you go. Take nightly and in 
                        small doses. A little bit should 
                        still be effective.  

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Thanks, Doc. You’re a lifesaver.

           Schmidt pockets the opium and heads away. Lord watches him go 
           and then heads back inside --

           INT. MEDICAL WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

           Lord stares down at the sleeping warrior. Her chest heaving 
           with labored breath. Sweaty, fevered, fighting off infection. 

           He brushes her hair from her face and administers a wet cloth 
           to cool her down. 

           INT. SHERIDAN’S TENT - SAME TIME

           Sheridan’s sitting at his desk, alone. 

           Patton enters. Secures the flap.

           The two of them share a look. A long moment. Finally --

                                 PATTON
                        What can we do? 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        We?

                                 PATTON
                        We.
           Sheridan nods.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        We have to get the rest of the men 
                        on our side. 

                                 PATTON
                        Okay. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        But I’ve been put in charge of the 
                        relocation tomorrow. 

                                 PATTON
                        That’s perfect. It’ll help your 
                        standing in the regiment. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Maybe... but if something goes 
                        wrong, I’ll be to blame. 
                             (then)
                        Colonel Custer knows that. 

           He looks at Patton.

                                 PATTON
                        You think he wants you to fail.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Of course. If I do, he’s got cause 
                        to bury me.

           A beat. Patton shakes his head.

                                 PATTON
                        The Colonel may not like you, but I 
                        don’t believe he would set you up. 
                             (beat)
                        I think this is a good thing.

           Off Sheridan, not so certain --

           EXT. SIOUX ENCAMPMENT - NEXT DAY

           WOMEN wail. CHILDREN cry. 

           We open back up as the Seventh force the Sioux to pack their 
           camp. 

           Sheridan oversees, looking nervous. The atmosphere is tense. 
           Tom Custer is a little ways away. 
                                 TOM CUSTER
                             (yelling)
                        Come on, move it.  

           The camp is packed up and ready to move. The Sioux are lined 
           up next to their possessions -- members of the Seventh 
           surrounding them on all sides. Ready.

           Sheridan surveys the situation. Then gives the order.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Okay. Let’s march.

           At first, nothing. Then the Sioux begin to shuffle forward.

           EXT. HILL - SAME TIME

           The command group is on horses, observing from above. We see 
           Harrow, Boston Custer, and the Colonel. Autie Reed in the 
           place of honor right next to his uncle. 

                                 HARROW
                        Why are there so few men...? 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Who cares. 

           Harrow looks to Colonel Custer. 

           No response. 

           EXT. SIOUX ENCAMPMENT - SAME TIME

           Sheridan is breathing a big sigh of relief as the Sioux 
           finally begin marching.

           Further down, Tom Custer is trying to get a particularly 
           sluggish woman to catch up with the group. 

           A SIOUX MAN approaches, tries to get Tom Custer to stop. 

                                 SIOUX MAN
                        It’s her leg, she --

           Tom Custer knocks him down. The Sioux man gets up and spits 
           at him. 

           Sheridan sees what’s about to happen before it does, but he’s 
           too far away --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Captain, no --
           Tom Custer slashes the man open. The woman next to him cries 
           out. And then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE as the Sioux see their 
           comrade die. They start to fight back --

           EXT. HILL - SAME TIME

           Harrow sees the chaos erupt. Sounds of the fracas reach them.

                                 HARROW
                        Permission to assume command?

           A beat.

           Then Colonel Custer shakes his head. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Let’s give Captain Sheridan a 
                        chance to prove himself. 

           Harrow shifts uncomfortably.

           EXT. SIOUX MARCH - SAME TIME

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        Men! With me!

           A group of privates flock to Tom and dismount. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        No! Stand down!

           But no one can hear him. They move through the Sioux ranks, 
           CUTTING DOWN the men who fight back (without weapons). The 
           WOMEN try to get in the way --

                                 SIOUX WOMAN
                        Please!

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        MOVE!

           Tom grabs her, and THROWS her out of his way. She gets back 
           up, and then he KILLS HER TOO. 

           He continues SLAUGHTERING his way through the Sioux.

           EXT. HILL - SAME TIME

           Harrow sees the situation going to shit. 
                                 HARROW
                        Sir!

           Colonel Custer nods. 

           Harrow takes off down the hill.

           EXT. SIOUX MARCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Back on Tom Custer, caught up in his blood rage. The privates 
           are following his lead. 

           Until Sheridan ARRIVES, wheeling his horse out in front of 
           Tom --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        CAPTAIN CUSTER. STOP.

           Tom stops. Bodies litter the ground around him. The remaining 
           Sioux cower. Tom approaches Sheridan, still seeing red -- 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        Get out of my way --

           Sheridan dismounts, SHOVES Tom back. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (furious)
                        They’re unarmed. 

           Tom Custer raises his blade, enraged, and it looks like he 
           and Sheridan might come to actual blows. 

                                 HARROW (O.S.)
                        Enough! 

           Tom Custer and Sheridan look at Harrow, who rides up to them. 

           Sheridan looks to him for some kind of outward support but 
           Harrow whips on him. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        What happened here?

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (accusatory)
                        He started slaughtering them --

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        They were threatening me. Menacing. 
                        I had to retaliate.
                                 SHERIDAN
                        They were unarmed! I didn’t order --

                                 HARROW
                        CAPTAIN. 

           Authoritative. Disappointed.

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        I will be assuming command of this 
                        march. Captain Sheridan, to the 
                        back. Captain Custer, to the 
                        Colonel...

           He pauses. Looks around at all the men. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                             (declares)
                        Continue the march. 

           Silence. Only whimpering tears can be heard from the 
           decimated Sioux.

           Sheridan stares at Harrow. Studying him. Questioning him. 
           Harrow avoids eye contact. 

           The march continues.

           EXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DAKOTA TERRITORIES - DAYS LATER

           The Sioux are marched north. 

           Harrow is at the front of the contingent. Sheridan is 
           relegated to the rear.

           Sheridan glares at Harrow’s back as they march. Unspoken 
           tension between the two.

           EXT. RESERVATION BOUNDARY - DAYS LATER

           Harrow stands at the edge of the reservation boundary. He 
           watches as the sad contingent of Sioux pass by a sign 
           reading: Great Sioux Reservation.

           The men of the Seventh work to make camp at the boundary.

           Sheridan approaches and stands next to Harrow. Harrow doesn’t 
           acknowledge his presence. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What now?
           Harrow doesn’t respond. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re just going to ignore me? 
                             (beat)
                        You know as well as I do that Tom 
                        is impossible to control --

                                 HARROW
                        You were in command. Take 
                        responsibility. It was your job --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What would you have done?
                             (beat)
                        What would you have done 
                        differently, Will? You tell me that 
                        and I’ll admit I was wrong. 

           A moment. Harrow’s at a loss. Sheridan continues --

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Whose idea was it for me to lead 
                        the march? 
                             (off Harrow’s silence)
                        I was set up. They knew that you 
                        would blame me if something went 
                        wrong. 

                                 HARROW
                             (warning)
                        Michael...

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You have to see that, Will. I need 
                        you on my side. 

                                 HARROW
                        Your side? We’re all on the same 
                        side here. 

           A long pause.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Are we?

           Sheridan leaves.

           Harrow watches the Sioux march onto the reservation, 
           unsettled. As he watches, sounds of a confrontation from 
           behind him --

           Harrow goes to investigate...
           EXT. CAMPSITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Harrow arrives at the scene, where THREE SOLDIERS are 
           PUMMELING James Porter.

           When they see Harrow, the men instantly stop. Spring into 
           salutes, guilty. Porter lies on the ground groaning.

                                 HARROW
                             (quietly furious)
                        Explain. 

                                 BEARDED SOLDIER
                             (stammering)
                        This is the third time he’s stolen 
                        rations of mine. I told him to stop 
                        but he didn’t.  

           Harrow turns to Porter, still on the ground.

                                 HARROW
                        Is this true?

                                 PORTER
                        No...

           Harrow senses Porter’s lying.

                                 PORTER (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t --

                                 HARROW
                        Porter.

           A moment. Then Porter tears up. 

                                 PORTER
                        Our portions have been getting 
                        smaller for weeks. How are we 
                        supposed to fight if we’re not 
                        being fed? 
                             (beat)
                        I thought we’d already be back in 
                        St. Louis by now. I didn’t sign up 
                        for this. None of us did.  

           Harrow softens.

                                 HARROW
                        I know this is hard, but we have to 
                        remember all the good we’re doing 
                        here. 
                                 PORTER
                             (under his breath)
                        Like killing unarmed women?

           He shakes his head. Harrow pretends not to hear.

           Bearded Soldier reaches down, offers his hand to Porter. 
           Porter takes it and Bearded Soldier helps him climb to his 
           feet.

                                 HARROW
                        I had better not hear about any 
                        other squabbles. We’re the Seventh 
                        Cavalry. We’re better than that. 

           Porter glares, while Bearded Soldier looks down in shame --

                                 BEARDED SOLDIER
                        Sorry, sir. I guess being out here 
                        for so long is wearing all of us 
                        thin. 

           Off Harrow, concern growing -- 

           EXT. SEVENTH CAVALRY CAMPSITE - LATER

           Nighttime again at the fire. A new group plays poker with 
           Dorman and Younghawk. Porter scowls at them from afar, 
           clearly being held out of the game. 

           The mood around camp is noticeably more sour. 

           At the fire, we see Vinatieri strumming a GUITAR. 

           Harrow stands across the fire from him, studying. This goes 
           on for a while until Vinatieri gestures to a seat next to 
           him. Harrow obliges. Sits.

                                 VINATIERI
                        Is everything okay? 

                                 HARROW
                        It’s fine.

           Vinatieri strums for a minute. As the fire burns, the numbers 
           of men dwindle. Then --

                                 VINATIERI
                        Is it true that Captain Sheridan 
                        was the one who introduced you and 
                        Anna?
                                 HARROW
                             (nodding)
                        After the war Michael and I spent a 
                        few years in New York City. He was 
                        seeing friends of hers. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        Friends? Plural?

                                 HARROW
                        Yeah, but never Anna. Second he saw 
                        her, he knew she was perfect for 
                        me.

           Vinatieri laughs. Another beat.

                                 VINATIERI
                        Sounds like you two are close.

                                 HARROW
                        We are. 
                             (then)
                        But now we may have some 
                        irreconcilable differences. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        Really?

                                 HARROW
                        ...He doesn’t trust the Colonel. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        And you fault him for that? 

                                 HARROW
                        Colonel Custer is one of the 
                        greatest commanders to have ever 
                        lived. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        Oh, I’ve heard. 

           Harrow frowns at Vinatieri.

                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure we could both list off his 
                        accomplishments. All the battles 
                        he’s won for America. The things 
                        that have earned the respect you 
                        have for him. But do you know what 
                        I respect about you, Sergeant 
                        Major? 
                             (off Harrow, listening)
                                 (MORE)
                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        You look after every last soldier 
                        in this unit. 

           He continues talking as we CUT TO some of the men --

           INT. PATTON’S TENT - SAME TIME

           Patton and Schmidt lie on adjacent spots in the tent. 

                                 VINATIERI (V.O.)
                        From the lowest privates --

           Schmidt is passed out, his latest dose of opium lies next to 
           him. 

           Patton’s awake. Practicing sword swings with Schmidt’s saber.

           We move to --

           INT. MEDICAL WAGON - SAME TIME

           Where Lord is taking care of a still-comatose Moving Robe -- 

                                 VINATIERI (V.O.)
                         -- to the support staff --

           And now we move to --

           EXT. OUTSIDE COLONEL CUSTER’S TENT - SAME TIME 

           Where Sheridan silently SPIES on the Custers from a distance 
           as they sit in a tight knit circle. 

                                 VINATIERI (V.O.)
                         -- To your fellow officers.  

           Suddenly Sheridan lets out a small cough. Tom and Boston look 
           in his direction, but he ducks low, protected by the 
           darkness. As he huddles, we hear --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER (O.S.)
                        What was that?

                                 TOM CUSTER (O.S.)
                        Nothing...

           And off of Sheridan’s relief, we cut back to --
           EXT. CAMPFIRE - SAME TIME

           Where Vinatieri’s put down the guitar. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        Do you really think the Colonel 
                        shares your concern for their well-
                        being?

                                 HARROW
                        Of course.

                                 VINATIERI
                        You care about the men, Will. Above 
                        all else. And you think that 
                        Colonel Custer’s a good commander 
                        because you believe he feels the 
                        same way you do.

                                 HARROW
                        He does.

           Beat.

                                 VINATIERI
                        I’d heard it said that the Colonel 
                        admires Andrew Jackson. 

                                 HARROW
                             (so?)
                        A brilliant military strategist. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        A President. 

           Harrow’s eyes narrow.

                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        Jackson won the presidency on the 
                        back of his military 
                        accomplishments. 

           Harrow’s silent. First time he’s ever considered that.

                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying the Colonel doesn’t 
                        care about the men. I’m saying 
                        there are things he cares about 
                        more. 
                             (beat, then)
                        “Ambition can blind a man to the 
                        fortunes of those around him.” 
                        - Aristotle. 
           A poignant pause. 

                                 HARROW
                        That’s not Aristotle.   

           Vinatieri shrugs, gives a small smile. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        Doesn’t mean it isn’t true.
                             (then)
                        Maybe your friend Sheridan has a 
                        point. 

           Off Harrow, thinking --

           EXT. COLONEL CUSTER'S TENT - LATER

           Harrow walks up the hill to Colonel Custer’s tent. He reaches 
           it. Raucous voices come from within. He hesitates, then 
           announces -- 

                                 HARROW
                        Sir, it’s me.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (O.S.)
                        Enter!

           Harrow opens the flap.

           INT. COLONEL CUSTER'S TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Harrow comes in to find Colonel Custer sitting around a table 
           with Boston Custer, Tom Custer, and Autie. Tom and Autie are 
           drinking from BOOTS OF BEER. 

           Tom finishes his boot first, slams it down, roars 
           triumphantly, then SMACKS Autie across the face. 

           Beer spurts out of Autie’s mouth. Boston laughs. They’re all 
           drunk.  

                                 AUTIE
                             (frustrated)
                        Another round! 

           The Colonel looks to Harrow, a grin still on his face -- 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Yes, Harrow? 

           Harrow’s uncertain. Put off by the tone of what he just 
           walked into. But he steps forward --
                                 HARROW
                        I had to break up a fight today, 
                        sir.

           A beat, then --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        You seem concerned. 

                                 HARROW
                        Well, morale is sagging. This is a 
                        real issue --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Come, Harrow. Have a drink. 

                                 HARROW
                        I’m here to talk about the men --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Sit with us. It’s good beer. My 
                        private stock. Plenty of it. 

           There’s something dangerous in Custer’s voice. Harrow 
           considers continuing anyway, but instead -- 

           He sits down, hiding his frustration. Colonel Custer refills 
           the boots with beer. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Do you boot race, Harrow?

                                 HARROW
                             (short, hiding annoyance)
                        I used to. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Well our family plays with a twist. 
                        It’s the same race to the finish. 
                        But then the winner...

           He looks to Tom, who MIMES slapping Autie again. Autie 
           instinctively ducks. Tom and Boston laugh. Colonel Custer 
           continues --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        It highlights the competition. 
                        Power or pain? Dominance or 
                        humiliation? You find out all you 
                        need to know about a man.
                             (then)
                        Boston? 
           Boston nods. The Colonel and Boston cheers the refilled 
           boots, and Boston starts drinking. The Colonel watches him 
           for a moment, regarding him like prey. Then he CHUGS. 

           It rushes out of the boot and down his throat. Boston never 
           stood a chance. 

           Within seconds, the Colonel is finished. He unleashes a 
           booming SLAP onto Boston, who falls out of his chair. Harrow 
           winces. Tom and Autie hoot and holler. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never lost. 
                             (beat)
                        Your turn, Harrow. 

           Colonel Custer stares Harrow down until Harrow nods. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Autie, refill us. 
                             (then, to Harrow)
                        Did you know I finished 34th out of 
                        34 at West Point? All those cadets 
                        “ranked higher” spent all their 
                        time polishing their shoes to a 
                        shine and sucking up to our 
                        instructors. But what good is that 
                        in war? I’ll tell you -- none of 
                        them ever took me in a boot race. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Didn’t you graduate first in your 
                        class, Harrow? 

           Harrow nods, teeth gritted. Colonel Custer laughs. 

           Autie hands them both their boots of beer. Tom and Boston 
           start POUNDING on the table. Harrow and Colonel Custer touch 
           boots. Then Harrow starts CHUGGING. 

           Again, Colonel Custer waits. Toying with his victim. The 
           table bounces as Tom and Boston pound it. Autie joins in.

           Then the Colonel starts to realize Harrow is drinking fast. 
           The Colonel races to catch up -- Harrow doesn’t let up --

           Colonel Custer keeps pressing, almost there --

           But Harrow is already done. The thumping stops. Tom, Boston, 
           and Autie are in shock. The Colonel looks at Harrow, his face 
           unreadable. Then, slowly --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Well, aren’t you going to...? 
           He takes a step towards Harrow, offers up a side of his face. 
           Harrow just looks at it. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                             (a command)
                        Do it.

           Harrow’s hand lifts, tenses. The room is airless. Everyone 
           watching, waiting. But Harrow can’t do it. Finally -- 

           Colonel Custer smiles, and then suddenly SLAPS Harrow. Harrow 
           stumbles back, stunned. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        I win because I seize my moments. 
                        You lose because you don’t. 

           He laughs. Nods at Harrow. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Goodnight. 

           And off Harrow, gathering himself --

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Harrow walks back through the camp, rubbing his cheek. Very 
           few men still awake. 

           He passes a still-lit campfire with nobody around it. He 
           shakes his head. He goes over and throws a bucket of dirt on 
           it, extinguishing it. 

           EXT. PLAINS - DAWN

           The entire camp is shrouded in a soft MIST. It’s very quiet.

           INT. HARROW’S TENT - EARLY MORNING

           It’s dark. Harrow is asleep, curled up on his cot under a 
           blanket. His breath is visible in the cold. He shivers. 

           We hear the sound of his tent flap opening. Harrow bolts 
           awake, scaring the YOUNG PRIVATE at his entrance. 

                                 PRIVATE
                        I’m sorry sir --

                                 HARROW
                        What is it? 
           The Private hesitates. Harrow feels a pit in his stomach. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? 

           EXT. MIDDLE OF THE ENCAMPMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The camp is still mostly asleep. The dawn is just starting to 
           break through. 

           Harrow, fully clothed, approaches a group of MOUNTED 
           SOLDIERS. 

           Seven, including Younghawk, Boston Custer, and Tom Custer. 
           All armed. Harrow’s horse saddled and waiting. 

           Tom Custer stares Harrow down as he reaches them. Harrow 
           doesn’t meet his gaze. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        It’s okay, take your time. 

           Harrow swings himself up onto his horse. Ignores the bait. 

                                 HARROW
                        How many of them? 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        We’re not sure. 

           Harrow glances towards the Custer command tent, where the 
           Colonel himself stands, watching them, just a figure in the 
           early morning mist. 

                                 HARROW
                        Let’s go. 

           He looks to Younghawk, who nods EAST. Towards home. 

           The horses take off, storming through camp. Tom Custer 
           leading them. 

           As they gallop past Sheridan’s tent, he walks out. Cocks his 
           head curiously as the hunting party rides off. 

           His brow furrows. 

           INT. FOOD TENT - MINUTES LATER

           Sheridan enters, scans the tent. There’s a line of sleepy men 
           forming for breakfast. He spots Patton. 
           Sheridan walks up to him. Patton sees him and straightens, 
           trying not to look tired. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Did you see that hunting party go 
                        out? 

                                 PATTON
                        Yes sir. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Do you know what they’re going 
                        after? 

                                 PATTON
                        Deer, sir.  

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Sergeant Major Harrow is going on a 
                        deer hunt? 

           Patton reddens, feeling foolish.

                                 PATTON
                        It’s just what I heard. 

           Sheridan’s unconvinced. 

           A SOLDIER IN LINE next to them taps Sheridan on the shoulder. 

                                 SOLDIER IN LINE
                        There’s a line, cap’n. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (distracted)
                        Right, sorry. 

           He goes to leave. Patton gets out of line and quickly follows 
           Sheridan. Reaches him. 

                                 PATTON
                        Captain...

           Sheridan turns --

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        I was wondering if you might be 
                        able to teach me how to ride. With 
                        a blade. 

           Sheridan considers him. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You’re a trumpeter. 
                                 PATTON
                        For now, sir. But I want to be a 
                        cavalryman.

           Sheridan raises his eyebrow. A painful beat of anticipation 
           for Patton.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Come see me later. Something I have 
                        to do first.

                                 PATTON
                             (hiding his elation)
                        Thank you sir. 

           Sheridan leaves. 

           EXT. PLAINS - MORNING

           The hunting party slows to a stop as Younghawk studies the 
           dirt in front of them. He gets off his horse and kneels to 
           the ground. 

           The others look on silently. 

           Younghawk stands. Ponders. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        Did you lose them? 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Quiet down. 
                             (beat, as he studies the 
                              dirt as well)
                        The tracks split.

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        Then we split. 
                             (to Harrow)
                        I’ll take three men and you take 
                        three. 

           Harrow shakes his head. 

                                 HARROW
                        We’re not splitting up. 

           Younghawk studies the tracks. Tom Custer spits. 
                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        We don’t know how many of them 
                        there are and we don’t want one 
                        party to end up in a fight we could 
                        lose. 

           Tom Custer nudges his horse towards Harrow to get up in his 
           face. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        I don’t lose fights. 

                                 HARROW
                        As the commanding officer --

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        I don’t give a damn about your 
                        rank, Harrow --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Tom. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                             (snarling)
                        What? 

           Boston nods towards Younghawk and everyone looks. He’s 
           pointing towards a thick WOODS, where one set of tracks 
           leads. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        All of them. 

           They have the trail again. 

           EXT. STABLES, SEVENTH CAVALRY CAMP - SAME TIME

           Sheridan moves with purpose to the makeshift STABLES. He 
           stops in front of them, counting the empty stalls --

                                 SCHMIDT (O.S.)
                        Oy, Captain. 

           Schmidt’s standing off to the side. Rifle up. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What are you doing? 

           Schmidt shrugs. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        I was posted here. 
           Sheridan turns his eyes back to the empty stalls. They’re 
           bothering him. He nods slightly as he continues to count. 

                                 SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
                        What are you --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        One moment, Schmidt. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Alright. 

           Sheridan finishes counting. A darkness comes over his face as 
           he does. Schmidt notices. 

                                 SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
                        Is something the matter, Captain? 

           Sheridan rubs his temples and sighs. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Deserters. 

           EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME

           Two horses run at a desperate pace. Two men on each, 
           including PORTER. He’s terrified, his face caked with dirt 
           and sweat. 

           He rides with a SERGEANT. Two PRIVATES on the other horse. 

           The horses gallop around trees and jump over rocks, reaching 
           a small clearing --

           Porter’s head swivels, he glances back, a shout? -- it’s hard 
           to hear over the stampeding hooves --

           Nothing behind them --

           He looks back ahead --

           As several horses suddenly CUT OFF THEIR PATH, led by Tom 
           Custer who fires a deafening GUNSHOT into the ground. 

           Porter and the Sergeant’s horse WHINNIES and BUCKS them. They 
           tumble to the ground. 

           Porter grabs his ankle in pain. More horses rush up behind 
           them. 

           The privates on the other horse keep their saddle but throw 
           up their hands. 
           They’re surrounded. 

           Harrow, leading the rear unit, dismounts.  

                                 HARROW
                        Get off that horse, privates. 

           The privates obey, scared for their lives. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        On your knees. All of you.

           The four runaways kneel next to each other. Harrow moves to 
           stand in front of them. 

                                 HARROW
                             (pained)
                        Why run? 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                             (calling out)
                        Come on, Harrow. Kill them and be 
                        done with it. 

           Porter breaks down --

                                 PORTER
                        It was his idea.

           Porter nods to the Sergeant. The Sergeant doesn’t even look 
           at him, just stares straight ahead. 

           Harrow takes a step towards him. 

                                 HARROW
                        Is this true, Sergeant Johnson? 

           Sergeant Johnson turns to Harrow. Resigned but resolute. 

                                 SERGEANT JOHNSON
                        I couldn’t do it anymore.

                                 HARROW
                        Do what?

                                 SERGEANT JOHNSON
                        I couldn’t keep justifying it to 
                        the men. Every day for the past few 
                        weeks they’ve asked me why we’re 
                        still out here. They worried about 
                        not having enough rations. About 
                        losing their friends. About our 
                        place in this war. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SERGEANT JOHNSON (CONT'D)
                        They asked me why, and eventually I 
                        had no more answers. 
                             (then)
                        So we left.

           Tom Custer dismounts. Takes out his SWORD.

           Strides towards the deserters. 

                                 DESERTING PRIVATE
                             (near tears)
                        Please don’t kill us. 

           Harrow cuts Tom off at the pass. A hand to his shoulder. Tom 
           Custer bristles. Younghawk and Boston Custer tense, ready to 
           intervene. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                             (growl)
                        Get your hand off of me. 

                                 HARROW
                             (quiet)
                        We’re not killing these men. 

           Their voices stay low, they’re just talking to each other. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        And then tomorrow four more leave. 
                        And the day after, eight. 

                                 HARROW
                        We need every man. Did you not hear 
                        him? The unit is tired. Depleted. 
                        We can’t afford to demoralize them 
                        further. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        How do you know they won’t run 
                        again if we let them live? 

                                 HARROW
                        I don’t. 
                             (then)
                        But we need them. Mercy, Tom. 
                        That’s an order.

           Beat as they face off, neither backing down. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        Fine. 

           He takes a step past Harrow. In a swift motion, he lifts his 
           sword --
           Sergeant Johnson sees it coming, shuts his eyes --

           As Tom Custer DECAPITATES him. 

           Blood spurts onto Porter, who shudders. One of the privates 
           whimpers. Everyone’s frozen in shock.

                                 TOM CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Today, we are merciful. 

           He turns and walks past Harrow, who looks sick.  

                                 TOM CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Now back to camp. We’ll see what 
                        the Colonel thinks of them. 

           Harrow looks to Younghawk and Boston Custer, but neither will 
           meet his eye. 

           EXT. SHERIDAN’S TENT - DAY

           Sheridan sits outside of his tent. Lost in thought. 

           Periodically, he glances east, in the direction that the 
           “hunting party” went. 

           He’s pulled out of his worrying by the sight of Patton 
           walking his way, struggling to carry two saddles. 

           When Patton finally reaches Sheridan -- 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Are you sure you want to be a 
                        soldier? 

           Patton stands there obstinately. 

                                 PATTON
                        I don’t have a family. Grew up in 
                        an orphanage, no friends. Never 
                        belonged anywhere. Never felt a 
                        purpose. But I joined the army and 
                        I see these men who would die for 
                        one another. They matter more than 
                        anything to each other. They’re a 
                        family. I believe in that. I want 
                        to be a part of that. 
                             (beat)
                        Please, sir.

           Sheridan sighs. 
                                 SHERIDAN
                        Go get your horse. Meet me at the 
                        western edge of the camp. 

           Patton nods vigorously and starts lugging his equipment 
           towards the stables. 

           EXT. WESTERN EDGE, ENCAMPMENT - LATER

           Sheridan holds a bundle of long STICKS under his arms. He 
           watches as Patton runs up to him with a horse. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Follow me. 

           He pats the horse on the nose to greet it and starts walking. 

           They go in silence. Just the faint sound of camp in the 
           distance. A cold, sharp wind. And their breathing. Until --

                                 PATTON
                        Did you find out where they went?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        They’re chasing deserters. 

           On Patton, this hitting him hard. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        This is an opportunity. The men are 
                        losing faith in Colonel Custer.

                                 PATTON
                        ...What do you want to do?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I need to talk with Harrow when he 
                        gets back. 

           EXT. PLAINS - SAME TIME

           Harrow and Tom Custer’s unit rides back to the encampment 
           with the three remaining deserters. Everyone is quiet. 

           Porter, riding a horse alone, moves over to Harrow. In a low 
           voice --

                                 PORTER
                        What’s gonna happen to us? 

           Harrow doesn’t answer. 
                                 PORTER (CONT’D)
                        Sergeant Major? 

                                 HARROW
                        I don’t know, Porter. That’s for 
                        the Colonel to decide. 

           Porter shakes his head. Mutters to himself. 

                                 PORTER
                        You’ve heard the rumors right? 

           Harrow ignores him.

                                 PORTER (CONT’D)
                        That Sitting Bull has an army of a 
                        thousand men? That we’re not 
                        stopping until we find Sitting 
                        Bull? 
                             (beat)
                        That the Colonel ignored a direct 
                        order from General Sheridan to pull 
                        us back?

           Beat. Nothing from Harrow.

                                 PORTER (CONT’D)
                        You must have. You’re not deaf. 
                        You’re not dumb. What Sergeant 
                        Johnson said...
                             (beat)
                        You don’t have those same 
                        questions?

           Harrow turns to him and gives a searing glare. 

                                 HARROW
                             (in increasing intensity)
                        I know what we’re doing here isn’t 
                        exactly the Lord’s work. Does this 
                        feel good, to be out here 
                        “relocating” the Sioux? Of course 
                        not. I fought a war to end slavery. 
                        I know what it feels like to be on 
                        the right side of a war. But this 
                        is my job. To protect you. To get 
                        you home to your family. I can’t do 
                        that if I ask questions. 
                             (calms)
                        The Seventh is great because we 
                        follow our leader. So no. I don’t 
                        question. For the sake of my own 
                        life. And yours.
           Porter stares at him, then shrinks away, back to the center. 

           Harrow glances over at Boston and Tom Custer, talking to each 
           other a little further up. 

           The unit continues on in silence. 

           EXT. WESTERN EDGE, ENCAMPMENT - SAME TIME

           Sheridan has staked the ground with the long sticks he was 
           carrying, creating what looks to be an obstacle course of 
           sorts. Patton watches him. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        So. Here’s the goal. 

           He vaults himself onto the horse. Takes out his SABER. Trots 
           some feet away. Turns around. CHARGES at the sticks. 

           He gets low, takes the saber and lifts it behind him and 
           high. He SLICES through with a vicious swing, taking the 
           upper half off one of the sticks. 

           He switches hands deftly as the horse approaches the next 
           target, seamlessly moving his weight to the other side -- 
           slices -- another perfect hit as the wood topples over. 

           He stops the horse. Patton’s jaw is practically on the floor. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Mount. 

           Patton dutifully climbs the horse. Sheridan hands his SABER 
           to Patton. Patton takes it. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Feel the weight. Try both hands. 
                        You’ll need to be able to switch. 

           Patton feels it out. Moving the blade from hand to hand. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Now start taking swings. 

           Patton swishes the blade through the air. A grin spreading 
           across his face. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        The tenets are simple: know how to 
                        shift your weight and utilize 
                        momentum. The biggest advantage you 
                        have on horseback is your inertial 
                        mass. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        But if you don’t use it properly, 
                        it can work against you. You could 
                        get your blade stuck, and then 
                        you’re dead. 

           Patton is distracted by the excitement of being on a horse 
           with a sword. He wasn’t listening. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand? 

                                 PATTON
                        Ready to try!

           Sheridan sighs -- no he isn’t. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Go for it. 

           Patton happily trots the horse the same distance as Sheridan. 
           Turns, gets a determined look on his face. He CHARGES. 

           He approaches one of the sticks, raises the saber high and 
           back like Sheridan, but doesn’t go low --

           Swings the saber --

           It gets STUCK in the wood --

           Patton holds onto the saber, the horse keeps moving, the 
           momentum completely unsaddles him --

           His shoulder twists and he falls to the ground with a THUMP. 
           Patton groans. 

           Sheridan rushes to Patton. Patton’s grabbing his shoulder. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get you to the doctor. 

           EXT. MEDICAL WAGON - MINUTES LATER

           Patton lies on a makeshift cot outside Lord’s medical wagon, 
           moaning in pain, while Lord inspects his shoulder and 
           Sheridan observes. 

                                 LORD
                             (pokes)
                        Ah no. 
                             (prods)
                        Oh no. 

           Lord looks at Sheridan, winks.
                                 SHERIDAN
                             (catching on)
                        Is it what I think it is? 

                                 LORD
                        I believe so, Captain. 

           Patton’s terrified. 

                                 PATTON
                        What is it...? What --

                                 LORD
                        We’re gonna have to amputate. 

           Patton wails. Tries to pull away from Lord as Lord puts 
           Patton’s shoulders between his hands. 

                                 PATTON
                        It can’t be that bad! Please --

           Lord makes a quick, strong move -- POP. 

                                 LORD
                        It isn’t. Dislocated shoulder. 
                        You’ll be better in a couple weeks. 

           Patton looks at his shoulder, dumbfounded. 

                                 PATTON
                        But...

                                 LORD
                        I’ll give you a bandage to keep it 
                        compressed.

           Sheridan walks over to Lord’s medical wagon. 

                                 PATTON
                        I’m gonna be alright? 

                                 LORD
                        Are you sure you’re meant to be a 
                        soldier, Patton? 

           Sheridan opens the flap -- looks in, freezes --

           Lord realizes what’s happening --

                                 LORD (CONT’D)
                        Captain!

           Sheridan pulls back the flap to reveal MOVING ROBE, lying in 
           a restless sleep. Patton’s eyes go wide. 
           Sheridan whips on Lord. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What were you thinking? 

                                 LORD
                        Please... don’t tell... 

           Moving Robe COUGHS. She’s conscious. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Go get Dorman. 

                                 LORD
                        Captain, I beg --

           Sheridan silences him with a look. Lord runs off, head down. 

           EXT. PLAINS - SAME TIME

           The camp is still aways off, but in sight. Harrow and Boston 
           lead the group side by side. Harrow glances at Boston -- 

                                 HARROW
                        We need these men, Boston. If Tom --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                             (without looking at him)
                        I know. 

           Harrow’s surprised. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Tom can get... overzealous. 

                                 HARROW
                        You’ll have a word with the 
                        Colonel? 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Yes. But this isn’t a favor to you. 
                        It’s what best for the unit. 

           Harrow nods. Whatever gets him the result. 

           EXT. MEDICAL WAGON - LATER

           Sheridan waits with Patton in front of the wagon. 

                                 PATTON
                        Are you going to turn him in?
                                 SHERIDAN
                        I don’t know yet.

           Lord arrives with Dorman. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Dorman)
                        This stays between us. 

           Dorman nods. 

           Sheridan climbs into the wagon, the other three close behind. 

           INT. MEDICAL WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           Moving Robe is sitting up. 

           As Sheridan goes to sit near her, Moving Robe makes a lunge 
           at him with a pair of ARTERY FORCEPS --

           But she’s slow and weak from injury --

           Sheridan easily disarms her and shoves her back, pinning her 
           down. She struggles. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Give Patton something to bind her 
                        arms. 

           Lord hands Patton a tourniquet cloth --

                                 LORD
                        You’re crushing her. 

           Sheridan ignores him, holding Moving Robe down while Patton 
           ties her wrists. Sheridan passes the forceps to Lord with a 
           warning look. 

           Moving Robe glares at the four men sitting around her. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Who is she?

           Lord doesn’t have an answer. Looks to Dorman. 

                                 DORMAN
                        What is your name? 

                                 MOVING ROBE
                        Thasina Mani. 

           Dorman raises an eyebrow. 
                                 DORMAN
                        This is Moving Robe. 

           Off Sheridan’s face, he knows the name well --

           EXT. CAMP - SAME TIME

           The hunting party enters camp. SOLDIERS stand next to their 
           tents, watching as the horses pass between them. They stare 
           at the blood still drying on Porter.

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        Boston and I will take them to the 
                        Colonel. 

           The other members of the unit disperse. The deserting 
           soldiers look terrified. Harrow nods. The party moves off. 

           Harrow rides his horse to the stables. He dismounts. Schmidt 
           is still on guard. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        You alright, sir? You look a bit 
                        sick. 

                                 HARROW
                        Yes, thank you Schmidt. I’ll -- 
                        I’ll go see Lord. 

           Schmidt takes his horse and Harrow walks in the direction of 
           Lord’s wagon. 

           INT. MEDICAL WAGON - SAME TIME

           The men watch Moving Robe. Dorman listens carefully. 

           She never stops glaring at them as she finishes her speech.

                                 DORMAN
                             (translating)
                        As soon as she’s healthy she will 
                        leave and rejoin the Sioux forces. 

                                 LORD
                             (quiet)
                        So we, what, kill her in cold 
                        blood? 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What would you have us do? 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHERIDAN (CONT'D)
                        You brought us into this 
                        predicament, Doctor. There’s a 
                        Sioux commander in your medical 
                        wagon.

                                 LORD
                        I’m a doctor. It is my duty to 
                        preserve life. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Not hers. Ours. 

                                 LORD
                        I don’t make that distinction.

                                 MOVING ROBE
                        You should’ve killed me when you 
                        had the chance. 

           Sheridan eyes Dorman. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What did she say? 

           Dorman shrugs. 

                                 DORMAN
                        “Fuck you.”

           Lord looks to Sheridan, hesitant. 

                                 LORD
                        What if -- what if we release her? 

           Silence. Sheridan stares Lord down. 

           Then, the wagon flap opens --

                                 HARROW
                        Doc --

           HARROW stands there, shocked by the sight. 

           For a second, we think he might be understanding, but when he 
           speaks, his tone has an undercurrent of rage --

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        Who is that?

                                 LORD
                        Sir. This is my doing, they had 
                        nothing to do with it --
                                 HARROW
                        Does Colonel Custer know? 

                                 LORD
                        No, and I beg you to consider --

                                 HARROW
                        He must be told immediately. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (jumping in)
                        You can’t tell him. 

                                 HARROW
                             (furious)
                        He is our commanding officer! Why 
                        are you protecting her?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I’m not. I’m protecting him. 

           He points at Lord.

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        If you tell Colonel Custer, you’re 
                        signing his death warrant.

           He’s right and Harrow knows it. A beat, and then Harrow 
           abruptly leaves the wagon --

                                 LORD
                             (scared)
                        No...

           Sheridan quickly follows Harrow. 

           EXT. MEDICAL WAGON - CONTINUOUS

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Will.

           Sheridan jogs to catch up. Harrow doesn’t slow down.

                                 HARROW
                        What the hell is happening? Our own 
                        doctor...

           He trails off. They walk side by side. Sheridan can tell 
           there’s something more. Presses --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        What happened?
           Beat.

                                 HARROW
                        Four men, Michael. This morning, 
                        four men chose to desert rather 
                        than follow our command. That’s 
                        never happened to the Seventh.

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (tentatively)
                        Things are falling apart because 
                        the Colonel isn’t listening to 
                        anyone else. 

           Harrow looks at his friend. He doesn’t argue.

                                 HARROW
                        Maybe.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        If he finds out about that Sioux 
                        he’ll have Lord hanged for treason. 

           They’ve reached Harrow’s tent. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s true, Will. You know it is. 
                             (beat)
                        You can’t tell him.

           After what seems like forever --

                                 HARROW
                        I won’t. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Thank you --

                                 HARROW
                        But Lord needs to kill her. She’s 
                        dangerous. 

           Sheridan sighs.

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        What do you think will happen if 
                        she escapes?

           A moment between them. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        She’ll lead the Sioux back to us. 
                        They’ll attack.  
           Sheridan nods, understanding.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I’ll handle it. 
                             (then)
                        Thank you. 

           Harrow enters his tent, and Sheridan turns to head back to 
           the medical wagon. 

           INT. MEDICAL WAGON - LATER

           Sheridan enters the wagon. Lord, Patton, and Dorman all look 
           to him.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        He’s not going to say anything. 

           Looks of relief. Dorman quickly exits. 

                                 LORD
                        Thank you so much, captain --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        But he’s ordered you to kill her.

           A long beat. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        There was no other way out. 

           Lord swallows hard. 

                                 LORD
                        I -- I can’t do that. Please... 

           Sheridan regards him, thinking. Then --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Okay. 
                             (beat)
                        I‘ll take care of it. 

           Lord looks up at him, grateful. 

                                 LORD
                        Thank you. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You don’t have to be here. 

           Lord glances at Moving Robe one last time. Then leaves.
           Sheridan and Patton look down at Moving Robe. Patton looks to 
           Sheridan.

                                 PATTON
                        ...Are we really doing this?

           Sheridan looks to Patton. Then back down at Moving Robe. Off 
           Sheridan, thinking --

           EXT. HARROW’S TENT - NEXT DAY

           Harrow takes a shower using a bucket of water, scrubbing 
           himself vigorously with a sponge.

           The grime and sweat wash off, and the scars on Harrow’s chest 
           become visible. Crinkled skin where an arrow pierced, a stark 
           white line of skin where a blade slashed. 

           A man who’s dedicated the better part of his life to war. 

           EXT. CAMP - THAT NIGHT

           Campfire. All the men together around the pit. 

           Porter approaches, wanting to be back with them. Everyone 
           goes silent. Uncomfortable beat. And then Schmidt pats his 
           hand on the log next to him. Porter walks over. Sits down. 

           Everyone goes back to their conversations. 

           EXT. MEDICAL WAGON - DAY AFTER

           Lord administers treatment on a SOLDIER. 

           He walks over to his wagon. Pulls open the flap to grab some 
           supplies. Sees the spot where Moving Robe once laid. 

           He stares at it sadly before returning to the soldier.

           EXT. COLONEL CUSTER’S TENT - ANOTHER DAY

           Colonel Custer speaks to Boston and Tom, while Sheridan 
           watches them from a distance. Apprehensive. Like he can sense 
           something is coming.

           INT. HARROW’S TENT - LATER THAT WEEK

           Harrow sits at his desk. A piece of paper before him. He 
           pauses, as if building resolve.
           Then he writes --

           Dearest Anna, we are fast approaching your expected delivery 
           date and I’m growing more fearful that I will not be back in 
           time...

           EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

           Soldiers around the campfire. Hunched over their dinner soup 
           bowls. Everyone eats quietly, exhausted. 

           Harrow sits off to the side, among the men but not mentally 
           present. He plays with his EMBROIDERED KNIFE.

                                 SCHMIDT (O.S.)
                        Look at this. 

           Patton, Porter, and Younghawk are gathered around Schmidt. He 
           has a wood board with a TEN CENT PIECE on it. Trying to cheer 
           everybody up. 

                                 SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
                        I call it “Die Hexe und der 
                        Zauberer.” Whoever grabs it first, 
                        gets it. 

           Porter tries to pluck it off quickly, it turns out it’s GLUED 
           to the board, and he flops to the ground from the pushback. 
           Schmidt smiles. Harrow looks over. 

                                 SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
                        “Sword in the stone!” It’s my new 
                        plan of how I’m going to propose to 
                        my girl. Instead of a ten cent 
                        piece, I glue the ring to the 
                        board. When she tries to take it... 

           Porter chuckles, clapping him on the shoulder. Younghawk 
           forces a smile. Patton nods, his mind elsewhere. 

                                 PORTER
                        Good luck, Schmidt. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                             (winks at him)
                        I’ll win her over yet! 

           As the privates sit back down around the fire, Sheridan walks 
           in. Sits next to Harrow. Hands him a cigar. He notices 
           Harrow’s knife. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You still have that old thing? 
                                 HARROW
                        Of course. It was my father’s. 
                        Soon, it will be my son’s. 

           He puts the heirloom back in its scabbard on his belt. The 
           two of them smoke quietly for a beat.

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        Is everything alright?

           Sheridan doesn’t answer for a moment. Looks like he wants to 
           say something... but doesn’t.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Yeah.

                                 HARROW
                        Okay.

           Harrow exhales. Looks at the fire. Then hands the cigar back 
           to Sheridan. 

           We pan up to the STARS. Not many out. It’s dark tonight.

           INT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Patton and Schmidt duck under the flap and enter the tent 
           they share. Schmidt claps Patton on the shoulder. 

                                 SCHMIDT
                        You okay? You seem off.

                                 PATTON
                        Just tired. Haven’t been able to 
                        sleep lately.

           They get ready for bed, taking off their uniforms. Schmidt 
           lights his OPIUM PIPE. Offers it to Patton.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        No thanks.

                                 SCHMIDT
                        Suit yourself.

           Schmidt takes a hit.

                                 SCHMIDT (CONT’D)
                        Take me, Hypnos. 

           He lies on his cot. Takes another hit. Then inhales deeply, 
           puts his pipe down, and closes his eyes. 
           Patton lies awake. 

           EXT. 7TH ENCAMPMENT - MIDNIGHT 

           We see the whole encampment, completely asleep but for a 
           couple WATCHMEN nodding off by torches. 

           We come in on ONE GUARD, strolling over to a tree. He undoes 
           his fly when -- movement from out on the plains. He peers 
           into the night, unsure of what he’s looking for, when -- 

           An ARROW comes out of the darkness and THUNKS into his heart, 
           killing him instantly. He drops. 

           We stay on his lifeless body and hear the rustle of many feet 
           moving past him. 

           INT. TENT, 7TH ENCAMPMENT - SAME TIME

           The men are asleep. Close on Patton, finally about to drift 
           off. When suddenly -- 

           A WHOOPING CRY. Patton jolts back up.  

           The sound of FIRE. The sound of ARROWS flying. The sound of 
           STEEL. GUNSHOTS. 

           The entrance flap moves slightly --

           Patton grabs the RIFLE next to him. 

           It opens and a SIOUX WARRIOR bursts in, armed with a TOMAHAWK 
           axe --

           He sees Patton still in his cot and runs at him, HOWLING --

           Patton yells, fires off a SHOT that misses --

           The Sioux warrior HACKS at him with the axe, but Patton 
           blocks it with the body of the rifle, it nicks his arm 
           anyway, drawing blood --

           He pushes the warrior back and rolls away --

           The warrior runs at him again, seeing Patton on his heels --

           But Patton flips the bayonet out just in time, IMPALING the 
           warrior, who falls to the ground. 

           A BATTLE carries on outside. Patton is about to join it, but 
           realizes he’s leaving Schmidt. 
           Patton rushes over to Schmidt, who’s still asleep --

                                 PATTON
                        Schmidt!

           He slaps him across the face, but Schmidt remains 
           unconscious, completely knocked out from the opium. 

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        SCHMIDT! 

           He shakes him again, but nothing. A YELL from outside. Patton 
           clenches his jaw --

           He takes his rifle and runs out --

           EXT. PATTON’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

           There are a few tents burning, and soldiers dash around, 
           trying to organize. It’s a disaster. 

           Sheridan dashes by with a group --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Patton, with us! 

           Patton hurries to join them. He and Sheridan exchange a look 
           and they sprint off into the night --

           EXT. ELSEWHERE, 7TH ENCAMPMENT - SAME TIME

           Harrow is in the middle of a skirmish with a group of SIOUX 
           WARRIORS. A FEW SOLDIERS with him.

           Out of the corner of his eye -- the glint of a spear. He 
           turns to see --

           MOVING ROBE. She’s pulling her spear from the chest of a 
           CAPTAIN. Lord’s bandages still around her midriff.  

           Harrow pauses. Unsure of what he’s seeing. Then ANOTHER SIOUX 
           SWINGS at him. Harrow PARRIES and STABS, killing the Sioux 
           quickly. 

           When he turns back, Moving Robe is gone.

           EXT. CAMP - LATER

           The Sioux raid is over. The men are in disarray, trying to 
           sort through the dead and wounded. 
           Lord tends to several SOLDIERS simultaneously. Sheridan and 
           another SOLDIER prop up a damaged tent. A FEW WEARY PRIVATES 
           carry a DEAD BODY to a freshly dug mass grave.

           In the midst of the destruction, we find Harrow. Storming 
           through camp. Looking for --

                                 HARROW
                        Lord!

           Lord turns, confused.  

                                 LORD
                        Over here, Harrow.

           Harrow marches up to him. 

                                 HARROW
                        I need a word.

                                 LORD
                        Not now. These men need my help --

                                 HARROW
                        NOW.

           Harrow’s look ends further protest. Lord stands. Follows 
           Harrow. Sheridan sees them leave. 

           Harrow leads Lord out of eyesight from the rest of the men. 
           Turns a corner around a tent. 

           Lord’s right behind Harrow when all of a sudden Harrow spins 
           around and GRABS HIM. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        You let her go, didn’t you.

           His voice is deadly.

                                 LORD
                        What?

           Lord’s visibly confused. 

                                 HARROW
                        The Sioux woman. I saw her. I 
                        ordered you to kill her and you let 
                        her go. 

                                 LORD
                        I didn’t let her go! I swear. I 
                        think --
                                 SHERIDAN (O.S.)
                        It was me.

           Harrow and Lord turn. Sheridan followed them. Harrow puts 
           Lord down. 

           Lord looks between the two men. Scurries away.

                                 HARROW
                             (betrayed)
                        How could you do such a thing?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        The men are hanging by a thread. 
                        They’re ready to turn against him. 
                        They needed a push.  

                                 HARROW
                             (quiet, furious)
                        Men are dead because of you. Wives 
                        lost husbands. Children lost 
                        fathers -- all so you could... 
                        start a mutiny?!

                                 SHERIDAN
                        No. So that we could save everyone 
                        else.
                             (beat)
                        You know what happens if we follow 
                        him to Sitting Bull. Won’t be a 
                        single one of us left to make it 
                        home. I’m preventing that.

                                 HARROW
                        By killing our men. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        If this unit was infallible, we 
                        would have been ready for that 
                        attack.

           Harrow’s seeing red. 

           THUMP. Cold cocks Sheridan. Sheridan falls to the ground.

           Harrow drops on top of him, RAINING blows. Sheridan refuses 
           to defend himself -- he just keeps taking the hits. One after 
           the other. 

           By the time Harrow rolls off of Sheridan, exhausted, Sheridan 
           has been beat to a pulp. 

           Harrow stands. Looks down at Sheridan. And then leaves.
           Off Sheridan, lying with the pain --

           EXT. CAMP - PRE-DAWN

           Patton wanders back to his tent, exhausted. Blood on his 
           face. The slash on his arm still open, but he clearly can’t 
           feel it. 

           There’s a commotion near the center of camp. Patton passes 
           by, sees Tom Custer roaring with anger. Taking his rage out 
           on some poor SENTRIES. 

           Patton moves on to find -- 

           Lord, still shaken, bent over a WOUNDED SOLDIER leaned up 
           against a metal stake. The wounded soldier’s leg is purple. 

                                 LORD
                        -- poison in the arrow, it will 
                        spread and you will die unless I 
                        amputate --

                                 WOUNDED SOLDIER
                             (whimpering)
                        This is one of your jokes, right 
                        doc --

           Lord takes a tenacula out of his kit, clamps down on the 
           man’s leg. Then Lord actually amputates his leg with a 
           capital saw right there and then. The wounded soldier HOWLS.  

           Patton shuts his eyes and looks away, keeps walking. 

           He reaches his tent some moments later, relieved and almost 
           surprised to have made it. He enters the tent, his nose 
           crinkling at a putrid smell --

           INT. PATTON’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Patton enters to find --

           Schmidt. Throat slit. Blood soaking his cot. 

           Patton starts to hyperventilate, his eyes well up. He slowly 
           falls to his knees. 

                                 PATTON
                        Schmidt...

           His lower jaw quivers. He can’t hold it back. 

           He starts to sob. 
           Then he becomes angry at himself. His fist clenches. He 
           pounds the ground. Then pounds it again. And again. 

           Until he’s completely worn out. 

           He collapses. 

           EXT. THE 7TH ENCAMPMENT - NEXT MORNING

           We sweep over the tents of the 7th in daylight. 

           Some of them are charred from the fire attacks. There’s a 
           line of MEN near the medical wagon. Soldiers walking around 
           are weary and depressed. The mood is dour. 

           We finally reach Colonel Custer’s tent... 

           INT. COLONEL CUSTER’S TENT - SAME TIME

           All of the leadership is gathered around the war table. 
           Colonel Custer sits at the head. Everyone else (Harrow, 
           Sheridan, all of the Custers, OTHER OFFICERS) stands. 

           Sheridan is bruised, bearing scars and welts from earlier, 
           but he doesn’t stand out. Many of the other officers have 
           injuries from the ambush.

           The mood is grim. Harrow is running down a list of their 
           losses --

                                 HARROW
                        -- Our pork supply is almost 
                        completely gone and two of our 
                        potato storages were burned to the 
                        ground. We were short anyway, now 
                        we probably have three days worth 
                        of food left. 

           Heads are buried in hands. Colonel Custer listens 
           impassively. We see Sheridan in the very back. Watching. 
           Waiting.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        The men? 

           Harrow shakes his head and looks at a list. 

                                 HARROW
                        We lost Boggs, Yarbrough, 
                        Dougherty, Smart, Springer --
                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Enough. How many? 

           A beat. 

                                 HARROW
                        Thirty two, Colonel. Twenty nine 
                        soldiers, one of Vinatieri’s, a 
                        cook, and a stable boy. 

           One of the Captains speaks up --

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Sir, we’ve never suffered losses 
                        like this. We’re no longer equipped 
                        to --

           Tom Custer silences him with a look. The Captain cowers, 
           retreats. 

           But Sheridan isn’t afraid. 

           He steps forward and stares down Tom Custer. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        How many more men? How many more 
                        battles? 
                             (turns to Colonel Custer)
                        Sir, we have no supplies. Morale is 
                        in a pit. If we don’t turn back 
                        now... who knows how much damage 
                        the next attack could do? 

           Everyone in the room is nodding along to Sheridan’s point.  

           Then, as Custer considers this --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                             (very slowly)
                        It’s time for us to head home... 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Yes.

           The room holds a collective breath, for a second it appears 
           that Sheridan has gotten through to Colonel Custer, until --

                                 HARROW
                        No. We can’t turn tail and let 
                        Sitting Bull declare victory after 
                        one setback. We can’t end our 
                        campaign like that.

           Sheridan stands there. Shocked.
                                 SHERIDAN
                        The campaign is finished --

                                 HARROW
                        We can’t leave our men unavenged. 
                        We won’t.
                             (Sheridan tries to speak)
                        You don’t understand. You couldn’t 
                        possibly. You’re not really one of 
                        us.

           Sheridan has no response. Reeling. The room is silent.

           Sheridan tries to appeal --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Be reasonable, Will. It is 
                        foolhardy to continue given the 
                        present conditions! The men, the 
                        food supplies, the morale --

                                 HARROW
                             (cutting him off again)
                        We’ll have food. I’ll lead a 
                        buffalo hunt myself. Sir?

           He looks to Colonel Custer for affirmation. The Colonel gives 
           it to him with a nod, impressed. Harrow has erased Custer’s 
           doubt about the mission.

           Sheridan looks at Harrow in disbelief. His most powerful 
           ally. Gone. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                             (renewed vigor, turning to 
                              Boston)
                        Boston, that ambush party is 
                        wounded, bleeding, and in retreat. 
                        Chances are good they’re leaving an 
                        obvious trail right now. While 
                        Harrow restocks our food, take a 
                        scouting party and don’t come back 
                        until you find me Sitting Bull.

           Sheridan starts to leave, furious. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Sheridan. 

           Sheridan stops.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        You’ll go with your friend on the 
                        hunt.
           Sheridan walks out without responding. 

           The room is palpably tense. Then --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        What are you waiting for? 

           The tent empties. 

           EXT. COLONEL CUSTER’S TENT - SAME TIME

           We follow Sheridan as he storms away from Colonel Custer’s 
           tent. He spots Patton. Runs up to him.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Patton. I don’t know what happened 
                        in there. We lost Harrow. We have 
                        to --

                                 PATTON
                        There is no we. 

           Sheridan’s taken aback.

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Not anymore.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I thought it would be worth it.

                                 PATTON
                        It wasn’t.

           Sheridan looks like he’s been slapped.

           Harrow, Boston Custer, and the rest of the officers come out 
           of the tent. Patton rushes up to Harrow -- 

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Sir. I have a request.

           Harrow nods but keeps walking. Patton follows him. 

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        We’re going after them, aren’t we? 
                        I want to come. I’m tired of being 
                        a trumpeter, I’m bad at it anyway 
                        and I want to be a real soldier. 

           He’s got a new determination, a fierceness to him. 

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Let me prove --
                                 HARROW
                        You can go. 

                                 PATTON
                        I -- really? 

                                 HARROW
                             (calls back to Boston)
                        Take Patton with you. 

           Boston Custer, talking with some other officers, shrugs. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Be ready to ride at the hour. 

           He turns back. 

                                 PATTON
                        Thank you, Sergeant Major. 

                                 HARROW
                        Be careful. 

           Harrow watches Patton run off. Patton’s enthusiasm 
           momentarily lifting Harrow’s spirits... until he sees 
           Sheridan watching.  

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                             (an order)
                        Ready the horses, Captain. 

           Sheridan shakes his head and walks away. 

           EXT. PLAINS - DAY

           We sweep over a hunting party of a DOZEN MEN on horseback, 
           led by Sheridan and Harrow. The men are slumped, the horses 
           move slowly. They’ve been riding a while. 

           Harrow moves through the party, he pats one man on the 
           shoulder, jokes with another. Morale boosting. 

           Sheridan rides ahead, alone. Slowly getting farther and 
           farther from the unit. Harrow notices.

                                 HARROW
                        Captain Sheridan.

           No response. Sheridan starts riding faster. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                             (yelling now)
                        Captain!
           Now Sheridan’s pushing his horse. Fully sprinting away. The 
           men look at him, tense -- is he deserting? 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        Fuck.
                             (to the men)
                        With me. After him.

           Harrow starts to gallop after Sheridan. The men follow. 
           Chasing him down. 

           Harrow’s gaining on him. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        Michael! Stop. 

           Nothing. Sheridan continues his sprint --

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        I won’t ask you again...

           Harrow’s almost caught Sheridan. His hand goes to the pistol 
           on his side, when he hears a LOW RUMBLE in the distance. 

           Finally Sheridan calls back --

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (pointing)
                        Buffalo. 

           EXT. PLAINS - DAY

           A HERD OF BUFFALO. Some run, some walk. 

           A GUNSHOT rings out -- a buffalo collapses to the ground, 
           blood blossoming out of his hide. 

           The buffalo begin a STAMPEDE --

           As the hunting party descends on them from a nearby hill --

           They chase down the buffalo expertly, corralling them and 
           firing at will. 

           After they’ve taken six, Sheridan stops --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        We have enough. 

                                 HARROW
                        We’re to kill as many as we can. 
                                 SHERIDAN
                        We’ll never be able to carry back 
                        more than what we already have. 

                                 HARROW
                        Colonel’s orders. The Sioux rely on 
                        these beasts for food as much as we 
                        do. 

           Sheridan looks sick. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                             (shouts to the party)
                        As many as you can!

           The men keep chasing and continue to fire on the retreating 
           buffalo. It’s a massacre. 

           EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PLAINS - DAY

           The scouting party (Boston Custer, Younghawk, Patton, OTHER 
           SOLDIERS) is at the edge of a forest. 

           Younghawk is off his horse, leading it, following a trail 
           only his sharp eyes can see. 

           He bends down, and we can suddenly see what he sees: 

           SMALL SPECKS OF BLOOD. The trail they’ve been following. 
           Younghawk looks off. Scans the treeline and the plains. 

           He glances back at Boston, who’s in a foul mood. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        What is it? 

           Younghawk gestures in two directions. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        Trail goes both ways. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Pick one. 

           Younghawk doesn’t know what to do. He looks for support from 
           others in the scouting party, but everyone looks away. Except 
           for Patton. Their eyes meet. 

           Younghawk looks back down for a moment. Then slowly lifts his 
           arm and points in one direction. 
           Boston rides past Younghawk, who doesn’t look happy. 
           Younghawk climbs back onto his horse. Patton comes up to him, 
           impressed. 

                                 PATTON
                        How did you figure it out? 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        I didn’t. 

           EXT. PLAINS - LATER THAT DAY

           Harrow’s hunting party lumbers back towards camp. Every horse 
           has sacks on both sides, loaded with cut-up meat and bones. 

           Everyone looks completely exhausted. Sheridan and Harrow at 
           the head of the party. After riding for a while --

                                 HARROW
                        I actually thought you were running 
                        off. 

           Sheridan looks at him. 

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        I was worried I was going to have 
                        to explain to the General why I 
                        shot his brother.

           A moment. Sheridan rides away from him without responding. 

           EXT. CAMP - DUSK

           The men WHISTLE as Harrow’s party enter camp and their 
           comrades come out. People start to CHEER as they see the 
           food. It’s the first sign of joy in a while. 

           SOLDIERS start helping unload the horses. 

           Harrow looks on at the men with a smile, when -- 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Nothing tastes sweeter than a dead 
                        man’s last meal.

           Sheridan trots his horse past Harrow. Harrow’s smile now 
           faded.

           This doesn’t feel like a victory anymore. 
           EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

           MEN cook meat on makeshift spits over fires. There’s a 
           general air of energy. Men are starting to line up for the 
           finished meat. Little pockets of laughter in the line. 

           Harrow watches from the edge. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (O.S.)
                        You did it. 

           Colonel Custer walks up and stands next to Harrow. Harrow 
           turns and looks at him. 

                                 HARROW
                             (as greeting)
                        Sir. 

           They watch the men. As they do --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        I must admit. There was a moment... 
                        I doubted myself.  

           He trails off. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        But you brought me back. 

           He puts a hand on Harrow’s shoulder. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        You’ve always been my rock, Harrow. 

                                 HARROW
                        Thank you, sir. 

           Colonel Custer nods and walks away. Harrow watches him go, 
           then turns back to the campfires and the men -- a conflicted 
           look upon his face. 

           We go CLOSE on a CAMPFIRE and seamlessly cut to: 

           EXT. CAMPFIRE, PLAINS - NIGHT

           The flames of another, smaller campfire. Gathered around this 
           one is the scouting party. Younghawk roasts a small rabbit. 
           Patton brings wood to feed the fire. 

           Boston stares into the flames, upset. 

                                 PATTON
                        Smells good.
           He smiles at Younghawk, who nods. 

           A silence. 

           Boston turns to Younghawk. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        We rode all day and found nothing. 

           Younghawk meets his gaze. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        You never find nothing. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        Could be the other way... 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Could be you meant to lead us the 
                        wrong way. 

           Patton is caught between them.

           Boston stands up, menacing.

           Younghawk holds his ground. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        I wouldn’t.

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        How do I know that?

           Boston takes out his PISTOL. Everyone at the campfire tenses. 
           Even Younghawk looks scared. 

           Younghawk says nothing. Boston COCKS HIS GUN. 

           Suddenly Patton leaps up --

                                 PATTON
                        Stop it. 

           Boston raises his eyebrow, surprised by the audacity of the 
           young private. Patton stands between Younghawk and Boston. 

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        He’s one of the Seventh, like any 
                        of us. 

           Boston regards him. 
                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Us? 
                             (viciously)
                        You’re a trumpeter, Patton. 

           Patton just stands there. Then Boston puts his gun away. And 
           goes off to his tent. 

           Patton exhales. 

           EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT

           Boston Custer is asleep, snoring lightly. 

           Patton cleans up the plates and Younghawk is snuffing out the 
           fire with dirt. 

           Younghawk comes over to Patton after he’s done and starts to 
           help. A silent moment of bonding. 

           Patton glances over to Younghawk. A pause, then --

                                 PATTON
                        Why do you work for us? For the 
                        army? 

           Younghawk looks over at him. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        How do you think this war is going 
                        to end? The Sioux will be gone. 

           Patton’s silent. Embarrassed. 

                                 PATTON
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        They have no future. But I will. 

           Patton’s uncomfortable. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK (CONT’D)
                        You think I’m a traitor to my 
                        people? 

                                 PATTON
                        No. I just... we don’t treat you 
                        well. 

           Patton tilts his head over at the sleeping Boston Custer. 
                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        He doesn’t bother me. 

                                 PATTON
                        Okay... 

           He trails off. Squints. 

                                 PATTON (CONT’D)
                        Is that -- I think that’s smoke?  

           Younghawk turns to look. 

           It’s faint, but there is a small grey cloud in the distance. 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        It is. 

                                 PATTON
                        Sitting Bull? 

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        Maybe. 

           Younghawk goes over to Boston Custer. He shakes him awake. 
           Boston arouses, angry. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        What? I swear to God, if --

                                 YOUNGHAWK
                        Look.

           He points off to the distance. Boston squints, sees the 
           smoke. Off Boston, disbelieving --

           EXT. PLAINS - SAME TIME

           The scouting party races along the plains towards the smoke. 
           The cloud now looks like it might block out the sky. 

           Patton’s eyes are wide, scared even. It’s bigger than he 
           thought. 

           EXT. PLAINS - SAME TIME

           The scouting party reaches a hill. The smoke cloud is 
           directly above them now. 

           They hop off their horses and walk up towards the top of the 
           hill. 
           A sense of foreboding on all of their faces, even Boston. 

           EXT. PLAINS - SAME TIME

           The scouting party reaches the top of the hill, their horses 
           stay behind while Patton, Boston Custer, and Younghawk crawl 
           up to look over the ledge --

           Where they see HUNDREDS of SIOUX TENTS. Smoke billowing from 
           the multitude of campfires. As far as the eye can see.

           There are thousands of Sioux here. 

           A deep fear comes over Boston. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        The rumors were true... 

           Close on Patton, his eyes wide. They found Sitting Bull’s 
           army.

           EXT. COLONEL CUSTER’S TENT - EARLY MORNING

           Looking out across the plains, a small plume of dust can be 
           seen rising in the distance. 

           Tom Custer stands outside the Colonel’s tent, looking at it. 
           Walks into the tent. Comes out a moment later with the 
           Colonel. 

           INT. HARROW’S TENT, MAIN CAMP - MINUTES LATER

           Harrow is shaken awake by Tom Custer. His eyes snap open, 
           he’s sweating as if waking from a nightmare. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        Scouting party’s back. 

           EXT. EDGE OF CAMP - MINUTES LATER

           Boston leads the party back into camp. Harrow, Tom Custer, 
           and Colonel Custer are waiting for them when they arrive.

           Boston Custer dismounts. He and Colonel Custer hug. Then --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                             (quietly)
                        We found them, George. 
                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Sitting Bull?

           Boston nods. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        They’re camped. Not on the march. 
                        They’re... waiting.

           Colonel Custer grabs him. Excited. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Good job. Harrow, Tom -- ready the 
                        men to march. 

           Harrow and Tom salute and leave. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                             (to Boston)
                        How many men?

           Boston looks to the others. Patton’s quaking. Colonel Custer 
           notices. He takes Boston by the shoulder and they walk off 
           alone. 

           INT. COLONEL CUSTER’S TENT - LATER

           Light shines in from the tent opening. Colonel Custer sits 
           alone at his desk. 

           We’re with him for a time as he puts the finishing touches on 
           A LETTER. 

           When he’s done, he holds it up. Glances over it for a moment, 
           when Sheridan enters. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                             (wary)
                        You requested my presence, Colonel? 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        I did.

           He looks up. Stares Sheridan down.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Did you know I was there when Lee 
                        surrendered to General Grant? 
                             (then)
                        The way everyone looked at Grant in 
                        that moment... you could tell he 
                        was destined for greatness. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        That he would be a man who would 
                        live throughout history. That, in a 
                        way, he would be immortal. 

           Sheridan doesn’t engage. He just lets the Colonel speak. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        We found Sitting Bull.

           Sheridan stiffens.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        He’s camped on the banks of the 
                        Little Bighorn. We’re marching on 
                        him within the hour. I’ll have his 
                        head by this time tomorrow.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        ...How many does he have? 

           Colonel Custer doesn’t answer. 

                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        How many? 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        It doesn’t matter. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        It’s an army isn’t it? I knew --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        You won’t be there. 

           Sheridan’s shocked.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be joining Major Reno fifty 
                        miles south of here. I’m removing 
                        you from my regiment, effective 
                        immediately. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You don’t have the authority. I was 
                        appointed by my brother -- 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        I know.

           Colonel Custer hands Sheridan the LETTER. Sheridan takes it.
                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        That’s for him. It details how 
                        you’ve been undermining my 
                        leadership from your first moments 
                        under my command, how you’ve 
                        systematically destroyed the 
                        company’s morale, and how you’ve 
                        even caused men to desert. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You know that had nothing to do 
                        with me.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        We never had these problems before 
                        you arrived --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I arrived because you had these 
                        problems! You’re leading these men 
                        to their deaths -- 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        You will leave this regiment right 
                        now or I will hang you for open 
                        mutiny.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Mutiny? This whole regiment is in 
                        mutiny! 
                             (beat)
                        I know Phillip ordered you to 
                        return. 

           A slight smile curls around the Colonel’s mouth. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        Really? Can you prove it? 

           Sheridan’s silent. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Go pack up your tent. 

           Sheridan stands there, helpless. No recourse. 

           He turns and leaves. 

           EXT. HARROW’S TENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The camp’s still asleep for the most part, but Harrow’s 
           dunking his head in a bucket of water to wake up. 
           Sheridan approaches. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Will...

                                 HARROW
                        What.

           Sheridan walks up to Harrow like he’s in a daze. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Colonel Custer reassigned me. 

                                 HARROW
                        And you want me to convince him to 
                        let you stay -- 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        No. 

           Harrow’s taken aback. 

                                 HARROW
                        What then?

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You need to come with me. 

           A beat. Harrow recovers --

                                 HARROW
                        No.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        This will cost you your life --

                                 HARROW
                        Just go.

           But Sheridan can’t. He has to keep trying --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Think of your child. Doesn’t he 
                        deserve to know his father?

                                 HARROW
                        You’ve lost the right to talk about 
                        my son.

           Sheridan shakes his head.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You cannot win this fight.
                                 HARROW
                        Yes we can. 

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Will --

                                 HARROW
                        We have the element of surprise. We 
                        have superior weaponry. We’re 
                        better trained, better organized, 
                        and we’ve never lost a battle.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You’ve never faced an army.

                                 HARROW
                        You know what the difference 
                        between the two of us is? You’d 
                        kill your own men to prove you’re 
                        right. I’d die for mine.

           Sheridan wells up, he can’t help it. The two men stand in 
           silence for a moment. Finally --

                                 SHERIDAN
                        You have to stand up to him. For 
                        the men.

           A glimmer in Harrow’s eyes -- but he hardens. 

                                 HARROW
                        You know the most pathetic thing? 
                             (beat)
                        I wanted to name him Michael.

           Sheridan looks at Harrow one last time. Then walks off.

           EXT. EDGE OF CAMP - MINUTES LATER

           Sheridan is on his horse, pack bags strapped to its flanks. 
           Riding out of camp.

           The MEN watch as he rides through. Silent observers.

           Sheridan sees Patton off to one side. They make eye contact. 
           Sheridan stops beside him. Looks down.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Can I give you some advice, Patton? 

           Patton doesn’t respond.
                                 SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Stick with the band. 

                                 PATTON
                        Shouldn’t you get going?

           He’s resolute.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        I’m sorry.

           Then Sheridan giddyups his horse and starts south, in the 
           direction of Reno’s camp.

           Patton watches him go. Once Sheridan starts to disappear in 
           the distance, Patton turns around to prepare for the march.

           He takes a few steps before spotting --

           The entire Custer clan, clustered a ways off on the edge of 
           camp, watching Sheridan leave. 

           EXT. PLAINS - LATER THAT MORNING

           Camp is packed and stored behind them. 

           The whole regiment is lined up and ready to travel. 

           Harrow is finishing a final sweep when Tom Custer approaches, 
           Boston hot on his heels -- 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                             (to Tom)
                        -- You didn’t see them. There were 
                        too many... we can’t let this 
                        happen -- 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                             (ignoring Boston)
                        Harrow, come on, we’re leaving --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Tom --

                                 TOM CUSTER
                             (spins on him)
                        Don’t you think I know we won’t 
                        win? 

           Boston looks surprised. 
                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        If you agree with me, then we have 
                        to go to George. Maybe together we 
                        can convince him --

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        We can’t convince him. He’s George. 
                        He wants his glory. And I want 
                        mine. 
                             (beat)
                        No place I’d rather die than next 
                        to my brothers on the battlefield. 

           He grins, his eyes crazed. Boston shakes his head in 
           disbelief.

           Tom turns to Harrow. 

                                 TOM CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go. 

           Harrow looks at Boston, thinks about saying something... but 
           doesn’t. 

           EXT. BANKS OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN - LATER

           The Seventh marches in formation. It’s a sight to behold as 
           they arrive at the eastern banks of the Little Bighorn River. 

           Harrow directs the men to line up on the hill, and the band 
           to ready their instruments. 

           The band begins to play as Harrow dismounts his horse and 
           splashes water on his face in the shallows of the river. 

           As he does, Vinatieri approaches. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        We’re at the end.

           Vinatieri smiles sadly.

                                 HARROW
                        Don’t bet against the Seventh yet. 

           He starts walking away. Vinatieri calls after him --

                                 VINATIERI
                        Sergeant Major. 
                             (Harrow turns)
                        If you don’t stop him, no one will.

           Beat. 
                                 HARROW
                        Play double time today. We could 
                        use some energy.

           EXT. HILL, LITTLE BIGHORN RIVER - MINUTES LATER

           The entirety of the Seventh Cavalry stands in formation on 
           the hill. Vinatieri walks through his men, preparing them for 
           the upcoming march. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        We’ll be playing double time, boys! 
                        Keep it tight, keep it chipper. 

           He stops in front of Patton, as he did in the opening scene. 
           Patton’s trumpet is down.

                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        Everything all right?

           Patton shakes his head. 

                                 PATTON
                        I want to fight. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        We all have our place in this, son. 
                        Yours is here with me. 

           Patton nods reluctantly. Vinatieri steps to the head of the 
           band. As he gets there, murmurs start, and he turns around to 
           see --

           Colonel Custer. On his horse. Trotting to the head of the 
           regiment. 

           When Colonel Custer arrives at the front, he turns to face 
           the men. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        History is written by the victors. 

           Harrow and Tom Custer stand in front of their columns. 
           Listening.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        All the remaining forces of the 
                        Lakota Sioux nation are across this 
                        river. I know it’s been long, I 
                        know it’s been hard, but victory 
                        today will mark the end of our 
                        legendary campaign.
           The men grip their weapons. Ready for the fight.  

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        People will tell stories about this  
                        conquest. There will be a march in 
                        every city in the land. In Boston. 
                        In Chicago. In Washington. You left 
                        St. Louis as soldiers. You will 
                        return as heroes. 

           Harrow sees one of the MEN crying. The Colonel is getting to 
           them. They’re inspired. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        When we kill Sitting Bull, their 
                        resistance will be over. And you 
                        will be remembered as the men who 
                        served under George Armstrong 
                        Custer, in the Seventh cavalry, the 
                        greatest military force ever 
                        assembled!

           Tom Custer lets out a hearty roar. The rest of the men join 
           him. Harrow’s chest puffs out.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Vinatieri?

           The old conductor raises his arm and the band starts to play. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Garryowen!

                                 THE MEN
                        GARRYOWEN!

           They march towards the water, and ford the river on 
           horseback. 

           Once they’re through the river, they pass around a hill and 
           SITTING BULL’S ARMY COMES INTO FOCUS. 

           Harrow’s breath catches at the sight -- 

           There are so many you can’t see the land beneath them.

           Sheridan was right. They can’t win this.

           Harrow tries to remain calm, but it’s now clear to him that 
           this mission is suicide. 

           A great PANIC fills him. He looks around, finds BOSTON 
           CUSTER, urges his horse towards him --
                                 HARROW
                        Boston!

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Harrow. 

                                 HARROW
                        We have to stop this.

           Boston looks resigned. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                             (gently)
                        It’s too late. 

                                 HARROW
                        I heard what you said to Tom --

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        You can’t choose your family. 

           He shrugs. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        And I’m not abandoning mine. 

           There’s no help to be found here. 

           Harrow sees Colonel Custer at the head of the troop, grits 
           his teeth --

           EXT. LITTLE BIGHORN RIVER - MINUTES LATER

           The Colonel’s giving orders from the front. Harrow rushes up 
           to him -- 

                                 HARROW
                        Colonel. 

           Custer looks at him, but doesn’t see him. He’s beyond. Claps 
           Harrow on the shoulder.

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        My rock. The man we need. 
                             (beat)
                        What is it? 

           Harrow draws in a breath -- ready to say something -- but all 
           that comes out...

                                 HARROW
                        ...We’re ready sir. 
                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                             (glint in his eye)
                        That’s what I wanted to hear. 

           Harrow trots over to his column, while the Custers take their 
           positions. Suddenly, the ground begins to shake. 

           The SWARMING ARMY of Lakota Sioux charge their way. A sonic 
           wall of BATTLE CRIES arrive.

           Harrow looks to the Colonel, who shows no signs of the fear 
           that their men are showing. He just raises his saber and --

                                 COLONEL CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        Garryowen!

                                 MEN
                        Garryowen!

           And with that, they charge. 

           EXT. SUPPLY CARAVAN - SAME TIME

           Autie Reed is alone, back with the supplies. As a civilian, 
           he isn’t allowed in battle.

           He perks up when the sounds of the Sioux charge reach him 
           from far away. 

           As he tries to listen to the battle, he’s distracted by the 
           sounds of someone entering a supply cart. He takes out his 
           pistol. 

                                 AUTIE
                        Who’s there? 
                             (then, scared)
                        This camp is the property of the 
                        Seventh cavalry of the United 
                        States Army --

                                 PORTER (O.S.)
                        Put down that gun before you hurt 
                        yourself.

           Porter emerges from behind some tents. 

                                 AUTIE
                        What are you doing here?

           No response.

                                 AUTIE (CONT’D)
                        ...You’re deserting. Again. 
                                 PORTER
                        I’m saving myself. There’s a 
                        difference.

           Autie levels his pistol at Porter.

                                 AUTIE
                        You’re a coward.

                                 PORTER
                             (shaking his head)
                        I’m just the only person left with 
                        any sense in this whole unit.

                                 AUTIE
                        You should be ashamed to call 
                        yourself a soldier. 

                                 PORTER
                        If you’re so brave, why don’t you 
                        go join your family.

           A moment of silence. Sounds of the din can be heard in the 
           distance. 

                                 PORTER (CONT’D)
                        That’s your battle out there. Not 
                        mine. 

           Autie looks at him. Lowers the gun. Then sprints to the last 
           remaining horses. Unties and mounts one.

           We watch him gallop towards the fray from Porter’s 
           perspective. After Autie fades into the distance, Porter 
           walks over to the horses and grabs one for himself. 

           Then takes off in the opposite direction as the battle. 

           Back east. Towards home. 

           EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER FROM THE BATTLE - MOMENTS LATER

           The band continues to play, even though the regiment is out 
           of earshot and the din of the charge is drowning out the 
           music.

           Vinatieri looks to Lord, stationed next to him, who nods. 

                                 VINATIERI
                        Alright men. 

           The music peters out. 
                                 VINATIERI (CONT’D)
                        Instruments away, we’ll need all 
                        hands on deck. 

           Patton jumps forward. 

                                 PATTON
                        We’re joining the fight?!

                                 VINATIERI
                        No.
                             (gestures to Lord)
                        We’ll be medics for the wounded. 
                        Dr. Lord?

           Lord gestures to his supply caravan. 

                                 LORD
                        We’ll need to set up operating 
                        tables and treatment tents. If you 
                        could all just lend a hand...

           The musicians put down their instruments, and begin unloading 
           materials. 

           Patton stares at the battle unfolding just across the river 
           as he begins to help Lord and the others. 

           Meanwhile --

           EXT. BATTLE - SAME TIME

           Harrow leads his men in their charge. Seen from above, it 
           looks like a small droplet of blue is about to be swallowed 
           in the maw of some great beast. 

           The battle begins. 

           Harrow slashes a SIOUX FIGHTER in front of him. The fighter 
           falls dead beside his horse. He surveys the battle in the 
           midst of the chaos. 

                                 DORMAN
                        Harrow!

           Harrow spots Dorman about 10 feet away. Dorman is dragged off 
           his horse by a team of FOUR SIOUX WARRIORS. 

           Harrow kicks his horse, and charges towards Dorman. 

           As the battle rages around them, Harrow reaches Dorman. 
           Harrow swings wildly, injuring three of the Sioux. The last 
           one retreats. Harrow helps to pull Dorman to his feet. 
                                 DORMAN (CONT’D)
                        We have to fall back. They’ve 
                        nearly surrounded us. 

           Harrow spins, searching for Colonel Custer. 

           Harrow finally spots him about a hundred yards away, swinging 
           at any Sioux within reach. Caught up in a bloodthirsty rage.

           EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER - SAME TIME

           Patton watches the battle and feels powerless as he sees the 
           Sioux surround their men.

                                 AUTIE (O.S.)
                        Where is my uncle?

           Vinatieri and Lord look -- Autie Reed arriving from the east. 

           Lord points to the battle across the river. 

           Without a second’s hesitation, Autie takes off towards the 
           fight. 

           Patton’s eyes go wide. Turns to Lord and Vinatieri. 

                                 PATTON
                        We have to go with him.

                                 VINATIERI
                        We can’t do that.

                                 PATTON
                             (to the whole band)
                        They need every last one of us!

                                 VINATIERI
                        We’re not soldiers, Patton. 

                                 PATTON
                        But we can be today.

           He takes out his saber, determined. 

           The band looks to him. Slowly, they all follow suit. 

           Lord and Vinatieri share a look of resignation. They both 
           pick up rifles. 

           The men are ready. Patton looks to Vinatieri.
                                 VINATIERI
                        What are you looking at me for?
                        Give the command.

           Patton draws in a breath. Then yells --

                                 PATTON
                        GARRYOWEN!

           He charges. The rest follow. 

           EXT. BATTLE - SAME TIME

           Harrow rides quickly through the battle to Colonel Custer. 
           Harrow reaches him as the Colonel DECAPITATES the warrior 
           he’s fighting. 

                                 HARROW
                        We need to fall back across the 
                        river!

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        We stay. 

           Colonel Custer dispatches another Sioux with a stab through 
           the chest. Wrenches his blade back out, and the man falls. 

                                 HARROW
                        They’re flanking us. We’ll be 
                        surrounded in moments!

                                 DORMAN (O.S.)
                        We need help!

           EXT. ELSEWHERE, BATTLE - SAME TIME

           We move to where Dorman fights. 

           He’s next to Younghawk, who has abandoned his dead horse and 
           is fighting on foot. They’re being overrun. 

           Dorman dismounts, and the two of them go back to back as 
           about sixty SIOUX surround them -- 

           THUNK. 

           A thrown tomahawk buries itself in Younghawk’s skull. 

           The scout falls dead. 
           Dorman spins around. Tries to jump back on his horse, but one 
           of the Sioux grabs his leg. He’s pulled down and SLASHED from 
           shoulder to crotch. 

           Blood sprays out of his exposed lung. He falls to the ground. 
           Resting in a sitting position against Younghawk’s dead horse. 

           His breaths are short and panting. 

           The Sioux aren’t attacking him. They are letting him sit 
           there. Dorman looks up as a powerfully-built, older chieftain 
           approaches -- this is SITTING BULL. 

           Sitting Bull walks up to Dorman. Kneels down. 

                                 SITTING BULL
                        Like grasshoppers. 

           Sitting Bull gestures to one of his deputies, who brings a 
           canteen. He gives it to Dorman who drinks deeply. 

           Dorman nods in thanks. Sitting Bull takes back the canteen. 
           Stands. Looks down at Dorman --

           Who’s slumped over. Dead. 

           EXT. BATTLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Back with Harrow, now --

                                 VOICES
                        GARRYOWEN!

           Harrow spins to see Patton, Autie, Lord and the band charging 
           out of the river. The reinforcements provide a surprise boost 
           as they crash into the Sioux lines. 

           A surge of momentum. Harrow turns to Colonel Custer --

                                 HARROW
                        Sir! We have a chance! We have to 
                        retreat now!

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                             (yelling at the Sioux)
                        Give it up! There are not enough 
                        Indians in the world to defeat the 
                        Seventh!

           The band fights alongside the remaining soldiers, but Harrow 
           sees --

           It’s hopeless. 
           We see Vinatieri go down, speared on all sides, old and 
           overmatched. 

           Patton is fighting valiantly, but nearly surrounded. 

           Autie Reed gets shot in the leg, falls off his horse. 

           Tom Custer sees this, and immediately charges over. 

                                 TOM CUSTER
                        AUTIE!

           Tom gallops through the Sioux, SLASHING HIS SABER left and 
           right. He’s cut a path of fifteen men by the time he reaches 
           his nephew --

           But he’s too late. Autie’s already dead. 

                                 TOM CUSTER (CONT’D)
                        NOOOOOOO!

           Tom lets loose a guttural scream. He’s a sight to behold. 

           The Sioux fire arrows into Tom, but he doesn’t fall, even as 
           they pierce him through the shoulder, through his leg, and 
           through his stomach... 

           With arrows protruding from him, Tom charges headfirst into 
           the Sioux line. 

           He manages to get about ten feet before his horse is killed. 

           Even as it falls sideways, trapping his leg underneath its 
           full dead weight, Tom continues to fight on the ground. 
           Swinging at anything that gets close. 

           He kills still more Sioux before finally being disarmed.

           He tries to use his bare hands, fighting ‘til the last, but 
           then he’s stabbed. Over and over and over again.

           EXT. ELSEWHERE, BATTLE - SAME TIME

           Harrow and Colonel Custer are fighting next to each other. 
           Harrow continues to plead --

                                 HARROW
                        We’ve lost the battle! We have to 
                        retreat! 

           They hack through more men. 
                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        You have to give the order. 

           A moment. The Colonel turns to him. His resolve is absolute. 

                                 COLONEL CUSTER
                        I’ll never give that order. 

           And he turns back to the fight. 

           Harrow is stunned for a moment. But then realizes --

           There’s only one way to save what’s left of the men.

           He CHARGES AT COLONEL CUSTER -- 

           Takes out HIS KNIFE --

           Lets out a PRIMAL ROAR --

           And with a forceful STAB to the side, Harrow buries his knife 
           INTO THE COLONEL.  

           Colonel Custer falls. Betrayal and shock on his face, and the 
           Sioux descend on him. 

           Harrow turns, now in command --

                                 HARROW
                        The Colonel has fallen! RETREAT! 

           Boston, fighting nearby, sees Colonel Custer’s body. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                             (echoing Harrow)
                        Retreat!

                                 LORD/PATTON
                        Retreat!

                                 HARROW
                        With me!

           Harrow jumps on his horse and begins to ride towards the 
           river. The surviving soldiers racing after him. 

           As they sprint, gallop, and fight their way out of the 
           battle, Lord glances over his shoulder. Stops. Turns --

           And we see Moving Robe among the Sioux, bearing down on him. 

           She cuts a path through the battle, finally reaching Lord. 
           Lord looks at her, pleading, and she DECAPITATES HIM with a 
           quick strike. Keeps moving without a second glance. 
           Boston and Harrow lead the remaining men. They’re almost to 
           the river. 

                                 BOSTON CUSTER
                        Go! I’ll buy some time --

           Harrow nods, forges across the river with the remnants of the 
           unit. When he reaches the other side he turns back to see 
           Boston, swarmed.

           Boston takes a few shots before being cut down in seconds. 

                                 HARROW
                             (to the men)
                        Keep going! Retreat!

           He looks to the river and sees --

           Patton. Waist deep. Nearly across. But facing the fight. 
           Harrow’s heart drops.

                                 HARROW (CONT’D)
                        PATTON! KEEP GOING! YOU’RE ALMOST 
                        ACROSS!

                                 PATTON
                             (calling back)
                        I’m gonna die a soldier!

           He faces the whole Sioux army. Three thousand strong surge 
           across the Little Bighorn. 

           He fights bravely for a moment, before succumbing.

                                 HARROW
                        NO!!!

           Harrow looks around. Sees the rest of his men falling. 

           He looks east. Behind him, the open plains...

           But he turns back to the battle. 

           There’s no one left. 

           He watches the wave of Sioux racing towards him.

           Then lets his saber drop. 

           It clatters to the ground. 

           He dismounts his horse and goes to his knees. 

           The Sioux reach him. Cut him down. No ceremony, no honor...
           Just the last man to fall. 

           EXT. MAJOR RENO’S CAMP, FIFTY MILES SOUTH - SAME TIME

           Without sound, we see Sheridan come racing into the camp. He 
           charges straight up to MAJOR RENO. With frantic energy, we 
           see Sheridan appeal, gesturing north. Reno shakes his head.

           EXT. PLAINS - THAT NIGHT

           Sheridan lies on his back. Staring up at the stars.

           EXT. PLAINS - MORNING

           Reno’s men pack their tents under Sheridan’s supervision.

           EXT. PLAINS - NEXT FEW DAYS

           Reno’s men slowly plod north. Sheridan leads the caravan, a 
           look of dread on his face. Afraid of what he might find.

           EXT. “LAST STAND HILL”, LITTLE BIG HORN RIVER - DAYS LATER

           We slowly pan over the battlefield. It’s stained red with 
           blood. The landscape is so littered with dead bodies that the 
           normally smooth rolling hills appear rocky and jagged. 

           Sheridan is the first to arrive. The entirety of Major Reno’s 
           regiment fanned out behind him.

           There is hardly a patch of grass not covered by a mutilated 
           corpse. But the Sioux are gone. 

           Sheridan steps over bodies, searching. 

           Finally he stops walking. He’s found what he was looking for. 

           He sinks down next to the body of his friend.

                                 SHERIDAN
                        Will.

           From the distance we hear --

                                 YOUNG PRIVATE (O.S.)
                        He’s over here!

           Sheridan looks across the river. A group of men gathered.
           He gets up. Crosses the river. Finally reaches the throng.

           He pushes through, the soldiers part for him. He gets to the 
           center.

                                 YOUNG PRIVATE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Captain Sheridan knew him! Give 
                        them some space.

           The men step back, allowing Sheridan a moment alone with --

           Colonel Custer. In death, he looks like everyone else. 
           Scared. Vulnerable. Powerless.

           Sheridan looks down. Something catches his eye. 

           HARROW’S KNIFE. Still stuck in Colonel Custer’s side. 
           Sheridan sees it. Recognizes it. Tears fill his eyes. 

           He kneels down and stares at the knife...

           Then discretely pulls it out, and pockets it.  

           Stands up. Straightens his back. And we --

           CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
