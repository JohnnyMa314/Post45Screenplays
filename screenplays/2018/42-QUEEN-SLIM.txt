                                   Lena D. Waithe
           INT. DINER - NIGHT (SOMEWHERE IN OHIO) 

           We’re in the kind of place that feels like everyone should 
           know your name. But they don’t. Families frequent this spot 
           when they’ve fallen on hard times. It’s practically empty on 
           this boring Thursday. SERVERS drop off hot plates while 
           ELDERLY PEOPLE sip cheap coffee at the counter. 

           Our focus is directed toward a BLACK MAN and a BLACK WOMAN 
           sitting in a small booth in the back. 

           The MAN: has a slender frame and a laid back demeanor. He’s 
           not a fan of rocking the boat or ruffling feathers, but he 
           ain’t no punk either. For the purpose of this story we’ll 
           call him SLIM. 

           The WOMAN: She’s regal as fuck, and sometimes that causes her 
           to look down on peasants. She’s not an easy laugh and she’s 
           always waiting for the other shoe to drop. For the purposes 
           of this story, we’ll call her QUEEN. 

           Not unlike most first dates there are long silences and 
           forced small talk. 

           The WAITRESS quickly drops off their food and walks away 
           without uttering a word. Queen examines the spread. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Didn’t you ask for scrambled eggs?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah. 

           She clocks the two sunny side up eggs on his plate. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        It’s all good. 

                                 QUEEN
                        No, it’s not. 

                                 SLIM
                        It’s just eggs. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I have a thing about that. 

                                 SLIM
                        Eggs?

                                 QUEEN
                        No, about people not doing their 
                        job well.
                                 SLIM
                        She’s got four kids and an 
                        alcoholic husband at home. She’s 
                        doing the best she can. 

                                 QUEEN
                        How do you know that?

                                 SLIM
                        She comes through my line every 
                        Sunday, yelling at her kids and 
                        giving me a stack of coupons. She 
                        can never find her Costco card so I 
                        always let her use mine so she can 
                        get the discount.

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s nice of you.   

                                 SLIM
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know, can you?

                                 SLIM
                        May I ask you something?

                                 QUEEN
                        Sure. 

                                 SLIM
                        What took you so long to respond? 

                                 QUEEN
                        I didn’t realize that much time had 
                        passed.

                                 SLIM
                        I sent you a very well crafted 
                        message three weeks ago. I spell 
                        checked it and everything and got 
                        crickets. Then today, out of the 
                        blue, you hit me up asking if I 
                        wanna grab dinner. What changed? 

                                 QUEEN
                        I had a shitty day. 

                                 SLIM
                        What was so shitty about it?
                                 QUEEN
                        The state decided to execute my 
                        client. 

           Queen says that as if she were giving someone the logline to 
           her least favorite movie. 

           In an instant Slim loses his appetite. 

                                 SLIM
                        I didn’t even know that was still 
                        legal. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It is in 31 states. And Ohio 
                        happens to be one of ‘em. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m sorry.

                                 QUEEN
                        Me too. 
                             (then)
                        Normally, I’d just go home and have 
                        a glass of wine. But I didn’t feel 
                        like being alone. Not tonight.  

           Slim can’t tell if this is a cry for help or a proposition. 

                                 SLIM
                        You didn’t have any friends or 
                        family you could call? 

                                 QUEEN
                        No. 

                                 SLIM
                        So you turned to Tinder?

                                 QUEEN
                        What’s wrong with that?  

                                 SLIM
                        A lot of things. 

           Slim sips his soda. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you pick me? 

                                 QUEEN
                        I liked your profile picture.  
                                 SLIM
                        Word?

                                 QUEEN
                        You had this sad look on your face. 
                        I felt sorry for you. 

                                 SLIM
                        Damn. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I didn’t mean for that to sound 
                        shady. 

                                 SLIM
                        Well it did. 

           Then -- 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        My dad took that picture of me. It 
                        was the same day my girlfriend left 
                        me for a dude with a better car. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Then why’d you make it your profile 
                        picture? 

                                 SLIM
                        Cause I don’t have that many photos 
                        of myself. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Why not?

                                 SLIM
                        I know what I look like. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Pictures aren’t just about vanity. 
                        They’re proof of your existence. 

                                 SLIM
                        My mother and father know I’m here.  
                        That’s enough. 

           The idea of not having to prove oneself to the world is so 
           foreign to Queen it renders her speechless. 

           In the midst of her silence - Slim clocks her untouched 
           Caesar Salad. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Are you gonna eat that?
                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah, I just haven’t gotten to it 
                        yet. I’m a slow eater. 

                                 SLIM
                        I see. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You can have some. 

           Slim eats off Queen’s plate as if this were a third date 
           rather than their first. 

                                 SLIM
                        They always use just the right 
                        amount of dressing. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you really like this place or is 
                        it the only spot you could afford? 

                                 SLIM
                        It’s black owned. 

           She wasn’t expecting that answer. Queen can appreciate this 
           small token of righteousness. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Too bad they couldn’t get your 
                        order right. 

                                 SLIM
                        White restaurants fuck up too.  

                                 QUEEN
                        Touché. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - AN HOUR LATER

           Slim tries to create a vibe by playing some neo-soul music. 
           Which is regular soul music with a hint of patchouli.  

           He keeps looking down at his phone. Checking the directions. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You shouldn’t text and drive. 

                                 SLIM
                        Ain’t nobody texting. I’m making 
                        sure I don’t get lost. 
           She grabs Slim’s phone from his lap.  

                                 QUEEN
                        I can tell you how to get to my 
                        hotel. 

                                 SLIM
                        Give me my phone!

                                 QUEEN
                        Relax. I’m gonna give it back. 

                                 SLIM
                        You gon’ tell me where to turn?

                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah. 

           Queen points left. 

                                 SLIM
                        Oh so now you gon’ point the 
                        directions?

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m telling you where to go. 

           Slim is visibly annoyed. Queen starts sifting through his 
           Apple Music library. Queen sees that HE’S CREATED A PLAYLIST 
           FOR THEIR CAR RIDE TO AND FROM THE RESTAURANT. This amuses 
           her. Slim notices she’s uncovered his secret. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why you going through my playlists 
                        and shit? 

           She smiles.

                                 QUEEN
                        Did you like “In a Sentimental 
                        mood” before or after “Love Jones”?  

                                 SLIM
                        I knew about that shit way before 
                        “Love Jones.” 

                                 QUEEN
                        Don’t lie. 

                                 SLIM
                        Okay - I fucked with it more after 
                        I saw the movie. 
                                 QUEEN
                        I appreciate your honesty. 

           Then --

                                 SLIM
                        What you doing tomorrow?  

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m packing my bags and getting the 
                        fuck outta here. 

                                 SLIM
                        You just gon’ leave?

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s what usually happens when 
                        I’m done with a case. I pack up and 
                        go find another one. 

                                 SLIM
                        What kind of life is that?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know, but it’s mine. 

                                 SLIM
                        So what happens tonight?

                                 QUEEN
                        You’re gonna drop me off and you’ll 
                        go home, I guess. 

                                 SLIM
                        Oh.

                                 QUEEN
                        Did you think we were gonna have 
                        sex?

           Slim is embarrassed. 

                                 SLIM
                        No. I don’t know. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I needed some company, but not that 
                        kind. 

           Slim takes his phone back from Queen causing him to SWERVE a 
           bit. Then he SWITCHES LANES without signaling. 

           Just as he starts to pick up speed. He hears a horrifying 
           sound. WOOP WOOP. Every black person’s worst nightmare. 
           We hear a robotic voice muffled through a loud speaker: “Pull 
           over. That corner right there.” 

           Slim’s heart starts to race. Queen’s heart beats at its usual 
           speed. 

           The POLICE OFFICER steps out of his car and makes his way to 
           Slim’s door.  

           He motions for Slim to roll down his window. He does. 

           The Police Officer aims the light directly in Slim’s eyes.   
           Slim quickly shields his face so he can see what’s in front 
           of him.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Put your hand down. 

           He does as he’s told. 

                                 QUEEN
                        He only had it up because you were 
                        shining a light in his eyes. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I’m just trying to see inside the 
                        vehicle. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It’s just us. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        License and registration. 

           Slim reaches for his wallet. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m grabbing my wallet. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I can see that.  

                                 QUEEN
                             (under her breath)
                        Well, y’all like to shoot first and 
                        ask questions later. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Do you have something you wanna say 
                        to me? 

                                 QUEEN
                        No, sir. 
           Slim hands over his license. Slowly. As he reaches over to 
           rummage through his glove compartment his hand accidentally 
           grazes Queen’s thigh. He’s not being fresh. Just nervous. He 
           finally finds his crumpled up registration and hands it over. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Do you know why I pulled you over?

                                 SLIM
                        No, sir. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You forgot to use your signal back 
                        there. And you swerved a bit. 

           Queen shakes her head. 

                                 SLIM
                        Oh, my bad. 

           The Police Officer takes Slim’s license and registration and 
           slowly walks back to his squad car. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The Police Officer talks to his DISPATCHER. 

           On his dashboard we see a PHOTO. It’s a picture of his WIFE 
           and KIDS.

           The Kids are TWIN BOYS. They both have blonde hair and green 
           eyes. They’re completely unaware of how privileged their 
           lives will be simply because they were born white and male. 

           The Wife is a bored brunette whose dreams are no bigger than 
           her backyard. 

                                 DISPATCHER
                        Whattya got?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Black male. Mid-twenties. He’s with 
                        a black female early thirties. He 
                        changed lanes without signaling. He 
                        seemed to be driving a little 
                        erratically. 

                                 DISPATCHER
                        Is he under the influence?
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        I don’t know yet. I might have him 
                        do a breathalyzer just to be safe.  

                                 DISPATCHER
                        Let me know if you need anything. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Will do. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLIM'S CAR - NIGHT - SAME TIME

           Slim and Queen sit in silence while they wait for the Police 
           Officer to return. 

           They look like two children awaiting their punishment. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you have any warrants?

                                 SLIM
                        Really? 

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you?

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, I ain’t got no warrants.

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you have any weapons in the car? 
                        Any narcotics?

                                 SLIM
                        I got a pocket knife in the glove 
                        compartment. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s fine. 

                                 SLIM
                        I know it is. 

           The Officer finally walks back to the car. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Will you step out of the vehicle, 
                        please?
                                 QUEEN
                             (under her breath)
                        Shit.

                                 SLIM
                        May I ask why, Officer?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        No you may not. Can you step out of 
                        the car?

           Before he gets out of the car Queen and Slim lock eyes. He 
           doesn’t know Queen very well, but he can tell she has the 
           spirit of Nat Turner wrestling inside of her. 

           Slim steps out and puts his hands on the roof of the car. The 
           Police Officer proceeds to search him, aggressively. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        You got any sharp objects in your 
                        pockets I should know about?

                                 SLIM
                        No, sir. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Any illegal substances?

                                 SLIM
                        No, sir. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        What about in the vehicle?

                                 SLIM
                        No, sir. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLIM’S CAR - PASSENGER SEAT - SAME TIME

           Queen’s left knee bounces uncontrollably. Her chest goes up 
           and down. 

           She plays with her phone. Spinning it around. Flipping it in 
           between her dainty fingers. She’s trying to distract herself. 

           Queen looks in the rearview mirror and sees the Police 
           Officer interrogating Slim on the side of the road. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The Police Officer finishes patting Slim down. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Have you been drinking tonight?

                                 SLIM
                        No. 

           Slim laughs. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Why is that funny? 

                                 SLIM
                        Cause I don’t drink. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Do me a favor, pop the trunk. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Because I asked you to.

           Slim hesitates. 

                                 SLIM
                        Ain’t nothing in there but some 
                        shoe boxes.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Let’s see ‘em.  

                                 SLIM
                        Okay. 

           Queen HONKS the horn in an effort to get the Police Officer’s 
           attention. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Can I help you?

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you have a warrant?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Ma’am, he’s already agreed to the 
                        search. So I don’t need one.  

           Slim pops the trunk. 
           He was telling the truth. The only thing in his trunk are a 
           bunch of sneakers. Consumerism is his only vice. 

           Slim feels vindicated and violated at the same time. 

                                 SLIM
                        Told you. 

                                 QUEEN (O.S.)
                        Can we go now? 

           The Officer’s cheeks turn bright red. 

           He starts opening all the boxes one by one. He’s hoping he’ll 
           find something, but he doesn’t. 

           Slim goes to close the trunk, which startles the Officer. He 
           PULLS OUT HIS GUN and AIMS IT AT HIM. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Don’t make any sudden moves!

           Slim raises his hands. 

                                 SLIM
                        I was just closing the trunk. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Get on the ground and put your 
                        hands behind your back. 

                                 SLIM
                        Are you serious?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Now! 

           Slim does as he’s told. 

           The Officer keeps the gun pointed at the back of Slim’s head. 
           Slim looks like he’s about to cry. 

           Queen can’t take this anymore. She GETS OUT OF THE CAR. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Is he under arrest?

           The Officer turns around and AIMS HIS GUN AT HER. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Ma’am, get back in the vehicle!

           He then tilts his head and talks into his walkie. 
                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        This is Officer Reed requesting 
                        back up. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Officer, I can assure you I’m not a 
                        threat to you and neither is my 
                        date.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Ma’am if you don’t get back in the 
                        car I’m gonna have to arrest you 
                        too.

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m happy to get back in the car, 
                        but would you mind telling me why 
                        you’re arresting him? 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Get back in the vehicle now!

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m reaching for my cell phone --

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Keep your hands where I can see 
                        them!!

                                 QUEEN
                        I have the right to record this 
                        arrest. 

           Queen REACHES in her pocket. 

           Officer Reed AIMS HIS GUN AT HER and FIRES OFF TWO SHOTS. 
           BOOM! BOOM!

           The first shot misses her, but the SECOND SHOT PIERCES HER 
           STOMACH. She collapses to the ground. And hits her head on 
           the pavement hard. 

           Slim SCREAMS for her. He tries to stand, but Officer Reed 
           SLAMS his chest against the pavement. 

           Officer Reed and Slim roll around on the ground for a few 
           seconds. Until Officer Reed finally pins Slim to the ground 
           and points the gun at his face. 

                                 OFFICER REED
                        Don’t move! 

           Officer Reed sees Queen trying to get up. He points his gun 
           at her again, but Slim quickly KNOCKS it out of his hand.
           When the gun goes flying - Officer Reed reaches for it. Slim 
           reaches for it as well and luckily gets to it first. 

           Queen is on the side of the road gasping for air. 

           When Slim turns around he sees Officer Reed LUNGING toward 
           him. 

           Slim fires the gun. BOOM. Slim shoots Officer Reed in the 
           chest. Killing him instantly.  

           Queen muffles her own scream. 

           Officer Reed’s lifeless body lies on the pavement. A pool of 
           blood quickly forms around him. 

           Queen applies pressure to her fresh wound and slowly rises to 
           her feet. Slim gets up and runs to her side.  

                                 SLIM
                        Oh fuck. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I think I’ll be okay. 

           She clocks the dead Police Officer.

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

                                 SLIM
                        No. 

           Slim puts Queen’s arm around his neck. Helping her stand.

           She uses her free hand to take the gun from Slim and gently 
           shoves it in his pants. 

           It’s his gun now. 

           Queen turns to face Officer Reed’s squad car. The headlights 
           are still on. Giving the small CAMERA on the DASHBOARD a 
           perfect view of her face. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Let’s go. 

           Slim looks at her for a long beat. 

                                 SLIM
                        We just gon’ leave him here?

                                 QUEEN
                        Yes. We have to leave now.  
           Slim walks Queen back to the car. The engine is still 
           purring. He helps her into the passenger seat. 

           Slim walks around to the other side and gets in the driver’s 
           seat. Still in shock. 

           As they drive off into the darkness all we hear is the static 
           filled radio coming from the squad car. 

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Officer Reed? Officer Reed, do you 
                        still need back up? Officer Reed, 
                        do you copy?

           As we hear sirens far off in the distance, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           OPENING CREDITS

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Slim drives faster than his car is used to going. No music is 
           playing. They’re no longer wrapping up a date. Now they’re 
           fugitives, on the run. And one of them is wounded. 

           Slim has no idea where they’re going. Neither does Queen. 
           He’s just driving. Aimlessly. 

                                 SLIM
                        You’re bleeding a lot. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’ll be okay. 

           Slim looks at her wound. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. Everything is gonna be 
                        okay. 

                                 SLIM
                        How?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know. 

                                 SLIM
                        You should’ve stayed your ass in 
                        the car. 
                                 QUEEN
                        So this is my fault?

                                 SLIM
                        You should’ve just let me handle 
                        it. 

                                 QUEEN
                        If I didn’t interject you’d be dead 
                        right now. 

           Slim SLAMS his hands down on the steering wheel. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m definitely not getting into 
                        heaven now.  

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s what you’re worried about?

                                 SLIM
                        Where we going?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know. Just keep driving. 

           The severity of what they did starts to sink in. 

                                 SLIM
                        Fuck! We have to get you to a 
                        hospital. 

                                 QUEEN
                        No! They’ll arrest us. We can’t. 

                                 SLIM
                        Then here -- take my jacket at 
                        least. 

           He takes off his jacket and hands it to her. She balls it up 
           and presses it against her lower abdomen. It hurts like hell. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Shiiiiit! 

           Slim says “okay” a million times. He goes to pull over. Queen 
           stops him. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t pull over! We can’t give the 
                        cops a chance to catch up to us. 
                                 SLIM
                        Look, get the pocket knife from my 
                        glove compartment and try to get 
                        the bullet out. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Hell no. 

                                 SLIM
                        You have to. I also have a small 
                        bottle of bourbon under the seat. 

           She looks at him with judgmental eyes. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I thought you didn’t drink. 

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t. My cousin stole that from 
                        a hotel and left it in my car. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I can’t do this. 

                                 SLIM
                        You don’t have a fucking choice. I 
                        don’t want your blood on my hands 
                        too. 

           She can tell from the base in his voice - he’s serious. Slim 
           reaches over her again and grabs the pocket knife. He hands 
           it to her. 

           Queen takes a big deep breath. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        You’re stronger than you think. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I think I’m pretty fucking strong. 

           Queen lifts Slim’s bloody jacket from her stomach and raises 
           her shirt. Luckily the bullet isn’t that deep. She can see it 
           sitting just below her flesh. Taunting her like white kids 
           used to taunt Ruby Bridges. 

                                 SLIM
                        Are you sure you don’t want me to 
                        pull over?

                                 QUEEN
                        Yes, I’m sure. Just keep driving. 
           She knows the quicker she does this the better. So before 
           Slim can say another word she’s SHOVED the knife into her 
           stomach. 

           She lets out a blood curdling scream. Queen misses the bullet 
           by an inch. 

                                 SLIM
                        Oh my God! 

                                 QUEEN
                        Shut up!

           She tries again. The second scream is even worse. The good 
           news is she gets closer to the bullet. 

           Blood starts to stream down her legs. 

           Slim opens the bourbon and hands it to her. She pours it onto 
           her open wound. This time she bites her lip and tries to 
           sanitize the area. 

           She lifts the half exploded bullet out of her stomach and 
           stares at it.  

                                 SLIM
                        Throw it out the window. 

                                 QUEEN
                        No, it could have my fingerprints 
                        on it.

           Queen puts the bloody bullet in the glove compartment. She 
           picks up Slim’s soaked jacket and puts it back on the wound 
           in an attempt to stop it from bleeding. 

           It doesn’t work. 

                                 SLIM
                        You need some bandages. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Just keep driving. I’ll be fine. 

                                 SLIM
                        You’re the opposite of fine. You 
                        have a hole in your stomach. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I know that. 

                                 SLIM
                        I killed a fucking cop. They gon’ 
                        lynch my ass when they find me.  
                                 QUEEN
                        Then lets make sure they don’t find 
                        us. 

                                 SLIM
                        What if he was wearing a body cam? 
                        Or had a camera in his car. This 
                        shit bout to be all over the 
                        fucking news. 

           Slim grabs his phone. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I gotta call my dad.

           Queen snatches his phone and tosses it out the window. She 
           chucks hers as well. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?

                                 QUEEN
                        We can’t call anybody. It’ll make 
                        them accomplices. 

                                 SLIM
                        You could’ve just said that shit. 
                        Now we ain’t got no phones. 

                                 QUEEN
                        A cellphone is nothing but a 
                        tracking device anyway.  

           Slim is shell shocked as Queen tries to take deep breaths. 

                                 SLIM
                        I feel like I’m about to throw up. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Please don’t. Cause if you throw up 
                        then I’m gonna throw up and it’s 
                        gonna get real ugly up in here. 

           Slim leans his head out the window. 

           He lets the fresh air wash over his face like Holy Water. It 
           doesn’t wash away his sins, but it does keep his nausea at 
           bay. 

           For now. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET - TWO HOURS LATER

           The car speeds down an empty road. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLIM'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Queen starts to fall asleep while Slim continues to drive. 
           His eyelids are getting heavier by the second.

           The fuel in his car is running low and there’s not a gas 
           station in sight. Eventually exhaustion gets the best of him 
           and he falls asleep at the wheel. 

           He DRIVES THE CAR off the road. Crashing into a ditch. 

           Queen hits her head on the dashboard.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DITCH - NIGHT

           Slim climbs out of the car and checks on her. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What happened?

                                 SLIM
                        I fell asleep. 

           Queen stumbles out of the car, holding her wound, and looks 
           around. They’re on an empty highway. Nothing but grass 
           surrounding them. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna push. 

                                 QUEEN
                        By yourself? 

                                 SLIM
                        You can’t do shit.  

                                 QUEEN
                        When I’m healthy I have pretty good 
                        upper body strength. 

           Slim pushes the car as hard as he can. It doesn’t move. 
           Slim gets in the driver’s seat and tries to drive it out. 
           That doesn’t work, but it does move the car closer to the 
           street. 

           He pushes the car again, this time with more success. 
           Eventually he gets the car back on the road. 

           Queen gets in the driver’s seat this time. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, I’ll drive. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m on e. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’ll drive slow until we see a gas 
                        station.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - AN HOUR LATER

           Queen is driving at a snail’s pace. They don’t see a gas 
           station anywhere. 

                                 QUEEN
                        God dammit. We’re almost out of 
                        gas. 

                                 SLIM
                        Don’t take the Lord’s name in vain. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m sorry. I’m just on the run for 
                        my fucking life, I’ve been shot, 
                        and we’re stuck in the middle of 
                        the nowhere with no phones and I 
                        can’t see shit. 

                                 SLIM
                        You the one that threw our phones 
                        out the window. 

           The car comes to a complete stop. They can no longer ride on 
           fumes. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Let’s get out and walk. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m not going out there. 
                                 QUEEN
                        We can’t just sit here. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m not walking out into the 
                        darkness. 

           They sit there quietly for a beat. Then they see a flash of 
           light. Headlights to be exact. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Okay, we gotta flag this car down. 

                                 SLIM
                        I hope they black. 

                                 QUEEN
                             (to herself)
                        That’s not always a good thing. 

           They both step out of the car. Nervous as hell. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           As the car gets closer and closer, Queen realizes -

                                 QUEEN
                        Oh fuck. It’s a Sheriff’s truck. 

                                 SLIM
                        Dammit.

                                 QUEEN
                        And he’s wearing a cowboy hat. 

           Slim crosses himself. Hoping for the best. 

           The SHERIFF is Mexican. His smile is friendly and his 
           demeanor is warm. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Y’all having car trouble?

                                 QUEEN
                        Uh, yeah, we ran out of gas. 

           The Sheriff then sees Queen is covered in blood. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Ma’am, are you okay? 
                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah, I accidentally cut myself. 

           The Sheriff looks at Slim and wonders if he’s stumbled upon a 
           domestic dispute. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Did he hurt you?

                                 SLIM
                        I would never hurt a woman. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        You cut yourself pretty bad. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I know. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Why don’t you guys hop in my truck? 
                        I’ve got a first aid kit in my 
                        backseat. And there’s a gas station 
                        up the road. I’ll give you a ride. 

                                 SLIM
                        We don’t mind walking. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I do. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Come on. I won’t bite. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHERIFF’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Queen sits in the backseat and bandages herself up. The 
           bleeding has finally stopped oozing out of her. She uses a 
           lot of gauze and tape because she doesn’t know when she’ll be 
           able to re-bandage it. 

           Slim sits up front, sweating bullets. He keeps turning around 
           to look at Queen. 

           He’s worried about her. He’s also scared out of his mind.  

                                 SHERIFF
                        Y’all okay? You seem jumpy. 
                                 QUEEN
                        No, we’re fine. We just made a 
                        wrong turn somewhere and got lost. 

                                 SLIM
                        Where are we?

                                 SHERIFF
                        You’re in Kentucky, my friend, but 
                        don’t worry - we’ll get you some 
                        gas and you’ll be on your way. 
                             (then)
                        How’s your stomach?

                                 QUEEN
                        Much better. Thank you. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           The Sheriff looks at them for a beat. They stare back, 
           confused. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Gas costs money. 

                                 SLIM
                        Oh shit, I left all my stuff in the 
                        car. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Me too. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Y’all are in bad shape. 

                                 SLIM
                        I can pay you back when we get to 
                        the car. 

           The Sheriff takes pity on them and walks into the gas 
           station. 

           We follow him inside. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GAS STATION - COUNTER - CONTINUOUS

           The Sheriff grabs a red jug for the gas to go in and then he 
           walks up to THE CASHIER. 
                                 SHERIFF
                        I need to fill this up. 

                                 CASHIER
                        That’ll be ten bucks. 

           The Sheriff hands him the money. Then he looks out the window 
           and sees Queen and Slim standing by his truck. 

           A VOICE from his walkie gives him an update. 

                                 VOICE
                        A Police Officer was shot and 
                        killed by two assailants. A male 
                        and a female. Both African-
                        American. One of the suspects was 
                        wounded by the officer. They’re 
                        said to be armed and dangerous. 
                        Let’s just keep our eyes open. 

           He stares daggers at Queen and Slim. They can feel his eyes 
           on them. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - SAME TIME

           Queen has her hand on the passenger door. Slim paces back and 
           forth. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Stop pacing. 

                                 SLIM
                        I can’t help it. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You look guilty. 

                                 SLIM
                        I am guilty. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Have you been charged with 
                        something?

                                 SLIM
                        No. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Then you’re not guilty. 
                                 SLIM
                        Why is he staring at us like that?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Cashier hands the Sheriff a receipt. 

                                 CASHIER
                        Do you need anything else?

                                 SHERIFF
                        Hold on a second. 

           He grabs his walkie and talks into it. 

                                 SHERIFF (CONT’D)
                        What kind of car were they in?

                                 VOICE
                        A black hybrid. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Any other info?

                                 VOICE
                        We’re still waiting for the dash 
                        cam footage to come in. 

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 QUEEN
                        Get in the driver’s seat. 

                                 SLIM
                        Are you crazy?

                                 QUEEN
                        Just do it. Quick. 

           Slim hops into the driver’s seat. Queen gets in the passenger 
           side. Before Slim can turn the key - BAM! 

           The Sheriff holds the red jug up to the driver side window. 

           Startling them. 
                                 SHERIFF
                        Were y’all gon’ leave without me?

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, I just wanted to see if this 
                        was a four wheel drive. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        It is, actually. 

                                 SLIM
                        Cool. I’m gonna hop in the backseat 
                        now. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        You do that.

           They all ride in awkward silence. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Thanks for helping us out. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Of course. 

           Then --

                                 SHERIFF (CONT’D)
                        What’d you say your name was?

                                 QUEEN
                        I didn’t. 

           She allows that question to dangle in the air. 

           They pull up to Slim’s BLACK HYBRID. The Sheriff eyes it. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Where y’all coming from?

                        Ohio. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Good state. 

                                 SLIM
                        Yup. 
           Queen and Slim hop out of the car. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Slim starts putting the gas in his tank. 

           Queen and the Sheriff look on. This simple task feels like 
           it’s taking an eternity. 

           Slim hands the Sheriff the jug and gets in the driver’s seat. 
           Queen hops in the passenger side.

           Slim turns the car on. They’re back in business. But before 
           they can pull off the Sheriff leans into the driver side 
           window. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        I thought you were gonna pay me 
                        back. 

                                 SLIM
                        Oh yeah, hold on a sec. 

           Slim reaches for the gun in his pants. He pulls it out with 
           intentions of aiming it at the Sheriff’s head, but it slips 
           out of his hand and accidentally goes off. BOOM!

           Shooting a hole in the floor of his car. 

           The Sheriff GRABS Slim’s arm but he quickly hits him in the 
           face with the gun -- knocking him out. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Oh shit, did you shoot yourself?

                                 SLIM
                        Ahhhh I don’t think so. But what if 
                        I did and I’m in shock?

           Queen pats him down. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You’re not bleeding. I think you’re 
                        okay. 

           He takes a deep breath while the Sheriff lies on the ground 
           moaning. 

           Slim tries to drive off, but Queen stops him. 
                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 SLIM
                        I’m getting us outta here. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We can’t just leave him here. He’ll 
                        call us in the second he wakes up. 

                                 SLIM
                        What do you want me to do, kill 
                        him?

                                 QUEEN
                        No, but you need to threaten him or 
                        something. 

           Slim and Queen get out of the car. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Slim and Queen kneel over The Sheriff. He’s still grabbing 
           his forehead in pain. 

                                 SLIM
                        Will you promise not to tell 
                        anybody you saw us?

                                 SHERIFF
                        I don’t like to make promises I 
                        can’t keep. 

           Queen climbs back into The Sheriff’s truck and finds his 
           wallet. She pulls out his license with his home address on 
           it. 

           She holds the license up to his face. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Is this where you live?

           He doesn’t respond, but judging by the frightened look on his 
           face - it is. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Look, I’m sure whatever happened 
                        with that cop was an accident. 
                        Y’all don’t look like cold blooded 
                        killers to me.
                                 QUEEN
                        What do cold blooded killers look 
                        like?

                                 SHERIFF
                        Just give me the gun and we can 
                        work something out. 

           Slim looks at Queen. He searches for answers in her almond 
           shaped eyes. 

                                 QUEEN
                        They’re trained to make you feel at 
                        ease. It’s their job to convince 
                        you everything will be okay. But 
                        the second you turn over your gun 
                        and confess you become property of 
                        the state. 
                             (then)
                        Is that what you want? You wanna be 
                        the state’s property? 

                                 SLIM
                        Nah. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Okay then. Shoot his ass. 

           He turns to the Sheriff. 

                                 SLIM
                        I can’t kill nobody else. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I din’t tell you to kill him. I 
                        told you to shoot him. 

           Queen grabs the bloody pocket knife and starts SLASHING The 
           Sheriff’s tires. Slim watches her. 

                                 SLIM
                        You look like you’ve done that 
                        before. 

           She cuts her eyes at him. Slim turns to look at The Sheriff. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about this. 

           Slim looks up at the sky. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        God, please forgive me for my sins. 
           Slim aims the gun at the Sheriff’s right foot and shoots him. 

           The Sheriff SCREAMS in agony. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Sorry!! 

           While he screams Slim and Queen hop back in their getaway car 
           and SPEED OFF. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLIM'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Slim is speeding down the highway. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Slow down. If we get pulled over 
                        we’re fucked. 

                                 SLIM
                        We gotta post up somewhere.  

                                 QUEEN
                        I know. 

                                 SLIM
                        You said you were packing up and 
                        leaving town. Where were you going? 

                                 QUEEN
                        To see about my uncle. He lives in 
                        Tennessee. 

                                 SLIM
                        Let’s go there then. 

           Queen doesn’t respond. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        What? You don’t want me to meet 
                        your family?

                                 QUEEN
                        No, that’s not it. It’s just a long 
                        drive. 

                                 SLIM
                        Well, we got plenty of time. You 
                        think we can stay there? 
                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah, but eventually we gotta 
                        figure out a plan. 

                                 SLIM
                        I know. 

           Slim’s mind starts to drift. Queen clocks this. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What are you thinking?

                                 SLIM
                        I’m thinking about that Sheriff. 
                        What if he bleeds out and dies?

                                 QUEEN
                        He won’t. 

                                 SLIM
                        You don’t know that. He could’ve 
                        helped us. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I know how the system works. He 
                        wasn’t going to help us. He was 
                        going to turn us in and have a beer 
                        with his friends to celebrate. We 
                        would’ve been the catch of the day. 

                                 SLIM
                        Do you have some lawyer friends 
                        that can help us? Maybe we can tell 
                        them what happened and they can 
                        defend us. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It’s hard to defend two people that 
                        fled a crime a scene.  

                                 SLIM
                        Even if one of ‘em got shot? 

                                 QUEEN
                        They won’t care. 

                                 SLIM
                        Well, we gotta figure something out 
                        cause I can’t be a fugitive for the 
                        rest of my life. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You don’t have a choice. 
                                 SLIM
                        What if I turn myself in?

                                 QUEEN
                        A black man shoots a police officer 
                        during a routine traffic stop. How 
                        do you think that’s gonna play out? 

           Slim starts to hyperventilate. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        If you wanna turn yourself in be my 
                        guest, but don’t do it with me in 
                        the car. 

                                 SLIM
                        You think we can get away with 
                        this?

                                 QUEEN
                        We can try. 

                                 SLIM
                        That don’t sound too reassuring. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Well, we can either die on our feet 
                        or live on our knees. 

                                 SLIM
                        Both those things sound fucked up. 

           After a long beat. Slim continues to drive. It’s his way of 
           silently agreeing to keep running. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m starting to feel lightheaded. I 
                        need some food. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m hungry too. 

           He sees a few fast food spots up ahead. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll stop at a McDonalds or 
                        something. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s disgusting. 

                                 SLIM
                        Now ain’t the time to be choosey.  
           She rolls her eyes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MCDONALDS DRIVE THRU - FORTY MINUTES LATER

           They both are slouched in their seats, trying not to make eye 
           contact with anyone. Slim grips the steering wheel with both 
           hands. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m just gon’ do it. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What if they recognize you?

                                 SLIM
                        Stop being so scary. 

           She looks at him as he continues to sit there.

                                 QUEEN
                        Why don’t you pull up then?

                                 SLIM
                        Cause I’m scared. 

           Queen looks out the window and spots a few BROWN BOYS failing 
           miserably at skateboard tricks in the parking lot. She sits 
           up in her seat and locks eyes with one of them. 

           He has a lot of meat on his bones and a face covered in 
           freckles. We’ll call him CHUBBY. She WAVES him over. Slim 
           clocks this and freaks out. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        What you doing?

           The BOYS don’t even try to stop Chubby from walking over. 
           They just keep busting their asses on the pavement. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You wanna get some free food and 
                        make a little money?

                                 CHUBBY
                        What’s the catch?

                                 SLIM
                        Ain’t no catch, lil man. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        Aight.
           Queen hands him the last twenty dollar bill from her wallet. 

                                 SLIM
                        Let me get a double cheeseburger 
                        and the ten piece chicken nuggets 
                        with sweet and sour sauce. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’ll have a chicken sandwich with 
                        no condiments and a small fry. Oh 
                        and some waters, please. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        Y’all some picky muthafuckas. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Keep the change. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        Ain’t gon’ be that much left after 
                        all that. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re parked in the Mcdonald’s parking lot. Lights off. Car 
           off. 

           Slim eats fast and loud. Queen eats like a rabbit. She 
           watches him devour his food with a disgusted look on her 
           face. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You make a lot of noise when you 
                        eat. 

                                 SLIM
                        Woman, this could be my last meal - 
                        would you just let me be. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It’s hard for me to eat with you 
                        making so much noise. 

           Slim tries to eat quieter. He fails, but Queen appreciates 
           the gesture. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’ve never heard of someone not 
                        being able to eat because they’re 
                        disgusted by the sounds of other 
                        people eating. 
                                 QUEEN
                        I know it’s weird, but I have a 
                        thing about it. 

                                 SLIM
                        You got a lot of things. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I have two things. Give me a break.  

                                 SLIM
                        I’m sure you got a lot more than 
                        that. 

           She does. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        How do you avoid the sounds of 
                        people eating? 

                                 QUEEN
                        I eat alone most of the time. 

                                 SLIM
                        That’s the saddest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It’s not that bad. 

           Slim finally reaches the point of fullness and stops eating 
           for a second. 

                                 SLIM
                        You scared?

                                 QUEEN
                        Of what?

                                 SLIM
                        Getting caught. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m trying not to think about it. 

                                 SLIM
                        Is that what you tell your clients? 
                        Not to think about it? 

                                 QUEEN
                        I tell them not to have any 
                        expectations. 
                                 SLIM
                        Does it work?

                                 QUEEN
                        No. Nothing prepares you for death. 
                        Even if you’re guilty. 

                                 SLIM
                        You think all your clients are 
                        innocent?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know. That’s between them 
                        and their God. But I think enough 
                        of our ancestors have been killed 
                        over shoddy evidence. And I refuse 
                        to let these states swap out a 
                        southern tree for an electric chair 
                        and call it justice. 

           Queen tosses the rest of her food in the empty McDonald’s 
           bag. She’s not hungry anymore. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get outta here.  

           Slim starts the car. Then he hears -- 

                                 CHUBBY (O.S.)
                        Hey, is this y’all?

           Chubby plays them a video on his phone. It’s the DASH CAM 
           FOOTAGE of Slim shooting Officer Reed in the chest. 

           The video is already up to one hundred thousand views on 
           YouTube. 

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, man. That ain’t us. 

           Slim quickly climbs into the driver’s seat and tries to start 
           the car. Chubby keeps banging on the window. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        Hold on, my dad wanna talk to 
                        y’all.

                                 QUEEN
                        We can’t talk to your dad. 

           Slim finally starts the car. But as soon as he pulls forward 
           he feels an IMPACT. He HIT something. Or someone. 
                                 CHUBBY
                        Daddy!!! 

           Slim and Queen get out of the car and see a TALL LANKY BLACK 
           MAN laying on the ground. Slim goes to touch him, but he 
           flinches. 

                                 SLIM
                        I am so sorry, man. I didn’t see 
                        you. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        You tried to kill my daddy!

                                 QUEEN
                        We didn’t try to kill anybody. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        I told you he wanted to talk to 
                        y’all and you tried to run away. 

           Slim looks up at the kid. 

                                 SLIM
                        Does this look like I’m running? 
                        I’m right here. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Sir, can you move? 

                                 TALL LANKY BLACK MAN
                        I think you hit my bad knee. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        His cartilage is already fucked up 
                        from playing football. 

                                 SLIM
                        Can you move it?

           He tries to and then he SCREAMS in pain. Chubby starts 
           crying. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        You broke my daddy leg!

                                 TALL LANKY BLACK MAN
                        Stop crying like a lil bitch. I’ll 
                        be alright. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        Mommy told you to stop calling me a 
                        lil bitch. 
                                 TALL LANKY BLACK MAN
                        Nigga, I’ll call you whatever the 
                        fuck I want. I made yo fat ass. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        Y’all gotta take him to the 
                        hospital. 

                                 QUEEN
                        No, we don’t. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        So I can get y’all food, but you 
                        can’t take my daddy to the 
                        hospital? What if he’s paralyzed?

                                 QUEEN
                        Sir, can you feel your legs?

                                 TALL LANKY BLACK MAN
                        Yeah. 

                                 QUEEN
                        He’s not paralyzed. 

                                 TALL LANKY BLACK MAN
                        Stop calling me, sir. I ain’t no 
                        cop. 

                                 SLIM
                        What’s your name?

                                 TALL LANKY BLACK MAN
                        Get Low. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What’s your real name?

                                 CHUBBY
                        That is his real name. 

           Get Low moans in pain every time he tries to move his leg.

                                 SLIM
                        Yo, where’s the nearest hospital? 

                                 QUEEN
                        We have to get out of here. We 
                        don’t have time for this. 

                                 GET LOW
                        It’s a free clinic up the block. 
                                 QUEEN
                        Can you walk?

                                 SLIM
                        He’s not gonna walk. We’re taking 
                        him. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        It’s the least y’all could do. 

           Queen cuts her eyes at the Chubby kid. 

           They all grab a limb and help Get Low into the backseat of 
           Slim’s car. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLIM'S CAR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Slim drives carefully as to not irritate Get Low’s injury. 
           Chubby holds his dad’s hand the whole way there. 

                                 GET LOW
                        How you doing miss lady? He almost 
                        killed you. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m still alive. 

                                 GET LOW
                        I support what y’all are doing.

                                 QUEEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 GET LOW
                        Killing these crooked ass cops. I 
                        support that shit. We need to take 
                        all these muthafuckas out. 

                                 SLIM
                        That’s not what we’re doing. 

                                 GET LOW
                        I saw the video. I watched that 
                        shit like thirteen times. You shot 
                        the fuck outta that muthafucka. He 
                        deserved that shit. If a nigga shot  
                        my bitch, I’d kill his ass too. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m not his bitch. 
                                 CHUBBY
                        And y’all took his gun. That’s some 
                        gangsta shit right there. 

           Queen and Slim look at each other. Their hearts are racing. 

                                 GET LOW
                        Cop killllaaaaassss!!!

                        No, we’re not. 

                                 GET LOW

                        more. We pulling triggers. Fuck 
                        these cracker ass crackers. 

                                 QUEEN
                        The hospital’s on the left, pull 
                        over. Now!

           Slim swerves into the driveway. 

                                 SLIM
                        Alright. We’re here. 

                                 CHUBBY
                        Y’all gon’ help me with him?

                                 GET LOW
                        Nah, they gotta lay low. It’s 
                        probably cameras all up and through 
                        this bitch. 

           Chubby opens the car door and drapes his dad’s arm around his 
           neck. He stumbles a little bit, but eventually he makes it 
           out and walks up to the sliding doors of URGENT CARE. 

           A NURSE sees Get Low struggling to walk and immediately runs 
           over to assist him. 

           Before Slim can pull off, Get Low turns around and says --

                                 GET LOW (CONT’D)
                        Power to the people. 
           He raises his right fist and limps inside. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - DAWN

           Slim and Queen drive through Kentucky. 

                                 SLIM
                        How long before a helicopter starts 
                        flying over us?

                        We might have to kill somebody else  
                        before that happens.

                        People are thinking we did this 
                        shit on purpose. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I think I know why. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why?

                                 QUEEN
                        The officer you killed shot an 
                        unarmed black man while he was 
                        walking his daughter to school. 

                                 SLIM
                        Are you serious?

                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah, I recognized him when he 
                        leaned in the car. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why didn’t you say something?

                                 QUEEN
                        What was I gonna say? “Oh you’re 
                        the dude that got acquitted for 
                        killing that black dude last year?” 

                                 SLIM
                        Were you fucking with him on 
                        purpose?

                                 QUEEN
                        No! 
                                 SLIM
                        How do I know you’re telling the 
                        truth?

                                 QUEEN
                        Because I don’t lie. 

           Slim looks at her. 

                                 SLIM
                        So you didn’t have a vendetta 
                        against that cop? 

                                 QUEEN
                        I think he should’ve been found 
                        guilty, but I wasn’t sitting at 
                        home figuring out ways to kill him. 

                                 SLIM
                        You just seemed real calm when you 
                        saw he was dead. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’ve been around death my whole 
                        life. It doesn’t scare me. 
                             (then)
                        He also shot my ass. 

                                 SLIM
                        You’re crazy, man. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It should be a sin to call a black 
                        woman crazy. 

                                 SLIM
                        Well, it ain’t one of the ten 
                        commandments. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It should be. 

                                 SLIM
                        You one of those people that thinks 
                        God is a black woman?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t think God is anything. 

                                 SLIM
                        Lord help me. 
                                 QUEEN
                        Are you freaking out cause a non-
                        believer’s in your car?

                                 SLIM
                        I’m freaking out because we don’t 
                        have any money and I need to stop 
                        and get gas again. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It’s not that scary. I told you 
                        what to do. 

                                 SLIM
                        You only saying that cause you 
                        don’t have to do it. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You got this. I believe in you. 

                                 SLIM
                        Don’t patronize me. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I was being serious. 

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t know you that well - so 
                        it’s hard to tell the difference. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Slim stands in front of a TEENAGE WHITE BOY. This is his 
           summer job. And he hates it. 

                                 SLIM
                        Let me get forty on pump nine. 

           The Teenager waits for Slim to hand over the money. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        Where’s the forty bucks? 

           Slim lifts up his shirt and shows the kid his gun. That’s his 
           currency. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY (CONT’D)
                        Is that a .45?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah. 
                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        Can I hold it?

                                 SLIM
                        No, you can’t hold it. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        I’ll pay for your gas if you let me 
                        hold it. 

                                 SLIM
                        Look --

           Slim looks at the kid’s name tag. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Igor. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        That’s not my name. I found this on 
                        the floor in the break room. 

                                 SLIM
                        I can’t be seen passing you a gun 
                        on camera. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        These cameras don’t work. They’re 
                        just there to scare off robbers. 

                                 SLIM
                        What’s something you love? 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        Chili cheese fries. 

                                 SLIM
                        Swear on chili cheese fries that 
                        these cameras don’t work. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        I swear on chili cheese fries with 
                        extra cheese these cameras are 
                        bullshit. 

           Slim takes the gun out of his pants and hands it over. 

           The kid goes from being an innocent Teenager to John Wayne in 
           a matter of seconds. He looks confident and joyful. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY (CONT’D)
                        Why does holding a deadly weapon 
                        make me feel so alive?
                                 SLIM
                        Is that a rhetorical question?

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        What does rhetorical mean?

                                 SLIM
                        It means you don’t really want me 
                        to answer it. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        Then no. It’s not a rhetorical 
                        question. 

           Slim thinks for a beat. 

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t know, man. 

           The Teenager pulls cash out of his pocket and puts it into 
           the register. 

                                 TEENAGE WHITE BOY
                        Safe travels. 

                                 SLIM
                        Can I have my gun back? 

           The Teenager hands it over. And just like that he goes back 
           to being a kid again. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - FIVE HOURS LATER - DUSK

           They arrive in Tennessee. 

           They pull up to a house far off the beaten path. It’s big, 
           but not well kept. This house used to be owned by people who 
           cared for it, but its new inhabitants could care less. 

           Queen BANGS on the door. 

                                 SLIM
                        Damn, why you knocking like you the 
                        police? 

           No answer. She knocks again. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        If you didn’t throw our phones out 
                        the window we could’ve called 
                        first.

                        the window the police would’ve 
                        caught us by now. 

                                 SLIM
                        Touché. 

           Queen keeps knocking. Until a TALL BLACK GIRL, with a fire in 
           her belly and a glimmer in her eye, answers the door. She 
           looks like the romantic interest in every hip hop music video 
           ever made. 

                                 TALL BLACK GIRL
                        Can I help you?

                                 QUEEN
                        Is my uncle here?

                                 TALL BLACK GIRL
                        Who’s your uncle?

                                 QUEEN
                        Don’t play with me. 

           She looks Slim up and down. 

                                 TALL BLACK GIRL
                        Who’s the dude?

                                 QUEEN
                        He’s my friend. 

           That stings. 

           The Tall Black Girl opens the door to let them in. 

                                 TALL BLACK GIRL
                        He in the back.

           INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Queen walks through the house like she owns it. Slim trails 
           behind her. She makes her way down a few hallways, and 
           brushes by GODDESS - a half black, half Asian twenty-
           something girl. There’s no glimmer in her eye - just stars. 

           Her eyes widen as Slim and Queen walk by.

                                 GODDESS
                        Oh shit! It’s them!
           INT. HOUSE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Queen opens the door to find her UNCLE EARL counting money by 
           hand, and there’s a lot of it. Uncle Earl is like Chicken 
           George (if he wasn’t a slave). He’s rocking a red velour 
           track suit and has a well kept Afro. He stands up and looks 
           at Queen. 

           From the look on his face they haven’t seen each other in a 
           while. 

           Uncle Earl puts down the money and walks over to give her a 
           hug. The embrace is one-sided. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Well, if it isn’t the black Bonnie 
                        and Clyde. 

           Earl reaches out to shake Slim’s hand. Earl’s hand is twice 
           the size of his. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know what the news is 
                        saying, but whatever it is - it’s 
                        not true. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You know I don’t fuck with the 
                        news. I keep my ear to the streets. 

                                 QUEEN
                        The streets lie too. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        They know better than to lie to me.  
                        Ya’ll hungry?

           INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Uncle Earl cooks up some creamy shrimp scampi Alfredo. It 
           looks amazing. He makes plates for Slim, Queen, and the two 
           beautiful girls we saw earlier. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I always thought you’d escape this 
                        life without getting shot. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Well, you were wrong. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        It’s rare, but it happens. 
           He leans back. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        Who patched you up?

                        She did. She took the bullet out 
                        with my pocket knife.  

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Strong as hell. Just like her mama. 

           Earl stares at Queen for a long beat. A little too long. 
           Causing her to look away. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        What’s your plan?

                                 QUEEN
                        We’re still figuring that out. 

                                 GODDESS
                        Y’all need to hurry up, cause the 
                        cops looking for y’all. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We know. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        How you gon’ outrun the police?

                                 QUEEN
                        We just need to outsmart them.

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        That ain’t hard to do. Cops are 
                        dumb as shit. 

                                 TALL BLACK GIRL
                        Not all of ‘em. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        She only saying that cause she used 
                        to fuck one of them muthafuckas. 

                                 TALL BLACK GIRL
                        Just cause they’re in a uniform 
                        don’t make ‘em bad people. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Yeah, but that uniform make them 
                        think they better than us. 
                                 GODDESS
                        We wear uniforms too. Only 
                        difference is ours make niggas feel 
                        good.

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Stop talking crazy. 

                                 QUEEN
                        She’s not talking crazy. You just 
                        don’t understand.

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Oh so now I’m dumb? I don’t know 
                        shit? 

           Uncle Earl walks over to Queen and gets in her face. He fixes 
           the collar on her shirt. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        I guess your uniform make you think 
                        you better than us too. 

           He leans in even closer, causing Slim to stand up and push 
           him away. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        You gon’ shoot me too?

           Earl reaches in Slim’s pants and grabs his gun. He aims it at 
           his own chest.  

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        I’m right here. 

           Slim is shook. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        Look at you. Scared as hell. You 
                        ain’t built Ford tough. 

           Queen stands up and takes the gun away from her uncle. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Stop. 

           Uncle Earl chuckles. Goddess walks over and gives Earl a kiss 
           on the lips. 

           And just like that he completely forgets about Slim. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Naomi. 
           The Tall Black Girl has a name. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        Go grab those papers by my bed so 
                        my niece can sign ‘em and be on her 
                        way. 

           Naomi runs to the back. 

                                 GODDESS
                        Do they have to leave after she 
                        signs the papers? 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Hell yeah. The SWAT team probably 
                        on their way to my house right now. 
                        And I don’t want those muscle neck 
                        muthafuckas nowhere near my shit. 

                                 SLIM
                        I doubt they’ll find us out here. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Nigga, please. These cops are like 
                        slave catchers. They can smell a 
                        free black body from miles away. 

           This puts the fear of God in Slim. Earl looks at his empty 
           plate. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        You want some more food, Kunta?

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, I’m good. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You sure? This could be the last 
                        meal you ever eat. 

           Naomi returns holding a stack of papers. Earl hands Queen a 
           pen. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        You know where to sign. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m not signing shit until you 
                        agree to a few things. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Oh shit, here we go. 
                                 QUEEN
                        We need to stay here for a night or 
                        two.

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        A night or two? Which one is it?

                                 QUEEN
                        Two nights. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Fine. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We need some cash. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        How much?

                                 QUEEN
                        Enough to last us for a few days. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        What else? 

                                 QUEEN
                        We need another car. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You can kiss my ass. 

                                 NAOMI
                        He love those cars more than he 
                        love us. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You want me to sign the house over 
                        to you or not?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You always tryna blackmail 
                        somebody. 

           Then --

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        I ain’t got no extra cars laying 
                        around. 

                                 GODDESS
                        What about the cadillac you don’t 
                        drive?
                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Goddess, if you don’t shut the fuck 
                        up. Ain’t there a lap somewhere you 
                        need to be grinding on? 

                                 GODDESS
                        I’m off today. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Did I tell you, you was off?

                                 GODDESS
                        No. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Then go make yourself useful. 

           She grabs her plate and leaves. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you agree to my terms or not?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I’m not giving you no car. 

           Uncle Earl picks out his afro, defiantly. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You owe me. 

           Those three words stab him in his stomach. Slim tries to read 
           the situation, but can’t make sense of it.

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You sure this how you want me to 
                        pay you back? 

                                 QUEEN
                        Yes. I’m sure. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Fine. You got it. 

           And with that Queen picks up the pen and starts initialing 
           every other page. As soon as she’s done she hands the papers 
           to Naomi. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           Queen nods. 
                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        You need to figure out what you 
                        gon’ do when you leave here. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We will. 

           Earl looks at Slim. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        She talk for both of y’all?

                                 QUEEN
                        Don’t do that. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I just wanna know what the nigga’s 
                        thinking. Cause he look kinda slow 
                        to me. 

                                 SLIM
                        We should go to Cuba. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Now we talking! Ain’t that where 
                        Assata went after she killed that 
                        state trooper?   

                                 QUEEN
                        Allegedly killed. 

                                 SLIM
                        We just gotta keep driving until we 
                        get to Miami and then --

                                 QUEEN
                        And then we’ll be standing in front 
                        of a very large body of water. How 
                        are we supposed to cross that?

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t know yet. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Of course not. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You got a better idea? 

                                 QUEEN
                        What about Iceland? I know that’s 
                        where Bobby Fisher went when there 
                        was a warrant for his arrest. 
                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Y’all ain’t Bobby Fisher. Y’all 
                        need to go where the sista went. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Thank you, Uncle Earl but we don’t 
                        need any more of your unsolicited 
                        advice.

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Suit yourself, but I’ve been 
                        running from the police my whole 
                        life. I know what the fuck I’m 
                        talking bout.  

           Queen gets up to leave. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        Where you think you going?

                                 QUEEN
                        To lay down. I’m exhausted. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Y’all ain’t going nowhere until we 
                        shave yo heads. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I know you used to do that back in 
                        the day, but that doesn’t work 
                        anymore. We’re not doing that. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You wanna keep walking around 
                        looking how you look in that video?

                                 QUEEN
                        We’ll be fine. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        No, you won’t. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You’re not shaving my head. 

                                 SLIM
                        Mine either. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Okay, you get a choice. Cause you a 
                        woman. And I believe women have the 
                        right to choose. 

           Then he looks at Slim. 
                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        But you ain’t shit. Naomi, use the 
                        cheap razor on his ass. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE  - KITCHEN - LATER

           Slim sits on a stool by the stove while Naomi takes a razor 
           to his head. He’s pissed.  

                                 SLIM
                        Man, this is fucked up. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        This what happens when you running 
                        from the law.  

           Earl motions for the girl to keep shaving. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you guys have any wigs?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I live in a house full of 
                        strippers. Of course we got wigs. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - GODDESS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           There’s a row of about TWENTY WIGS. They all come in 
           different colors, lengths, and types. It looks like a museum 
           in there. Queen walks by them. Touching a few. Smelling 
           others. She’s fascinated.  

                                 GODDESS
                        Take whatever you want. You can 
                        have some of my clothes too. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Thank you. 

           Then --

                                 GODDESS
                        Can I clean your wound?

                                 QUEEN
                        I’ll clean it later. 
                                 GODDESS
                        I took a year of nursing school. I 
                        know what I’m doing. 

           Queen feels bad for judging her. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Okay. 

           Goddess helps Queen take her shirt off. Goddess slowly pulls 
           the bandage away. Queen winces. 

                                 GODDESS
                        You’re alright. I got you. 

           They lock eyes. 

           Goddess smiles at her. Queen smiles back. 

           Goddess has great bedside manner. 

           In another life she could’ve been a revolutionary, but in 
           this one she occupies the fantasies of working class men who 
           will never understand how complex she really is.

           INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Queen walks into the kitchen wearing a Tina Turner wig. From 
           her Ike & Tina days. Queen looks even more regal than before. 

           She looks up and sees Slim leaning against the stove. With 
           his newly shaved head. He looks like the second lead vocalist 
           in an R&B group from the nineties. Queen doesn’t want to 
           admit it, but she likes what she sees. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Wow. 

                                 SLIM
                        You like it? 

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know yet. It’s interesting. 

                                 SLIM
                             (rubbing his head)
                        You like this shit. 
                                 QUEEN
                        Shut up.

           Uncle Earl is smoking a cigar while Naomi watches TV. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I know you stole my two dollar 
                        bill. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t need your money. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You know how many two dollar bills 
                        there are in this world? 

                                 NAOMI
                        No, and I don’t care. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        That’s your problem. You don’t care 
                        about nothing. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh that’s my problem?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Yeah, that’s your problem. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You my muthafucking problem. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Correction. I’m the answer to your 
                        problems. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Fuck you, Earl. 

           Earl gets up and SLAPS her with the back of his hand. She 
           falls out of the chair and hits the floor hard.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UNCLE EARL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Slim and Queen lie next to each other on a water bed. 
                                 QUEEN
                        You hear that?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah, it sounds like somebody’s 
                        fighting. 

           Queen gets up and walks over to the door. She peaks out and 
           sees Naomi holding her mouth. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        You want me to talk to him?

                                 QUEEN
                        Please don’t. 

           Queen walks back to bed. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t used to be like this. 
                        Vietnam fucked him up. 

                                 SLIM
                        Damn. I’m glad I never had to go to 
                        war. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Shit, I feel like I go to war 
                        everyday. 

           She lays back down. The bed jiggles and moves. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t wanna deal with this shit. 
                        Let’s leave first thing in the 
                        morning. 

           Slim and Queen lie next to each other in silence. They try to 
           remain still so the bed won’t move. 

           Slim stares up at the ceiling. In a daze. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah. 

                                 QUEEN
                        How is that possible? You took 
                        somebody’s life yesterday. 
                                 SLIM
                        I guess, I’m just used to saying 
                        I’m okay even when I’m not. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I know the feeling. 

                                 SLIM
                        What if it was my time to go? What 
                        if God wanted me to die and I 
                        messed up His plan?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t think that’s what He 
                        wanted. 

                                 SLIM
                        How do you know?

                                 QUEEN
                        I just think you were meant to be 
                        here. 

           A beat. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m making an executive decision. 
                        We’re going to Cuba.

                                 QUEEN
                        Executive decision? What do you 
                        think this is “Mad Men”?

                                 SLIM
                        We can’t leave here tomorrow and 
                        not know where we’re going. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What about that large body of 
                        water?

                                 SLIM
                        We’ll figure it out. 

           Queen has never been great at letting men lead. Right now, 
           she doesn’t have much of a choice. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Fine.

           A beat. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m scared. 
                                 SLIM
                        That’s alright. I’ll be brave 
                        enough for the both of us.  

                                 QUEEN
                        Maybe we can take turns. 

                                 SLIM
                        You wanna be brave first?

                                 QUEEN
                        No, I’m tired of being brave.

                                 SLIM
                        Alright, well when I get tired of 
                        being brave I’ll let you know. 

           They shake on it. Causing the bed to go up and down. They 
           can’t help but laugh at this. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Hey, why does your uncle owe you?

                                 QUEEN
                        I got him out of prison once.

                                 SLIM
                        For what? 

                                 QUEEN
                        He killed somebody. 

                                 SLIM
                        Who’d he kill? 

                                 QUEEN
                        My mother. 

           Slim is stunned by that answer. But he knows better than to 
           ask a follow up question. 

           Slim turns off the light and turns over. Queen’s hand finds 
           its way to his newly shaved head. She rubs it, gently. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m rubbing your head for good 
                        luck.

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t believe in luck. Everything 
                        is destined. 
           They hear a loud KNOCKING on the door.

           Earl opens the door to find a BLACK POLICE OFFICER standing 
           there. He’s a handsome guy that spends all of his free time 
           in the gym. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Who called you?

                        I’m just here to make sure 
                        everybody’s okay. 

           Earl turns to look at Naomi. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You still fucking this nigga?

                                 NAOMI
                        Cause I called the police. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You got a death wish?

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER 
                        Is that a threat?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        No, it’s a figure of fucking 
                        speech. I’m not gon kill her. She’s 
                        my biggest draw.

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        Then why don’t you handle her with 
                        care? 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I’ll do better. 

           The Officer looks out the window and sees Slim’s car. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        You got a new car?
           Earl clocks this. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Yeah, I’m tryna be environmental 
                        and shit. I recycle pussy everyday. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        You mind if I come in?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        If you got a warrant I’ll give you 
                        the grand tour. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        I gotta piss. Can I use your 
                        bathroom?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        It’s some bushes right over there. 

           The Officer smiles.

           INT. UNCLE EARL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM

           Slim peaks out the window and sees the police car. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why are the cops here?

                                 QUEEN
                        Get down!

           INT. UNCLE EARL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Police Officer makes his way to his squad car. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        Keep your hands to yourself, Earl. 
                        I don’t wanna have to come back 
                        here again. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I ain’t want you here in the first 
                        place.

           The Officer looks at the license plate on Slim’s car. 
                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        What you looking at?

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        Why do you have a car in your 
                        driveway with Ohio plates? 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        I bought it off some dude. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        What was his name?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Can’t remember.  

           The Officer takes a picture of the plates. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        I think I will come back with that 
                        warrant. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Cool. I’ll be right here when you 
                        get back. Just make sure the font 
                        is big enough so I can read it. You 
                        know I’m old.

           INT. UNCLE EARL’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Slim and Queen run around the house frantically. 

           They quickly take off their clothes. Slim puts on one of 
           Earl’s track suits. Queen squeezes into one of Goddess’ 
           dresses. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Goddess hands Earl a small piece of paper. 

           He looks at it for a beat. Then hands it off to Queen, along 
           with an envelope full of cash. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Take this.  

           The piece of paper has an address written on it. 
                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        That should cover your gas for most 
                        of the way. And the guy at that 
                        address will take care of you. His 
                        wife ain’t shit, but he’s cool. 

           The address is in Atlanta, Georgia. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Johnny Mankowitz? Who’s he?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        We were in the trenches together. I  
                        saved his life a few times. 

                                 QUEEN
                        He’ll let us stay there?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        He’ll do whatever I tell him to. I 
                        already put in a call. 

                                 SLIM
                        Can we trust him?

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Don’t make me shoot you. 

           Slim falls back. 

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        This dude is paranoid as fuck. He 
                        got hiding places all up and 
                        through that muthafucka. If 
                        something goes down, y’all good. 
                        He white as hell, but he down for 
                        the cause. 

                                 SLIM
                        What cause?

                                 GODDESS
                        Yours.

                                 QUEEN
                        We don’t have a cause.

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You do now. 

           Earl hands Slim the keys to his BRIGHT RED CADILLAC. The 
           interior is ALL WHITE. It’s straight out of a blaxploitation 
           film. 
                                 SLIM
                        Thank you, Uncle Earl. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Nigga, I ain’t yo uncle! 

           And with that Slim gets in the car. 

           Queen goes to give Goddess a hug goodbye. Goddess holds onto 
           her longer than expected. 

                                 GODDESS
                        Can I go with you? I could be your 
                        lookout. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’ll come back for you, okay? 

           Goddess nods. Queen gets in the car. 

           Earl leans down and whispers into Slim’s ear. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        Take care of her. 

           He taps the top of the car. Then, without looking at Queen, 
           he shouts --

                                 UNCLE EARL (CONT’D)
                        Love you, baby girl. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Love you too. 

           Earl lifts up the garage door to let them out. 

           Slim backs out carefully. 

           Uncle Earl hands Goddess a book of matches and some lighter 
           fluid. She hops in Slim’s car and drives in the opposite 
           direction of Queen and Slim. 

           She’s taking the car deep into the woods so she can set it on 
           fire. 

           INT. CADILLAC - MOMENTS LATER

           Slim and Queen speed down a dirt road. 

                                 SLIM
                        Remember in “12 Years A Slave” when 
                        Solomon left Patsy on the 
                        plantation?
                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah. 

                                 SLIM
                        I feel like Goddess is our Patsy. 

           Queen looks back. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Maybe we could come back for her. 

                                 SLIM
                        Maybe. 

           Queen sees some 8-TRACK TAPES by her feet. She picks one up 
           and sticks it in the player. 

           THE BIG PAYBACK starts to blast through the speakers. She 
           turns it down - not wanting to draw too much attention, but 
           Slim turns it back up. 

           He looks at her and smiles. 

           EXT. OPEN ROAD - DAWN

           Slim and Queen drive through the bible belt. It’s a mix of 
           beautiful landscapes and poverty. 

                                 SLIM
                        Look how pretty this country is. 

                                 QUEEN
                        From this vantage point it looks 
                        like all men are created equal. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why you gotta take it there?

                                 QUEEN
                        Take it where?

                                 SLIM
                        I’m tryna make conversation and 
                        enjoy the sights. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m just being honest. 

                                 SLIM
                        Do you have to be honest all the 
                        time? Why can’t we just vibe?
                                 QUEEN
                        So you want me to be quiet and look 
                        pretty?

                                 SLIM
                        I didn’t say that. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s what you’re implying. 

                                 SLIM
                        No, that’s what you’re assuming. 

           There’s an awkward silence. Then Queen stares out the window 
           for a bit. She takes in the fields, the colorful sky, and the 
           birds chirping. He’s right. It is beautiful. 

                                 QUEEN
                             (mumbling)
                        It is pretty.

                                 SLIM
                        What’s that?

                                 QUEEN
                        I said it’s pretty. 

                                 SLIM
                        I thought that’s what you said. 

           She shoves him. Playfully. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I can be right sometimes. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You mind if we take a break from 
                        James Brown?

                                 SLIM
                        Sure. 

           Queen searches through the 8 tracks and finds a pleasant 
           surprise. She shoves it in and hits play. 

           After a beat AIN’T NO WAY... Sung by a younger, thinner, and 
           less shady Aretha Franklin - permeates through the car. 

           Queen climbs into the backseat and lays on her back. Letting 
           the wind blow through her long flowing wig. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        What you doing?
                                 QUEEN
                        I’m being inconspicuous. 

           Slim has gotten more comfortable driving the Cadillac. He 
           drives it like he bought it with his own money. 

           Queen’s eyelids become heavy as Aretha serenades them. 
           Eventually she falls asleep. Slim watches her in his rearview 
           mirror. 

           He’s never been more frustrated and enamored by anyone in his 
           life. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OPEN ROAD - NIGHT

           Queen is awakened by loud music. But it’s not coming from the 
           car stereo - it’s coming from up ahead. 

           There’s a club a few feet away in the middle of the woods. It 
           looks like the JOOK JOINT from THE COLOR PURPLE. 

           Slim pulls over and slows down. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What are you doing? Are you crazy?

                                 SLIM
                        I heard live music, I wanted to see 
                        where it was coming from. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Why?

                                 SLIM
                        I like live music.

                                 QUEEN
                        Where are we?

                                 SLIM
                        Georgia. We’re about three hours 
                        from Atlanta.  

                                 QUEEN
                        Then let’s keep going.  

           He listens closer. 

                                 SLIM
                        It sounds like somebody’s playing 
                        the blues. 
                                 QUEEN
                        So what - let’s go.

                                 SLIM
                        Would you have gone on a second 
                        date with me? 

                                 QUEEN
                        No. 

                                 SLIM
                        Damn. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It’s nothing personal. I’m just not 
                        looking for a relationship. 

                                 SLIM
                        I get it. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What was the second date gonna be?

                                 SLIM
                        I’m not telling you. 

           Queen laughs. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Come on. Don’t do me like that. 

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, fuck that. You should’ve said 
                        yes. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Okay, fine. I’ll go.  

                                 SLIM
                        You a lie. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I have the right to change my mind. 
                        I’m officially saying yes to the 
                        second date. Now, where we going?

                                 SLIM
                        I’m taking you dancing. Let’s go. 

           Slim gets out of the car. 
                                 QUEEN
                        Wait hold on. Can we dance once we 
                        get to where we’re going? Just to 
                        be safe.  

                                 SLIM
                        I’m tired of playing it safe. 

           Slim extends his hand to her. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You’re willing to risk getting 
                        caught just so you can dance with 
                        me?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah.

           Queen isn’t convinced. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        One dance. And then we can leave. 

           As she grabs his hand, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JUKE JOINT - CONTINUOUS

           This place is so crowded the walls are sweating. This small 
           establishment feels like it was built during a time when 
           black folks still had to drink from the shitty water 
           fountain. 

           The lighting is pretty dim. And everyone is on the dance 
           floor grinding slow and hard to a THREE MAN BAND playing B.B. 
           King’s “How Blue Can You Get.” 

           Slim takes Queen’s hand. Startling her. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why you so jumpy?

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m nervous. 

                                 SLIM
                        Ain’t nobody in here thinking ‘bout 
                        you. 

           She rolls her eyes. Slim leads her to the middle of the dance 
           floor and pulls her in close. She shoves him away. 
                                 QUEEN
                        Watch your hands. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m tryna hide your face. 

                                 QUEEN
                        By grabbing my booty? 

                                 SLIM
                        My hand slipped. 

           Queen slowly puts her arms around Slim’s sweaty neck. Slim 
           puts his arms around her waist, careful not to touch her ass. 
           The music gets louder and even more soulful as Queen and Slim 
           start to find their groove. 

           Slim looks around and realizes the prettiest girl in this 
           place is in his arms. He can’t help but grin from ear to ear. 

           Then he looks down and sees Queen has rested her head on his 
           chest. She’s so close she can hear his heartbeat. And right 
           now it’s beating pretty fast. So is hers. Slim holds Queen a 
           little tighter. She wipes the sweat from his brow.

           As the song reaches a thunderous CRESCENDO Slim leans in for 
           a kiss - caught in the moment - Queen denies him. 

           The crowd applauds the trio, shouting and yelling out the 
           band member’s names. Queen and Slim applaud the talented 
           musicians.  

                                 QUEEN
                        We should go. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Queen has her bare feet up on the dashboard. Slim gives her 
           the side eye. 

                                 SLIM
                        You lucky you got cute feet. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Even if they weren’t they’d be 
                        still be sitting right here.  

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, I would’ve stopped and got you 
                        some gym socks or something. 
                                 QUEEN
                        That’s messed up. 

                                 SLIM
                        Honestly, I don’t think dudes even 
                        cared about women’s feet until 
                        Eddie Murphy made it a thing. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I know. But the difference is he 
                        can be picky about a woman’s feet. 
                        The rest of y’all need to be happy 
                        somebody’s even laying next to yo 
                        ass. 

           She can see Slim is falling asleep at the wheel again. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t drive us into a ditch again. 
                        I still got a bruise on my forehead 
                        from last time. 

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, I got it. 

                                 QUEEN
                        No, you don’t. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m good. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Explain something to me. Why do 
                        dudes not like asking for help? 

                                 SLIM
                        It’s a sign of weakness. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s the dumbest shit I’ve ever 
                        heard. 

                                 SLIM
                        You say that but then turn around 
                        and want a strong mandingo type 
                        muthafucka. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t want that. 

                                 SLIM
                        What do you want?
                                 QUEEN
                        That’s a loaded question.

                                 SLIM
                        We got nothing but time. 

           Queen leans back in her seat. She’s so far back she’s 
           practically lying down. Like she were at a therapy session. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I want a guy to show me myself. 

           Slim glances at her. Her legs are on full display. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        I want him to love me so deeply I’m 
                        not afraid to show him how ugly I 
                        can be. I want him to show me 
                        wounds I never knew I had. But I 
                        don’t want him to make the wounds 
                        go away - I want him to hold my 
                        hand while I nurse them myself - 
                        and then I want him to cherish the 
                        bruises they leave behind. 

                                 SLIM
                        Damn, no wonder you still single. 

           They both chuckle. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        That’s a lot of shit. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Is it though? 

                                 SLIM
                        Yes. 

           Then --

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        But you deserve that. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t like that word.

                                 SLIM
                        You got a thing about that too?

                                 QUEEN
                             (smiling)
                        Yeah, I do. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 QUEEN (CONT'D)
                        I don’t think we deserve anything 
                        in this life. We get what we work 
                        for. That’s it. 

                                 SLIM
                        Okay, I’ll switch it up. 
                             (beat)
                        You’re worthy of that. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I like that. Thank you. 

           She watches him drive for a beat. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        What do you want in a woman? And 
                        don’t point at me.

                                 SLIM
                        First of all, I wasn’t gon’ point 
                        at you. 

           He laughs. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I just want somebody that’s ride or 
                        die.

                                 QUEEN
                        What does that even mean? Where are 
                        you riding to and why do you have 
                        to die when you get there?

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t mean that shit literally. I 
                        just wanna be with somebody that’s 
                        always gon’ love me. No matter 
                        what. I want someone that’s willing 
                        to hold my hand and never let it 
                        go. 

           Queen has never heard someone describe love in such simple 
           terms. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I hope you find it. 

                                 SLIM
                        Me too. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GAS STATION - BATHROOM - DAY

           Queen tries not to touch anything while washing up in a 
           disgusting bathroom. 

           She looks in the mirror for a long beat. Wondering how she 
           got here. Wondering what the future holds. 

           Queen looks around the bathroom and realizes she’s all alone 
           in the world. 

           Then - KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 SLIM (O.S.)
                        You okay in there?

           For the first time in her life a man’s voice reassures her 
           that she’s not alone. 

           The sound of Slim’s voice reminds her there’s a chance 
           everything will be okay. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Slim leans against the wall outside the bathroom door. 

           He watches people as they walk by. He wonders if they 
           recognize him. He wonders if they’re going to turn him in. 

           Then he spots a LITTLE BLACK GIRL walking with her MOTHER. 
           They look like the woman and child from the infamous Gordon 
           Parks picture. It’s a photograph of a smartly dressed black 
           woman with her innocent child standing under a “Colored 
           Entrance” sign.  

           The Little Girl locks eyes with Slim. She gives him the stink 
           eye for staring at her. 

           Then she laughs at him. As if to taunt him for losing a 
           staring competition he never knew he was a part of. Slim 
           smiles. The Little Girl’s sassy demeanor reminds him of home. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - LATER

           Queen is driving now. Slim rubs his bald head. 

                                 SLIM
                        Skinny Luther or fat Luther?
                                 QUEEN
                        Uh, skinny Luther. 

                                 SLIM
                        Ah fuck. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What?

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t trust people that like 
                        skinny Luther.

                                 QUEEN
                        Skinny Luther was dope. He had a 
                        lot more energy. He sang better. 
                        And his clothes fit. 

                                 SLIM
                        You crazy as hell. Fat Luther was 
                        the shit. Who else you know can 
                        pull off a jheri curl and a three 
                        piece suit at the same damn time?

           She’s quiet. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Right, nobody. 

           INT. CAR - LATER

           While Queen drives she spots a couple HORSES grazing. She 
           almost crashes the car. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Look! You see the horses?

           Slim sees them up ahead. 

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah, they over there chilling. 

                                 QUEEN
                        There’s probably a farm nearby. 

           She starts to pull over. 

                                 SLIM
                        What you doing? I thought you said 
                        no more stopping. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I changed my mind. 
           EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Queen walks up to the horses slowly. Judging by her demeanor 
           she’s more comfortable around animals than she is people. 

           She goes to pet one. 

                                 SLIM
                        You crazy? What if they get scared 
                        and kick you in the face?

                                 QUEEN
                        They’re not wild. 

                                 SLIM
                        You don’t know that. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Judging by their shiny coats - 
                        they’re domesticated. 

           Slim moves in closer. Queen grabs his hand and guides it in 
           an a soothing back and forth motion. The horse is calm and so 
           is Slim. 

           It’s quiet all around them. 

                                 SLIM
                        How you know so much about horses?

                                 QUEEN
                        My uncle used to take me horseback 
                        riding when I was a kid. 

                                 SLIM
                        Earl?

                                 QUEEN
                        I told you he didn’t used to always 
                        be like that. 

           Queen walks over to the other horse and looks in its eyes. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        He told me nothing scares a white 
                        man more than seeing a black man on 
                        a horse. 

                                 SLIM
                        Why?

                                 QUEEN
                        Because they have to look up at 
                        him. 
                                 SLIM
                        I’ve never been on a horse. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You should try it sometime. 

           Queen starts walking back to the car. Slim doesn’t follow 
           her. 

                                 SLIM
                        Maybe I should do it right now. 

                                 QUEEN
                        No. Their owner could come out and 
                        catch us. You can go horseback 
                        riding some other time. 

                                 SLIM
                        When?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know. 

                                 SLIM
                        What if we don’t make it?

           The weight of his question renders them both speechless. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We will. 

                                 SLIM
                        You don’t know that. 

           He’s right. She doesn’t. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Help me get on the horse. 

           Queen walks over to him. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Which one is the calmest?

           Queen chooses the one that’s still grazing. She holds Slim’s 
           hand and helps HOIST him up onto the horse. 

           The horse BUCKS at first. Then Queen whispers to the horse 
           and eventually the stallion calms down. 

           Slim is nervous at first, but eventually he becomes one with 
           the animal. After a moment Slim’s posture shifts. He puffs 
           out his chest and looks out into the world like an African 
           warrior. 
           Queen looks up at him. He looks down at her. They hold each 
           other’s gaze for a long beat. 

                                 QUEEN
                        It’s nice isn’t it?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah. 

           Then - 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           The horse BUCKS again. But only this time Queen can’t calm 
           him down. The horse knocks Slim off his back. Slim hits the 
           ground HARD. 

           He doesn’t break anything, but he gets the wind knocked out 
           of him. 

           Queen helps him up and they run to the Cadillac. 

           They hop in the car and drive off! 

           INT. CAR - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           As the sun starts to set, the Cadillac starts to smoke. 

           The smoke is coming from UNDERNEATH the car. 

           Slim pulls over. 

           EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - CONTINUOUS  

           Slim is under the car. It’s smoking like crazy. Queen stands 
           over him. Freaking out. 

                                 QUEEN
                        How do you not know anything about 
                        cars?

                                 SLIM
                        Don’t judge me.  

                                 QUEEN
                        I think there’s a body shop up the 
                        road. 

                                 SLIM
                        Really far up the road.  
           Queen walks to the back of the car and assumes the position.

                                 QUEEN
                        Then we should start pushing. 

           Slim gives in and they both start pushing the car up the 
           road. They try to hurry while they still have light. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GAS STATION - GARAGE - TWO HOURS LATER

           Slim and Queen are spent. A PLUMP BLACK MAN chews tobacco and 
           blinks at them. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        Your transmission’s fucked. 

                                 SLIM
                        That don’t sound good. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        I can have it back to you tomorrow 
                        for about two grand. 

                                 SLIM
                        Two grand?

                                 QUEEN
                        We need it back today. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        Y’all in a rush? 

           He looks at them suspiciously. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah, we’re on our way to visit 
                        family. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        Why y’all in a rush to do that?

           He lets out a hearty laugh and then spits tobacco juice on 
           the ground. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN (CONT’D)
                        I can get it back to you tonight 
                        but that’ll cost you a little mo. 

                                 SLIM
                        How much mo?
                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        Another five hundred. 

           Slim pulls Queen to the side. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s all of our money. 

                                 SLIM
                        Then fuck it - let’s just hop on a 
                        bus or something. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s too risky. 

                                 SLIM
                        Maybe I can try to fix it myself. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We’ll get caught waiting on you to 
                        fix it. 

                                 SLIM
                        You wanna give him all our money?

                                 QUEEN
                        No, but we don’t have a choice. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN (O.S.)
                        We doing this or not?

           Queen walks over and hands him the envelope full of cash. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Could you just hurry up. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        Who the fuck you think you talking 
                        to? 

           He walks up on Queen. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Look, we don’t want any trouble. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        I can’t tell. 

                                 SLIM
                        We just need the car fixed as soon 
                        as possible. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        I’m moving as fast as I can. 
           Slim pulls out his gun and points it at the mechanic’s head. 
           This time he holds it with confidence. 

                                 SLIM
                        We need you to move a little 
                        faster. If you don’t mind.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The Plump Black Man fixes the transmission while Slim holds a 
           gun to his head. Queen sits on a counter staring at Slim. She 
           can’t take her eyes off of him.  

           The Plump dude is sweating more than usual while he tries to 
           concentrate. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        Y’all killed that cop, didn’t you?

                                 SLIM
                        Not on purpose. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        It don’t matter if it was on 
                        purpose or not. Now they really got 
                        a license to kill us. 

                                 QUEEN
                        He shot me.    

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        You gave ‘em an excuse.

                                 QUEEN
                        You weren’t there. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        No, I wasn’t. But I saw the affect 
                        it had on my son. He thinks y’all 
                        the second coming. Now every time 
                        something happens he wanna make a 
                        sign and go march in the streets.  

                                 SLIM
                        What’s wrong with that?

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        A lot of things. 

           Then --
                                 QUEEN
                        Can you work more and talk less? 
                        Please.  

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        Look, this gon’ take a while. And 
                        I’ve never been a fan of working 
                        with a gun to my head.  

                                 QUEEN
                        We’re not leaving you with this 
                        car. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        What if I give you some insurance?

                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t want no house keys or no 
                        drivers license cause all that shit 
                        can be replaced. Fuck that. 

           The Plump mechanic walks over to the garage door and knocks 
           on it. 

           After a beat a SKINNY BROWN KID no more than seventeen lifts 
           it up. 

           Slim quickly puts his gun away. 

           The young man looks like Barack Obama long before he fell in 
           love with Michelle. He wears a dirty white T-shirt, tattered 
           jeans, and a CAMERA hangs from his neck like a gold chain. 

                                 SKINNY BROWN KID
                        Yes, sir? 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        You wanna take them on a walk? 

           One look at Queen and Slim and he lights up like a Christmas 
           tree. He obviously doesn’t share his father’s views about 
           them. 

                                 SKINNY BROWN KID
                        Yeah! 

           Then -

                                 SKINNY BROWN KID (CONT’D)
                        Yes, sir. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        I need an hour to fix this car. 
                        Keep ‘em occupied until then. 
                                 SKINNY BROWN KID
                        Yes, sir. 

           Slim walks over and shakes the young man’s hand. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m - 

                                 SKINNY BROWN KID
                        I know who you are. It’s an honor 
                        to meet you, sir. 

                                 SLIM
                        What’s your name?

                                 SKINNY BROWN KID
                        Everybody calls me Junior. 

           Plump Black Man beams with pride. 

           Then Skinny Brown Kid takes Queen’s hand and kisses it, 
           sweetly. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - AFTERNOON

           Queen and Slim walk hand in hand. Junior leads the way. 

                                 SLIM
                        Where is everybody?

                                 JUNIOR
                        There’s nothing to do around here. 
                        People just go to work and go home. 

                                 SLIM
                        I know the feeling. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That sounds like a miserable 
                        existence. 

                                 SLIM
                        Sounds kind of peaceful to me. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Peaceful or complacent?

                                 SLIM
                        Just because you wanna work a 
                        regular job and lead a normal life 
                        doesn’t mean you’re complacent. 
                                 QUEEN
                        So is that why you work at Costco?

                                 SLIM
                        Don’t make fun of my job, okay. My 
                        dad works there and I like spending 
                        time with him. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s a good reason. 

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t wanna spend my whole life 
                        being stressed out just so somebody 
                        can write about me when I’m gone. 
                        All I want is a manageable 
                        mortgage, a couple kids, a dope ass 
                        wife and a hypoallergenic dog. 

           Queen lets that sink in. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That’s all you want?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah. What do you want?

                                 QUEEN
                        I want people to write about me 
                        when I’m gone. 

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        Me too. 

                                 SLIM
                        So that’s why you out here saving 
                        lives? So people will write about 
                        you?

                                 QUEEN
                        Excuse me?

                                 SLIM
                        You think if you save enough lives 
                        then maybe yours will mean 
                        something.  

                                 QUEEN
                        Fuck you. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Don’t fight. 

           They both look at Junior as if he were their own son. 
                                 SLIM
                        Sorry, man. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        Don’t apologize to me. Apologize to 
                        her. 

           Queen looks at Slim. Waiting for his bullshit apology. 

                                 SLIM
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Uh huh. 

                                 SLIM
                        What do you wanna be when you grow 
                        up? 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I wanna be like y’all. 

           They finally arrive to Junior’s secret spot. It’s a small 
           hill with a perfect view of the sunset. 

           Queen, Slim, and Junior sit on the grass and watch the sun 
           say goodnight.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Queen and Slim get back in their newly repaired Cadillac. She 
           turns on the car and it hums like it just came off the 
           factory line.  

           Queen smiles. Slim looks rejuvenated. 

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        Can I take your picture?

                           SLIM
           Yeah.
                                                          QUEEN
                                              Nah, I don’t think that’s a 
                                              good idea. 

                                 PLUMP BLACK MAN
                        I fixed your car for free - you can 
                        let him take your picture. 

           They both start to get out of the car, but Junior stops them. 
                                 JUNIOR
                        No, don’t pose in front of it. 
                        That’s cheesy. Just look over here. 

           Queen has her hand on the wheel. Her toned arm on full 
           display. Slim leans forward. His hand on his chin. He doesn’t 
           look at the camera - he looks at her. 

           Queen stares directly into the lens, the look in her eyes is 
           the perfect combination of fear and pride. 

           The FRAME FREEZES. We linger on them long enough to realize 
           they’re no longer the people we met at the diner. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Queen is driving. Deep in thought. Slim is fast asleep. 

           They drive by a sign that reads WELCOME TO ATLANTA. 

           Queen stares at it for a long beat. It brings back an 
           unwanted memory. 

           She makes an impulsive turn. Jolting Slim awake. 

                                 SLIM
                        Yo. 

           She’s on a mission. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you mind if we make a detour?

                                 SLIM
                        I do actually. 

           Queen doesn’t care and makes a hard left turn. She drives 
           down a winding road. Tears in her eyes. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        You okay? 

                                 QUEEN
                        Not really. 

           He sits up and wipes the sleep out of his eyes. 

           Slim can tell she needs to be held in this moment, but he 
           doesn’t know if that’s permitted. He reaches out and touches 
           the small of her back. She allows it. 
           His hand is bigger than she realized. He rubs her back softly 
           at first - then he applies more pressure to help her relax 
           and to make sure she feel his presence in a way she hasn’t 
           before.  

           Her heart is beating so fast he can feel her body pulse. His 
           heartbeat syncs up with hers. They are connected. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Queen stares at a tombstone. 

           ETTA JOHNSON - BELOVED MOTHER AND DAUGHTER. 

           Slim stands a few feet behind her. Far enough to give her 
           space. But close enough to let her know she’s not alone. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We were close when I was younger, 
                        but when I got older I felt like I 
                        didn’t know her anymore. She didn’t 
                        know me either. We could go months 
                        without talking. And when we did - 
                        I hated it. I had nothing to say to 
                        her. She wanted a connection so 
                        badly, but I just didn’t care. I 
                        didn’t need her anymore.   

           She turns to look at Slim. Searching for judgement in his 
           eyes. There is none. 

                                 SLIM
                        What was she like?

                                 QUEEN
                        She was a beautiful hurricane. 

                                 SLIM
                        That sounds nice. 

                                 QUEEN
                        She was.  

           Queen extends her hand to Slim. He takes it and moves in 
           closer. 

           She kneels down and pulls up a few weeds crowding her 
           mother’s resting place - all the while still holding onto 
           Slim’s hand. 

           Queen kisses her palm and touches the cold tombstone. 
           This is what closure looks like. 

           She lets go of Slim’s hand and makes her way back to the car. 

           Slim hangs back. 

           He stares at her mother’s grave a little longer. 

           INT. CAR - HOURS LATER

           Queen and Slim sit in a parked car. Slim is in the driver’s 
           seat. Queen lies flat on her back in the backseat. 

           Slim breathes her in. 

                                 QUEEN
                        My grandma left the house to both 
                        of them. My mom wanted to sell it. 
                        My uncle wanted to live in it. 
                        Typical black family bullshit. 

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah. 

                                 QUEEN
                        One night they were at the house 
                        fussing about it and he pushed her 
                        down a flight of stairs. She 
                        cracked her skull. She bled out so 
                        quick by the time the ambulance got 
                        there she was already dead. 

           Slim hangs his head. Unsure of what to say. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        I had just passed the bar. I was 
                        desperate to try my first case. I 
                        never thought that would be it. 

                                 SLIM
                        How could you defend the person 
                        that killed your own mother? 

                                 QUEEN
                        It was an accident. 

                                 SLIM
                        Does it ever piss you off that he’s 
                        alive and she isn’t?

                                 QUEEN
                        All the time. 
                                 SLIM
                        Even though y’all weren’t close? 

                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah. I took comfort in the idea of 
                        her existence. No matter how far 
                        away we were I could always feel 
                        her presence. 

                                 SLIM
                        I can’t feel my family anymore. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 SLIM
                        I can’t feel their presence. I’m 
                        too far away. 

           A wave of sadness washes over him. 

                                 QUEEN
                        They’re with you. 

           They lock eyes. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna see them again. 

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t believe you. 

           Queen leans in and kisses him. It’s so pure and innocent - 
           it’s unclear if sex will follow. 

           But then he pulls her in close and kisses her again. The 
           second kiss is anything, but innocent. It’s the perfect 
           combination of lust and melancholy. 

           They’ve been longing for this moment for a while. 

           Slim pulls Queen on top of him. Rather than entering her 
           right away - he lifts her up to his face  - her hands press 
           up against the ceiling while he DEVOURS her. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET DAY - SAME TIME 

           We’re in the same streets Junior just walked with Queen and 
           Slim. But now the town isn’t so quiet. There’s a storm 
           brewing and it has nothing to do with the weather. 
           A SEA OF BLACK and BROWN BODIES are MARCHING in PROTEST. They 
           are full of PRIDE and VENOM. 

           They’re protesting the death of an UNARMED BLACK BODY. 

           This particular body belongs to a TEENAGE GIRL. 

           Her PICTURE DAY PHOTO is everywhere. In it she wears bamboo 
           earrings in her ears and thick purple braids in her hair.

           She’s the kind of black girl middle America fears most. 
           Outspoken and free. 

           If she hadn’t been killed - there’s a strong chance she 
           would’ve been impregnated in another year or two. That child 
           could’ve been another statistic or the second black 
           president. We’ll never know. 

           The crowd wears t-shirts with her face at the center. They 
           hold up signs that demand the cop that killed her be buried 
           under the jail. 

           The PROTESTORS are surrounded by POLICE OFFICERS. The 
           Officers are dressed in SWAT GEAR. Ready for war. 

           The Officers form a line. The Protestors form a line opposite 
           them. 

           The Police stand completely still like statues of oppression 
           in the South. The Protestors are vibrant not violent. 

           A LITTLE BROWN GIRL no more than six-years-old STANDS tall in 
           front of the LONG LINE OF COPS. She directs her message to 
           one cop in particular. 

                                 LITTLE BROWN GIRL
                        Stop killing us! Please!

           Even in a state of rage and frustration her manners don’t go 
           out the window. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Slim pulls Queen’s hair back and bites her neck. He follows 
           each bite with a kiss. 

           Queen reclines the drivers seat as far back as it will go and 
           kisses Slim deeply. Then she proceeds to move her hips back 
           and forth. Driving Slim crazy. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

           A POLICE OFFICER THROWS TEAR GAS INTO THE CROWD. 

           Protesters cover their faces with t-shirts and hoodies. Their 
           hands crumple the face of the slain Teenage Girl. 

           Some Protestors run for their lives while others run toward 
           the Police. 

           The Police Officers start BEATING protestors with BATONS and 
           chase after them while on HORSEBACK. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Queen is now gripping onto the steering wheel. Hands and arms 
           sweating. Slim grips her waist and pulls her back and forth. 

           Windows fogged. Both gasping for air. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

           Junior makes his way through the crowd. 

           A BLACK POLICE OFFICER stops him from going any further. The 
           Officer is dressed in bullet proof gear from head to toe. 
           Junior can do him no harm in this moment. 

           Junior is only wearing a hoodie and sweatpants to protect 
           him. 

           It’s David and Goliath all over again. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        If you don’t vacate the premises 
                        I’m gonna have to arrest you, son. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m not your son.

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        What’s your name, young man?

                                 JUNIOR
                        I don’t have to tell you that.  
                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        I don’t want to hurt you. Trust me. 
                        But it’s my job to clear the 
                        streets. Which means you can’t be 
                        here. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        I have a right to protest. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        I understand that, but you don’t 
                        have a permit. So that means you’re 
                        breaking the law. 

                                 JUNIOR
                        What you gon’ do, kill me?  

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER
                        No, but I will be forced to arrest 
                        you.

           The Police Officer LIFTS UP THE BULLETPROOF SHIELD ON HIS 
           HELMET - so there’s one less barrier between them. 

                                 BLACK POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        I’m begging you. Go home. 

           The Police Officer GRABS Junior by his arms -- in an attempt 
           to calm him down. But he wrestles free. 

           Junior pulls out a SMALL HAND GUN. Which he probably stole 
           from his father’s underwear drawer. He aims it at the only 
           part of the Officer’s body that’s not covered. 

           He SHOOTS him square in the face. 

           Causing the Officer’s head to EXPLODE IN HIS HELMET. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Slim thrusts his pelvis against Queen’s again and again until 
           she finally throws her head back and SCREAMS with pleasure. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - SAME TIME

           Junior watches the Police Officer fall to the ground in front 
           of him. He has succeeded in killing a giant that meant him no 
           harm, but he feels justified just the same. 
           A SEA of SWAT MEMBERS descend on Junior and tackle him to the 
           ground. His future is uncertain. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Queen and Slim lay intertwined in the backseat. 

           Naked. Spent. Sweaty.

           Completely unaware the world is burning around them. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME

           Uncle Earl’s face is DRENCHED WITH HIS OWN BLOOD. His right 
           eye is SWOLLEN SHUT. And his lip is BUSTED. 

           Even beaten to a pulp he’s the coolest guy in the room. 

           The other guy is DETECTIVE WARD. He’s dressed in plain 
           clothes with a firearm on his hip. He’s intimidating in size, 
           but his balls are nonexistent. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        Where are they? 

           Uncle Earl spits out a tooth. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You gone pay for that shit. And I 
                        don’t want no cheap veneers either. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        We found guns, cocaine, and a lot 
                        of cash under your floor, Mr. 
                        Johnson. So you’re going away no 
                        matter what.  

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        That cash is earnings from my strip 
                        club. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        You’re selling a lot more than lazy 
                        lap dances.

                        We got two of your bottom bitches 
                        right next door. 

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You don’t even know what a bottom 
                        bitch is, with yo light skinned 
                        ass. You mixed? 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        Mr. Johnson --

                                 UNCLE EARL
                        You probably got a fat white mama 
                        and a broke black daddy. 

           Uncle Earl has obviously struck a nerve with the Detective 
           and in retaliation he SLAMS Earl’s head onto the steel table. 
           Hard. Causing him to lose his balance and fall to the floor. 
           Detective Ward kneels down. Making sure his crotch is 
           directly in front of Earl’s face. 

           He winces in pain. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        You don’t have to tell me where 
                        they are. One of your little whores 
                        will.

                        Yeah you definitely half white

           The walls are bare. There are only two photos on the desk. 
           Both feature two black women on vacation. 

           DETECTIVE DAVIS is one of the smiling women in both photos. 

           Judging by her frame she takes pride in the way she looks, 
           but her job doesn’t require her to be beautiful. Just

                        Well, you look young so that’s not

           Detective Davis grabs a photo from the file in front of her. 

           It’s the same PHOTO from Officer Reed’s dashboard.

                        I don’t know where your mouth been. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        I’m clean, I promise. 

           Goddess takes a bite from the donut. The sugar puts her mind 
           at ease. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ (CONT’D)
                        Is Goddess your real name?

           Goddess looks at her like, “bitch, you know the answer to 
           that question”. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ (CONT’D)
                        Okay. 

           Goddess takes another bite of the donut. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ (CONT’D)
                        Goddess, what’s your ultimate goal?

                                 GODDESS
                        What?
                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        This can’t be it. 

           Detective Prinz moves in closer. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ (CONT’D)
                        You want more for yourself. I can 
                        see it in your eyes.  

           Goddess looks away. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ (CONT’D)
                        What do you wanna be? 

                                 GODDESS
                        I don’t know. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        You’re lying. 

                                 GODDESS
                        I’m serious. I never thought about 
                        that shit.

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        What do you want more than anything 
                        in this whole world? 

           Goddess finishes off the donut and takes a deep breath. 

                                 GODDESS
                        I wanna be a star. 

           Detective leans back and smiles. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        You should be. You’re pretty 
                        enough. 

                                 GODDESS
                        Thank you. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        If you help me, the press is gonna 
                        wanna talk to you. Your face will 
                        be everywhere. You’ll be a 
                        household name.  

           Goddess isn’t phased by this. 

                                 GODDESS
                        I don’t wanna be famous for that 
                        shit. 
                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        Do you think you’re gonna be a 
                        famous movie star?

                                 GODDESS
                        Maybe. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        That’s not gonna happen. 

                                 GODDESS
                        You don’t know that. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        I do. 

                                 GODDESS
                        You ain’t gotta believe in me. 

                                 DETECTIVE PRINZ
                        Goddess, tell me what you want - 
                        and I’ll give it to you. 

                                 GODDESS
                        I want a lawyer. 

           Detective Prinz has failed. Goddess isn’t as simple as she 
           thought. 

           INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Detective Ward pulls out another photo of a couple kids. But 
           these kids have a strong resemblance to Naomi. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        Do you know these kids? 

           Another rhetorical question. 

           Naomi’s eyes well up. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t fuck with my kids. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        That’s the last thing I want to do. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Then why you got a picture of ‘em?

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        I know the judge that awarded your 
                        mom full custody. 
                                 NAOMI
                        How you know the judge?

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        It’s a small world. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Nah, all you white folks just know 
                        each other. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        I can put in a call and see if I 
                        can get him to wave the supervised 
                        visits. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I want more than that. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        Okay, I can try to get you joint 
                        custody. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What you mean try?

           Detective Ward wonders if he should make a promise he can’t 
           keep. 

                                 DETECTIVE WARD
                        I’ll make it happen. 

           Naomi wipes the tears from her contoured cheeks and leans 
           forward. Ready to spill her guts. 

           INT. HOUSE - IN ATLANTA - MORNING

           THE MANKOWITZ sit on a couch across from Queen and Slim. 

           MRS. MANKOWITZ is lily white. She’s warm, yet hard to read. 
           MR. MANKOWITZ has a nervous energy most veterans can’t shake. 
           His eyes are kind, even though they’ve seen mankind at its 
           worst. He’s spent his whole life trying to forget the war. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        You know the boy that killed the 
                        police officer? 

                                 SLIM
                        We spent a little time with him. 

                                 QUEEN
                        He was very sweet.
                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        I’m sure he is. 

                                 SLIM
                        Did the news say what was gon’ 
                        happen to him?

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ 
                        They’re gonna try him as an adult. 

           Queen hangs her head. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Fuck. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        Language. 
                             (then)
                        This is a Christian house. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        You should be. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Excuse me?

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        These kids think it’s okay to kill 
                        cops because of you. 

           Slim is visibly upset. 

                                 SLIM
                        We didn’t tell him to do that. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        It’s not their fault. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        Then whose fault is it? 

                                 SLIM
                        Look, we don’t want nobody else to 
                        die. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        Too bad. You’re next. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        Honey. 
                                 QUEEN
                        No, it’s okay. I know they’re 
                        looking for us. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        They have a bounty on your heads. 

                                 SLIM
                        How much are we worth?

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        A hundred thousand. 

                                 SLIM
                        Each?

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        Total. 

                                 QUEEN
                        That ain’t much. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        A hundred grand could pay off our 
                        mortgage. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You gonna turn us in?

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ 
                        Absolutely not. 

           Queen cuts her eyes at Mrs. Mankowitz. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        How long do you need to stay?

                                 QUEEN
                        Just a night. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        You can stay in our room. We’ll 
                        take the couch.

                                 SLIM
                        Thank you. That’s very kind. 

           Mrs. Mankowitz looks as if he should’ve discussed that with 
           her first. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        And if somebody comes in here you 
                        can hide under the bed. 
                                 QUEEN
                        I don’t know if that’s the best 
                        hiding place if the cops come. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        No, you don’t understand. There are 
                        loose panels under the bed. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        He thinks the atomic bomb is gonna 
                        drop at any moment. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ 
                        I like to be prepared. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        I keep telling him if a bomb drops - 
                        it doesn’t matter where you hide. 
                        You’re dead anyway. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        What are you gonna do when you 
                        leave here?

                                 SLIM
                        Try to get to Cuba. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        That’s smart. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        How are you gonna cross the water? 

           Queen and Slim look at each other. 

                                 SLIM
                        We haven’t figured that out yet. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        I think we can help. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You got a boat?

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        No, but we know a guy with a small 
                        plane. He lives in Miami. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        Jackson?

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        Yeah. 
           Mrs. Mankowitz WRITES DOWN AN ADDRESS and hands it to Queen. 

           She slips it into her pocket. Mr. Mankowitz looks concerned. 
           His wife clocks this. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        I don’t trust him. 

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        That’s your problem. You don’t 
                        trust anybody. Do you guys want me 
                        to call him or not?  

                                 SLIM
                        Please. 

           As Mrs. Mankowitz gets up to make the call - 

           A SWAT TEAM PLOWS THROUGH THE DOOR. 

           Queen and Slim jump up and run upstairs BEFORE THE COPS SEE 
           THEM. 

           Mrs. Mankowitz screams at the top of her lungs. Mr. Mankowitz 
           holds up his hands and tries to reason with the police. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        Do you have a warrant?! 

           One of the SWAT MEMBERS shoves him against a wall, and holds 
           one up. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ (CONT’D)
                        I want to read that. 

                                 SWAT TEAM MEMBER
                        Take all the time you need. 

           Mr. Mankowitz reads the warrant carefully. It’s legit. 

           He nods at the police. Then with the flick of a finger the 
           Swat Leader commands his team to search the whole house. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

           They swarm the house like bees. Tearing it apart. 
           They break antiques and stomp on wooden floors that have just 
           been repaired. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Queen and Slim make their way to the MASTER BEDROOM. They try 
           to lift up the panels under the bed. Some of them lift easily 
           while others are stuck and won’t budge. Slim starts to sweat 
           bullets. Queen does her best to loosen them up as fast as she 
           can. 

           They move quickly - but they aren’t fast enough. 

           Determined FOOTSTEPS make their way to the bedroom. The 
           bedroom door SWINGS OPEN. Silence. 

           We follow the FEET looking in the closet and then out the 
           window to see if they jumped. 

           Then we PAN UP to reveal the feet belong to the Swat Team 
           Member that shoved Mr. Mankowitz against a wall downstairs 
           just moments ago. 

           He stares at the bed and grins. Then he lifts it up with one 
           quick swoop, and --

           Nothing. They aren’t there. 

                                 SWAT TEAM MEMBER
                        Fuck! 

           He lets go of the bed and it CRASHES against the floor. 
           Shaking the whole house. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - SAME TIME

           Queen and Slim lay close together. Shaking. Trying not to 
           breathe. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - LATER

           The Police are loading the bright red Cadillac that Queen and 
           Slim have called home - for most of their journey - onto a 
           tow truck. 
           It’s evidence now. The Mankowitz are handcuffed and sitting 
           in the back seat of a Swat Truck. The Swat Team Member from 
           before looks down at them. 

                                 SWAT TEAM MEMBER
                        If you tell me where they’re going 
                        we can let you go and you can enjoy 
                        the rest of your evening.  

           Mrs. Mankowitz looks at her husband. 

                                 MR. MANKOWITZ
                        I don’t know where they’re going. 

           He kneels down and gets in Mrs. Mankowitz’s face. 

                                 SWAT TEAM MEMBER
                        How bout you? You look a lot 
                        smarter than your husband.  

                                 MRS. MANKOWITZ
                        You heard what my husband said. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM - UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - HOURS LATER

           Queen and Slim are half asleep. She turns to him. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We have to leave at some point. 

                                 SLIM
                        I know. I’m just not trying to walk 
                        into an ambush. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I heard cars leave hours ago. 

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah, but I’m sure they left some 
                        folks behind so they could keep an 
                        eye on the house. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You can stay and die of starvation 
                        if you want to - but I’m getting 
                        the fuck outta here. 

           Queen slowly lifts the panels up one by one. They both take 
           in the fresh air. They roll from up under the bed. 
           Queen walks over to the window that faces the back of the 
           house. All that’s back there is a GARAGE and some grass. Slim 
           walks over. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        Nobody’s out there. 

                                 SLIM
                        They’re probably out front. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You wanna check?

                                 SLIM
                        So they can see me and burst in 
                        here again? Hell nah. 

           Queen lifts up the window and looks down. 

           It’s low enough so they can’t kill themselves, but high 
           enough that they could break a leg if they landed wrong. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We gotta jump.

           Slim looks out. 

                                 SLIM
                        It’s too high. 

                                 QUEEN
                        All you have to do is bend your 
                        knees as soon as you hit the 
                        ground. Bend and roll. 

                                 SLIM
                        This ain’t no damn fire drill. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I’ll be brave enough for the both 
                        of us.  

                                 SLIM
                        Okay fine then you jump first. 

           Queen climbs onto the window seal, takes a deep breath, and 
           JUMPS out of the window. 

           But she doesn’t take her own advice and forgets to bend her 
           knees. 
           She hits the ground HARD and lands flat on her back knocking 
           the wind out of her body and her LEFT SHOULDER OUT OF ITS 
           SOCKET. Queen grabs her arm and rocks back and forth trying 
           not to scream. She’s in excruciating pain. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           Seeing Queen in pain is the push he needed. He walks back a 
           few feet and runs toward the window LEAPING to the ground. He 
           follows Queen’s instructions and lands perfectly. 

           Rather than rejoicing he rushes over to Queen’s aid and pulls 
           her into the garage. 

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Queen is in so much pain she can’t speak. 

                                 SLIM
                        Okay, I know how to do this. But 
                        you have to promise not to scream. 
                        Can you do that?

           She shakes her head no. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I believe in you. 

           She continues to shake her head and backs away from him. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I think there are cops out front 
                        and if they hear you - it’s over. 
                        All of it. We’re done. I know how 
                        strong you are. 

           They lock eyes. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be brave for us now. 

           Those words give her the strength she needs. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Give me your shirt.

           He takes it off and balls it up. She stuffs it in her mouth 
           and gives him a nod to let him know she’s ready. 

           Slim grabs her elbow with one hand and grasps her neck with 
           the other. 
                                 SLIM

           Then YANK! She SCREAMS but it’s muffled by his shirt.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Two POLICE OFFICERS are standing guard out front. Police 
           Officer 1, is out of shape and always in a good mood. Police 
           Officer 2, is too intense for his own good. 

           Police Officer 1 hears Queen’s muffled groans. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                        Did you hear that?

                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                        Hear what?

                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                        It sounds like somebody’s crying. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                        No, it’s just nature. You city boys 
                        ain’t used to that shit. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                        Don’t refer to me as a boy.

                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                        You know what I meant. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                        Look, I know the difference between 
                        a person and an animal. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                        Then go walk around. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                        Man, watch how you talk to me. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                        Touchy touchy. 

           Police Officer 1 starts to walk around the property. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME

           Queen rubs her shoulder - still in pain. While Slim searches 
           for a key to the STATION WAGON parked in the garage. 

                                 SLIM
                        Help me find a screwdriver. 

           They both start searching. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You know how to jumpstart a car?

                                 SLIM
                        I used to. My older brother taught 
                        me one summer. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I didn’t know you had a brother.

           Queen finds an old toolbox. Slim digs through it. 

                                 SLIM
                        The only car we ever jump started 
                        was my dad’s. He used to take his 
                        keys with him everywhere he went. 
                        He knew better than to leave that 
                        Acura around us. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I see why. 

           Slim finally finds what he’s looking for and hops in the 
           driver’s seat. Queen gets in the passenger. This is a far cry 
           from Uncle Earl’s fly caddy. But they’ll take what they can 
           get. 

           Slim tries to convince the ignition the screwdriver is a key 
           but it doesn’t work. 

                                 SLIM
                        Dammit.

                                 QUEEN
                        Keep trying. 

           He takes it out and tries again. Nothing. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Police Officer 1 walks around, looking to see if anyone’s 
           there. He sees the garage. But doesn’t hear anything. He 
           cocks his gun, and walks over to the garage. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME

           Queen digs through the toolbox again and finds a smaller 
           screwdriver and gives him that. 

           Slim puts that in the ignition and it works. The engine is 
           louder than they thought it would be. 

                                 SLIM
                        Now how we supposed to get outta 
                        here?

                                 QUEEN
                        By the grace of God.

                                 SLIM
                        So you believe in Him now?

           Before she can answer.

           POLICE OFFICER 1 LIFTS UP THE GARAGE DOOR. 

           They turn to look at him. They’re caught. 

           The Police Officer looks around and realizes his colleagues 
           are out front - chatting with each other. He looks back at 
           Queen and Slim and sees two faces that remind him of his own. 

           He remembers why he became a cop. To help people. And at the 
           moment, no one needs his help more than the two people in 
           front of him. 

           They have a staring contest for about three seconds. 

           Then he takes a few steps back and gives them room to back 
           up. 

           Slim puts the car in reverse and moves the car back slowly. 

           Queen sinks low into her seat. 

           Police Officer 1 nods his head as a way to say, “go head”. 
           They pull off and drive onto a busy side street. Queen and 
           Slim pass by a few distracted police officers and are on the 
           road. Again. 

           Police Officer 1 watches them go. Confident in his decision. 
           He walks back around to the front of the house.

                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                        What was it?

                                 POLICE OFFICER 1
                        A couple deer got caught in some 
                        branches. I set ‘em free.  

                                 POLICE OFFICER 2
                        Told you. 

           As Police Officer 1 grins, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STATION WAGON - HOURS LATER

           They’re almost in Miami. 

           Queen sticks her head out the window and lets the wind hit 
           her face. For the first time in her life she feels completely 
           free. No fear. 

                                 SLIM
                        What you doing?

           She doesn’t respond. Queen unbuckles her seatbelt and hoists 
           herself up onto the window seal and leans on the roof of the 
           car. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Are you crazy?! Get back in the 
                        car!

           She looks up at the sky. The clouds seem bigger to her. Queen 
           takes a deep breath - then gets back in her seat. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Are you tryna get caught?

                                 QUEEN
                        No, I just always wanted to do 
                        that. 
                                 SLIM
                        Well, don’t do it while I’m 
                        driving. 

                                 QUEEN
                        You should try it. 

                                 SLIM
                        Nah, I’m good. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Pull over. 

                                 SLIM
                        No. 

           She grabs the steering wheel and YANKS it to the left. They 
           almost crash into another car. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        If I do it will you please let me 
                        drive the rest of the way in peace?

                                 QUEEN
                        Swear to God. 

                                 SLIM
                        Swear on something else. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Okay fine, I’ll swear on you. 

           They lock eyes. She kisses him. As he pulls over, we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

           Queen is now gripping the steering wheel while Slim tries to 
           hoist himself up and out of the car window. He’s not as 
           graceful as she is.  

           He finally gets up there and tries to hold onto the roof of 
           the car, but his hands are sweaty so he loses his grip and 
           FALLS BACK - with his arms flailing in the air. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Oh shit!

           Before he flies out of the car he grabs a hold of the 
           rearview mirror and regains his balance. 
                                 SLIM
                        Fuck this, I’m coming back in. 

                                 QUEEN
                        No, you got it. You’re good. I’ll 
                        drive slow. 

           She slows down a bit and Slim finally gets a firm hold of the 
           roof. 

           Queen picks up a little speed and Slim gets a whiff of the 
           freedom she just got. Slim doesn’t know if he’ll ever feel 
           this free again - so he cherishes the moment. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT

           Queen and Slim are parked in an empty field - somewhere in 
           Miami. 

           It looks like an abandoned plantation. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Are you sure this is the address?

                                 SLIM
                        Maybe she wrote it down wrong. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Well it’s not like we can call and 
                        ask for confirmation. 

                                 SLIM
                        Fuck. 

           Slim gets out of the car and looks around. There’s no sign of 
           human life anywhere. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Will you please just get back in 
                        the car before you get kidnapped. 

                                 SLIM
                        Who’s gon’ kidnap me? Ain’t nobody 
                        out here. 

           Slim gets back in the car. They’re both exhausted from 
           driving all day. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I was hoping we’d pull up to a 
                        house so we could get some sleep. 
                                 QUEEN
                        Well, there isn’t one. 

                                 SLIM
                        I can see that. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I feel like a sitting duck. 

                                 SLIM
                        Let’s just sleep for an hour and 
                        then we can figure out our next 
                        move. 

                                 QUEEN
                        The cops could find us in an hour. 

                                 SLIM
                        No one knows we’re in this car. 

                                 QUEEN
                        They could figure it out.

                                 SLIM
                        How about you go to sleep and I’ll 
                        sit up front and make sure nobody 
                        kills us. 

           She gets out of the car and climbs in the back. 

           The backseat is practically a bed anyway. Slim takes off his 
           jacket and places it behind her head from the front seat. 

           Queen curls up in a ball and closes her eyes. Slim stares off 
           into the night. While he looks up at the stars, he hears --

                                 QUEEN
                        I can’t sleep. 

                                 SLIM
                        You want me to turn on the radio?

                                 QUEEN
                        No. I want you to tell me a story.  

           He turns to look at her. Confused and annoyed. 

                                 SLIM
                        What kind of story?

                                 QUEEN
                        Any story. I don’t care.  
                                 SLIM
                        Uh...

                                 QUEEN
                        Look, if I were home right now I’d 
                        just turn on my rain machine and go 
                        to sleep. But I’m not -- so I need 
                        you to get creative. 

                                 SLIM
                        The sound of rain soothes you?

                                 QUEEN
                        Yeah.  

                                 SLIM
                        Does the sound of my voice soothe 
                        you? 

                                 QUEEN
                        Not at the moment - can you just 
                        tell me a story please?  

           Slim leans back in his seat and tries to think. He’s nervous. 

                                 QUEEN (CONT’D)
                        You can start. 

                                 SLIM
                        I know, I’m thinking. 

           Queen stares at him. Patiently waiting. This makes Slim even 
           more nervous. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Okay so two teenagers fall madly in 
                        love, but their families can’t 
                        stand each other --

                                 QUEEN
                        You can do better than that. Come 
                        on.

                                 SLIM
                        Okay fine. 

           He fidgets with his hands while as he begins to speak. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        When I was little I asked my mom 
                        where babies come from. She said 
                        they come from heaven. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        I guess I didn’t believe her - 
                        cause right after that I went to go 
                        ask  my dad. He said -- babies are 
                        the product of two people that 
                        needed something from each other. I 
                        didn’t know what that meant. So I 
                        asked -- needed what? He said it 
                        could be any number of things. 
                        Maybe they needed to feel good. 
                        Maybe they needed love. Maybe they 
                        needed to feel human.  

                                 QUEEN
                        How old were you?

                                 SLIM
                        Seven. 

           She puts her head back down. Perplexed by this story, but 
           intrigued. 

                                 QUEEN
                        And then what?

                                 SLIM
                        Then I asked my grandmother and she 
                        said -- babies come from Satan. 
                        They’re his way of punishing us for 
                        all the evil shit we did to our 
                        parents. 

           Queen shakes her head. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        Then I went to my older brother and 
                        asked him. He said -- nobody knows. 
                        You’re just born. That’s it. Don’t 
                        ask why. 
                             (then)
                        I wasn’t completely satisfied with 
                        that answer, but I had run out of 
                        family members to ask - so he got 
                        the last word. But I always thought 
                        to myself if I ever have a kid... I 
                        pray to God he never asks me that 
                        shit. 

           Queen chuckles, so does Slim. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I have a feeling you’d give ‘em a 
                        good answer. 
           Queen’s eyelids become heavy. She eventually closes her eyes 
           and falls asleep. 

           Slim stares at her. Grinning. Watching her sleep has quickly 
           become one of his favorite pastimes. After a moment he finds 
           it hard to keep his eyes open as well. 

           Soon - they’re both fast asleep. In a station wagon. In the 
           middle of a field. Somewhere in Miami, Florida. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STATION WAGON - DAWN

           Slim is in a deep sleep. Mouth open. Head tilted. Drooling. 

           Then we hear - CLICK CLACK. Slim JOLTS awake. 

           There’s a RIFLE aimed at Slim’s face. Once his brain computes 
           what’s happening he scoots over into the drivers seat -  this 
           causes Queen to wake up too. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What’s going on?

           She looks at the man holding the rifle. He’s an OBESE WHITE 
           GUY wearing a FUBU t-shirt and all of his teeth are GOLD. 

           All of those things make Queen very nervous. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Don’t be scared. I don’t wanna hurt 
                        y’all. I wanna help you. 

                                 SLIM
                        Then why you pointing a gun at my 
                        face?

           He joyfully swings it over his shoulder. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Oh I was just having some fun. I 
                        point guns at everything. 

           He opens the door for Slim. He gets out, cautiously. 

                                 SLIM
                        Are you Jackson? 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        That’s my last name, yeah. 
                                 QUEEN
                        Your last name is Jackson? 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY 
                        I know it sounds like a black 
                        person’s last name but if you think 
                        about it - y’all got your names 
                        from us. 

           Touché. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        Come on. 

           Slim helps Queen out the back. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        I got a little trailer over here. 

           The Obese dude walks pretty fast. Queen and Slim trail behind 
           him. Then --

                                 SLIM
                        Do you know the Mankowitz? 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Yeah. 

                                 QUEEN
                        They gave us your address. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Why’d they do that?

           Queen and Slim catch up to him.

                                 QUEEN
                        They said you had a plane.

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        They lied. 

           Slim stops walking. Queen and the Big White Dude stop too. 

                                 SLIM
                        If you don’t have a plane we not 
                        coming with you. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        I have very little money. So 
                        there’s no way in hell I could ever 
                        afford a plane. But I have a friend 
                        with a lot of money. He got two of 
                        them muthafuckas.

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT'D)
                        He got a big one and a small one. 
                        Y’all just need the small one, 
                        right?

                                 SLIM
                        Yeah.

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        When we get to my trailer I can 
                        call him. 

           Queen is skeptical. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        Look, y’all can either believe me 
                        or go back to the station wagon. 
                        Your choice. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           Queen and Slim sit in the White Guy’s tiny trailer. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Alright - he can have the plane 
                        ready to go first thing tomorrow 
                        morning. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We need to go today. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Well it’s not that easy. 

                                 SLIM
                        We can’t wait until tomorrow. We 
                        have to go now. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Okay, but I doubt he’ll be able to 
                        make it happen. 

                                 SLIM
                        Just call him again. 

           Slim grabs the cordless phone and hands it to him. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                             (on the phone)
                        They need to go today. I know. 
                        That’s what I told ‘em. Uh huh. 
                        Okay. 
           He looks at Queen and Slim and shrugs his shoulders. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Thanks 
                        man. I appreciate this. 

           He hangs up. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        We gotta meet him in an hour. 

                                 SLIM
                        Okay cool. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        It’s an hour away - we gotta go 
                        now. 

                                 SLIM
                        Can I make a call first? 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        I thought you were in a rush? 

                                 SLIM
                        I am, but I need to make one quick 
                        call. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Make it quick. 

           The White Guy leaves. 

                                 QUEEN
                        What are you doing? We can’t talk 
                        to anybody. They could track us.  

                                 SLIM
                        I don’t care. 

           He dials a number he knows by heart. As it rings his eyes 
           start to well up. 

           Then finally we hear a BOOMING VOICE on the other end. 

                                 VOICE
                        Hello? 

           Slim doesn’t say a word. He just breathes. 

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Hello? 

           Then after a beat. 
                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Son? Is that you? 

           The tears start streaming down Slim’s face. 

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you? 

           Slim hangs up the phone. Queen pulls him into a hug and holds 
           him tightly as he cries into her chest. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Everything alright?

                                 QUEEN
                        We’re fine. Can you give us a 
                        second?

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        No, we gotta go now. 

                                 QUEEN
                        We’ll be out in a second! 

           The White Guy makes his way outside, mumbling under his 
           breath the whole time. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Queen and Slim sit in the backseat holding hands while the 
           Big White Guy drives. 

                                 QUEEN
                        Do you know what fubu means?

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Yeah, it’s for us by us. 

                                 SLIM
                        But you ain’t one of us. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        I know. I just like the clothes.  

                                 QUEEN
                        You like black women too?

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        I believe all black women are 
                        queens and we should bow in their 
                        presence. 
                                 SLIM
                        I second that. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Do you know how lucky you are to 
                        have been carried in a black 
                        woman’s womb? It’s a gift. Damn the 
                        Jews -- y’all the chosen ones. 
                             (then)
                        I fuck with y’all. 

           Slim sneaks a look at Queen. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        I was just sitting on my ass eating 
                        deep fried macaroons like I do 
                        every Sunday and then I saw that 
                        picture of y’all on the news -- and 
                        I knew I didn’t wanna keep doing 
                        the same shit no more. I knew I had 
                        to take my life into my own hands.  

                                 QUEEN
                        You got all that from a picture?

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Yes, Queen. 
                             (then)
                        Do you mind if I call you that?

                                 QUEEN
                        No. I don’t mind. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        There it go. 

           They look out the window and see a small PLANE up ahead. It’s 
           the kind of plane a famous person would meet their demise in. 

           He pulls up to the plane. Queen and Slim hop out. 

           They both shake his hand with gratitude. Particularly Slim. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        Peace and blessings to you both. 

           Queen grabs Slim’s hand and they both start walking toward 
           the plane. 

           It’s been a long road to this point. They’re ready to leave 
           it all behind. Then --

           WOOP WOOP! 
           They turn their heads to find FIVE SQUAD CARS lined up in a 
           row. TWO COPS step out of each vehicle. GUNS DRAWN. 

           The Obese White Guy yells at one of the cops. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY (CONT’D)
                        Ay yo. Run me my money, muthafucka. 

           A Cop TOSSES him a large BLACK DUFFLE BAG. He catches it. 

           One of the COPS sees him unzip the bag to count it. The Cop 
           pulls him to the side. 

                                 COP
                        It’s all there. 

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Just checking. 

                                 COP
                        What are you gonna do with the 
                        money?

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        Half of it is going to a lovely 
                        couple I wanna help pay off their 
                        house. 

                                 COP
                        And the other half?

                                 OBESE WHITE GUY
                        I’m gonna travel the world and 
                        order everything on the menu. 

           And with that he hops in his truck and speeds off. 

           One of the Police Officers gets on the bullhorn and yells at 
           Queen and Slim. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Get on the ground now! And put your 
                        hands behind your head. 

           Queen and Slim look at each other. Never letting go of each 
           other’s hand. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Get on the ground now! 

                                 QUEEN
                        There’s no getting out of this, is 
                        there?
                                 SLIM
                        No. 

           Queen looks up at the sky - and somehow manages to muster a 
           smile. 

                                 QUEEN
                        I wish we could’ve had forever. 

                                 SLIM
                        Me too. 

           Slim looks at her with tears in his eyes and says --

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        On the count of three I want you to 
                        run as fast as you can. 

           She nods. 

                                 SLIM (CONT’D)
                        One...

                                 QUEEN
                        Two...

           They both turn around and run toward the plane with all the 
           energy they have left. 

           A bullet PIERCES Queen’s stomach within seconds. 

           Slim is shot in BOTH KNEES. Then two bullets BLOW through his 
           chest forcing him to fall, face first, to the ground. 

           Queen continues to run until a cop who spends most of his 
           days in the shooting range sends a bullet straight through 
           her heart. Killing her instantly. 

           Slim crawls to her. He knows she’s no longer here. In body. 
           He kisses her forehead with bloody lips. Then collapses on 
           top of her. He takes one final breath before making his 
           transition to the hereafter. 

           They lay there on the pavement. In a pool of their own blood.

                        Sophie Johnson and Darius Hinds 
                        were shot and killed today by Miami 
                        Police. The two suspects have 
                        become quite infamous for their 
                        ability to escape authorities after 
                        killing a police officer four days 
                        ago in New York City.

                        Miami Police Department released a 
                        statement saying they had hoped to 
                        arrest the suspects so the suspects 
                        could have their day in court, but 
                        when they decided to flea they had 
                        no choice but to open fire. 

           The COPS put their guns down. Feeling powerful and guilty at 
           the same time. It’s an adrenaline rush they can’t describe. 

           The Police Officers walk over to the dead bodies. Observing 
           them. Not unlike a hunter observes his conquered prey. 

           As we linger on this visual - we’ll hear Alice Smith’s 
           tortured rendition of Nina Simone’s song “I Put A Spell On 
           You.” 

           SOCIAL MEDIA bubbles fill the screen. 

           FACEBOOK, TWITTER, and INSTAGRAM are all abuzz with people 
           posting, commenting, retweeting, recording themselves on 
           their phones. We see long rants. Hashtags. Comment sections 
           are flooded with debates. 

           Everyone has an opinion about the mysterious couple that 
           looked authority in the face and killed it with their bare 
           hands.

           INT. MORGUE - LATER THAT DAY

           The floor is covered in blood and water. A bloody baptism is 
           currently taking place. 

           The CORONER is a dignified black man with a salt and pepper 
           beard. For all the death he’s seen - there’s a lot of life 
           behind his eyes.    

           He washes Queen and Slim’s bodies as if they were his 
           favorite cousins. He prays over them. He does it in a soft 
           whisper because he knows this isn’t professional, but he also 
           wants to be loud enough so God can hear him. 

           He wants them to go to that Good Place. The Place his 
           Grandmother told him about when he was a child. The Place 
           overflowing with milk and honey and God’s love. 

           That’s his prayer. 
           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - THREE DAYS LATER

           HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, mostly Black and Latino, stand in the 
           streets holding flowers with sad eyes. They pour into the 
           streets to pay their respects to two ordinary people that 
           have become sacrificial lambs. 

           It’s reminiscent of BIGGIE’S funeral. Only this time there’s 
           no music being played from boom boxes. There’s no animation 
           or joy to be found. 

           We see an OLDER BLACK MAN with a bald head and a thin frame. 
           He looks like the older version of SLIM. This is his beloved 
           father. He bows his head and takes off his hat as his son’s 
           casket rolls by. 

           Slim’s family consists of his OLDER BROTHER, his SISTER, his 
           ELEGANT MOTHER and THREE YOUNG CHILDREN - his little cousins. 

           The only person there to grieve QUEEN is her Uncle Earl. He 
           cries uncontrollably as he reaches out to touch her casket. 
           It’s covered in pink roses. She hated that color. 

           YOUNG KIDS hold up the PHOTO Junior took of Queen & Slim in 
           the car.

           INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - DORM ROOM - DAY

           A very white COLLEGE KID hangs the same photo of Queen & Slim 
           on his wall. They are right up there next to Bob Marley and 
           TuPac Shakur. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRAZIL - STREET - DAY

           TWO LITTLE BOYS, who look like extras from CITY OF GOD, kick 
           a soccer ball back and forth. One of the boys is wearing a t-
           shirt with Queen and Slim’s faces on it. 

           And just like that they’ve gone from skin and bones to 
           mythical beings that everyone wishes they knew. 

           Heroes that everyone admires and role models young people 
           will immolate for generations to come. 
           Whether you call them sacrificial lambs, revolutionaries or 
           just two innocent people that defended themselves -- their 
           names will live on forever. 

           But for the purposes of this story -- they will always be 
           known as Queen and Slim. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
