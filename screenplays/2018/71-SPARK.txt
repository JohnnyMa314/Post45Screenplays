          January 2018
           EXT. STANFORD CAMPUS - VARIOUS

           A GRADUATE, holding his gown, scurries through crowds of 
           families to make it to his seat. Before the ceremony, we 
           follow him until he finds his place in line.

           INT. STANFORD STADIUM - MORNING

           A man’s VOICE (DEAN) drones one as we watch families fan 
           themselves in the toasty indoor stadium, waiting for their 
           graduates to receive their diplomas so they can escape to air-
           conditioned parties.

                                 DEAN
                        I present to you, Stanford’s 
                        Graduate School of Business’s 
                        graduating class of 2018.

           We move to the row of seated graduates on stage, as they 
           stand, ready to accept their diploma. We end on NAOMI JOHNSON 
           (27, African-American, impeccable posture) bright-eyed and 
           waiting to be called. The dean rattles off names as each 
           student steps closer to him. 

                                 DEAN
                        Clarence Jacker, MBA. Brad Johnson, 
                        MBA. Recipient of the Alexander A. 
                        Robicheck Student Achievement Award 
                        in Finance, Naomi Johnson, JD MBA. 

           As she glides to accept her diploma, a rupturing enthusiasm 
           extends from the audience and we see her black family: 
           mother, cousins, uncles, aunts, etc. They are the lone black 
           faces in a sea of mostly white. Naomi takes the diploma, 
           shakes his hand, and rounds her way back to her seat, 
           glowing. She sits down, looking at her diploma. The STUDENT 
           next to her holds out his hand for a low-five. She obliges 
           and smiles. 

           INT. JOHNSON HOME - KITCHEN - THAT AFTERNOON

           A home that’s a Crate & Barrel ad brought to life. Naomi’s 
           mother, PATRICIA, dressed in Eileen Fisher’s finest, puts 
           finishing touches on appetizers. There’s a graduation party 
           in full swing. Naomi emerges, flushed, in a colorful summer 
           dress. Her mother stops fussing and turns to look at her 
           daughter. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        I love that color on you. My sweet 
                        JD MBA-Okay daughter. 
           She pulls her face in and drowns her in kisses. Naomi 
           affectionately pulls away. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Mom. MOM. MOM! Stop. You’re going 
                        to get lipstick all over my face. 

                                 PATRICA
                        Good, everyone will know whose 
                        canal you came from.

                                 NAOMI
                        Gross. 

           She pinches her cheek and grabs a tray to bring outside. 
           Naomi walks over to a mirror on the wall, she does indeed 
           have an enormous lipstick impression of her mother’s full 
           lips on her right cheek. She tries to smudge it off. After a 
           lot of rubbing, she makes her way outside. 

           EXT. JOHNSON HOME - BACKYARD

           Light music plays, home made snacks, an open bar, and a 
           cacophony of black folk (friends, family, neighbors) mingle 
           to celebrate Naomi. She spots the bar and makes her way over 
           but gets stopped by her UNCLE MAURICE (black Santa Claus).

                                 UNCLE MAURICE
                        Naomi, Naomi, Naomi. Your aunt and 
                        I are so proud of you. 

           Naomi looks over to her AUNT DINAH, who chain smokes alone on 
           the other side of the pool. She looks over, immediately 
           putting out the cigarette and waving. Naomi waves back. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank you, Uncle Maurice. I’m so 
                        glad you guys could make it. 

                                 UNCLE MAURICE
                        You’ve got to be careful though. 
                        People with law degrees, especially 
                        top of their class, will be the 
                        first one’s abducted in the 
                        invasion. 

           This is something she hears often from him. She pats his 
           back. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh, I know Uncle Maurice -- I keep 
                        your pre-invasion kit next to my 
                        night stand. 
                                 UNCLE MAURICE
                        Atta girl. 

           Naomi walks away, only fifteen steps away from the bar. Alas, 
           she gets stopped again. This time by her mom’s co-worker 
           CHRISTINE (Midwest sensibility, knits her own bird-themed 
           sweaters)

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Oh you sweet girl, god bless you 
                        and your beautiful family. 

           She squeezes Naomi’s right hand affectionately. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank you for driving out here, I 
                        hope the commute wasn’t too bad. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        A breeze - finally got to finish my 
                        audiobook. I am just on the edge of 
                        my seat. This Voldemort guy sounds 
                        like ten miles of bad road. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re in for a real treat. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Your mother told me you and Adrian 
                        broke up, I’m sorry to hear that. 
                        Everyone at the hospital is real 
                        torn up about it. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (incredulous)
                        Oh she did? Well, that’s great. 
                        Yes, we broke up a few months ago. 
                        He’s moving to Chicago and we 
                        weren’t serious enough for long 
                        distance. His words, not mine. 

                                 CHRISTINE
                        Pity. When races mix, the babies 
                        turn out gorgeous. God’s little ice 
                        cream swirls. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ....Exactly. Okay, well gotta put 
                        something in this, I am parched. 
                        Great to see you. 

           She gestures to her empty hand and walks away. She’s not a 
           mere seven steps away from the bar. 
           But alas, intercepted by a family friend, TRACY (Late 20s, 
           biracial, beautifully freckled)

                                 TRACY
                        Naomi, there you are. Hardest 
                        person to find!

           Naomi is actually happy to see Tracy. They hug. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Tracy, hi, it’s so great to see 
                        you. What’s going on with you?

                                 TRACY
                        I actually just moved back from 
                        Nashville.

                                 NAOMI
                        Whoa, cool. Welcome back!

                                 TRACY
                        Thank you, thank you! What’s next 
                        for you, plans to work at some big 
                        law firm?

                                 NAOMI
                        Actually, I’m not practicing. I’m 
                        going tech, believe it or not. I 
                        got an offer at this VC firm in SV. 
                        Moving out there and starting next 
                        week. 

                                 TRACY
                        That’s incredible, congratulations. 
                        You’ll be close enough for Pat to 
                        visit. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t give her any ideas. I’m 
                        moving to Mountain View so that 
                        should give us some space. 

                                 TRACY
                        Knowing her, I doubt it. Would I 
                        know the company?

                                 NAOMI
                        It’s Harvey, Larter & Saw. 

           Tracy’s face scrunches as she looks at her drink, swirling 
           the large ice cube. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Do you know them?
                                 TRACY
                        I don’t know anyone who works there 
                        but I’m familiar. I heard it’s... 
                        tough. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Good, that’s why I picked them. 
                        They have one of the highest 
                        success rates with their 
                        investments, they let their first 
                        year analysts actually invest, they 
                        --

                                 TRACY
                        -- I meant tough for certain 
                        employees. People like us. People 
                        who --

                                 NAOMI
                        Black people, yeah I got it. I’ll 
                        be fine. I’m always the “one” in 
                        the room, many years of practice. 
                        Besides, I’m sure they’ve got at 
                        least one other black person so I 
                        won’t be the token. 

           Naomi laughs, Tracy is not convinced but decides to drop it. 

                                 TRACY
                        Congrats again and good luck Naomi. 

           Tracy walks away, Naomi thinks nothing of it and FINALLY 
           makes it to the bar. As she’s making herself a cocktail, she 
           looks at the people in her backyard celebrating. She toasts 
           to herself, smiling. The moment is quickly ruined when 
           another GUEST comes over to talk to her.

                                 GUEST
                        Woman of the hour -- your mom tells 
                        me you’re single. I know a great 
                        guy...Are manbuns still “in”?

           Naomi takes a big gulp and feigns polite interest. 

           INT. NAOMI’S NEW APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT WEEK

           Naomi drags the last of her moving boxes into her beautiful 
           two bedroom palace. She’s followed by DIANE, (mid 20s, black, 
           Queen of the Amazons in another life) who carries a box with 
           the Stanford FLAG swinging out of it. She barely misses 
           Naomi’s head. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Girl, watch it. You’re gonna kill 
                        us both with that thing flying 
                        around. 

           Diane drops the box on the floor. She picks up the flag and 
           proudly hangs it on the wall. 

                                 DIANE
                        I won’t be shamed for my Tree 
                        pride. 

           They both laugh at the large ‘S’ with the tree in the middle 
           of it. Naomi collapses on the couch while Diane grabs two 
           beers from the fridge. She collapses on the couch, handing 
           the other beer to Naomi. They clink tops. 

                                 DIANE
                        Cheers to two sistas doing it for 
                        themselves. Fighting the man.

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re working at Goldman Sachs and 
                        come Monday morning, I’m a startup 
                        bitch. Boo, we are the man.  

                                 DIANE
                        That calls for a second cheers.  

           The clink again and drink. 

                                 DIANE
                            (devilish)
                        ....We should celebrate. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Double nah. 

           Diane stands on the couch. 

                                 DIANE
                        No, we have to. Hear me out. We 
                        live on our own, I’m feeling my 
                        NorCal self, and we have graduation 
                        money to burn baby. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Counter argument - every episode of 
                        “Frasier” was just added to 
                        Netflix. 

           Naomi makes the “weighing” gesture. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Tough call. 

                                 DIANE
                        Ugh. 

                                 NAOMI
                        The man was supposed to be in a few 
                        episodes and turned the role into a 
                        career spanning twenty years, tying 
                        the role with --

                                 DIANE
                        ---You got a real blind spot for 
                        citizens of Honkey Town, USA. One 
                        drink. One little teensy, tiny, 
                        itty bitty titty committee drink. 

           Naomi thinks about it. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Nah, we good.

           Diane lies down on her lap, eyes pleading. 

                                 DIANE
                        I want to flirt with boys and be 
                        told how ‘exotic’ I look. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Well when you put it that way... 
                        nope.

                                 DIANE
                        I’ll let you order an appetizer... 

                                 NAOMI
                        ...Ladies and gentleman we have a 
                        deal. One drink. 

                                 DIANE
                        One. Uno. Eins. 

           Naomi’s eyes narrow. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR

           An ordinary, lowly attended bar that boasts jukebox music, 
           dim lighting, and a sub-par happy hour. Naomi and Diane sit 
           at a high top table. Naomi slurps the last of her one drink 
           and motions for the check. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Well this was cool, lez bounce. 

           As Naomi gets off the stool, the music changes to 
           Chumbawamba’s “Tub Thumping.” Diane sits her back down. 

                                 DIANE
                        We can’t leave now, it’s an 
                        unforgivable sin.
                            (yelling)
                        I get knocked down! But I get back 
                        up again! You are never gonna  keep 
                        me down!

           The entire bar sings along. Diane motions for the bartender 
           to bring another round. 

                                 DIANE
                        Come on, I know you know the words. 
                        You know I know you know the words. 
                        You are never gonna keep me down. 

           She dances around Naomi who smiles, refusing to engage to 
           sing along. The bar gets louder. Naomi gives in. 

                                 NAOMI
                        He drinks a Whiskey drink, he 
                        drinks a Vodka drink.

                           NAOMI
           He drinks a Lager drink, he 
           drinks a Cider drink.
                                                          DIANE
                                              He drinks a Lager drink, he 
                                              drinks a Cider drink.

                                 DIANE
                        He sings the songs that remind him 
                        of the good times.

                                 NAOMI
                        He sings the songs that remind him 
                        of the best times.

           Diane pulls Naomi up and they start jumping and singing along 
           to the music, all eyes in the bar are on them. A SERVER drops 
           off four beers. Before she leaves, Naomi checks with her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Sorry, she only ordered two. 

                                 SERVER
                        The other two are from the 
                        gentlemen over there. 
           The server points to a group of GUYS. One in particular, 
           GINGER DUDE, waves. Diane grabs a beer and raises it to him, 
           waving him and his friends over. Naomi elbows her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What are you doing? You said one 
                        drink and now it’s three, and this 
                        harem of fools is making their way 
                        over here. 

                                 DIANE
                        Ya welcome, bish.  

           Diane takes the hand of Ginger Dude and dances with him in 
           the center of the dance floor. The other guys start to leer, 
           fending for her attention. She shoos them away, sips from 
           both beers and looks at her watch. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        Late to your next appointment?

           Naomi turns around to see a new guy has made his way over, 
           BEARDED DUDE (Early 30s, manicured beard, Caucasian, eyes 
           like sea glass.) She is startled by his beauty. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Wha?

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        It’s 9:30PM on a Saturday night and 
                        you’re looking at your watch like 
                        you’re gonna be late for church. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh, I don’t go to church. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        Now that I’m looking at you, you do 
                        seem like the “burst into flames” 
                        type. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Sizzle sizzle. 

           He looks away, smirking. She’s lost her cool and doesn’t know 
           how to respond. He looks back over to her. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                            (cooly)
                        Celebrating?

           He points to Diane dancing with Ginger Dude. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Mourning. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        Yikes... Sorry? 

                                 NAOMI
                        I mean, mourning my dwindling youth 
                        but yes, technically, we’re 
                        celebrating. Starting new jobs this 
                        week, but it’s boring. I’d rather 
                        talk about something else. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        I’ll clink to that. 

           He raises his beer glass to hers. They lock eyes intimately 
           as they both sip. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Watching anything good?

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        Aside from this circus display --

           They look to Diane and Ginger who now make aggressively out. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE 
                        My go-to show was just added to 
                        Netflix, so that’s been a top 
                        priority. It’s this older show 
                        about a psychiatrist whose dad 
                        moves in with him. 

           Naomi spits out her drink.

                                 NAOMI
                        You watch “Frasier”?

           He helps clean up her dribbled beer. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        “Watch” is too casual, I would say 
                        binge is a little closer to home. 

                                 NAOMI
                        A guest role that turned into a 
                        career of 

                           NAOMI
                                                      BEARDED DUDE
           Twenty years. 
                                              Twenty years. 

           They both smirk, sipping their beers. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Do you want to dance?

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        No. Do you?

           A beat. He puts his hand on her thigh.

                                 NAOMI
                        No. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

           Naomi and Bearded Dude kiss as their sensible clothing flies 
           into oblivion. They continue talking between gasps for air. 

                                 NAOMI
                        In addition to starring, he also 
                        directed more than 30 episodes. 

           They hop around the room, finally making it onto the bed. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        Don’t get me started on the 
                        nominations but, in an eleven year 
                        run, it won 37 Emmys. Game of 
                        Thrones just beat it with 38 last 
                        year. 

           They continue to kiss and talk while getting comfortable on 
           the bed. 

                                 NAOMI
                        David Hyde Pierce was nominated 
                        every single year. You can’t find 
                        quality television like that today. 

           They’re down to their underwear now. Naomi stops him for a 
           moment.

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t wake me when you sneak out at 
                        4AM. 

                                 BEARDED DUDE
                        Word. 

           She flips the light switch off. Goodnight!
           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Naomi sleeps alone, tangled in her sheets. There’s a knock on 
           her door. Naomi mumbles something inaudibly. 

                                 DIANE O.S.
                        Ya welcome bish!

           Naomi rolls over, covering her head with her comforter. 

           EXT. HLS OFFICE BUILDING - THE NEXT MORNING

           Naomi, dressed in a classic #imwithher pantsuit, exits a 
           corporate-looking shuttle and stands outside an industrial 
           building with sign reading: “Harvey, Larter, & Saw” on top of 
           the front door. She enters. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM

           Naomi, along with a handful of other bright-eyed first 
           dayers, sits in a conference room waiting for the orientation 
           meeting to begin. There’s a fruit spread (WITH kiwi and 
           mango!!), bagels, even lox. This job is cush. NICK (early 
           30s, attractive and lovable schlub, Caucasian) walks over to 
           the empty seat next to her. 

                                 NICK
                        Taken?

                                 NAOMI
                        By you. Have a seat. 

           She smiles as he sits down. She holds her hand out. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Naomi. 

           He shakes. 

                                 NICK
                        Nick. 

           As she’s about to converse, a hush falls over the room as 
           IYANA (Early 40s, always in heels, overly-worked physically 
           and mentally), REGINALD (old rich white dude), and PATRICK 
           (less old, less rich, still white dude) enter. 

                                 IYANA
                        Good morning, everyone. I hope 
                        you’ve helped yourself to 
                        breakfast. Young minds need fuel. 
                                 IYANA (CONT'D)
                        Please, allow me to introduce my 
                        cofounders of HLS, Reginald Harvey.

           Reginald nods his head to the group. 

                                 IYANA
                        And Patrick Larter. 

           Patrick also nods his head to the group. 

                                 IYANA
                        I’m Iyana Saw, welcome to HLS. 
                        We’ve paired you with mentors to 
                        guide you through the process. You 
                        all come from various backgrounds 
                        and were chosen among a highly 
                        selective pool. We believe that 
                        it’s important to diversify our 
                        staff in order to see the best 
                        that’s out there. Some of you are 
                        fresh from law or business school -

           Naomi looks around to see if anyone perked up at that. No one 
           else moved, but she also notices that once again she is the 
           only black person and one of only two women. 

                                 IYANA
                        Some of you from the banking world, 
                        and even someone from journalism. 

           Nick elbows Naomi and points to himself. He’s a real dork. 

                                 IYANA 
                        Thank you all for joining our 
                        mission. With your input, we will 
                        make smart choices in deciding the 
                        future and how we can help make 
                        sure that we all make it there 
                        together. We won’t keep you much 
                        longer, go forth and better our 
                        community. 

           The room halfheartedly claps and disperse to meet with their 
           mentors. Naomi looks around for hers when Iyana walks right 
           up to her. 

                                 IYANA
                        Miss Johnson. I’ll be your mentor 
                        during your initial orientation 
                        phase. 

           Iyana reaches out soft, cared-for hand out, Naomi shakes it 
           firmly. Iyana grins. 
                                 IYANA
                        Love a woman with a firm hand 
                        shake. Please, come with me. 

           We follow Iyana as she gives Naomi a walking tour of the 
           company. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - VARIOUS

           Iyana walks her around the office. 

                                 IYANA
                        Since your initial application, 
                        we’ve amended a few aspects of the 
                        company and have experience 
                        exponential growth since doing so. 
                        We’re now in the alumni stages for 
                        many of our initial investments.

                                 NAOMI
                        Already? It’s only been three years 
                        since HLS was founded. Impressive. 

                                 IYANA
                        Yes. Last year’s Q4 we had under 
                        $600 million in early stage 
                        developments with nineteen early 
                        stage deals. Our under management 
                        assets are around $1.9 million. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Jesus.

           As they walk through Naomi peeks through open offices, each 
           ranging in different styles from surfer chic to black and 
           white minimalism. No two offices are the same. 

                                 IYANA
                        As you know, our primary industries 
                        are media, software, and healthcare 
                        but we’re really open to new paths 
                        forged by our younger employees. 

                                 NAOMI
                        And first year associates can 
                        present options to the board?

                                 IYANA
                        Of course. As your time here grows, 
                        we want you to grow with your 
                        companies. 
                                 NAOMI
                        You want us to put down roots, 
                        smart. 

           Iyana stops in front of Naomi’s shared office, the other side 
           empty. 

                                 IYANA
                        And this is where you’ll start. 

           She shows her in. 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE. 

           It’s one of the smaller ones, and it’s simple but there’s a 
           beautiful view of the city and it’s all hers. 

                                 IYANA
                        Get to work, the world is waiting. 

           Iyana leaves. Naomi sits at her desk, beaming. Before she 
           gets too comfortable. There’s a knock on her office door and 
           Nick pops his head in.  

                                 NICK
                        Hey! Reginald’s treating new folks 
                        to an early lunch. You free?

                                 NAOMI
                        Free for free lunch? Hell yeah. 

                                 NICK
                        Noishe. Scoozi’s at 12:30.

           Nick leaves. 

           EXT. SCOOZI’S ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           Establishing of an upscale but casual dining lunch hot spot. 
           Naomi pulls up in front of the valet, dropping her car key 
           off and dashing inside, late for lunch. CPT (colored people 
           time, we always late.)

           INT. SCOOZI’S - HOSTESS STAND

           Naomi shuffles up to the front desk, winded. The HOSTESS (16) 
           smiles and greets her. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        Welcome to Scoozi’s. You entire 
                        party was just seated, followed me. 
           Naomi follows her into the restaurant. 

           INT. SCOOZI’S - MAIN DINING AREA

           The hostess leads Naomi over to a large, boisterous birthday 
           party. It’s a full table for a BLACK FAMILY. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        Here you are, your waitress will be 
                        right with you.  

           The hostess begins to turn away but Naomi grabs her by the 
           elbow.

                                 NAOMI
                        Excuse me. That’s not who I’m 
                        dining with. 

           The hostess bites her lip, worried. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        Oh. I’m s-sorry. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (pushing)
                        Why would you think I was here with 
                        them?

                                 HOSTESS
                        I just, well, I, I’m so so sorry. 

           Naomi shakes her head in disbelief. 

                                 NICK O.C.
                        Naomi, over here!

           Naomi sees Nick waving her over on the other side of the 
           restaurant. 

                                 NAOMI
                        See that table over there? That’s 
                        who I am dining with. 

           Naomi brushes past her. She quickly walks back to her stand, 
           ashamed. 

           INT. SCOOZI’S - PRIVATE ROOM

           Naomi joins Nick, Reginald, and three other associates at a 
           rectangular table, who talk amongst themselves. Reginald 
           clinks his water glass and stands.  
                                 REGINALD
                        Naomi, welcome. Everyone settle 
                        down. Thank you for joining me for 
                        lunch today. I always like to treat 
                        the newcomers on their first day to 
                        get acclimated, liquored up, what 
                        have you. 

           The group chuckles. 

                                 REGINALD
                        HLS is happy to have you and we 
                        want you to be happy. 

           Everyone raises their glass to that -- hear hear!  

                                 REGINALD
                        What makes me happy is embarrassing 
                        all of you and making you go around 
                        telling us a little about 
                        yourselves. Let’s start with you, 
                        young man. Tell us how you got 
                        here. 

           Reginald points his butter knife to ELI (early 30s, dark 
           features.) As Reginald sits, Eli stands. 

                                 ELI
                            (Inland North Ohioan 
                              accent)
                        My name is Eli. I played football 
                        for The Ohio State University and 
                        went on to get my business degree 
                        from The Ohio State University as 
                        well. Born and raised in Ohio. I’m 
                        allergic to peanuts. I made my 
                        first investment in my uncle’s 
                        software and today it’s worth about 
                        $287 million. 

           He sits down. Next to him is DANIEL (mid 30s, frail, still 
           carries silver spoon in mouth.)

                                 DANIEL
                        Daniel from Manhattan. I went to 
                        Princeton for undergrad, developed 
                        my own app and sold it two years 
                        ago  for an undisclosed amount. Mr. 
                        Larter is a family friend of mine 
                        and recommended I start my 
                        professional career at HLS. Here I 
                        am. 
           Daniel nods his head to Reginald and sits down. Next to him 
           is WHITNEY (late 20s, giraffe, “Big Eyes”-like blue eyes, 
           lightning white hair)

                                 WHITNEY
                        I’m Whitney. I prefer to be called 
                        Whitney. I have a masters in 
                        engineering from Cornell and I like 
                        problem solving. My roommate used 
                        to work at HLS and referred me. 

           Whitney bows her head and sits. Nick bumps the table as he 
           stands, shaking everyone’s glasses. 

                                 NICK
                        Whatsup, everyone. My name is Nick, 
                        I’m from Chicago. I was the 
                        journalism kid, decided I want to 
                        pursue VC insteada’ writin about 
                        it. Got my masters from 
                        Northwestern. Moved out here this 
                        past January. Uh... Go Cats! 

           He sits down. Naomi is last. She rises. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Naomi Johnson. I’m from Palo Alto. 
                        I agreed to take this job as long 
                        as my mother promised not to visit 
                        unannounced. 

           No one laughs. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I was pre-med at Harvard. Decided I 
                        was sick of Boston and sick of sick 
                        of people. Took a detour as  a 
                        Rhodes scholar, but English weather 
                        is the bane of my existence, so I 
                        went to Stanford and got my JD/MBA. 
                        Wanted to keep my options open. 

           People look around surprised. 

                                 ELI
                        And how do you know one of the 
                        partners. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t. Met them for the first 
                        time during my interview. 
           No other follow up questions. She sits back down as the 
           waiter arrives to take everyone’s orders. Eli leans in to 
           Daniel.

                                 ELI
                            (barely a whisper)
                        Diversity hire. 

           Daniel nods along, Naomi clocks this but chooses to ignore 
           it. 

           INT. SCOOZI’S - LATER

           People clean their plates and their mouths as they finish 
           lunch. A bottle of wine or two down, they seem a little more 
           relaxed. The waitress drops the bill back off and Reginald 
           signs it, putting the receipt into his coat pocket. He 
           stands. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        I don’t understand why they can’t 
                        just BAN him from twitter? Simply 
                        irresponsible.

                                 ELI
                        First amendment, freedom of speech. 
                        That’s why.  

           Nick interjects. This is something he counter argues often.

                                 NICK
                            (matter of fact)
                        The first amendment was established 
                        to prevent the government from 
                        punishing the people. Not the other 
                        way around. 

                                 ELI
                        You read that in your “New York 
                        Times?”

                                 REGINALD
                        Okay, okay. Let us get back to 
                        work. Use this... passion to fuel 
                        your ideas. Thank you for joining 
                        me.

           Reginald exits first and the rest scatter as they walk out to 
           their cars. 
           EXT. SCOOZI’S - VALET STAND

           Everyone’s left except Nick and Naomi who are mid-
           conversation as they wait for their cars.

                                 NICK
                        I cannot believe she sat you at the 
                        wrong table. You should say 
                        something to the manager or, better 
                        yet, Reginald. 

                                 NAOMI
                        No, no. I don’t want to be known as 
                        the complainer. 

           Nick shrugs. 

                                 NICK
                        Well can’t say lunch wasn’t fun, 
                        can we. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Both my lobster bisque and the 
                        people I was seated with were too 
                        rich. 

           He laughs. 

                                 NICK
                        Whatdya think so far?

                                 NAOMI
                        I think it’ll be interesting. I’m 
                        looking forward to it, I’ve been 
                        tracking some potential early 
                        stagers so we’ll see. You?

                                 NICK
                        I think good. It must be weird for 
                        you though, being the only one. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (defensive)
                        --How so?

                                 NICK
                        You’re probably the only person who 
                        actually earned their job offer.  

           He smiles, knowingly. Before she can respond, the valet comes 
           around in Nick’s Audi A8.  

                                 NAOMI
                        This you?
                                 NICK
                        Yep. Graduation gift from my 
                        stepmom. One whole summer of 
                        chauffeuring her to and from 
                        injectable appointments as penance. 

           The other valet drives up in Naomi’s BMW X3. 

                                 NICK
                        This you?

                                 NAOMI
                        Graduation gift from myself. Two 
                        whole summers of life-guarding.

                                 NICK
                            (playfully)
                        So black people can swim. 
                        Fascinating. 

           She hits him.

                                 NAOMI
                            (stern)
                        Hey!
                            (playfully)
                        Didn’t say I was good. 

           He smiles and gets into his car. She tips the valet and gets 
           into hers and goes back to work.

           INT. HLS OFFICE - HALLWAY

           CHYRON: SIX WEEKS LATER

           Naomi walks through the hallway. She seems at ease, greeting 
           co-workers as she walks by. NED (30s, painfully white) stops 
           her. 

                                 NED
                        Hey -- see you at flag football 
                        this weekend? We need our QB.

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes, but I think my days as QB are 
                        over, my shoulder is still crazy 
                        sore from last week’s game. 

                                 NED
                        Work it, girlfraand. 

           Naomi nods along. She continues walking but is sidestepped by 
           a second co-worker, SHARON (real big loser). 
                                 SHARON
                        Naomi, I meant to tell you! Travis 
                        and I watched the first episode of 
                        “Frasier” this weekend. It’s like, 
                        SO, funny. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Sharon, I told you. You have to 
                        start with “Cheers” first. To fully 
                        grasp his essence.

           Co-Worker 2 pulls out her phone and types into it. 

                                 SHARON
                        It’s called Cheers? Okay, we’ll do 
                        that. Thanks!

           Sharon scuttles away as Naomi heads into her office. 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE 

           She walks in and plops down at her desk. Her things are 
           slowly overflowing onto the vacant other side of it. Iyana 
           knocks and walks in.

                                 NAOMI
                        Afternoon, Iyana. How’re you?

           She closes the door behind her. 

                                 IYANA
                        Well, thank you. 

           She sits at the chair across from Naomi. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Everything okay?

                                 IYANA
                        Yes of course. I just wanted to 
                        check in and see how things were 
                        progressing. A little over a month 
                        in, how are things going for you?

                                 NAOMI
                            (gushing)
                        Honestly, I love it. Everyone’s 
                        been super helpful and inviting. 
                        Our flag football team is pretty 
                        terrible but I’ve learned a year’s 
                        worth of gossip at our post game 
                        happy hour. Mr. Saw has witnessed a 
                        lot of infidelity.  
           A beat. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh, the actual job. That is also 
                        great!

           Naomi rummages through her messy desk looking for something. 
           She spots a folder and pulls it out, handing it to Iyana. 

                                 NAOMI
                        In fact, I’ve been looking at some 
                        early stage companies that could 
                        use a little HLS love. There’s this 
                        company, Bio-Fuse, which is outside 
                        of our primary industries but --

                                 IYANA
                        --That’s great. Really. I encourage 
                        your approach to take initiative. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Great! So Bio-Fuse’s statement is --

                                 IYANA
                        -- that being said, and this 
                        company sounds very promising, I 
                        would like to assign you to another 
                        company. 

           Iyana reaches into her purse and pulls out a mini TABLET, 
           handing it to her. Naomi reads off the screen. 

                                 NAOMI
                        “HEAL: There’s a right way to 
                        recover.”  

                                 IYANA
                        The Health and Environmental 
                        Advocacy League. They’ve been 
                        brought to my attention by a 
                        colleague and they’re looking to 
                        work with some of our younger 
                        associates. Someone who can grow 
                        with them. I think you’d be 
                        perfect.

           Naomi is taken aback. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Me?
                                 IYANA
                        Yes. You. Is there reason to 
                        believe this is not of interest or 
                        capability?

                                 NAOMI
                        NO. No. This sounds perfect, I’m 
                        ecstatic you thought of me. 

                                 IYANA
                        I think they’ll be a lucrative 
                        investment for this company in the 
                        upcoming year and frankly... woman 
                        to woman, I want to help you. I 
                        want you to succeed. We should be 
                        looking out for one another.

                                 NAOMI
                        Woman to woman, I agree. Thank you.

           She mulls on it, still unsure.

                                 IYANA
                        It won’t be easy: long hours, a lot 
                        of travel between here and New York 
                        where they’re based, and highly 
                        risky career-wise. But! With 
                        potential for high reward. The 
                        founder is in town and I’d like you 
                        to have dinner with him this 
                        weekend to gauge mutual interest. 

                                 NAOMI
                        This weekend? That’s, well, very 
                        soon. If I’m being honest, I’m 
                        hesitant to take on a company 
                        that’s established and already a 
                        series C. I was hoping to do the 
                        “start small and learn from that” 
                        kind of thing. Especially working 
                        alone -- I wouldn’t want to take on 
                        more than I chew. Bite off more 
                        than I can eat? You get it.

                                 IYANA
                        Of course, but you will not be 
                        alone. We have a new hire coming in 
                        from our New York office, Ben. He 
                        officially transfers this week and 
                        he will be taking the other half of 
                        this office. 

           Iyana stands and walks out of the room for a moment. Naomi 
           quickly drags her shit back to her side of the desk. 
                                 IYANA O.C.
                        Ben!

           Iyana re-enters. 

                                 IYANA
                        Yes, you may want to re-distribute 
                        your belongings.

           There’s a knock on the door. The door opens and in walks BEN 
           aka BEARDED DUDE! However, he is now freshly shaven and even 
           more of a smokeshow. Good for him. He holds two hangers with 
           DRY CLEANED CLOTHES, and folds them over the back of their 
           shared couch. Upon seeing him, Naomi knocks over a full glass 
           of water on her desk, spilling water everywhere. He rushes to 
           help clean up. 

                                 IYANA
                        Naomi Johnson this is Ben 
                        Skarsgard. Ben, this is Naomi; your 
                        new office mate. 

           He puts his hand out. 

                                 BEN
                        It’s nice to meet you. 

           Does he recognize her? She shakes his hand while wiping up 
           water. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah, nice to meet you too... 

                                 IYANA
                        I’ll let you two get familiar, but 
                        Ben has already agreed to dinner. 
                        Naomi, let me know as soon as 
                        possible what your decision is. 

           Iyana leaves. Ben and Naomi kind of just stare at each other. 

                                 NAOMI
                        So, uh. Heeeeeyyyy.

                                 BEN
                        You don’t mind if I put those 
                        shirts there, do you? 

           She shakes her head no. 

                                 BEN
                        You look familiar. Do I know you 
                        from Yale?
                                 NAOMI
                        No, we uh, hung out like a month 
                        ago. 

           Ben moves to organize his desk. 

                                 BEN
                        Hung out? Are you a family friend?

           This is pure torture.

                                 NAOMI
                        Not exactly. I’m, like, kind of a 
                        friend? We met at that Whiskey Bar 
                        that one night. 

                                 BEN
                        Ah yes yes, of course. 

           She can breathe again. 

                                 NICK
                        You’re Todd’s girlfriend! Yes, nice 
                        to see you again. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (exploding)
                        No, dude! We had sex. 

           He breaks into laughter. 

                                 BEN
                        I know.

           He tries to contain himself. 

                                 BEN
                        I wanted to see how long it would 
                        take you. That was fun. 

           She throws a pen at him. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Fuck you.

           They both chuckle. They then stop and it’s awkward for a sec. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ....Okay, so what’s happening now? 
                        Did you live here a month ago? How 
                        did we not cover the job sitch?
                                 BEN
                        You’re the one who said you didn’t 
                        want to talk about work! That 
                        weekend I was in town signing a 
                        lease and finalizing my contract. I 
                        too was out celebrating. 

                                 NAOMI
                        These fates are cruel. 

                                 BEN
                        If I recall, they were cruel twice.

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay, okay, let’s not. This is my 
                        place of business.  

                                 BEN
                            (switching gears)
                        Dinner this weekend with this old 
                        fart - you in?

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah, I don’t know. 

                                 BEN
                        Are you crazy? HEAL is rumored to 
                        blow up next year and they are 
                        HANDING it us. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay sure, yeah, when you put it 
                        like that. But what if we drop the 
                        ball and blow it? 

                                 BEN
                        I don’t drop balls. I carry them. 
                        Or throw them. Like Tom Brady.

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t remember you being this 
                        cocky. 

           He opens his mouth for rebuttal but she beats him to it. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t be cute. 

           He shuts his mouth. A moment later.  
                                 BEN
                        I think it’ll be great. If what 
                        I’ve heard about you is true, 
                        you’re a fucking shark slash 
                        braniac overachiever and you should 
                        be salivating over this. 

                                 NAOMI
                        “Shark” has a negative connotation. 
                        Braniac overachiever will be fine 
                        on its own.   

           Ben grabs his bag. His phone rings, and he looks at the 
           caller. He answers. 

                                 BEN
                            (into phone)
                        Hey, give me one second. 
                            (to Naomi)
                        Okay, whatever, I’ve got to take 
                        this. I will see you later, desk 
                        buddy. 

           He moves to the door to leave, but turns around. 

                                 BEN
                        Sleep on it. In your bed. Unless, 
                        there’s someone else in it. 

           He raises his eyebrows suggestively. She throws another pen 
           at him. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Get out!

           He leaves. She sits back in her chair, flushed as fuck. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Duuuuuuuude.

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

           Naomi enters the apartment with bags of CHINESE TAKEOUT from 
           a local dive restaurant called Mama Chen’s. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Bish where you at? Mama brought 
                        home Mama Chen’s.

           She walks into the kitchen and starts unpacking the food. 
           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Diane enters, still in her ladysuit from work. She plops down 
           at the dining table, waiting to be served. 

                                 NAOMI
                        How was your day Miss Thang?

                                 DIANE
                        Like, I kind of want to kill myself 
                        but then I know my ghost would be 
                        so mad at all this money I got in 
                        the bank. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t be silly. I’d take it. That’s 
                        friendship.

                                 DIANE
                        Coo coo, glad you’ve got ma back. 

           Naomi puts the food out like a buffet and grabs plates and 
           silverware for them. 

                                 DIANE
                        Things are fine. Sister gotta 
                        hustle, you know how it is. Old Man 
                        McHenry asked me what I was today. 

                                 NAOMI
                        People can’t be doing that. Obama 
                        only left office a year ago. 

                                 DIANE
                        I told him I was Creole. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Pssh, you African as fuck. 

                                 DIANE
                        He don’t know the difference. I 
                        told him that and swear to Beyonce, 
                        he nodded, leaned in, and told me 
                        he was “this” close to getting on a 
                        plane to help his “good friend” 
                        Sean in Haiti.

                                 NAOMI
                        HA!

           They dole out food on their plates and dig in, starved. 

                                 DIANE
                        How was your day, boo?
                                 NAOMI
                        OH like LOL, forgot to text you. 
                        Remember that sexy beard-o who came 
                        home with me like a month ago?

           Diane purses her lips.

                                 DIANE
                        He finished the toilet paper and 
                        did not replace the roll, but like, 
                        whatever. Yes, I recall. 

                                 NAOMI
                        HE WORKS AT HLS NOW. 

           Diane, mid bite, drops her mouth and a piece of Sweet and 
           Sour Chicken rolls right out. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Girl, check yaself. 

                                 DIANE
                        Put this thing in reverse, and back 
                        the fuck up. What do you mean “he 
                        works at HLS now?”

                                 NAOMI
                        Get this -- the night we met, he 
                        was in town signing a lease. He 
                        just moved from New York and now we 
                        are coemployees. 

                                 DIANE
                        Wack. Follow up question, will you 
                        see him around the office?

                                 NAOMI
                        Who knows? I mean, we kind of share 
                        an office now...

                                 DIANE
                        You can’t share an office with 
                        someone you’ve shared bodily fluids 
                        with. 

           Naomi gestures to her Miso Soup. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Can you not? 

                                 DIANE
                        Wild. Just wild. You win for best 
                        day. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah. Oh and Iyana wants me to 
                        partner up with him to lead this 
                        HEAL company for a potential 
                        investment. 

           Diane smacks the fork out of Naomi’s hand.

                                 DIANE
                        Bish! Why didn’t you lead with 
                        that? That’s incredible!!!! 
                        Congratulations!!!!

                                 NAOMI
                        Ugh that was a really thick piece!

           She bends down to pick the fork up and continues to eat with 
           it. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I haven’t accepted. I was invited 
                        to meet the founder for dinner, 
                        with Ben this --

                                 DIANE
                        Homeboy’s name is Ben?

           Naomi nods sheepishly. 

                                 DIANE
                        It would be. Continue. 

                                 NAOMI
                        So I’m supposed to meet them for 
                        dinner, but I’m on the fence. 

                                 DIANE
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 NAOMI
                        What if it’s weird working with 
                        him? I don’t want to bite off more 
                        than I can chew -- ah! That’s the 
                        saying. I couldn’t think of it 
                        earlier. 

                                 DIANE
                        Listen to me. You the only sista up 
                        in there and they are GIVING you a 
                        piece of success. This is the dream 
                        scenario. Fuck Ben, scratch that 
                        you already did that. Don’t think 
                        about him, think about yourself. Do 
                        what you need to do to succeed.
           Diane then purses her lips, makes a stern face, and starts 
           swishing her hair.

                                 NAOMI

                        Yes. Yes, I do. 

                                 DIANE
                        Now pass me some Mongolian Beef.

           They continue to eat, rehashing the rest of their days.

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Naomi gets into bed with her laptop. She does some googling 
           on HEAL and reads from their website. It looks legit. She 
           gets a text from her mom, Naomi reads it. 

                                 PATRICIA (TEXT)
                        Diane told me about Heal!!!

           She closes out of her phone and puts it on her night stand. 
           She gets another text.

                                 PATRICIA (TEXT)
                        !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           And another. 

                                 PATRICIA (TEXT)
                        *KISSY EMOJI*

           And another.

                                 PATRICIA (TEXT)
                        You’ll be running that company in 
                        no time. Proud of you!!!!!!

           Naomi can’t help but smile. She texts her mom back.

                                 NAOMI (TEXT)
                        That’s not how this company 
                        works... but thank you. Goodnight!

           She scrolls through her messages and pulls up her text 
           conversation with Iyana. She starts to type and we see the 
           conversation:
                                 NAOMI (TEXT)
                        So...what time is dinner?

           Within seconds, Iyana replies. 

                                 IYANA (TEXT)
                        7:00PM. Mastro’s. Welcome aboard. 
                        *THUMB’S UP EMOJI*

           She clicks her phone off. She hears it vibrate again, sees 
           it’s more emojis from her mom. She puts the laptop on the 
           floor, turns her lamp off and goes to sleep.

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Dressed in a flattering, but professional dress, Naomi hops 
           around her bedroom looking for her other HEEL. She’s getting 
           ready for dinner. Her phone buzzes. She hops to her 
           nightstand to see a text from a new number. 

                                 TEXT
                        Hey, it’s Ben. Want a ride to 
                        dinner? You’re on my way.

           She thinks for a second, then replies.

                                 NAOMI (TEXT)
                        How do you know where I live, 
                        stalker?

           She then remembers how and as she’s typing, he calls her. She 
           picks up. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes, I know how you know. Never 
                        mind.

           INT. UBER - SAME

           Ben sits in the backseat of the car. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN NAOMI AND BEN

                                 BEN
                        I’m hurt you could forget. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Was that all?
                                 BEN
                        Do you want a ride? I’m in an uber 
                        and kinda sorta in your 
                        neighborhood.

                                 NAOMI
                        That would be great. What’s your 
                        ETA?

           Ben looks at his watch. 

                                 BEN
                        Now?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Ben’s uber is outside of her apartment. Naomi looks out 
           through a window and waves. 

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - SAME

           She puts him on speakerphone and puts the phone on her bed. 
           She finds her heel under her bed. She grabs it and a purse.

                                 NAOMI
                        In the neighborhood, huh?

                                 BEN O.S.
                        Kinda sorta. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Goodbye. 

           She hangs up, turns her light off, and runs out through the 
           apartment.

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Diane is watching a movie on the couch. She turns her head, 
           watching as Naomi runs out. 

                                 DIANE
                        My girl’s all grownsed up! Go get 
                        em!
           INT. UBER - A FEW SECONDS LATER

           Naomi gets into the car and slides over next to Ben. He looks 
           her over. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Nice shirt. 

                                 BEN
                        Right from the dry cleaner, I like 
                        em fresh and pressed. You look 
                        beautiful. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I know.

           He smirks as they sit in padded silence on the way to dinner.

           EXT. MASTRO'S STEAK HOUSE

           Their uber pulls up outside of an upscale American 
           steakhouse. Ben gets out street side, runs over and opens 
           Naomi’s door, letting her out. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Someone’s feeling chivalrous. 

                                 BEN
                        Ladies always come first. 

           She rolls her eyes and heads into the restaurant. 

           INT. MASTRO'S STEAK HOUSE - ENTRYWAY

           The restaurant is quiet though relatively packed with a more 
           elegant, older clientele. Naomi holds the door for Ben and 
           they walk over to the HOST (mid 30s, clean cut.) 

                                 BEN
                        Skarsgard, party of three. 

           The host looks through his book and finds them. 

                                 HOST
                        Yes, welcome. A member of your 
                        party is already here. Right this 
                        way. 

           They follow the host into the restaurant. 
                                 NAOMI
                        We never discussed that, but 
                        Skarsgard? Really? That cannot 
                        possibly be your last name. 

                                 BEN
                        It can and it is. I’m like a little 
                        Swedish Fish. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re more like an Air Head. 

           The host leads them to a four-top table where LAWRENCE MARTIN 
           (60s, silver moose, smells of freshly printed money) 
           overlooks a wine menu. He sees them and rises. 

                                 HOST
                        Enjoy your evening. 

           The host leaves. Ben walks over to Lawrence and shakes his 
           hand.

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Lawrence Martin, nice to finally 
                        meet you. 

                                 BEN
                        Ben Skarsgard, the pleasure is all 
                        mine Mr. Martin. 

           Naomi then steps forward and Lawrence gives her a full body 
           look. She reaches out her hand. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Naomi Johnson, Mr. Martin. Thank 
                        you for meeting with us. 

           He shakes her hand and pulls her in for a kiss on the cheek, 
           which throws her off guard. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh! Thank you. 

           She blushes. Lawrence pulls her chair out for her and she 
           sits. Ben and Lawrence sit down. 

                                 BEN
                        We are excited to sit down with you 
                        sir, HEAL is really making some 
                        headway. 
                                 LAWRENCE
                        As am I. But, please, save the shop 
                        talk for after we have drinks, Mr. 
                        Skarsgard. I’ve only had my first 
                        glass. 

           He shakes his wine glass that has a few drops of Pinot Noir 
           left in it. 

                                 BEN
                        Of course. 

           Lawrence looks for their server, raises his wine glass and 
           shakes it indicating he’d like another. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Skarsgard you said? Swedish?

                                 BEN
                        Bit of a mutt, but mostly Swedish 
                        and English. 

           Lawrence nods approvingly. He looks to Naomi. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        And what are you?

           Naomi knew this would come up, she smiles graciously. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m a little Native American, a 
                        little Irish, and a lot west 
                        African. That last one was a reaaal 
                        surprise. 

           She chuckles. It takes Ben and Lawrence to get it, but then 
           they laugh along with her. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Very good, very good. You’re very 
                        pretty for a black girl. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh, um, thank you. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        You know what I mean. There are 
                        some not very pretty women of 
                        color, but you, you’re very pretty. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank... you.
           Ben restrains laughter opting to kick her leg under the table 
           instead. The SERVER comes over, ready to take their orders. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        If you don’t mind, I’m happy to 
                        order for the table. 

                                 BEN
                        Be our guest, Mr. Martin. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Ben, you can call me Larry. 

                                 BEN
                        Alrighty. Be our guest, Larry. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Do you both eat meat?

                                 BEN
                        Naomi sure does. 

           Under the table, she kicks him back. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Wonderful. 

           Lawrence turns his attention back to the server. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        We’ll start with the snow crab 
                        claws and Tuna Tartare. We’ll have 
                        the rack of lamb, a New York Strip, 
                        and the twin lobster tails. On the 
                        side, an order of the garlic 
                        mashed, sauteed mushrooms, and 
                        steamed broccoli. Please

           The server scribbles down quickly. Lawrence turns back to 
           Naomi and Ben. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        And what will you two be having?

           He laughs too hard at his joke, they play along. 

                                 SERVER
                        Anything to drink for either of 
                        you?

                                 NAOMI
                        I’ll try the elderflower martini, 
                        please. Thank you. 
           Ben looks over the wine list, undecided. He snaps the book 
           shut. 

                                 BEN
                        You know what, I’ll have the same. 

           Naomi gives him a look. 

                                 SERVER
                        Excellent, I’ll be right back with 
                        those. Thank you. 

           The server leaves. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Okay. Let’s talk shop. Why do you 
                        want us and why do I want you?

                                 NAOMI
                        Ms. Saw, Mr. Harvey, and Mr. Larter 
                        each come from a strong background 
                        of investment success. Their total 
                        acquired amounts from investments 
                        in the past five years alone 
                        surpass $1.9 billion and their 
                        dedication to expand is 
                        insurmountable. 

                                 BEN
                        If we’re being straightforward, 
                        HEAL is a mature company. You’re 
                        producing sales, profits and cash 
                        flow. You don’t need us, but you 
                        should have someone managing the 
                        company’s growth. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        I’ve already got a team in place. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Right now, it’s really just you and 
                        your VP. Your company is growing at 
                        an exponential rate. Now is the 
                        time to assemble a management team 
                        to execute your business plan more 
                        efficiently. We can help you do 
                        that. 

                                 BEN
                        We would rather invest in a bad 
                        idea led by an accomplished team 
                        than the opposite. Lucky for you, 
                        we specialize in making good ideas 
                        come together with good teams. 
           Lawrence mulls this over as the server returns to fill his 
           wine glass and drops off the martinis. They each take their 
           glass and Lawrence raises his. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        A toast to you both. You have 
                        captured my interest. 

           Ben and Naomi look at each other, pleased. They toast their 
           glasses and each sip. Ben winces at his martini. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (talking down)
                        Aww, is it too strong for you?

                                 BEN
                        Nope, it’s just perfect. I love, 
                        elderflower.  

           She takes a big sip without flinching and lets the drink coat 
           her mouth. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Fabulous. 

           They continue to talk. 

           INT. MASTRO'S STEAK HOUSE - LATER

           Empty plates are scattered on the table. A snow crab here, a 
           sliced cut of steak there. Ben has switched to a whiskey 
           neat. They each look spent and full. Lawrence finishes up a 
           joke.

                                 LAWRENCE
                        So the driver looks him dead in the 
                        eye and says: “Sir your question is 
                        so easy that I’m going to let my 
                        driver answer it for me!”

           The three of them break out into laughter. Ben adds a little 
           touch by wiping away a tear with his napkin. 

                                 BEN
                        Larry, what a joke, what a meal, 
                        what a night. I won’t be able to 
                        eat another thing for the rest of 
                        the weekend. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Great. That’ll give you time to 
                        start making adjustments to HEAL’s 
                        business plan.  
                                 NAOMI
                        Does this mean you’re in?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        I’m in.

           He smiles as the server drops off the bill. They each go to 
           grab it, but Lawrence prevails. He hands his AMEX over and 
           server leaves.   

                                 LAWRENCE
                        I got this. If I expense it, you’re 
                        still technically paying for it. 

                                 BEN
                        You make a fair point, we’ll let 
                        you have it this time. 

           The server returns with the receipt. As soon as Lawrence 
           signs and puts the card back in his wallet, he grabs his coat 
           and stands to leave. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank you for such a wonderful 
                        evening. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Truly my pleasure. 

           They shake hands and he turns her hand over and pats it with 
           his other. Ben stands to shake goodbye. With that, Lawrence 
           leaves. Ben and Naomi sit back at the table to finish their 
           drinks. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Well he was interesting. 

                                 BEN
                        Can people still ask you what you 
                        are?

                                 NAOMI
                        No, no they cannot. 

           They both laugh. 

                                 BEN
                        That went well, good job kid. I’ll 
                        text our group chat with Iyana to 
                        update her. 

           He pulls his phone out of his pocket, sees a text and makes a 
           face. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Everything okay?

                                 BEN
                        Yep. Just some... New York stuff 
                        I’m sorting out. 

           Ben concentrates on texting and Naomi can’t help but stare at 
           him, seeing him in a new light. He’s gone from “funny, white-
           boy dancing, Whiskey bar guy” to “charming, articulate, work 
           guy.” 

                                 BEN
                        ....And sent. I am officially off 
                        the clock. Toast to that my friend. 

           He raises his whiskey glass. She raises her martini class and 
           they cheers, sipping without breaking eye contact. A PASSERBY 
           bumps into Naomi’s chair, and she spills a bit of her martini 
           on her shirt and gets a little splash on her face.  

                           NAOMI
                                                           BEN
                 (to the passerby)
                                                (to the passerby)
           Excuse you!
                                              Excuse you!

           Naomi dabs at her shirt, making sure it doesn’t stain. Ben 
           scootches closer and uses his napkin to dry off her cheek. He 
           pauses before doing so, asking permission with his eyes. He 
           gently wipes away a splash of drink, and they both get 
           shocked. 

                           NAOMI
                                                           BEN
           Eep!
                                              Oooh!

           They both laugh and shake it off. 

                                 BEN
                        That’s a good way to describe you. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What? Frequently spilled on. 

                                 BEN
                        No, electric. You’ve got this, 
                        this, spark about you. It’s... 
                        intoxicating. 

           He moves closer to her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ben, listen. We work together now. 
                        We should keep things, you know, 
                        super platon.
           He moves even closer. 

                                 BEN
                        Mmm hmm. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Even though women don’t actually 
                        have bowel movements, I don’t like 
                        to shit where I eat. 

                                 BEN
                        Right. 

           He gently moves a piece of loose hair behind her ear. He’s 
           hella close to her now. Her defense is weakening, the poor 
           girl. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (scrambling)
                        We share an office. We can share 
                        notes, and pencils, and pens, but I 
                        think sharing beds is bad news. 
                        Sharing kisses is super bad news.

                                 BEN
                        Totally. 

           His hand is on her thigh now. She’s a goner. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I mean, God is always, watching. 
                        Santa too. 

                                 BEN
                        Ho, ho, ho. 

           He puts his hand on her face, their lips are centimeters from 
           each other. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I guess it’s like, okay, if you 
                        spend the night. You know, in case 
                        Lawrence has any questions. Or I 
                        have questions... or you have 
                        questions. 

           He nods. She kisses him. It’s a good, juicy, liquored-up one. 
           He stands, pulls her chair out for her, grabs her hand and 
           leads her out of the restaurant.  

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re paying for the uber. 
                                 BEN
                        As you wish. 

           They leave the restaurant. 

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - 4AM ISH

           Naomi and Ben lie in bed, recuperating. Her room looks like 
           it smells like sweat. He faces her. He pokes her nose.

                                 BEN
                        Boop. 

           She rolls over, facing away from him. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay, good night. 

           He pulls her in, making her little spoon. 

                                 BEN
                        Goodnight. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ben? Can I ask you something?

           After a moment, he whispers into her ear. 

                                 BEN
                        This is Dr. Frasier Crane. I’m 
                        listening. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Can this be, just like a two-night 
                        stand thing? I don’t like business 
                        and pleasure.

           She turns to face him, earnestly. 

                                 BEN
                        That can be exactly what it is. 
                        Never again.

           She turns away again. He pulls her in close again. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay good. Never again. 

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - OUTSIDE HER BEDROOM DOOR

           Diane has her ear to the bedroom door, in her pajamas, eating 
           out of an ice cream carton.
                                 DIANE
                            (to herself)
                        Ya welcome, bish.

           She cackles to herself and schleps back to her bedroom. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - FITNESS CENTER - A FEW WEEKS LATER

           Naomi runs on the treadmill while watching CNN. Nick walks in 
           and sees her, he jots over and starts to walk on the 
           treadmill next to her. When she sees him, she takes off her 
           headphones and decreases her pace. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (winded)
                        Hey you. 

                                 NICK
                        Morning, morning. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t usually see you here, 
                        starting your New Years resolutions 
                        a few months early?

                                 NICK
                        Last week a button popped on my 
                        shirt, so here I am. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ha! Well, welcome. We’re happy to 
                        have you. 

           He increases his pace to match hers.

                                 NICK
                        I heard you pulled the plug on 
                        HEAL. With Ben. 

           At the mention of his name, she blushes. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah, finalized the seed amount 
                        last week.

                                 NICK
                        I don’t think I’ve ever seen you 
                        blush.

                                 NAOMI
                        Blushing? I’m not blushing. I just 
                        ran six miles, I’m hella flushed 
                        from fitness maybe. 
                                 NICK
                        Sure, that makes sense. 

           She decreases her speed to a slow walk to cool down. 

                                 NICK
                        I’d uh, just be careful with that 
                        guy. 

                                 NAOMI
                        That guy? He is dork from 
                        Connecticut with tendonitis, not a 
                        hitman. 

                                 NICK
                        I’m just saying. When I worked at 
                        The Post, I saw a lot of horror 
                        stories with how guys like him 
                        treated women like,

           He catches himself. 

                                 NICK
                        Just how some macho guys can 
                        behave. All aggressive and 
                        territorial and stuff. You know?

                                 NAOMI
                        He’s harmless. He can barely 
                        conceal his receding hairline. 
                        Besides, nothing’s going on anyway. 

                                 NICK
                        Okay. 

           There’s an pause. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (sincere)
                        But thank you for the counsel, I 
                        appreciate it. 

           He is winded from his quick walk and slows down to barely a 
           walk. 

                                 NICK
                        Don’t mention it. Hey! I remember 
                        you brought up that company Bio-
                        Fuse a little while ago. I was 
                        looking into it, and I think you’re 
                        right. I would love to get some 
                        money into it. 
                                 NAOMI
                        Really? I brought it up to Iyana 
                        and it was a swift decline. 

                                 NICK
                        Don’t give up on it. You’re a 
                        shark!

                                 NAOMI
                        I think Shark has a negative 
                        connotation so... you’re right. 
                        I’ve had my head so far up the HEAL 
                        ass I completely forgot about it. 
                        We should develop a presentation 
                        and bring it to the partners.  

                                 NICK
                        That’s a great idea. If we can put 
                        together a strong case, maybe 
                        they’ll let us do it. Nice, nice, 
                        niiiiiice. 

           She stops the treadmill and hops off, toweling down her face. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Let’s do it after work, I’m free 
                        today? 

                                 NICK
                        Deal. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Have a great workout, I’ll see you 
                        later!

           She leaves. As soon as she’s out of sight, he turns off the 
           treadmill and chugs from his water, toweling his own sweaty 
           face.

           A) INT. NAOMI AND BEN’S OFFICE - DAY - Naomi and Ben sit at 
           their desks researching on the computers, every so often 
           exchanging glances and throwing things at each other. 

           B) INT. NICK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - Naomi and Nick take turns 
           scribbling things down on a big whiteboard under the words 
           “Bio-Fuse.” She gets a text from her mom: “Hi!! Hope Bio 
           Fusion is going well! I LOVE YOU!” She closes out of it and 
           goes back to scribbling.

           C) INT. HLS OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - Naomi, Ben, Nick, and 
           other associates listen during a morning meeting. Ben stands 
           and walks around to present their updates. 
           As he passes Naomi, he drops a slip of paper on the floor. 
           She discretely picks it up, opens it and reads it: “Ass on 
           point today.” She smiles, folding it and putting it in her 
           pocket. Nick clocks this.

           D) INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY - Naomi, Ben, Lawrence and his VP, 
           CHADWICK (Early 40s, pink faced) on a flight to New York 
           discuss strategy as a flight attendant serves them gourmet 
           sandwiches. Ben is texting on his phone between bites.

           E) INT. MAREA SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT - Naomi, Ben, 
           Lawrence, JEFF BEZOS, and 50 CENT, dine out together. 
           Everyone’s having a gay old time. 

           F) EXT. MAREA - Lawrence and others peel off in cabs as Naomi 
           and Ben wait outside of the restaurant. When Lawrence 
           disappears, Ben grabs Naomi’s hand, pulls her in and kisses 
           her. They walk hand-in-hand down the street alongside Central 
           Park. 

           G) INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING - Ben rolls out of the bathroom 
           in a towel, drying off his hair. He gets dressed, kisses 
           Naomi on the cheek as she reads in bed and leaves, while 
           taking a phone call. She looks to the door, pensive, then 
           back to the book on her lap. 

           H) INT. JOHNSON HOME - VARIOUS
           Naomi drops by home every now and then to appease her mother 
           for events she’s hosting for friends: birthday parties, 
           bridal showers, baby showers, etc. Whenever Naomi is in the 
           middle of something her mother drags her away to introduce 
           her to someone and brag about her successes.   

           I) INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Naomi stumbles into her room, exhausted. She plops down onto 
           her bed. 

           END OF MONTAGE

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Nick and Naomi are looking over their presentation, ready to 
           give it at the morning meeting. 

                                 NICK
                        I feel good, I feel ready. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Me too. We’ve got some hella good 
                        shit right here. 
                                 NICK
                        World is at our feet. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Well I think my feet are numb and 
                        my shoes are filling with blood. 

           Nick looks at her HIGH HEELS, a signature red bottom. 

                                 NICK
                        Damn. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Damn is right. I’m gonna double 
                        check the USB, meet you there in a 
                        second. 

           She taps away at the computer as Ben glides in, with his dry-
           cleaned shirts. He lays them on the couch. She perks up. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Look what the cat dragged in. 

           He begins to take his shirt off and changes into the clean 
           shirt. 

                                 BEN
                        Meow. 

           She focuses back on the computer. 

                                 BEN
                        You and St. Nick presenting Bio-
                        Fuse today?

                                 NAOMI
                        Be nice. And yes. 

           He buttons up his shirt. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’ve never seen anyone more 
                        obsessed with an ironed shirt.

                                 BEN
                        Man’s gotta look good. I’m flying 
                        out to New York shortly. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Again?

                                 BEN
                        Again. Walk you to the conference 
                        room. 
           He pats her butt, she jumps and giggles, swatting his hand 
           away. She ejects the USB and they walk out. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Ben takes an open seat next to Reginald and Naomi grabs a 
           seat next to Nick. 

                                 PATRICK
                            (stern)
                        Good morning everyone, I trust 
                        you’ve been busy. Just some 
                        housekeeping items. 
                            (light)
                        Celebrations are in order. Our flag 
                        football team qualified for the 
                        silicon recreational playoffs for 
                        the first time.

           Everyone snaps. 

                                 PATRICK
                        So congratulations to all. The 
                        final game will be next Saturday 
                        before we take our winter holiday.  

                                 IYANA
                        And speaking of winter holidays, we 
                        look forward to seeing you all 
                        tomorrow night at our annual 
                        holiday party. As a reminder... it 
                        would be best if you did not 
                        overserve yourself. No one wants a 
                        repeat of last year’s festivities. 

           People all look to BRAD (Early 30s, a burly gentleman) who 
           looks to the floor. 

                                 REGINALD
                        Moving on. Does anyone have any 
                        companies they’d like us to look 
                        into. 

           Naomi clears her throat and stands. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Nick and I have something we’d like 
                        to present to the board. 

           Nick stands and attaches his iPad to the computer and 
           projects their presentation on the white screen at the head 
           of the table. 
           She notices that as soon as she stands, the majority of the 
           room slump in their chairs, looking plagued by having to sit 
           through this. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Iyana, I mentioned to you a few 
                        months ago my interest in a 
                        Biological tech company called Bio-
                        Fuse that’s based right out of San 
                        Francisco. Nuclear fusion may be 
                        the key to clean, endless power for 
                        everything from our cars to our 
                        apartments to an entire city. Bio-
                        Fuse is attempting to produce such 
                        energy to harness in a safe, 
                        accessible way.

           As she speaks, Nick manages the slides to coordinate with her 
           points. 

                                 NAOMI
                        My interest has not waned, and in 
                        fact, since bringing it up, they’ve 
                        raised an impressive amount of pre-
                        seed capital. The price-to-earnings 
                        ratio is steadily increasing and we 
                        can buy in for a nominal fee that 
                        will be sure to double in the 
                        upcoming years. 

                                 NICK
                        Bio-Fuse will target a large 
                        marketable chunk of business and is 
                        expected to deliver large returns 
                        to its small number of current 
                        investors. 

           Naomi notices the room isn’t giving her their full attention. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (a little louder)
                        As you can see, we’ve measured, 
                        evaluated, and tried to minimize 
                        risk by examining competitive 
                        initial investments compared to 
                        what else is out there and --

           Iyana stands and interrupts. 

                                 IYANA
                        Thank you, Naomi and Nick. This is 
                        all quite thorough. Leave the drive 
                        with my assistant and we’ll look it 
                        over. 
           She is a little stunned to be interrupted. She looks to Nick 
           who just shrugs. They unplug and sit back down. 

                                 PATRICK
                        Thank you for that. Anyone else?

           Brad stands and sets up his presentation. Naomi looks 
           disappointed. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Naomi lingers by the door talking to Nick, as people file 
           out. 

                                 NAOMI
                        These shoes are cursed. I’m on 
                        teams for a bunch of other 
                        investments, I hope they let us 
                        take a stab on our own.  

                                 NICK
                        Don’t beat yourself up, we were 
                        great. Everyone’s probably just 
                        zonked out ready for eggnog and 
                        filling their children’s stockings 
                        with coal. Or lighting candles for 
                        a week. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I guess. 

                                 NICK
                        Let’s just leave it.

           Iyana is last to leave and finally walks out. 

                                 NICK
                        You’re not giving up on this, are 
                        you?

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m not giving up on this. Shark, 
                        remember?

                                 NICK
                        Negative connotation, remember?

           Naomi catches up to her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Iyana, hi. 
                                 IYANA
                        Hello. Good presentation, high 
                        quality slides.

           Naomi follows her as she walks through the office. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - VARIOUS

                                 NAOMI
                        Really? 

                                 IYANA
                        Yes. You know we encourage our 
                        employees to seek outside 
                        opportunities for internal 
                        consideration. 

                                 NAOMI
                        So is that your blessing to move 
                        forward with an offer? 

                                 IYANA
                        Oh. 

           She stops and turns to her. 

                                 IYANA
                        Listen, as I’ve said before, I love 
                        the proactive mentality. But we 
                        won’t be investing in Bio-Fuse. Now 
                        is not the time. Woman to woman, 
                        I’m on board with you, but Patrick 
                        and Reginald think our active time 
                        and money would best be spent 
                        elsewhere. It’s nothing personal, 
                        of course. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Was it the presentation itself? We 
                        can gather more data and --

                                 IYANA
                        Naomi, stick with HEAL. You’re 
                        doing great. 

           She starts to walk away. 

                                 IYANA
                        Think about tomorrow, it’ll be a 
                        real treat. Dancing, drinks, 
                        delicious food. Yum, yum, yum!
           And with that, she turns a corner and disappears. Not the 
           conversation she was hoping to have. She turns to walk back 
           to her office, when Ned stops her. 

                                 NED
                        Naoms, we really could use you for 
                        the playoff game this weekend. You 
                        around? 

                                 NAOMI
                        Wish I could, but I am swamped. 

                                 NED
                        Yeah I hear ya. I’ll see you 
                        tomorrow at the holiday dinner. 
                            (fishing)
                        Bringing anyone, uh, special?

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes. 

           He deflates. 

                                 NAOMI
                        My roommate. 

           She walks away, Ned’s hope is restored. 

                                 NED
                        Noishe. 

           Naomi slumps back to her office, defeated. 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE

           She sits at her desk, deep in thought, staring at the empty 
           seat in front of her. She takes her phone out of her pocket 
           and pulls up her messages. She scrolls to her conversation 
           with Ben. She texts him: “You back from NY yet?” And hits 
           send. Texting bubbles appear and remain for a few seconds. 
           Then they disappear. They appear again and he replies: “I 
           wish.” She puts her phone down and moves to her computer. She 
           looks through a few emails to see a new one pop up from 
           Nordstrom. Holiday Sale! The mouse hovers over the email as 
           she thinks. She shuts down her computer, grabs her stuff, and 
           heads out in a hurry. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Diane paints her toe nails when she hears a soft knock. She 
           gets up to open the door and sees Naomi buried in Nordstrom 
           bags and lets her in. 

                                 DIANE
                        What’d you do, rob the store? 
                        That’s not what Black Friday means. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Bio-Fuse got straight up rejected. 
                        I was dropped and so I shopped.  

           Naomi places the bags on the floor. 

                                 DIANE
                        Oof, I’m sorry boo. Maybe your idea 
                        was.... Too good?

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah, that must’ve been it. 

           Diane moves back to the couch to finish her nails. 

                                 DIANE
                        I’ve got some corns to file down, 
                        then tomorrow I’ll be dressed and 
                        ready to impress. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Good, you’ll need to work hard. I 
                        am tryna look good.  

                                 DIANE
                        OoOoh for Beeeeen?

                                 NAOMI
                        For myself. But also for Ben. 

           She smirks. 

                                 DIANE
                        Can’t wait to meet him and ask him 
                        what your deal is.

                                 NAOMI
                        I’ll kill you. But after you find 
                        out. I don’t have an answer but I 
                        can’t just ask him that. 

                                 DIANE
                        I was put on this earth to DTR.
                                 NAOMI
                            (puzzled)
                        What’s DTR?

                                 DIANE
                        HUH? Define The Relationship. 
                        That’s been in Urban Dictionary 
                        since 2003. Damn.  

           Diane rolls her eyes. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Whatever. Anyway, I worked up a 
                        sweat. STMN? 

           Diane’s turn to be puzzled. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (smart ass)
                        Shower then movie night. 

                                 DIANE
                        Ugh. Yes. Go wash that funk-ass!

           Naomi slips into her room, Diane yells to her from the couch. 

                                 DIANE
                        Don’t forget in between the cheeks.
                            (sotto)
                        They love in between the cheeks.

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Diane, dressed in a mock neck green velvet dress, taps her 
           heeled foot, checking her phone.

                                 DIANE
                        Bitch! Our uber’s here, get that 
                        funk ass out here. 

           Naomi’s bedroom door slowly enters and she emerges looking 
           like a stunna. She wears a bodycon, navy long sleeved, 
           backless DRESS. She wears large diamond studs in her ears. 
           Diane is in awe. 

                                 DIANE
                        I am in awe. You look, very, wow. 

           Naomi does a full spin. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah?
                                 DIANE
                        Yeah. Very sensual. 

           Her phone starts to buzz. 

                                 DIANE
                        Okay Cinderella, we gotta boogie. 

           They exit the apartment. 

           INT. UBER 

           Naomi and Diane sit in the back of their uber. 

                                 DIANE
                        So what can I ask him?

                                 NAOMI
                        Where he’s from, where he lives, 
                        end of list. 

                                 DIANE
                        A few amendments: if he’s into 
                        marriage, how many kids he wants, 
                        is he Jewish. End of my list. 

           Naomi rolls her eyes but can’t help but laugh. Diane gives 
           her arm a squeeze.

                                 DIANE
                        Thanks for the invite, I’m excited 
                        to be real black up in thur.

           EXT. OPAL VENUE/ EVENT SPACE, MOUNTAIN VIEW 

           Their uber pulls up outside of a somewhat rundown two-story 
           building. Naomi opens the door and they get out, a little 
           surprised. 

                                 DIANE
                        Uh, I thought your bosses were 
                        like, hella rich. This is some poor 
                        people shit. 

           Naomi rolls her eyes and pulls her inside. 

           INT. OPAL VENUE/ EVENT SPACE

           While eating their words, they enter to see a beautifully 
           renovated space decorated with an elegant and cheerful 
           holiday flare. 
           Lights strung from the ceiling, a dance floor with a 
           chandelier above it, leather booths surrounding a fully 
           stocked bar -- they have done quite a nice job. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ...You were saying?

           They walk in and look for a table. 

                                 DIANE
                        I’m so proud of you boo. You got 
                        yourself this kickass job, you’re 
                        working with impressive clientele, 
                        and I’m finally about to meet your 
                        slam piece. This is the best day of 
                        MY life. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Okay, okay, save a little of your 
                        energy, open bar’s open all night. 

           Naomi twirls Diane, who bumps into Nick on his way over to 
           greet them. She spills his drink on him. He’s in a tux and 
           the boy cleans up nice. Good for him. 

                           NICK
                                                          DIANE
           Oh, sorry!
                                              Oh, sorry!

           At first he doesn’t see Naomi. 

                                 DIANE
                        No no, all me dude. I bumped into 
                        you, thanks to this bitch. 

           Nick sees Naomi. His tongue practically falls out of his 
           mouth. 

                                 NICK
                        Wow. Hi. 

           He moves closer to her, they hug.  

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t recognize you, you look, 
                        um --

           Diane reads the room, albeit incorrectly. 

                                 DIANE
                        She looks banging’. Like, the kind 
                        you bang for life, as a result of 
                        marriage and everlasting love. 

           Naomi elbows her. 
                                 NAOMI
                        You look very handsome. Diane, this 
                        is--

           Nick’s gaze moves beyond Naomi to someone waving to him in 
           the distance. 

                                 NICK
                        Shit, sorry. I gotta go intervene, 
                        Eli is trying to see how long he 
                        can hit on Whitney before she slaps 
                        him. I’ll talk to you guys later. 

           He hesitates before pecking her on the cheek and jogs to the 
           other side of the room. Diane shakes her head as she purses 
           her lips

                                 DIANE
                        Honkey. Town. USA. Ben seems nice, 
                        don’t think he was picking up what 
                        I was puttin’ down but --

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh, that’s not Ben. That was Nick. 

                                 DIANE
                        Furreal? Whomever he is, he is in 
                        love with you. I don’t even know 
                        what words were exchanged, I was so 
                        distracted by the sound of his 
                        raging boner ripping through his 
                        tuxedo pants calling out for you.

                                 NAOMI
                        What is wrong with you? We’re 
                        friends. Besides, I think he knows 
                        what’s up with me. 

           Diane impersonates a boner trying to rip out of tux pants

                                 DIANE
                            (grizzled voice)
                        Naomi! I’m Nick’s boner! Please, 
                        touch me! Please, please, I need 
                        your sweet womanly touch. I’m sick, 
                        I have Jungle Fever!

           Naomi shakes her head in disgust. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Mmm, you nasty. Let’s go find a 
                        table. 

           Naomi walks away, Diane follows her. 
                                 DIANE
                            (grizzled voice)
                        Okay, I’m coming. Heh heh. 

           INT. OPAL - LATER

           Naomi and Diane sit with Eli, Daniel, Whitney, and Nick at a 
           table as they listen to people give speeches at the front of 
           the space. There’s an empty seat next to Naomi, she looks at 
           it with a worried look. Nick clocks it. Diane leans in to 
           whisper. 

                                 DIANE
                        Yo, where’s your fool? The pervert 
                        in me is getting antsy and ready to 
                        bounce.  

           Naomi pulls out her phone and texts Eli: “Where’s Ben?” Eli 
           takes out his phone, reads his text and replies: “On his way. 
           Later flight from NY.” She fails at trying to conceal a 
           little smile. She tucks her phone away and pretends to listen 
           to Patrick speak. After a few moments of his droning, Naomi 
           perks up at the sound of a door opening. She stealthily turns 
           around to see Ben entering. He stops to fix his cuff link. 
           Boy looks GOOD all dressed up. Her heart flutters. She leans 
           in to Diane. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Six o’clock behind me, that’s him. 

           Naomi faces forwards as Diane pretends to yawn and stretch 
           and turns to look at him. She sees Ben and she’s impressed. 
           She’s about to say something to Naomi when the door opens 
           again and a WOMAN (early 20s, Caucasian, legs for days, makes 
           Karlie Kloss look like Iggy Pop) sneaks in behind him. She 
           grabs his hand. Diane stinks up her nose, turns forward and 
           leans in to Naomi.

                                 DIANE
                        Who dat?

           Naomi turns around. She sees this beautiful couple make their 
           way into the room trying to find seats. A fire burns in her 
           stomach that slowly makes its way to her neck and eventually 
           to her eyes, something Ben notices when they finally make eye 
           contact. He kisses the woman on the cheek and excuses himself 
           outside, gesturing she meet him out there. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (to Diane)
                        Excuse me. 
                                 DIANE
                        Need me to hold your earrings?

           Naomi gets up and power walks outside after Ben. Diane 
           finishes her cocktail and then takes a big gulp of Naomi’s 
           wine from her glass. 

                                 DIANE
                        Shit.  

           EXT. OPAL - BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Ben nervously smokes a cigarette outside, awaiting his 
           scolding. Naomi enters in a flash behind a door flown open. 

                                 BEN
                        You look very pretty.

                                 NAOMI
                        What the fuck?

                                 BEN
                        Okay, I--

                                 NAOMI
                        What the actual fuck, Ben? Do you 
                        have a girlfriend? Don’t fucking 
                        lie, I will jam this heel into your 
                        throat without hesitation. 

                                 BEN
                            (meek)
                        Yes. 

           She interrupts explanation. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Did you have a girlfriend the whole 
                        time we’ve been whatevering?

                                 BEN
                        ...Yes, but hear me out.

           She paces madly.

                                 NAOMI
                        The nonfiction bullshit you’re 
                        about to spew better be Pulitzer 
                        level good. 
                                 BEN
                        Look, I’m sorry I didn’t say 
                        anything. She insisted on coming. I 
                        didn’t invite her, Susan wanted to--

                                 NAOMI
                        SUSAN? What kind of dumb, sickly 
                        thin, physically breathtaking 
                        person is named Susan? 

                                 BEN
                        I’m just not sure I’m in love with 
                        her. Still. Being around you is 
                        really confusing. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Being around me is “really 
                        confusing.” It’s not like you’re a 
                        closeted gay man and I’m the 
                        handsome stranger that moves into 
                        your parents’ villa for the summer. 
                        There’s nothing “confusing” about 
                        this. You lied to me--

                                 BEN
                            (standing up for himself)
                        Hey, I never lied to you. You never 
                        asked me if I was dating anyone.

                                 NAOMI
                        That is some real bullshit and you 
                        lied by keeping it from me. 

                                 BEN 
                        Did you ever ask if I was dating 
                        anyone?

           Okay, so she didn’t but like, come on. 

                                 NAOMI
                        No, but I didn’t think I had to. 

           She takes a big breath, collecting herself. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What’s her deal?

                                 BEN
                        We’ve been doing long distance 
                        while she was in New York. 

                                 NAOMI
                        She currently lives in New York? 
           She thinks for a second, doing the math. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Did you see her when we were there?

                                 BEN
                        Yes.

                                 NAOMI
                        Amazing. 

           She’s at a loss for words. Her disintegrating affection for 
           him and her biting hatred for him are at war with the 
           unfathomable sadness she didn’t prepare for. She digs deep to 
           find the right thing to say. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You know what, you’re right. I 
                        never asked you, so let me ask you 
                        now. 
                            (flippant)
                        Hey Ben, I really like working with 
                        you and think you’re super smart. 
                        Before we do anything that might 
                        complicate my personal and 
                        professional life, are you in a 
                        relationship with anyone?

           He takes a drag from the cigarette and looks to the ground. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m doing what I should’ve done 
                        months ago, because I guess I had 
                        to. I didn’t hear an answer. So, 
                        let me ask you again. Hey Ben. Are 
                        you. In. A relationship. With 
                        anyone?

           He avoids eye contact. 

                                 BEN
                        Yes. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Great, good to know. See that 
                        wasn’t so hard, was it? ‘Ppreciate 
                        the honesty. Let’s not fuck 
                        anymore, k?

           Pissed, she turns on her heel and grabs the door handle. 
           There’s one more thing bothering her. She doesn’t turn around 
           to face him. 
                                 NAOMI
                        How long?

           He debates answering it or not. 

                                 BEN
                        Six years. She’s moving here. 

           She laughs loudly, opening the door, tossing back her hair 
           for emotional strength and disappears inside. 

           INT. OPAL VENUE - TABLE

           Diane arm wrestles with Daniel, it’s even. With one gentle 
           inhale, she immediately knocks his arm over crushing him. The 
           table cheers. 

                                 DIANE
                        Make an app out of that! Suckaaaaa!

           She spots Naomi angrily rushing over to her. She grabs both 
           their purses and gets up to meet her. They meet in the middle 
           of the bar. 

                                 DIANE
                        Fuck boi?

                                 NAOMI
                        Fuck boi. 

                                 DIANE
                        C’mon boo, let’s get you home. 

           Naomi nods her head. Any more dialogue and she’ll burst into 
           tears. Diane wraps her coat around her and they walk out 
           together. Diane quickly calls an uber. As they pass the bar, 
           Diane grabs two bottles of Veuve unnoticed and they walk out. 

           INT. UBER - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Diane and Naomi get into the car. Naomi sits, strong. 

                                 DIANE
                        Listen, Nay. 

           Naomi shushes her. Diane grabs her hand and they ride in 
           silence. 
           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - A FEW WEEKS LATER - EVENING

           Naomi types away on her computer, thankful that the rest of 
           the office has been empty. She checks her phone for the time, 
           it switches to 6:00PM and she gets a reminder for 6:30PM: 
           “Dinner with POS and Lawrence.” She groans. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (psyching herself up)
                        It’s just a check in dinner with a 
                        client and world’s biggest dick 
                        hole. Has he spent more than two 
                        minutes in this office since the 
                        betrayal unfolded and exploded? No! 
                        Is he avoiding you? Who cares! 
                        Hopefully yes! You are better than 
                        him. This job means everything to 
                        you. You have taken a few weeks to 
                        mourn and move on. Other women have 
                        been through worse: Beyonce, Oprah, 
                        Harriet Tubman. Game face on.  

           There’s a soft knock on the door.

                                 NAOMI
                            (sotto)
                        Fuck!
                            (aloud)
                        Yes, proceed entry. 

           Ben’s adultering head pops in. 

                                 BEN
                        Mind if I come in real quick?

                                 NAOMI
                            (cold)
                        It’s your office too. 

           She turns to face her computer, pretending to do work. He 
           enters, sheepishly, with his dry cleaning on a hanger. Per 
           usual, he lays it on the couch. 

                                 BEN
                        Not for long, I asked to move to 
                        the one down the hall. 

           She looks over to him. She still has feelings but he’s a 
           dick, so this is a real “Sophie’s Choice” of emotions. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You didn’t have to do that. I hate 
                        you, but I’m not a savage. You can 
                        use your office. 
           He laughs. 

                                 BEN
                        Look, I’m sorry, I really am. I’ve 
                        got to figure out my own stuff, but 
                        in the mean time, I don’t want to 
                        screw up HEAL. We’re going to be 
                        working together and I’ll do 
                        whatever you want to make this 
                        easier for you. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You could walk in front of a high 
                        speed train?

           He stares at her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        We’re both adults, I can be... 
                        civil. 

                                 BEN
                        I’ll call the uber for dinner, is 
                        that a good start?

                                 NAOMI
                        Uber black.

                                 BEN
                        Uber black it is. 

           He requests a car on his phone. She turns off her computer 
           and they walk out together. 

           INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Ben and Naomi are joined by Lawrence at dinner. They’re 
           finishing up. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Well... we wanted to save the other 
                        news for last.

           Naomi and Ben look at each other, Lawrence is concerned.  

                                 BEN
                        Typically at this stage in a high-
                        growth segment, a lot of the 
                        companies we work with struggle to 
                        deliver a product. 

           A look of worry falls on Lawrence’s face. 
                                 NAOMI
                        But HEAL is puttering out high 
                        dividends for a company as young as 
                        it is AND we’re on track for FDA 
                        approval within the next year. 

           Lawrence raises his glass. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Wonderful news! You had me worried 
                        for a second, I felt my heart 
                        stalling. It’s all thanks to you 
                        both, you two make a great team. 
                        I’m happy to report this back to my 
                        team. 

           He looks to Naomi and smiles, appreciative. They all toast. 
           Lawrence stands. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Excuse me, need to go to the little 
                        boys room. 

           He leaves for the bathroom. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I hate when adults say that, it’s 
                        like, why? Just say bathroom. 

           Ben looks over at her, a serious look on his face. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What? Do I have caviar in my teeth? 
                        I told myself not to get it, this 
                        always happens when I get caviar. 

           She begins sucking at her teeth and moving her tongue around 
           looking for loose caviar. 

                                 BEN
                        No, no. You’re fine. You’re really 
                        just, incredible. I swear, he only 
                        meets with us so he can talk to 
                        you.

           She can sense where this is going and tries to shake it off. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah yeah, old news, loser. 

           He scoots in closer and puts his hand on her thigh. 

                                 BEN
                        I can’t blame him though...
           She looks down at his hand, stunned. She pushes it off him. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Are you fucking kidding?

                                 BEN
                        I can’t help it. You look 
                        incredible, I can’t take my eyes 
                        off you. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hey, how’s Susan?

           This shuts him up. She takes the napkin off her lap, and 
           slams it on the table. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’ve lost your damned mind. Tell 
                        Lawrence I said goodnight. 

           In a huff, she’s gone, leaving Ben by himself, humiliated. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - FITNESS CENTER - MORNING

           Naomi walks in, ready to sweat. She gets on the treadmill, 
           puts in her headphones, and pulls up some articles to read on 
           her iPad. She kranks the mph UP and starts running. After a 
           few minutes, she looks up from her iPad and sees Nick. She 
           takes one ear bud out. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Morning. 

                                 NICK
                        Damn, I have seen you here at the 
                        crack of dawn every morning. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t do well with down time. 

           She slows her pace. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What’s up?

                                 NICK
                        He hands her a NEWSPAPER with a 
                        page dog-eared. 

           She takes the newspaper and reads the article. Her eyes go 
           WIDE. She reads it aloud. 
                                 NAOMI
                        “Here’s why Bio-Fuse IPO rumors are 
                        intensifying” You’ve got to be 
                        shitting me.

                                 NICK
                        Keep going. 

                                 NAOMI
                        “Citing anoynoymous sources, the 
                        Wall Street Journal alleges Bio-

                        going to pass out. 

           She stops the machine all together and chugs water.

                                 NICK
                        I know, what could have been. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Fuck. Why did you show me that, to 
                        torture me?

                                 NICK 
                        As a reminder... if things get a 
                        little, I don’t know rough, just 
                        remember your instincts are usually 
                        right. Go with them. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Well that’s ominously wise. 

           He shrugs. 

                                 NICK
                        We’ll get the next one. I’ll see 
                        you later. 

           He walks off. Naomi cranks the speed backs up and hauls ass 
           until her heart is about to explode. She pushes the stop 
           button hard and takes a minute to rest and think. She towels 
           herself off and hops off the machine and heads to the locker 
           room. 
           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING

           Naomi jogs into the office, late for the meeting. She shakes 
           out her freshly showered hair and puts it into a bun. One of 
           the INTERNS knocks. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes?

           The intern sheepishly walks in. 

                                 INTERN
                        I have Mr. Skarsgard’s dry 
                        cleaning. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ugh, why haven’t you left yet?!
                            (to the intern)
                        Sorry, you can throw it on the 
                        couch, thanks. 

           The intern places it delicately on the couch and leaves. 
           Naomi angrily stares it before “accidentally” picking it up 
           and dropping it on the floor a couple times. She throws it 
           back on the couch and leaves for the meeting. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM

           Naomi sneaks into the back row of the conference room, a few 
           minutes late for the meeting. 

                                 REGINALD
                        My assistant will send out data on 
                        the latest investments to all, so 
                        look out for that this afternoon. 
                        In other news, late last night HLS 
                        made an offer on a rising company 
                        that’s poised to go public in the 
                        next coming months. We had to put 
                        up a royal fight, but we were able 
                        to come in at a competitive price. 
                        Ben and Whitney will be the key 
                        links between us and emerging 
                        environmental company, Bio-Fuse.  

           The room applauds softly. Naomi stops wringing out her hair. 
           Did she hear that right? She looks at Nick, who shrugs. 

                                 IYANA
                        Okay, that’s it for today. I feel 
                        these meetings are getting shorter 
                        and shorter! 
                                 IYANA (CONT'D)
                        Thank you all, and look out for 
                        that e-mail later today. 

           Everyone gets up to go back to their desks. Naomi marches 
           right up to Iyana. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Iyana, why did we invest in Bio-
                        Fuse?

                                 IYANA
                        Yes, I felt you’d have some 
                        feelings on this. Ben brought it to 
                        our attention and his argument was 
                        valid. Excellent question, love it. 

           She sidesteps Naomi, but she stops her.

                                 NAOMI
                        But I initially suggested this 
                        company months ago and last week 
                        presented it and was shut down. Now 
                        you’re doing it when it is four 
                        times more expensive? And someone 
                        else is getting to manage it?

                                 IYANA
                        What do you want me to tell you? 
                        Some times these things happen. You 
                        should thank Ben for bringing it 
                        back to our attention, perhaps 
                        he’ll let you join. 

           She sidesteps again and this time makes her way out of the 
           room. Nick tries to intervene. 

                                 NICK
                        Let it go. She’s right, sometimes 
                        shit just happens. But again, it 
                        means we’re thinking the right way. 

                                 NAOMI
                        “Shit” just seems to happen to me 
                        lately. 

           She marches over to Ben. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You stole our company.

           He shushes her, looking around trying to quiet her. 
                                 BEN
                        Don’t be ridiculous. I didn’t 
                        “steal” your company. It’s not 
                        yours to steal, and you didn’t keep 
                        up with it. 

           He tries to get by her, she walks along with him. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You knew how much time I had 
                        invested in this and you just 
                        swooped in and repeated what we 
                        said. 

                                 BEN
                        Well, I must’ve said it in a better 
                        more compelling way. 

           He leaves the conferences room, she grabs her bag and catches 
           up to him. 

           INT. HALLWAY

           She walks alongside him. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Don’t give me that, I deserve a 
                        little bit better, surely you can 
                        agree to that. 

                                 BEN
                        Don’t call me surely. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Now isn’t a good time to try out 
                        your bad comedy routine.

           He walks to the doorway of a small office, she follows him 
           in. 

                                 BEN
                        You have great instincts, you 
                        should trust them. Then you 
                        would’ve kept up with it. 

                                 NAOMI
                        As history would show us, it would 
                        argue the opposite and tell me 
                        regardless of my instincts, I make 
                        bed decisions.

           He enters into his office, again she follows him. 
           INT. BEN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 BEN
                        I’ve got a lot of work to do, so if 
                        you could continue whining 
                        somewhere else that’d be really 
                        nice of you.

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m serious, this is poor 
                        workmanship. The least you could do 
                        is apologize. 

           Ben plops down at his desk and thinks for a moment. He looks 
           at her sincerely. 

                                 BEN
                        Naomi, I think you’re being a 
                        little hysterical. 

           At the mention of THAT word, she goes off. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Be a dick all you want but at the 
                        end of the day know I am better 
                        than you and in time that will come 
                        to fruition.

           He’s agitated now. He folds his hands in front of him on his 
           desk. 

                                 BEN
                        Sure. Listen, I have work to do and 
                        this is no longer fun for me, so if 
                        you’re not going to blow me or 
                        something, then get out of my 
                        office. 

           He turns to tap on his computer. Naomi’s mouth hangs open. 

                                 BEN
                        I’ll take that as a yes. 

           He smugly unzips his pants. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What. A. Mistake. 

                                 BEN
                        Hey man, if you weren’t so willing 
                        to fuck me, it never would’ve 
                        happened. 
                                 NAOMI
                        If I weren’t so fucking stupid, it 
                        never would’ve happened. What a 
                        colossal waste of time. 

           She storms out to her office. 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE

           She slams her door behind her, pacing angrily. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You’ve got be fucking kidding me, 
                        prematurely ejaculating piece of 
                        shit. 

           Her phone vibrates and her mom calls her, she answers. 

           INT. JOHNSON HOME- KITCHEN

           Patricia, wearing a punny apron, walks around the kitchen 
           checking various foods in their cooking stages. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN NAOMI AND PATRICIA:

                                 NAOMI
                        Mom, now’s not a good time. Can I 
                        call you back?

                                 PATRICIA
                        You can call me tonight, or 
                        tomorrow morning, or tomorrow 
                        afternoon. You know what, tomorrow 
                        night works too.

                                 NAOMI
                        Sure. 

           Patricia pauses her fiddling and changes her demeanor. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Nay, is everything okay?

                                 NAOMI
                        Mom, if I’m having... trouble with 
                        a co-worker do you think I should 
                        speak to someone about it? I don’t 
                        want to make things weird, but --
                                 PATRICIA
                        If you think it can be resolved 
                        properly between you and this other 
                        person, try that first honey. 

           Naomi paces and stops in front of Ben’s shirts. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Good idea, Mom. Thanks. I’ll call 
                        you, eventually. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Eventually? But--

           Naomi hangs up on her. She shrugs and goes back to her 
           cooking. 

           END PHONE CONVERSATION

           Naomi carefully takes a shirt out of Ben’s dry cleaning and 
           walks back over to her desk. She digs in her purse for a 
           BRIGHT RED LIPSTICK. She applies a thick coat and smacks her 
           lips a couple times. She gently kisses the inside of the 
           shirt’s collar. She goes back to her purse and pulls out a 
           small bottle of PERFUME. She dabs a little on the inside of 
           her left wrist and smudges it on the collar, chest, and 
           abdomen parts of the shirt. She smiles wickedly as she 
           carefully puts it with the other shirts. There’s a knock on 
           her door. She scurries back to her desk and sits in her 
           chair. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Come in!

           The intern comes back in and walks to the dry cleaning. 

                                 INTERN
                        Mr. Skarsgard has relocated 
                        offices. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Great. 

                                 INTERN
                        So I’m taking them...

                                 NAOMI
                        Have at it. 

           The intern grabs the clothes, Naomi smiles sweetly at her. 
           When she leaves, she’s finally left in peace. The day has 
           taken a real turn for the worse. She takes a big breath and 
           decides to get back to work. 
           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - LATER THAT WEEK

           Naomi’s in her office reading articles online while on the 
           phone with another investment of hers. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Frank, that’s music to my ears. 
                        Good news I needed to hear. We’ll 
                        send a diagnostic out this week. 

           She stands up to stretch and walk around. She looks at her 
           watch, almost lunch time! 

                                 NAOMI
                        Sounds good, I’ll give you a call 
                        in a few weeks. Take care. 

           She hands up. She walks around her office, bored and opens 
           her door. She takes a peep outside and everyone else working. 
           She walks down the hallway. 

           INT. HALLWAY - VARIOUS

           She browses past people’s offices to kill time. She comes 
           upon Ben’s office and debates whether to walk by it or not, 
           in case the door is open. She slowly creeps past it just as 
           the door opens she quickly turns on her heel and power walks 
           away turning a corner and hiding. She pops her head out and 
           sees Iyana leaving Ben’s office. He looks worse for wear. She 
           gives him a pat on the back and walks away. She goes back to 
           her office.  

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE.

           She walks back into her office and quickly shuts the door. 
           There’s a knock. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (paranoid)
                        Who is it?

                                 BEN
                        ....It’s Ben, can I come in?

           She slowly opens the door.

                                 NAOMI
                        What do you want?

           He pushes his way in and closes the door behind him. He sits 
           on her couch. 
                                 BEN
                        I spoke to Iyana and.... I’d like 
                        you to join Bio-Fuse, if you’d 
                        like.

                                 NAOMI
                        Why?

                                 BEN
                        You were right. You brought it to 
                        my attention and you should be 
                        included in it. 

           She’s suspicious. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What about Nick?

                                 BEN
                        Just you.

           She thinks.

                                 BEN
                        I’ve got a dinner scheduled tonight 
                        with one of the cofounders, I’d 
                        love it if you would come. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Really?

                                 BEN
                        Yes. 

           He stands and moves towards the door. 

                                 BEN
                        8:30PM at Rouge, reservation under 
                        my name. 

           He leaves. She’s still suspicious, but dances a little to 
           celebrate. 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - 7:45PM

           Sitting at her desk, she anxiously taps her foot under her 
           desk continuously checking the time on her phone. She puts on 
           a layer of her red lipstick. She gathers all her information 
           on Bio-Fuse, looks it over one more time and then leaves the 
           office. 
           EXT. ROUGE - 8:10

           Rouge, a red bricked classic french restaurant, is 
           romantically lit with dim white string lights that hang from 
           the outdoor patio. Naomi gets out of her uber and walks into 
           the restaurant.

           INT. ROUGE - SAME

           She walks up to the HOSTESS, looking for Ben. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hi I’m here for a reservation under 
                        Ben Skarsgard. For 3, I think? It’s 
                        for 8:30. 

           She checks the time on the phone. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I am a bit early so I can wait by 
                        the bar or--

           The hostess searches through her iPad. 

                                 HOSTESS
                            (British)
                        I’m not seeing a reservation. Could 
                        it be under a different name?

           Naomi thinks. Was he fucking with her?

                                 NAOMI
                        Maybe under Naomi Johnson?

           She continues looking. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        No, I don’t have anything under 
                        that either. 

           Naomi strains to look in the restaurant to see if he’s in 
           there. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Do you have anything under Ben?

           The hostess scrolls and stops. 

                                 HOSTESS
                        I have a Ben for party of two--

           Naomi rolls her eyes. 
                                 HOSTESS
                        But they’ve been seated. And that 
                        reservation was for 7:00. 

           It hits her, that stupid fuck. A quiet rage pulses through 
           her veins. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I see. Thank you. 

           As she’s about to turn and leave, she bumps into Ben and 
           ASHLEY (early 40s) the Bio-Fuse cofounder. 

                                 BEN
                            (only she can hear)
                        Oops. Guess I forgot to tell you 
                        the dinner got moved up. 

                                 ASHLEY
                        Miss Johnson? Were you supposed to 
                        join us for dinner?

                                 BEN
                        She was, but I think it’s clear 
                        she’s got enough on her plate right 
                        now. Don’t worry about it. 

           Ben turns to Ashley, blocking Naomi from her view.

                                 BEN
                        Ashley, I’ll meet you outside in 
                        just a second.

           She nods and exits the restaurant.

                                 NAOMI
                        You’re a piece of work. 

                                 BEN
                        You’re one to talk. The lipstick in 
                        the collar was a nice touch Naomi, 
                        a bit beneath you I thought. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Not sure what you’re referring to. 

                                 BEN
                        She almost ended it, it was close. 
                        I hope you’re happy.

                                 NAOMI
                        Being the lead manager for Bio-Fuse 
                        would’ve made me happy, but this 
                        feels like a small win. 
                                 BEN
                        Yeah well that’s not going to 
                        happen now. Have a great night and 
                        fuck you. 

           He turns to leave. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (sotto)
                        You wish.

           He heard that and turns back. For the first time, his face 
           looks genuinely cold. Naomi takes a hard look at it. His eyes 
           are puffy as if he’d been sleeping. He looks tired and worn 
           out. This cheers her up a bit. 

                                 BEN
                            (cold)
                        There was never a world in which we 
                        would’ve been together, and I feel 
                        bad for you that you thought that. 
                        You were something to do. Besides, 
                        I don’t date black women. 

           With that, he walks out on her. Of all the shit that’s 
           happened so far, this one hurts the most. An ice pick has 
           been jammed into her heart and she feels it. She stares, 
           watching as he walks off with Ashley. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - FITNESS CENTER - THE NEXT MORNING

           Naomi hauls ass on the treadmill, running off her 
           frustration. She keeps replaying the events of the last few 
           months: the affair with Ben, Bio-Fuse, the embarrassing 
           dinner the night prior, etc. She increases the mph, 
           practically stomping on the machine.  

                                 NAOMI
                        Did I try to solve the problem 
                        myself? Yes. I used soft tones and 
                        kind words. 

           She increases the speed a little more. She is sprinting. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Did it solve anything? 

           She continues running. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ....Did it solve anything?
           She hits the stop button and stomps off the machine grabbing 
           her towel and water bottle and marches out of the fitness 
           center. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - VARIOUS

           She marches through the hallways, on a mission. We think 
           she’s going to Ben’s office but she walks right past it into -

           INT. IYANA’S OFFICE AREA

           She walks up to her ASSISTANT’s desk. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I need to speak to Iyana. 

           The assistant looks up at her, unsure how to handle. She 
           picks up her headset, turns away from Naomi and speaks into 
           the headset quietly. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Iyana, I have--

           She turns back around. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        What’s your name?

                                 NAOMI
                        Naomi. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I have Naomi here for you.

           She listens to the response, the assistant turns back to her. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        You can go in. 

           Naomi barges into Iyana’s office. 

           INT. IYANA’S OFFICE

           Iyana sits comfortably at her wrap-around desk. She’s shocked 
           at Naomi’s sweaty appearance. 

                                 IYANA
                        Oh dear, are the showers in the 
                        fitness center broken?
                                 NAOMI
                        No. I’m here to talk about Ben. 

                                 IYANA
                        Ah yes, proceed. 

                                 NAOMI
                        He invited me the Bio-Fuse client 
                        meeting and intentionally told me 
                        the incorrect time so that I would 
                        show up late. 

                                 IYANA
                        That doesn’t seem like Ben, are you 
                        sure you heard him correctly? 
                        Perhaps you wrote the wrong time 
                        down. 

                                 NAOMI
                        That is not something I do, I don’t 
                        “write the wrong time” down. He did 
                        it intentionally. We have a 
                        strained relationship and this was 
                        retaliation. 

                                 IYANA
                        Naomi, the allegations you’re 
                        making against Ben, someone who is 
                        only known for his exemplary work 
                        ethic, are worrisome and carry 
                        weight. 

           Naomi starts to back down. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t mean to start anything, but 
                        this isn’t the first instance of 
                        hostility. He’s made comments to me 
                        that have made me uncomfortable, if 
                        I’m being honest. 

                                 IYANA
                        What do you propose we do?

                                 NAOMI
                        I.... I don’t know. I don’t want to 
                        cause trouble or start office 
                        gossip, I just would like this to 
                        be figured out. 
                                 IYANA
                        It’s not really my place to act as 
                        moderator, so whatever happened 
                        between the two of you, I think it 
                        might be best if you sort it out. 
                        Just the two of you. 

                                 NAOMI
                        There’s no one to help figure it 
                        out, we don’t even have a human 
                        resources department. You’re 
                        supposed to be my resource. If I 
                        need to speak to Reginald or 
                        Patrick then--

           Iyana stands. 

                                 IYANA
                        No need for that. I’ll discuss with 
                        them internally and we will....take 
                        care of it. Okay?

           Naomi sighs relief. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes, thank you. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - HALLWAY

           She walks past Ben’s office, his door is closed. She smiles 
           to herself, finally a win. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM- LATER THAT WEEK

           Naomi shuffles into the morning meeting and sits next to 
           Nick. Per usual, Reginald starts it with updates on the 
           company. 

                                 REGINALD
                        We’ll be taking our winter recess 
                        this weekend. I hope you all get 
                        some much needed rest and 
                        relaxation. A few end of the year 
                        notes...

           He puts on his readings glasses and looks over a piece of 
           paper. 
                                 REGINALD
                        Of our junior associates this year, 
                        Naomi, Nick, and Whitney were 
                        routed on the highest number of 
                        companies with the greatest amount 
                        of return. Excellent job, you 
                        three. 

           The room politely claps, Naomi beams. This was a fun 
           surprise. 

                                 REGINALD
                        In sadder news, because I love to 
                        sandwich news, we are pulling out 
                        of our agreement with ReNu along 
                        with seven other companies, which 
                        will be finalized later this week. 
                        Returns are not what were 
                        anticipated. And the final good 
                        news is-- 

           Naomi is texting Diane to tell her the good news. 

                                 NAOMI (TEXT)
                        Guess whose gurl had one of the 
                        highest returns this year. 

           Text bubbles appear, Diane responds. 

                                 DIANE (TEXT)
                        MY GURL *poop emoji* *thumbs up 
                        emoji*

           She smiles and continues texting. 

                                 REGINALD
                        After reviewing his work in New 
                        York and his continued success here 
                        in California, Iyana, Patrick and I 
                        are happy to promote Ben Skarsgard 
                        to partner. 

           Naomi looks up. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What?!

           Meaning to say that to herself, she accidentally blurts it 
           out, loudly, to everyone. They all turn to look at her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Sorry. 

           Reginald continues. 
                                 REGINALD
                        Congratulations Ben, who is en 
                        route from New York but he has been 
                        notified. That’s all, enjoy your 
                        holidays and we’ll see you in the 
                        new year. 

           Everyone stands and exits. Iyana tries to quickly slip out, 
           Naomi follows her. 

           INT. HALLWAY - VARIOUS

           She chases after her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Iyana. 

           She sighs audibly and turns around.

                                 IYANA
                        Yes, Naomi? I’ve got a conference 
                        call to dial in to. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You made him a partner? Is that 
                        what you meant when you said you 
                        were taking care of it  . 

                                 IYANA
                        Look, Ben has done very well and we 
                        thought it was best to reward him 
                        for such. Your notification was 
                        recorded and we have re-assigned 
                        his HEAL responsibilities solely to 
                        you. I believe you have dinner with 
                        Mr. Martin tonight, you can tell 
                        him then. Win win. 

           She turns back around and walks away. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Iyana, wait!

           This time, she doesn’t bother turning around and continues 
           walking away. 

                                 IYANA
                        Win. Win. 
           INT. MASTRO’S STEAK HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           Naomi sits a table for two, fidgeting. Lawrence appears, she 
           stands and they shake hands. They sit. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        And Mr. Skarsgard will not be 
                        joining us tonight, is that 
                        correct? 

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes, that’s right. And from here on 
                        out, it’ll be just you and me 
                        working together. Ben’s workload 
                        has shifted, but you’re in good 
                        hands with me. Don’t worry.

           She smiles sweetly. Lawrence smiles as well, interest peaked. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Interesting, well goodbye and best 
                        to him. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I went ahead and ordered our usual 
                        drinks, if that’s okay. Whiskey 
                        neat for you?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        That’s exactly right. Clever girl.

           Her hand rests on the table and he pats it. This has never 
           happened. She doesn’t want to be offend, so she just lets him 
           rest his hand on hers. When the waiter comes over, she takes 
           that time to point something out on the menu, freeing her 
           hand from his grasp. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What is a “local sand dab”?

                                 SERVER
                        It’s a whitefish. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Ah, just wondering. Thanks. 

           The server leaves, Lawrence turns his attention back to 
           Naomi. 

                                 NAOMI
                        So how is the management team 
                        doing? I’m continuing to watch HEAL 
                        grow, and I’m impressed at the rate 
                        of retention. 
                                 LAWRENCE
                        Yes, all is well. You’ve done a 
                        great job navigating direction. You 
                        work long hours, must be hard on 
                        your boyfriend. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Um, yes long hours, no boyfriend. 
                        But let’s talk about some goals you 
                        have for the upcoming fiscal year. 

           She takes a big gulp of her water. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Well one thing I’d like in the new 
                        year is to get to know you better, 
                        since we’ll be working so closely. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I think we know each other plenty. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Do you date white men? I’ve dated 
                        some young women of color in my 
                        day, before I was married of 
                        course.

           He laughs to himself and points to the wedding ring on his 
           left hand. She’s unsure how to answer. The room’s temperature 
           seems to be steadily increasing.  

                                 NAOMI
                        Uh, well, I don’t really have time 
                        to date right now so my type is... 
                        no one? How long have you and your 
                        wife been married? A lasting, 
                        faithful love like that is rare. 
                        And beautiful. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Twenty years. 

           She breathes, hoping to have ideally moved the conversation 
           away from herself. He inches his chair closer to hers. He 
           moves his left hand from the top of the table to underneath 
           it. Onto her thigh. Instinctively, she jumps up bumping the 
           table and making a commotion in the restaurant. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Mr. Martin, what are you doing?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        Come on, Naomi. Let’s not make a 
                        scene. 
                                 LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
                        We can continue discussions back at 
                        my hotel if that’s preferred. 

           She puts her napkin on the table. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t think so. I think we should 
                        call it a night and perhaps re-
                        think the representative 
                        arrangement in the new year. 

           She grabs her purse. He scoffs, standing as well. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        You’re really a tease you know 
                        that, sending mixed signals, 
                        dressing like that, wanting to work 
                        with me alone. It was not like this 
                        in my day. 

           She’s confused, she hasn’t behaved in that manner at all. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I’m dressing how my firm has asked 
                        me to. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                        I bet no one else looks like you in 
                        a skirt like that. 

           He pulls out his wallet and throws cash onto the table. 

                                 LAWRENCE
                            (unbelievable)
                        You’re not as easy as Ben had 
                        suggested. 

           He turns and leaves. Naomi fights back tears, she finally 
           cracks. 

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           Diane sits on the couch eating cupcakes, watching TV. Naomi 
           comes bursting in, still teary-eyed. Diane doesn’t look away. 

                                 DIANE
                        So they all just hung out at a bar 
                        every night? I don’t get it. 

           Naomi rushes into her room and closes the door. 
                                 DIANE
                            (looking up)
                        Woman?

                                 NAOMI O.S.
                        I’m fine, just, uh food poisoning. 

                                 DIANE
                        Nasty!

           She goes back to watching TV.

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - SAME

           She has collapsed onto her bed and weeps softly, feeling 
           confused and violated. 

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING, 7:00AM

           Naomi lies awake having barely slept the night before. Her 
           “workout” alarm goes off, but she hits the snooze and rolls 
           over. 

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - 8:30AM

           Naomi rolls over again, checking the time on her phone. She 
           forces herself out of bed to get dressed. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You can make it through the day. 
                        Beyonce. Oprah. Harriet Tubman.  

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING

           She sits at her desk, barely functioning but trying to fill 
           her body with caffeine. There’s a soft knock on the door. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Come in. 

           Iyana enters and closes the door behind her. Naomi attempts 
           to perk up hoping for some good news. 

                                 IYANA
                        Good morning, Naomi. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Morning. I was actually planning on 
                        stopping by this morning to talk to 
                        you. 
                                 IYANA
                        Yes, well. You seem to be under the 
                        weather lately. I don’t know what 
                        your home and personal life are 
                        like, but some have noticed 
                        inconsistencies and it’s taking its 
                        toll on you here at work. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Who has complained?

                                 IYANA
                        I didn’t say complain. I’ve 
                        discussed it with others, we think 
                        you work so hard, you deserve a 
                        little break. After the winter 
                        holiday, take a few extra... weeks 
                        to yourself. We’ll let you know 
                        when to come in. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What about my companies?

           Iyana doesn’t dance around it. 

                                 IYANA
                        We’ve assigned your co-workers to 
                        help with the workload. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Am I being.... Fired? I didn’t do 
                        anything wrong. 

                                 IYANA
                        No of course not, we’re not firing 
                        you. We just think you deserve a 
                        break. Don’t worry about a thing.

                                 NAOMI
                        How can you say that? I have an 
                        excel sheet with the work that I’ve 
                        brought in, including the profits 
                        and revenues that no other junior 
                        associate can compete with .

                                 IYANA
                        It’s not about numbers. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Then what is it about? Tell me. 
                        Woman to Woman. 
                                 IYANA
                            (snapping)
                        I got you in the door, didn’t I? I 
                        personally recruited you and put 
                        your name on a highly competitive 
                        list of applicants. I gave you lead 
                        on a company. It’s not my
                            (searching for the word)
                        Job to hold your hand. Again, it’s 
                        nothing personal. I just don’t 
                        think... you fit in with everyone 
                        else. But if opportunities 
                        elsewhere present themselves, it’s 
                        good to have options. Have a nice 
                        holiday.

           She turns and leaves. Naomi lets it sink in before grabbing 
           her bag and walking out her office, turning off the light and 
           closing the door. 

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           She walks out of her office, trying to keep it all together 
           and her head high. She passes by Nick, who motions to come 
           talk to her. She shakes her head ‘no’ and continues walking, 
           right out the front door. 

           EXT. HLS OFFICE

           Stonefaced, she continues walking to her car, her face 
           incapable of registering emotion. As she gets to her car, she 
           quickly unlocks it and get inside. 

           INT. CAR - SAME

           She locks the door, puts her seatbelt on and starts crying. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Naomi lies in bed. She hears Diane approach her door, and she 
           lingers outside of it. Her shadow moves and a NOTE slips 
           underneath the door crack. Naomi turns to her door and reads 
           the note which says “This Too Shall Pass. Fuckers!” She 
           appreciates the sentiment, but is still upset. She rolls 
           over. 
           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           She’s still in bed, wrapped in covers. She looks at her 
           phone, only a few texts from Nick. She doesn’t feel like 
           reading them. She clicks her phone off and rolls back under 
           her sheets. 

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING. 

           Naomi lies awake on her back. She hears the front door open 
           and can hear Diane rummaging around. Once again she hears 
           Diane stand outside her door and again, she slips another 
           note under the door. This one says: “Chinese in the fridge 
           for you. Fuck them but love you.” She reads it and goes back 
           to sleep. 

           INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - LATE EVENING

           It’s now 11:45PM. She sits up in her bed and checks her 
           phone. She has some missed texts from her mom and reads the 
           first one.

                                 PATRICIA (TEXT)
                        Saw this and thought of you! LOL! 

           She scrolls down to see her mother has sent her a picture of 
           melted ice cream on the ground that has formed a smiley face. 
           She thinks for a moment and dials her mom. 

                                 NAOMI
                        ...Mom?

           There’s a pause. 

                                 PATRICIA O.C.
                        I’m on my way. 

           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Patricia, dressed in pajamas and looking very comfy, takes a 
           whistling tea kettle off the stove. She’s REAL Midwestern and 
           still retains her accent and upbeat vibe. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        I knew it, I got this sixth sense 
                        that told me you were in trouble 
                        and as soon as you called me, I 
                        just knew. Call it mother’s 
                        intuition.
           She pours two cups of tea and brings them to Naomi, who 
           slumps on the couch. She sits and sips. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        So let me make sure I have my ducks 
                        in a row. First you’re canoodling 
                        with this boy, then you find out he 
                        was two timin’ ya, then he says 
                        some provocative things at work, 
                        STEALS your idea from you-- 

                                 NAOMI
                        I mean, he didn’t “steal” it, the 
                        nature of the job is monitoring and 
                        upkeep for external entities. 

           She looks at her, steely-eyed. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        So he STEALS your idea from you, 
                        you report him to that self-
                        interested money monster, and then 
                        that old crab ASSAULTS you at 
                        dinner---

                                 NAOMI
                        He didn’t assault me, he just 
                        innocently put his hand on my 
                        thigh. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Naomi Johnson, nothing is ever 
                        innocent for people in power when 
                        they abuse it. You need to speak up 
                        when wrongdoings are being done.

                                 NAOMI
                        I don’t want to cause trouble for 
                        anyone. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Imagine where we’d be if Rosa 
                        Louise McCauley Parks didn’t say 
                        nothin’ because she didn’t want to 
                        “cause trouble for anyone.” 

           Naomi looks away, hiding rolled eyes. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Do you know where we’d be? The back 
                        of the bus, that’s where. 

           Diane claps from inside of her room. Naomi sighs loudly. 
                                 PATRICIA
                        As I was sayin’,  so they put you 
                        on some kinda administrative leave, 
                        and you’re home doing nothing, all 
                        those genius Johnson cells of yours 
                        going to waste. 

           She tuts. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Jerks, they are.

                                 NAOMI
                        ...Okay, when you put it that way. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Any way you put it sweetheart, 
                        that’s how it is. Let me tell you 
                        somethin’. 

           She puts her cup on a coaster on the coffee table and turns 
           to Naomi. She grabs her hands. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Some times, not everything is fair 
                        to women, to people of color and 
                        you bet your black bottom to women 
                        of color in particular. 

                                 DIANE O.S.
                        PREACH MAMA J. Preach.

           Patricia looks to Diane’s closed door, and shakes her head. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        She is so loud, that one. 
                            (back to her point)
                        You know what the hardest part of 
                        being one of the top cardiologists 
                        in California is?

                                 NAOMI
                        ....Daily heart break?

           Patricia hits her with a pillow.

                                 PATRICIA
                        Don’t be cute. The hardest part is 
                        doing it when you’re a black woman. 

           The conversation takes a turn for the serious, Naomi sits up 
           and gives her mother her full attention. 
                                 PATRICIA
                        When I started my residency, I was 
                        competing with a bunch of richos 
                        who came from prominent families in 
                        the medical community. For a lot of 
                        them, I was the first woman of 
                        color to be in the OR. For the 
                        first couple of years, I got 
                        mistaken for the god damn nurses. 
                        I’m pretty sure it was intentional 
                        after a while, to break my spirit. 
                        Though I love the nurses I work 
                        with, that’s not my job. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What did you do about it?

                                 PATRICIA
                        I did my damn job and I did it 
                        well. The guys I worked with always 
                        tried to find some reason to leave 
                        me out. I was intelligent, 
                        articulate, and not to toot my own 
                        horn, but I was pretty darn cute. 
                        I was something they didn’t 
                        understand and for a lot of people, 
                        it’s threatening and scary to work 
                        with what someone or something that 
                        is not what you assume it to be.  

                                 NAOMI
                        But that wasn’t your fault. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        And it’s not yours, sweetheart. 
                        They expected me to talk a certain 
                        way, or dress a certain way, or a 
                        “diversity hire” because of the 
                        color my skin and I blew those 
                        jerks out of the water. I finished 
                        top of my residency class and was 
                        offered positions at 
                            (numbers off on her hands)
                        The Mayo Clinic. Cleveland Clinic. 
                        Johns Hopkins. UCLA. Northwestern. 
                        The list goes on. I was a hot item, 
                        let me tell you. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I didn’t know that. 
                                 PATRICIA
                        It’s not important. What’s 
                        important is that some people just 
                        want to bring you down, but you 
                        have to keep your head up, kick ass 
                        and move on. Take the time you need 
                        for this rigmarole absence and plan 
                        out your next step. No one is 
                        making you stay, but if you leave, 
                        you make sure they all know why. 
                        This job is only your first and 
                        it’s not forever.

                                 NAOMI
                        It’s starting to look more like, 
                        never. I still don’t have a return 
                        date.

                                 PATRICIA
                        Who cares. As long as you’ve got a 
                        fire in your belly, you’ll survive. 
                        I didn’t single-handedly raise you 
                        to be a quitter. 

                                 NAOMI
                        So what am I supposed to do, file a 
                        lawsuit?

                                 PATRICIA
                        Not necessarily. Bad behavior can’t 
                        be condoned, just make your voice 
                        heard. Speak up! Who knows what 
                        might spark from it.

           Naomi smiles, and hugs her mom. She pats her sweetly. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        I love you. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I love you. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        That being said, honey, I think you 
                        oughta shower. Things are ripe. 

           Naomi pulls out of the hug and looks at her mom, who shrugs. 

                                 PATRICIA
                        Just being honest. As your mom. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - A WEEK LATER

           Naomi, looking a little more lively, sits in a mess of paper 
           print outs with her laptop open. There’s a knock at the door. 
           She gets up to open the door, Nick walks in, holding a 
           Banker’s Box. He takes in the apartment. 

                                 NICK
                        Nice place. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank you for coming over. I’m glad 
                        you like my cave of shame. Can I 
                        get you something to eat?

                                 NICK
                        I’m good, thanks. 

           He brings the boxes over to the living room floor and they 
           sit on the couch and go through it. 

                                 NAOMI
                        So what’s it like?

                                 NICK
                        A little dramatic. People are up in 
                        arms about Ben’s promotion and as a 
                        side note, people are asking what’s 
                        going on with you and no one’s 
                        getting answers. 

                                 NAOMI
                        I like being the office mystery. 
                        How are you?

                                 NICK
                        I think being miserable is apart of 
                        adulthood, and I’ve accepted it. I 
                        don’t think I’m cut out for the VC 
                        life. 

           She puts her fist out and he fist bumps her. 

                                 NICK
                        What a nostalgic gesture. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What can I say, I like oldies. 

                                 NICK
                        You’re really something else. 

                                 NAOMI
                        What do you mean?
                                 NICK
                            (fumfering)
                        I mean, it’s just, you’re something 
                        else as in, not like everyone else, 
                        which sounds really basic, which 
                        you’re definitely not. 

           He stops himself. 

                                 NICK
                        ...Oldies are good. I strictly 
                        watch TV shows from the 90s. This 
                        is real dorky but, find me a show 
                        as good as “Friends”, or better yet 
                        “Frasier”, and I’ll show you a 
                        happy man. 

           This grabs her attention. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You... watch Frasier?

                                 NICK
                        Oh I love it. Martin reminds me of 
                        my dad. Eddy reminds me of my mom. 

           She smiles, is Nick.... hot now? 

                                 NICK
                        Anyway, the other reason I came 
                        over. 

           He pulls papers and files from the Banker’s Box. 

                                 NICK
                        I brought everything on your desk 
                        and even, wait for it---

           He excitedly pulls out a USB from his coat pocket and hands 
           it to her.

                                 NICK
                        I was able to snag documents 
                        detailing all the work you’ve 
                        brought in the for the company. 

                                 NAOMI
                        WHAT? That’s amazing!! How?

                                 NICK
                        When you’re a loser at a big 
                        company, people forget you exist. 
                        You can just walk into their office 
                        anytime you want. 
           She’s stunned. 

                                 NICK
                            (confessing)
                        .... It also helps if you stay 
                        until 10PM at night, bribe the 
                        janitor to keep quiet, and work at 
                        a place with minimal security. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Still impressed. Let’s see what 
                        we’ve got. I’m “back at work” on 
                        Monday but it looks like I’m being 
                        completely cut out. Read this.

           She hands her phone to Nick, who reads an email. 

                                 NICK
                        “Hi Naomi, thanks for reaching out 
                        and Happy New Year to you too. I’ve 
                        been told that Eli will be taking 
                        over the account. Sorry you’re 
                        moving on, but pleasure working 
                        with you!” Brutal. 

           She shrugs. 

                                 NICK
                        Don’t be down about it. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oh, I’m not. I have an idea, but I 
                        need to be officially terminated.

                                 NICK
                        Is that something that just 
                        happens?

                                 NAOMI
                        We’ll find out, won’t we? 

           She leans forward, sparking a match and lighting a candle. 

                                 NAOMI
                        You still got some friends from 
                        your previous life?

           She smiles, wickedly. He doesn’t get it juuuust yet.   

           INT. HLS OFFICE - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING

           Naomi, dressed in normal upscale business attire, walks 
           through the office hoping to maintain normalcy. 
           She holds her head up confidently. As if instructed to do so, 
           people avoid her gaze as they see her approaching. Sharon 
           walks towards her but as she sees Naomi, she immediately and 
           obviously turns around. Naomi laser-focuses on her and paces 
           up to catch up to her.

                                 NAOMI
                        Sharon, just the woman I was 
                        looking for. 

           Sharon, caught, spins around hoping to make the interaction 
           quick. 

                                 NAOMI
                        How’s it going? I feel like we 
                        haven’t talked in ages. You good?

                                 SHARON
                            (tense)
                        Yes, very good. Things are good. I 
                        should go, I’ve got a flight out 
                        later and --

                                 NAOMI
                        I know you’re busy. After all, you 
                        overtook not one, not two, but 
                        three of my companies. Just wanted 
                        to say hi and check in.  

                                 SHARON
                        That’s nice of you. Yes, very busy 
                        with those. Sorry about that by the 
                        way, you know how these things go. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (rattling it off)
                        Sure! Anyway, I also wanted to tell 
                        you one other thing. In the Cheers 
                        finale, Rebecca marries the 
                        plumber, Frasier moves back to 
                        Seattle, Woody gets elected as a 
                        city councilman, Norm is given a 
                        job by Woody, Cliff is promoted to 
                        Postal Assistant and last but not 
                        least, Diane comes back after six 
                        years of separation from Sam, they 
                        get engaged but mutually break it 
                        off because the bar is Sam’s one 
                        true love.   

           Sharon looks like Hillary Clinton on November 8th, 2016.
                                 SHARON
                            (angrily)
                        We were on episode three!!!!

                                 NAOMI
                        Yeah, life sucks sometimes. 

           Sharon angrily storms away.  

                                 NAOMI
                            (realizing)
                        That felt good. 

           She thinks for a second. She spots Eli standing outside his 
           desk. She walks over to him. 

           INT. OUTSIDE ELI’S OFFICE

           Eli speaks quietly on his cell with a client. Naomi marches 
           up to him and smacks the phone out of his hands. 

                                 ELI
                        What the hell, I was on a call!

                                 NAOMI
                        Obviously. First things first, I 
                        was not a diversity hire. 

           She looks around. Everyone’s white, she might’ve been.  

                                 NAOMI
                        On second thought, I might’ve been 
                        but who cares. I have a higher IQ 
                        and lower cholesterol than you. 
                        More importantly, Ohio State is a 
                        stupid school and Ohio is a stupid 
                        state. It’s the “Florida of the 
                        North”, the belly button of this 
                        country, and a breeding ground for 
                        serial killers. 

           He looks stunned. She feels even better. She walks back to 
           her office.  

                                 ELI
                            (yelling, hurt)
                        It’s The Ohio State! THE! 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Naomi, feet up on her desk, picks at her teeth as MOVERS 
           carry out the couch in her office. She looks at her clock. 
                                 NAOMI
                            (to the movers)
                        3PM, that’s a wrap for me, am I 
                        right guys? More important things 
                        to do. 

           She stands and leaves her office. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STARBUCKS

           Naomi enters and joins a MYSTERY WOMAN for coffee, who wears 
           slacks and a button down shirt. They talk. 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - TUESDAY MORNING

           Naomi wears a napkin bib as she eats a full rack of rubs at 
           her desk. She blasts the musical stylings of Drake from her 
           computer, but her door is closed. She pauses it, then glances 
           at her door, thinking. 

           INT. OUTSIDE OF NAOMI’S OFFICE - SAME

           She pops her head out and looks amongst the office. 

                                 NAOMI
                        HEY! Anyone have a problem with 
                        Drake?

           Everyone looks at her like she’s crazy. We now see her full 
           outfit. Today she’s wearing jeans, a T-shirt, and a blazer 
           that’s two sizes too big for her. No one responds to her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Cool, me too. That’s what I 
                        figured.  

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE.

           Leaving the door open, she walks back to her desk. After 
           licking her fingers clean from leftover BBQ sauce, she un-
           pauses the music and blasts it, making its way into the 
           hallway. 

           EXT. HLS OFFICE - EARLY EVENING. 

           Naomi walks out for the day, waving loudly to co-workers. 
           They ignore her. As she walks to her car, she spots Ned. 
           She waves to him, hoping his crush on her would allow him to 
           be polite enough to wave back. He does not. She shakes her 
           head and pops her trunk. She eyes something we don’t see. 

                                 NAOMI
                            (to Ned)
                        Hey Ned!

           He looks her way.

                                 NAOMI
                        Forgot to return this. Catch. 

           She steps out from her popped trunk and we see a football in 
           her hand. She takes a step forward and launches it at him. We 
           watches it as it spirals perfectly at him. He dodges it and 
           it hits his car, setting the car alarm off. She shrugs. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Oops!

           She gets a call from someone. She answers. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Hello, this is Naomi. 

           A beat.

                                 NAOMI
                        Yes, hi! Nick said you’d be 
                        calling. I’m about to get in my car 
                        and then we can discuss a little 
                        more. Give me one second. 

           She unlocks her car and gets in. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - WEDNESDAY MORNING

           The partners and associates sit in the middle of the meeting 
           as Iyana talks. 

                                 IYANA
                        Projects for early stage companies 
                        will be in by end of the week. 

           Naomi bursts in the door, this time wearing a graphic T shirt  
           that says “I Met God, She’s Black”, leggins, gym shoes, and 
           her hair is in a messy bun. She squeezes by people, excusing 
           herself. She sits next to Ben, making him make room for her. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Sorry I’m late, had some pipe 
                        problems if ya know what I mean. 
           She points obviously to her lower intestines. People grimace. 

           INT. OUTSIDE OF NAOMI’S OFFICE - THURSDAY MORNING

           Iyana walks out of her office, fanning the air. 

           INT. NAOMI’S OFFICE - SAME

           Naomi, sitting at her desk, puts her bare feet up on her 
           desk, and her hands behind her head. Today she’s wearing a 
           full grey sweat suit with the hood up.

                                 NAOMI
                            (shouting to Iyana)
                        Thanks for the boot! Gonna miss you 
                        babe.  Good talk! 

           She gets a text from Nick saying: “Made my calls, send to me 
           when you’re done!” She takes her feet off the desk, puts on 
           her flip flops, and walks out of the office. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING

           Diane chomps away at Chinese food, looking over Naomi’s 
           shoulder as she types something on her laptop. 

                                 DIANE
                        Yes, yes, I love it, I die for it. 

           Naomi shushes her. She types a few more things, skims it and 
           then theatrically clicks on her laptop. We hear the familiar 
           “SWOOSH” of an email being sent. 

           INT. IYANA’S OFFICE - A COUPLE DAYS LATER

           Iyana doodles on a ruled notepad as she listens to a 
           conference call on speaker phone. 

                                 ASSISTANT O.C.
                        You can’t go in there, she’s on a 
                        call. 

           Naomi bursts into the office. Iyana immediately returns to 
           the call. 

                                 IYANA
                        Excuse me a moment, I will dial 
                        back in. 

           She ends the call. 
                                 IYANA
                        Naomi, I think our severance 
                        package was more than fair. You 
                        can’t just barge into people’s 
                        offices. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Right right. 

                                 IYANA
                        Look, I’m sorry things didn’t work 
                        out but I hope, on your final day, 
                        we can terminate the relationship 
                        on positive terms. 

           Naomi nods. 

                                 NAOMI
                        Cool cool cool. Just wanted to give 
                        you a lil heads up, there’s an 
                        interesting article in the “Times” 
                        this morning. You know how to read 
                        right?

           A look of sincere dread takes over Iyana’s face. She 
           immediately begins typing away on her computer.  

                                 NAOMI
                        Woman to woman, I think I did a 
                        good job, but who knows. I’m not 
                        sure I “fit in” as a journalist 
                        either, but we’ll see! Okey dokey, 
                        have a nice day. 

           She confidently strides out as Iyana’s office phone and cell 
           blow ups up calls and texts.. 

           INT. HLS OFFICE - VARIOUS

           Naomi cooly walks through the office one last time. People 
           are scrambling to read the article. We hear an excerpt in her 
           VO. 

                                 NAOMI VO
                        I would like to thank the New York 
                        Times for letting me write this as 
                        a guest editor. The world of 
                        Venture Capitalist is largely about 
                        your social networks. Are you 
                        likable, do people want to do 
                        business with you, are you easy to 
                        be around? 
                                 NAOMI VO (CONT'D)
                        Sure it matters if you have good 
                        taste and a strong work ethic, but 
                        at the end of a day, it’s about 
                        your relationships with people. I 
                        worked at a company with no 
                        infrastructure to report the sexual 
                        harassment I received from a co-
                        worker who was promoted over me 
                        along with other qualified junior 
                        associates. Speaking of, hey Ben! 
                        How’s Susan?

           Ben reads the article online. He’s mortified. We see he gets 
           a phone call that he debates answering. 

                                 NAOMI VO
                        When I reported his behavior, I was 
                        told it would be handled. The only 
                        thing that was handled, was me at a 
                        dinner I had with a cofounder 
                        because that same co-worker told 
                        him I was easy. Instead of trying 
                        to help me or make my life easier, 
                        I was put on leave and slowly 
                        ousted from all of the companies I 
                        was on a team for, with more than 
                        half of them bringing in the 
                        highest revenue of any other 
                        associates. 

           EXT. HLS OFFICE

           She walks to her car. 

                                 NAOMI VO
                        I ignored the disparaging comments 
                        on my race, hoping to put it behind 
                        me. I quietly complained about the 
                        harassment and retaliation, not 
                        wanting to cause trouble. I am not 
                        opting to personally press charges, 
                        my time is far better spent than in 
                        arbitration. But I am speaking up. 
                        I hope to bring to light my 
                        experience and encourage others to 
                        come forward with theirs. I was 
                        recently reminded that in order to 
                        start a fire, all you need is a 
                        spark to get it going. Let the 
                        other sparks speak up and let’s 
                        burn it to the ground.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MONTHS LATER

           Naomi takes over a table with her laptop open; websites like 
           LinkedIn and Monster are open, and pamphlets from companies 
           are spread out. There’s an open seat next to her, with a 
           coffee at it. She reads a NEWSPAPER intently, she puts it 
           down and smiles. We see a glimpse of a headline “HARASSMENT 
           IN THE VALLEY.” Nick comes shuffling in, he drops his bag 
           down beside her. He kisses her on the cheek and then one by 
           one plops a different NEWSPAPER in front of her. Each with 
           headlines like “CRISIS KEEPS GETTING WORSE”, “WOMEN OF SEXUAL 
           ASSAULT”, and “THE VERDICT ON WOMEN IN TECH.” She gets a text 
           from her mom with LINKS to other articles, followed by five 
           FIRE EMOJIS. She shakes her head and puts her phone down. 
           Nick sits across from her, they cheers their lattes, and each 
           sip, about to start reading. 

                                                              FADE OUT.
