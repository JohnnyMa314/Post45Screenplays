                                 "Keep Coming Back."

                                             -- AA saying
           WE'RE UNDERWATER...

           Sun dapples the surface of the lake overhead. A figure is
           floating towards us. Coming into focus.

           IT'S A FOUR-YEAR-OLD-GIRL in a red bathing suit. Hair
           ripples, fear frozen in her glassy blue eyes.

           She hasn't been dead long.

           Tickling fronds of seaweed reach up from below and wrap
           around her arms and legs and neck like gnarled green
           fingers, and pull her down, down, down into the cold abyss.

           INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM - VERMONT - DAY

           The room of a teenage boy. Patriots memorabilia. Lacrosse
           stick. The glow-in-the-dark stars have survived on the
           ceiling since elementary school.

           WARREN MANN (50) enters. He wears rumpled dress shirt, and a
           two week old beard. Dark circles under kind eyes. He touches
           the door. The knob has been removed.

           A handsome J-Crew couple follows. JAN and MIKE. They've been
           through hell, and tensions are high. They watch him sniffing
           around. Bed is made. Hospital corners. Trophies sparkle.

           Warren notices the guitar on the stand. Picks it up. Tunes
           it. Jan and Mike exchange a look as he strums a minor chord.

           And then he turns it upside and starts shaking it wildly.
           Drug baggies fall out of the sound hole and land on the
           vacuumed carpet. Bingo. Jan bursts into tears.

                                 JAN
                        He lied to my face.

           Mike hugs her. Hushes her. Warren scoops up the baggies.

                               (
                                tired
                                 WARREN
                                 )
                        You know how you can tell if an
                        addict is lying? Their lips are
                        moving. It's not even Kyle anymore.
                        He's in his disease, and he's gonna
                        do whatever it takes to protect it.
                        You can't take it personally, Jan.

           He's said it a million times.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Let's make this his moment of grace.
           It seems to help a little. Warren looks at the bags. There
           are SMILEY FACES stamped on them.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The pre-intervention dry run. Warren sits before Jan and
           Mike. More people have joined the circle. A GRANDMOTHER,
           some FRIENDS, an AUNT. Jan practices her letter.

                                 JAN
                        You were legally dead for two minutes
                        before the paramedics found you. And
                        gave you a shot of Narcan. It worked
                        like a miracle. It reversed the
                        overdose, and brought you back to life.
                        They saved your life and you cursed
                        them out for spoiling your high...

           Warren's phone lights up. Call from MARIE. He ignores it.

                                 JAN (cont'd)
                        By the time I got to the hospital,
                        you were gone. Not dead. You had
                        already died. I mean gone. You ripped
                        out your IV, called your dealer and
                        left to shoot up in the parking lot.
                        Death wasn't enough of bottom for
                        you. Kyle, my beautiful baby boy,
                        please except our--

                                 MIKE
                        --It's not tough enough.

                                 WARREN
                        Gratitude's the key to these letters.

                                 MIKE
                        I'm not feeling very grateful right
                        now, Warren.

                                 WARREN
                        Focus on the good. It's disarming. It's
                        the last thing he's expecting to hear.

                                 MIKE
                        Dear Kyle. Get your ass back to rehab,
                        or yer gonna die again for good this
                        time. How's that for disarming?

                                 GRANDMOTHER
                        Michael.
                                 MIKE
                        He won't go! We've done everything.
                        He's just so goddamn stubborn--

                                 WARREN
                        --Anger can be fatal right now. This
                        is an act of love, no judgments.

                                 AUNT
                        That's right. Relapse is just a mile
                        marker on the road to recovery.

                                 WARREN
                        That's very good, Shelia.

                                 AUNT
                        It's from your book.

           He has to think. It is. A car pulls into the driveway.

                                 MIKE
                        It's him.

                                 JAN
                        He's early!

                                 WARREN
                        Okay everyone, you did the work now
                        trust the process. It works if you
                        work it. Read the letters exactly as
                        written, stick to the script--

                                 AUNT
                        Mike.

                                 WARREN
                        --We’re here because we love Kyle
                        more than he loves himself right now.
                        Let’s show him how much.

           Jan takes Mike's hand. He swallows his anger. The front door
           opens, and KYLE (17) enters. He stops in his tracks when he
           sees everybody stand.

                                 KYLE
                        What are you--

                                 WARREN
                        Hi, Kyle. My Name is Warren. We're
                        here today because--

                                 KYLE
                        --Okay, I'll go.

           Warren's caught off-guard.
                                 WARREN
                        Oh. Yes. Okay, great!

           Everyone blows past Warren to hug Kyle. They cry together
           and it's nothing but love. Warren just watches. Separate.

                                                            CUT TO:

           WARREN'S MUDDY AND CHIPPED BUMPER STICKER

                 "No one will ever cut you off if you let them in."

           INT. WARREN'S OLD VOLVO - DAY

           Kyle and Warren drive in silence. And then...

                                 KYLE
                        How much did they pay you?

                                 WARREN
                        I charge a four thousand dollar
                        retainer. 

                                 KYLE
                        Four grand? For what? A ride?

           Warren gets a call from MARIE. He ignores it.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        Can we listen to music?

                                 WARREN
                        You have to learn to sit with
                        yourself, bud. Wherever you go there
                        you are.

           Kyle starts humming a song. He bats away a pesky tear. He
           looks away. Green mountains whiz by.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I know how you feel.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah right.

                                 WARREN
                        Yeah right? How about I was slamming
                        two bundles a day for fifteen years.
                        Robbing dealers, shitting myself,
                        stealing Nana's painkillers while
                        she's dying of cancer upstairs cuz I
                        needed them more apparently.

           Kyle shoots him a look. 
                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Now I got twenty-five years clean. My
                        life's unfolding instead of
                        unraveling. I have a beautiful
                        daughter who loves me, and who has
                        never seen me drunk or high, and the
                        crazy thing is, it wasn't a waste of
                        time, all that horrible shit I did. I
                        can use it all to help people,
                        because I've been there. My struggle
                        has value. And so does yours.

                                 KYLE
                        This is my fourth time.

                                 WARREN
                        So, you've done it before. You've
                        done it for your parents, you've done
                        it for the judge, now do it for you.

                                 KYLE
                        Dying. This is my fourth time dying.

           This throws Warren off.

                                 KYLE (cont'd)
                        I'm gonna get out, I'm gonna relapse,
                        and I'm gonna die.

           They drive in silence. And then Warren turns on the radio.

           EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE TREATMENT CENTER - DAY

           They stand before the welcoming doors of the fancy rehab.
           Kyle holds his suitcase. White as a ghost.

                                 WARREN
                        Can I tell you something? I do this a
                        lot, you know? It's my job.

                                 KYLE
                        What a shitty job.

                                 WARREN
                        Yeah. But I never saw a kid with more
                        of a chance than you. Listen to me.
                        You're willing. I know it doesn't
                        sound like much but it's everything.
                        You were the quickest yes I ever got.

                                 KYLE
                        I want to get sober.
                                 WARREN
                        And now you're here, and you want it,
                        and people love you. You're nothing
                        but hope. A dopeless hope fiend.

                                laughs
                                 KYLE
                                      )
                               (
                        That's stupid.

                                 WARREN
                        Yeah. Well, what do you want? I'm
                        stupid.

                                 KYLE
                        Where do I go?

                                 WARREN
                        In there.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay.

                                 WARREN
                        You wanna hug?

                                 KYLE
                        No.

           They hug.

                                 WARREN
                        I'll see you in 90 days.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay.

                                 WARREN
                        Here's my card, call me if you get
                        squirrely, you know?

                                 KYLE
                        I will.

           Kyle picks up his bags and starts inside.

                                 WARREN
                        Go easy on your folks, they love you!

           The doors close behind Kyle. Warren lights a smoke, takes a
           deep inhale.

           INT. WARREN'S VOLVO - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Warren blasts Carole King like he's trying to drown
           something out. He pulls into a dead end near the woods.
           MARIE is calling. He silences it. Three missed calls. He's
           gritting his teeth as he digs around in his pockets.

           And pulls out one of KYLE'S SMILEY FACE DRUG BAGGIES.

           He rubs the bag between his fingers. He likes the feel of
           the plastic. He likes the crinkle sound it makes. The smiley
           face is warped by his nervous fingering. Smile to frown,
           smile to frown, smile to--

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Will you teach me, daddy?

           EXT. LAKE - WARREN'S MEMORY

           Mist looms above a secluded lake, set deep in the woods.

           LITTLE ALLY (4) stands on the edge of rickety dock. She's
           wearing her red bathing suit. Sagging wood creaks under her
           feet. It could collapse at any moment.

           She touches a toe to the water. Her reflection ripples. She
           glances up the cobblestone path at her sister, CHRISTY (6)
           swinging on a tire swing, trying to touch heaven.

           Ally bows at the edge, touching her fingertips to the water.

           Christy swings higher and higher and -- SPLASH!!!

                                                            CUT TO:

           WARREN'S EYES CRACK OPEN!

           He sucks in a HORRIBLE WHEEZING GASP, like he was holding
           his breath in his sleep.  

           It's dusk. He's left his car running and the battery is
           dead. He looks down at the smiley face baggie. And shoves it
           back in his pocket. Not yet. Not today. 

           EXT. TURNAROUND - NIGHT

           The AAA Service guy gives him a jump.

                                 SERVICE GUY
                        So, it died and you ran out of gas?

                                 WARREN
                        I know, story of my life right?

           EXT. WARREN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Warren is parked outside his office. It's above a pizza
           shop. His window reads:
                                     WARREN MANN

                       * Certified Intervention Professional *

           He's on the phone. Nervous.

                                 WARREN
                        What are you using at Fenway? Minus
                        one fifty? Gimmie ten dimes on The

                        I know what it is. I'm good for it. I
                        got a check coming Monday, I just did
                        a-- Yes, I'm good for it, Lenny,
                        they're locked! It's a lock! It's the
                        sugar lock of the week! Lock it up!

           INT. WARREN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Warren enters. It's dark. There's a STRANGE MAN hunched in
           the corner, shrouded by shadows and staring at him. He flips
           the lights. The Strange Man is a cardboard cutout of
           himself. An ad for his old memoir.

                                 THE INTERVENTIONIST
                        A story of addiction and redemption.
                                   By Warren Mann

           Cardboard Warren is twenty years younger. Happier.
           Healthier. Smiling bright.

           He moves into the living room. Funeral programs and
           laminated prayer cards strewn across the counter. A pile of
           dead kids. He goes to a shoe box of assorted powders, pills,
           and baggies. Kits, works, and tourniquets. Needles still in
           plastic confiscated from clients. He drops Kyle's smiley
           face bags in there.

           He almost steps on the EXOTIC FISH that lies dead on the
           carpet beside the glowing aquarium. And sighs.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Warren flushes the dead fish down the toilet.
           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           The couch has been pulled out into a bed. Warren sits here
           surrounded by moving boxes, chain smoking, and watching the
           game. The place is packed with too much stacked furniture
           and stuff from his old house, because he's living here now.

           The Red Sox are up three runs in the bottom of the ninth.
           He's feeling good, he's feeling real good. And then The
           Yankees hit a grand slam, and his jaw hits the carpet.

           He sits for a moment in his disbelief, and then he calmly
           throws the remote control out the window.

           His phone rings. Incoming call: UNKNOWN CALLER.

                                 WARREN
                               (
                                              )
                                clenched teeth
                        Fuck, Lenny, I said Monday.

           He silences the phone, and turns it off.

           TIME CUT

           Warren is stalking through the same eight public photos on
           CHRISTY MANN'S Facebook page. She's a beautiful blonde 20-
           year-old. Laughing with friends. Hugging her well-toned
           boyfriend, TUCKER, 23, Asian-American. Pictures of the two
           of them at swim meets, winning medals. Her smile makes
           Warren smile.

           Friend request forever pending.

           Three copies of his less successful followup are stacked
           underneath the couch to balance its broken leg:

                                  FORGIVE YOURSELF!
                            The Healing Art of Letting Go
                                   By Warren Mann
                            Author of The Interventionist

           The books slip out and the couch collapses under him. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE OFFICE - NIGHT

           Warren dumps boxes of his books into the dumpster out back,
           and slaps it shut. It feels good. Clean. He sees the remote
           in the street and goes to pick it up.

           He stops.

           Sees a MIDDLE-AGED MAN standing under a BUZZING STREET
           LIGHT. Staring at Warren with vacant eyes. Arm covered in a
           black road map of track marks.
                                 WARREN
                        Pete?

           The Man turns, and walks down the alley.

           Warren shrugs it off and goes inside.

           INT. OFFICE - DAWN

           Dusty morning light punches through a crack in the black out
           curtains and seeps into the room. Warren sits at his dining
           room folding table, surrounded by yellow paper.

           It's an endless letter, and he's been at it for years.
           Stabbing cigarette butts into a crowded ashtray. Crumpled
           pages and false starts. Some pages typed, some scrawled on
           scraps, and napkins.

           They all start the same way: 

                                    Dear Christy,
                        They say if you always tell the truth
                        you never have to remember anything.

           He's writing and writing, but he can never seem to find the
           right words. He crosses everything out.

           He glances in the mirror. The box of drugs reflected. He's
           sweating. At war with himself. He lowers the pen. Chews his
           lip. The box seems to glow in the moonlight. Calling.

                                 WARREN
                        Fuck.

           He jumps to his feet and hurries to the box. So much fucking
           heroin. Different bags, different colors, different stamps.

           He dips his hands into the box, like it's warm water. The
           hair on the back of his neck stands up. His hand gets lost
           in balloons and baggies. He just wants to feel them.

           He catches the judgmental gaze of his CARDBOARD CUT-OUT on
           the other side of the room. A quick stare down. Real Warren
           loses. He rips his hand out of the bag, almost embarrassed,
           and snaps himself out of this self-destructive trance.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Warren is frantically dumping the drugs into the toilet.
           Black tar, China white, emptying bag after bag.

           He flushes the toilet. It burps and gurgles and starts to
           overflow. Water spills down the side, and pools around his
           feet like the toilet is overdosing.
           He rips the top off the tank, fidgets around, and then he
           manages to turn the valve, but not before --

           The toilet vomits up THE EXOTIC FISH.

           Warren reaches for it and --

           IT FLAPS ALIVE.

           Warren reels back.

           The fish is jumping on the tiles among the dope water and
           the torn drug baggies.

           Warren just stares at it for a beat. Confused. And then he
           scoops it up and drops it back into the aquarium. He watches
           it swim around.

           THE ORNAMENTAL HOUSE at the bottom of the tank glows
           ominously in the buzzy blue light.

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! Warren jumps. Someone is pounding on
           the door. And a ghostly voice --

                                 YOUNG CHRISTY (O.S.)
                        Wake up Daddy! Wake up Daddy! Open
                        the door! DADDDDDDY!!!!!

           Warren looks at the door in horror. Bending on its hinges.
           Knock! Knock! Knock!

                                 MARIE (O.S.)
                        Warren?!

           Marie's VOICE SNAPS Warren out of his trance.

                                 WARREN
                        Huh?!

                                 MARIE (O.S.)
                        Warren?! Open the door!

                                 WARREN
                        Marie?

                                 MARIE
                        OPEN THE DOOR!

                                 WARREN
                        Yeah, just a sec!

           Warren shuts the bathroom door. Dumps his cigarette butts
           into the garbage. Gives himself a bath of Fabreeze.
           EXT. WARREN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Warren opens the door a crack. MARIE (45) is standing on the
           stoop. So well dressed, and put together, save for the teary
           smear of mascara that bruises her soulful eyes.

                                 WARREN
                        What are you doing?

                                 MARIE
                        I’ve been calling all day.

           She tries to peek inside, but he blocks her view in case he
           forgot anything. 

                                 WARREN
                        I was on a job. My phone died.

                                 MARIE
                        It's Christy... she...

                                 WARREN
                        No.

                                 MARIE
                        She's not gonna survive another
                        overdose.

           Marie bursts into tears. Warren finds himself wrapping her
           in his arms. Another old habit. She lets him.

                               (
                                dazed
                                 WARREN
                                 )
                        Hey. It's okay. This is okay. Relapse
                        is just a mile marker on the road
                        to-- FUCK! Are you sure? I mean, she
                        was doing so good, wasn't she?!

                                 MARIE
                        You have to come back with me.

                                 WARREN
                        What?

                                 MARIE
                        You have to do an intervention.

                                 WARREN
                        Marie, I can't.

                                 MARIE
                        What do you mean, you can't?
                                 WARREN
                        It's a conflict of interest. Let me
                        call Dennis Berliner up in Stowe.
                        He's the best there is.

                                 MARIE
                        You're the best there is.

                                 WARREN
                        She’s made it pretty clear she
                        doesn’t want me in her life.

                                 MARIE
                        I’m not asking you to be in her life.
                        I’m asking you to save it.

           He looks at her.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Just say yes.

           INT. WARREN’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Warren dumps his endless Dear Christy letter into a
           briefcase, along with some Narcan Spray. Opiate Blocker. He
           locks the briefcase, thumbs the combo lock, and goes. 

           In the tank, the fish swims around the ornamental house.

           INT. MARIE’S VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT - AFTERNOON

           Warren melts into the comfy passenger seat of the sleek
           luxury ride. He’s on the phone.

                                 WARREN
                        I can’t thank you enough. Perfect,
                        Connie, we’ll see you tonight. I owe
                        you big time. Send my love to Tom.
                               (
                                hangs up
                                        )
                        She’s in.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, thank God.

                                 WARREN
                        Silverdale. It's the best. There’s a
                        four month wait for a bed, but I send
                        them so much business, you know?

                                 MARIE
                        You’re a miracle worker.

                                 WARREN
                        It’s a living.
                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        This is not how her story ends. I
                        promise you. As long as she’s
                        breathing there’s hope for recovery.

                                 MARIE
                        You know she still wears the watch
                        you got her she joined the team?

                                 WARREN
                        What, that old Poolmate?

                                 MARIE
                        She never takes it off.

                                 WARREN
                        Really?

           This helps a little. Warren stares out the window. Green
           mountains stretch into heaven. His phone buzzes. Incoming
           call. UNKNOWN CALLER. Fuck. He silences it.

                                 MARIE
                        Who keeps calling?

                                 WARREN
                        Nobody.

                                 MARIE
                        Are you gambling again?

                                 WARREN
                        That was fast.

                                 MARIE
                        I dunno. Your phone's been weighing
                        four hundred pounds lately.

                                 WARREN
                        Is Richard's coming?

                                 MARIE
                        He's there.

                                 WARREN
                        But, is he an influencer?

                                 MARIE
                        What you mean?

                                 WARREN
                        Team members need to have influence
                        or they really shouldn't be there.
                                 MARIE
                        Well, he's been there. She loves him.
                        Is that influence?

                                 WARREN
                        Yes.

           THUNDER RUMBLES in the distance as they pass a sign:

                              WELCOME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE.
                                 “Live Free or Die.”

           It’s a threat.

           EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE HIGHWAY - DAY

           Warren watches as they whip past the Keene exit.

                                 WARREN
                        You missed the turn.

                                 MARIE
                        No, I didn't.

                                 WARREN
                        Where are we going?

                                 MARIE
                        The lake house.

                                 WARREN
                        No.

                                 MARIE
                        It's all set.

                                 WARREN
                        Marie.

                                 MARIE
                        Her boyfriend's bringing her up, she
                        thinks it's a romantic getaway.
                               (
                                off his look
                                            )
                        It was the only way.

           Warren grips his briefcase tighter. His horrible truth is
           locked in there. His secrets. His lies.

                                 WARREN
                        You should have told me.

                                 MARIE
                        Would you have come if I did?

           He looks away.
           EXT. RURAL VILLAGE - AFTERNOON

           Lightning splits the sky in two as the Volkswagen glides
           down Main Street. Warren gazes out the window. The village
           looks strung out in the sickly green light.

           They pull up to the only stop light in town and

           KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

           Warren jumps out of his skin as A HOMELESS JUNKIE appears
           out of thin air, rapping on the window. He holds a soiled
           cardboard sign with nothing written on it. Arms covered in
           track marks. Sunken face speckled with sores.

           The Junkie holds out his palm.

                                 MARIE
                        Ignore him.

           The Junkie presses his hand against the window.

           Warren looks into his eyes. They burn dead liver yellow with
           unquenchable want. He sees himself in there and shudders.

           The light turns green. They drive on. His hand print smudges
           as they leave him in the dust.

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - AFTERNOON

           Warren enters. Notices the caution tape blocking the
           bathroom. BENNY (20s), the cashier, is happy to see him.
           He's missing a few teeth.

                                 BENNY
                        Yo! It's the Junkie whisperer!

                                 WARREN
                        Benny. My man.

                                 BENNY
                        What are you doing all the way up
                        here? You got a client in town?

                                 WARREN
                        Something like that, yeah.

           He motions to the bathroom.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        What happened?

                                 BENNY
                        Pete. Nice guy.
                                 WARREN
                        ...Pete Miller?

                                 BENNY
                        You knew him?

           Warren nods.

                                 BENNY (cont'd)
                        He's been in an out for a long time.
                        He struggled, man.

           He hands Warren a prayer card. It trembles in his hand.

                                 WARREN
                        He was my first sponsor... a million
                        years ago. We had a falling out.

                                 BENNY
                        What happened?

                                 WARREN
                        We just weren't a right fit for each
                        other that's all.

                                 BENNY
                        Funeral was yesterday. It was good.
                        People came. What's wrong with you?

                                 WARREN
                        Nothing...

           A picture of PETE. He looks a hell of a lot like the middle-
           aged man he saw standing under the buzzing street light.
           It's hard to be sure, but Warren shudders anyway.

                                 BENNY
                        He's the fifth guy to OD in there in
                        six months.

                                 WARREN
                        Seal that fucking door shut.

                                 BENNY
                        Everyone's dying, Warren. Morgue's
                        full up. They brought in a cold-
                        storage trailer for the overflow. 

           Warren's staring off into space. Spooked.

                                 OLD FARMER (O.S.)
                        It's the devil's work.

           They turn to a rawboned, sunburnt OLD FARMER with a scar
           over his eye, eavesdroping from a donut dusted table.
                                 OLD FARMER
                        I seen 'em bring one back. With that
                        Narcan. Some junker up on Gurney
                        Lane. Seen him lying there in the
                        road with a needle in his arm. They
                        brung him back from the goddamn dead
                        where he belongs. Why? So he can use
                        again and die some more tomorrow.
                        Without fear of what lies beyond.
                        Where's God in that?

           The Old Farmer glares at Warren with cloudy eyes.

                                 BENNY
                        Decaf, Luther.

           But Warren is shaken by this. He turns to Benny.

                                 WARREN
                        Gimmie a Box O' Joe. I got a feeling
                        it's gonna be a long night.

           EXT. ROAD TO THE LAKE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           They pull off the main drag and crawl down a dirt road that
           cuts through the old growth forest. It's a long way in.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           They finally pull up to the charming mountain style house.
           Old stone chimney. Green tiled roof. It rests on the
           secluded lake. They're way back in the woods.

           Warren sees the TIRE SWING dangling from a tree. Swaying
           like a hypnotist's watch. They pull around back.

                                 MARIE
                        Ready?

           Warren is staring at THE DOCK. It looks brand new. Sturdy.
           Not like the dock from his dreams.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Richard put it in.

                                 WARREN
                        It looks good.

           At the end of the dock, a MEMORIAL GARDEN STONE with a
           sculpted angel splayed over a carving:

                            Those we love don't go away,
                           they walk beside us every day.
                          Unseen, unheard, but always near,
                        so loved, so missed, so very dear.

           Flowers. A cairn of stacked stones. A shrine to lost love.
           Warren's eyes swell with a lifetime of guilt. The wind
           cries. THUNDER BOOMS. Warren takes it personally.

                                 MARIE
                        I have something I want you to read.
                        It might help.

           She reaches into the back seat, and presents Warren with a
           copy of his own book -- FORGIVE YOURSELF!

           He can't escape it. On the cover, Warren wears a forced
           smile. He looked old and tired, even then.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        There's some good stuff in here, I
                        think you'd get a lot out of it
                        actually. 

           He throws the book in the back. Pained.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        You're really gonna make me say it,
                        aren't you?

           He looks at her.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        It wasn't your fault.

                                 WARREN
                        I actually thought it'd get easier.

                                 MARIE
                        It doesn't get easier. You just learn
                        to live with it. Or you don't.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           RICHARD CABRERA (45), humble winner of the genetic lottery,
           is studying Warren's first book, The Interventionist. He's a
           regal Spaniard, wearing a tight dress shirt and skinny
           jeans. He's underlining a passage:

                                    CHAPTER NINE
                    "DEAL WITH THE PAST BEFORE IT DEALS WITH YOU"

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - FOYER - AFTERNOON

           Warren takes one step through the door and shudders. He
           looks around. It's quaint, but antiseptic. A glorious view
           of the lake outside massive picture windows. 
           Warren sees the PHOTO on the wall. LITTLE CHRISTY, a beaming
           buck-toothed 6-year-old in a yellow bathing suit. And her
           baby sister, ALLY, in a red bathing suit. They play on the
           tire swing. We see his sad reflection trapped in the glass.
           He turns away, pained.

                                 WARREN
                        Where's Bill?

                                 MARIE
                        Who?

           He points to the spot above the hearth.

                                 WARREN
                        My brookie. The trout.

                                 MARIE
                        That whole rustic thing... I dunno.

                                 WARREN
                        He was a three and a half pounder.

                                 MARIE
                        He followed me with his eyes.

           Warren sees THE CUPBOARD UNDER THE STAIRS. The dark green
           door creaks open just an inch.

           This triggers a MEMORY FLASH:

           A frantic Warren is helping Young Christy inside the
           cupboard. He gives her some Barbies, and a flashlight and
           shuts the door on her horrified face.

           SIRENS in the distance.

                                                           BACK TO:

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Warren?

           Warren snaps out of it. Turns to Marie.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Where'd you go?

           He's only been inside a minute and already his mind's
           fucking him.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        That you, hon?
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           They move to the living room, Warren sees the Adonis on the
           couch reading his book.

                                 RICHARD
                        Warren?

           He's unsure. Richard steals a look at the vibrant man on the
           dust jacket, compares him to the shadow standing before him.

                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        Warren!

           He jumps to his feet and offers his hand. His grip cripples.

                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        It’s great to finally meet you.

                               (
                                cringing
                                 WARREN
                                        )
                        For sure.

                                 RICHARD
                        I'm sure you get this all the time,
                        but can I tell you I’m a fan? I read
                        it cover to cover.

                                 WARREN
                        Thanks. It paid for this house.

                                 RICHARD
                        I heard they were turning it into one
                        of those reality shows?

                                 WARREN
                        No.

                                 RICHARD
                        Oh?

                                 WARREN
                        I mean we tried.

           Marie shoots him a "drop it" look.

                                 RICHARD
                        The book is always better anyway. I
                        can't wait to read the second one.

                                 WARREN
                        Don't bother, it's a pile of shit.

                                 RICHARD
                        Whoa.
                                 MARIE
                        It's not a pile of shit.

                                 WARREN
                        They wanted me to be the Junkie Tony
                        Robbins. Turns out I'm not.

                                 RICHARD
                        But it's so inspiring to me, going
                        through all that you went through
                        with Ally. To walk through that pain
                        as a sober man. If you can do that,
                        you can do anything, and that gives
                        me hope. For Christy.

                                 WARREN
                        Yeah.

                                 RICHARD
                        Here, let me take your things--

           Warren rips the briefcase away with a little too much force.

                                 WARREN
                        --That’s okay. We should really get
                        down to it if she’s coming tonight. I
                        understand it’s an emergency, but
                        these things shouldn’t be rushed. Why
                        don't we sit?

                                 RICHARD
                        Of course, make yourself at home.

                                 WARREN
                        It looks good in here. All this
                        furniture, everything's different.

                                 RICHARD
                        A little sprucing up, you know?

                                 WARREN
                        What's that?

           Warren motions to the GIANT SWIM TROPHY on the mantel. A
           little golden diver on top.

                                 MARIE
                        That's from States. They had the
                        party here.

                                 WARREN
                        She won states?!
                                 RICHARD
                        She was amazing. She really was. She
                        broke the 100 breast record. By two
                        seconds. Everyone was going nuts, you
                        really should have--

                                 WARREN
                        --So, is it just us? I usually like
                        to have at least three on a team. 

                                 MARIE
                        Tucker's coming.

                                 WARREN
                        Is he sober?

                                 RICHARD
                        He's good for her, Warren, don't worry.
                        We had the talk. Man to man. 

                                 WARREN
                        Mm.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wind plays a violent game of tether ball with THE TIRE SWING. 

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A fire rages in the hearth. Branches scratch panes. Warren
           holds court. The sleek chair he sits in is annoying and he
           struggles to get comfy. Marie and Richard grip legal pads.
           They're working their way through the Box O' Joe.

                                 WARREN
                        Okay. Last but not least. Let’s talk
                        about leverage.

           His phone buzzes. Makes him jump. That UNKNOWN CALLER. He
           looks distressed, and Marie clocks this.

           He silences the phone, and sets it face down on the table.

                                 RICHARD
                        Positive or consequential?

                                 WARREN
                        Huh?

                                 RICHARD
                        In the book, you talk about--
                                 WARREN
                        --Right. Right. I think in Christy's
                        case it should be consequential. So,
                        what are we taking away if she
                        refuses the gift of treatment?

           They think.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Remember, leverage isn’t a threat,
                        it’s a refusal to continue enabling.
                        When she's willing, we'll move
                        mountains. Go ahead, Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ll kick her out of the house. No
                        more living rent free.

           Thunder. Warren glances out the window at the swaying tire
           swing. The wind sounds like screaming.

                                 MARIE
                        Warren?

                                 WARREN
                        Huh?

                                 MARIE
                        You okay?

                                 WARREN
                        Fine.

                                 RICHARD
                        You mean... F.I.N.E? “Flustered,
                        Insecure, Neurotic and Emotional?”

                                 WARREN
                        No, just regular fine.

           There's a MOAN behind the walls.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        What was that?

                                 MARIE
                        The pipes.

                                 RICHARD
                        It's a faulty ballcock. Or something,
                        I dunno, I tried to do it myself, but
                        it's above my paygrade. We gotta get
                        a plumber in here.
           The pipes rattle and shake and cry like the house is alive
           and dying a slow and agonizing death.

                                 MARIE
                        I hate saying this, but I don’t think
                        we can have her at the wedding
                        either. Not if she's using.

                                 WARREN
                        Wedding?

                                 RICHARD
                        I mean, yeah, we can’t have her
                        smuggling drugs into Bermuda.

                                 WARREN
                        Yeah... that's... uh, that's
                        definitely a good point.

                                 MARIE
                        Are you gonna read a letter, too?

           Warren glances at his briefcase. It glows in the moonlight.

                                 WARREN
                        No.

                                 RICHARD
                        Are you sure?

                                 WARREN
                        I really need to stay neutral here,
                        guys...

                                 MARIE
                        You're the expert.

           Warren is sweating now. He glances out the window, and
           double takes because --

           A LITTLE GIRL IN A BATHING SUIT IS STANDING ON THE DOCK.
           Just a charcoal outline backlit by the moon. Peering
           vacantly into the black mirror of the lake.

                                 WARREN
                        Who's that?

           Marie looks.

                                 MARIE
                        What?

           There's no one there. Warren rises. Shakes away the crazy.

                                 WARREN
                        Are there new neighbors?
                                 MARIE
                        Not for miles.

                               (
                                looking
                                 WARREN
                                       )
                        --I thought I saw... I saw...

                                 MARIE
                        Are you okay?

                                 WARREN
                        I’m sorry, excuse me a second. I need
                        the bathroom quick.

                                 RICHARD
                        Down the hall to right.

                                 WARREN
                        I know.

           Pale and reeling, he rounds the corner. Marie eyes him
           suspiciously. Once he's out of earshot, they whisper.

                                 MARIE
                        This was a mistake.

                                 RICHARD
                        Stop.

                                 MARIE
                        It'll be triggering.

                                 RICHARD
                        Honey, the triggers are pulled.

                                 MARIE
                        She's gonna feel ambushed.

                                 RICHARD
                        This resentment's gonna kill her.
                        Warren says resentment is like
                        drinking poison and waiting for the
                        other guy to die.

                                 MARIE
                        Warren says a lot of things. 

                                 RICHARD
                        They need to make amends, or have it
                        out or kill each other. Something.
                        Because this isn't working.

           Marie goes to the window. Looks out. Nothing there.

                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        Did he know about the wedding?
                                 MARIE
                        I sent him an invitation.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Warren limps past the stairs, towards the bathroom. The
           cupboard under the staircase CREAKS opens as he passes.

           He peeks inside the dark green door. Nothing but cobwebs.
           Warren shivers, and slaps the cupboard shut.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Warren is practicing his breathing techniques, in through
           the nose, one-two-three, out through the mouth. He stares at
           himself in the mirror, trying like hell to keep it together. 

                                 WARREN
                        Whatthefuck.

           A BELCH OF THUNDER. The lights flicker. He turns on the
           faucet. GRINDING as the sink pukes up rusty water in chaotic
           bursts. He looks out the window at THE DOCK. The memorial
           stone. The wind. Warren checks the time on his Rolex.

           This triggers another MEMORY FLASH:

           We're in the very same bathroom. Warren is many years
           younger. He removes his Rolex and places it on the sink.

           This is where he hides his track marks. A perfect line on
           his wrist. Like bed bug bites.

           He gets to work cooking up his heroin. Needle stabs the
           pulsing flesh of his wrist. He hits the plunger. His head
           bobs as the warm euphoria blossoms in his gut and flutters
           throughout his body, releasing him from the crippling
           stranglehold of giving a fuck. 

           He licks the blood off his arm. Slumps on the toilet.
           Nodding out, falling forward like a wilting poppy.

                                 YOUNG CHRISTY (O.S.)
                        DADDDDY!

           Young Christy is POUNDING on the locked door. Pounding so
           hard it bends. She's weeping, pleading--

                                 YOUNG CHRISTY
                        Wake up Daddy! Wake up Daddy! Open
                        the door! DADDDDDDY!!!!!

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:
           The DISTANT RUMBLINGS of an engine snap Warren out of his
           memory. Still sober. He looks out the window. Headlights
           moving up the driveway. POUNDING ON THE DOOR.

                                 MARIE (O.S.)
                        They're here!

           The sink OVERFLOWS. Water spills on to the floor.

                                 WARREN
                        Fuck.

           He turns off the faucet.

                                 MARIE (O.S.)
                        WARREN! GET OUT HERE!

                                 WARREN
                        Coming! Coming now!

           Warren flushes the toilet for good measure.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Warren enters, firing on all cylinders.

                                 WARREN
                        Okay! Quick, switch seats. I want you
                        sitting across from Christy so you can
                        make eye contact, she needs to see
                        your eyes and your tears if they come,
                        which they will. Richard, I want you
                        here in case she decides to bolt,
                        she’ll have to cross your path to get
                        to the door. Don't let her leave, no
                        matter what. Remember, tonight is
                        about love. We did the work, just
                        relax and trust the process. We’re
                        here because we love Christy more than
                        she loves herself right now. Let’s
                        show her how much.

           They take their places. Legs bounce. Nerves wrack.

           The door flies opens and Christy enters. Hair dyed black. A
           sad shell of the vibrant young athlete from Facebook. Tucker
           follows her in. He looks solemn, and nervous. Marie and
           Richard rise. Christy stops in her tracks.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Mom? What are you-- Richard? I
                        thought you were going to Kansas?
                                 RICHARD
                        I canceled my trip, sweetheart. I'm
                        here. We're here for you.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Here for... what?

           And it dawns on her. She turns to Tucker. Her eyes get big.

                     CHRISTY
                                                     TUCKER
           No. No, no, no.
                                            I'm sorry, baby...

           She starts for the door. Warren steps out and shuts it.

                                 WARREN
                        Hi, pie.

           His presence knocks the wind out of her.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Come sit.

                                 CHRISTY
                        What are you-- What is he doing here?

                                 WARREN
                        We’re here because we love you very
                        much...

                                 CHRISTY
                        No. This isn't happening.

                     WARREN
                                                     CHRISTY
                                            No. This is... this not
                                            okay. This is not okay.
           And we have some important
           stuff we want to talk to you
           about.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                               (
                                to Marie
                                        )
                        Did you do this?! Did you invite him?

                                 MARIE
                        Of course I invited him.

                                 WARREN
                        Come have a seat.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Fuck you!

           Warren takes her arm, but she pulls away. Runs to the door.
           Richard blocks her exit. She turns and chews into Tucker.
                     CHRISTY
                                                     TUCKER
           I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FUCKING
           LIED TO ME! FUCKING ROMANTIC
           WEEKEND?! FUCK YOU, LIAR!
                                            Please don't be mad at me,
                                            everyone's just so worried
                                            about you that's all!

                                 MARIE
                        Sit down!

                                 CHRISTY
                        I'm sober! I'm fine!

                                 MARIE
                        How stupid do you think I am?

                                 CHRISTY
                        You're all ganging up on me!

           She tries to run out the back, but Richard grabs her.

                                 RICHARD
                        We're trying to help you.

                     CHRISTY
                                                     WARREN
           I don't need your help! I'm
           fine! I'm fine! I'm clean!
                                            Okay, let's all take a
                                            breath and--

                                 TUCKER
                        --Give me your watch.

                                 CHRISTY
                        ...What?

                                 TUCKER
                        Your watch, babe. Take it off.

           She instinctively clutches her Poolmate watch.

                                 TUCKER (cont'd)
                        I know. I know that's where you're
                        hiding your track marks.

           She's gripping her wrist. She won't let go.

           Warren and Marie share a look.

           She looks at Tucker. Seething. He mouths: "I'm sorry."

                                 WARREN
                        Come have a seat.

           She levels him with a look.

                                 CHRISTY
                        So... You finally got some time off
                        from saving every other Junkie on the
                        planet but me?
                                 WARREN
                        I'm here, Christy. 

                                 CHRISTY
                        Now you're here. Because they didn't
                        pick up your fucking pilot. That
                        Intervention rip-off show.

                                 MARIE
                        Christy, come here.

                                 WARREN
                        I've tried to make amends. Many
                        times. You've made it pretty clear
                        you aren't interested.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Not clear enough apparently.
                        Fucking hypocrite.

                                 RICHARD
                        I hate that, I hate it when you talk
                        about him like that. He's your father.

                                 CHRISTY
                        He's not my father.

                                 WARREN
                        That's right. Not tonight. I'm your
                        interventionist. Now join the circle. 

           Christy looks at Warren, and then at the empty chair.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I hope he's giving you the family
                        discount.

                                 RICHARD
                        Let's just hear what mom has to say
                        now, and then you can say what you
                        have to say at the end.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Go ahead then. Go ahead.

           She sits in the hot seat. Arms crossed. They're all sitting
           now. She takes a smoke out of her purse and lights up.

                                 MARIE
                        Christy!

                                 WARREN
                        It's okay, let her smoke.
                                 RICHARD
                        This is good. This is a good thing.

           Lights flicker. Wind howls. Christy takes a drag. 

                                 WARREN
                        Marie. Go first, go.

                               (
                                reading
                                 MARIE
                                       )
                        Christy. You’ve always been... You've
                        always been my light...

           Christy scoffs. Tucker stares at Warren. Like he knows
           something. It's making Warren nervous.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        When you were a little girl, your
                        sister asked you where babies come
                        from. And you told her that if God
                        smiled down on a mommy and daddy,
                        they got a baby--

           Christy shakes her head.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        --Well, God smiled the day you were
                        born. So big and bright. You were God’s
                        little grin. I know what you can be, and
                        it's not this. It's not you... it's the
                        drugs.

           Warren looks out the window and sees --

           The Little Girl. STANDING ON TOP OF THE LAKE. Immune to
           water and its liquid properties.

           A flash of lightning illuminates her.

           IT'S ALLY. A soggy shell of a child. Waterlogged and
           decaying. She has no eyes, just hallowed out sockets. Her
           rotten red bathing suit is now a part of her skin. She wears
           a seaweed crown in her tangled hair. Her face a gruesome
           mask of veiny blue flesh.

                                 WARREN
                        What the fuck.

           Marie lowers the letter.

                                 MARIE
                        What?

           They all follow his gaze out the window.
                                 RICHARD
                        Warren? What's wrong?

                                 WARREN
                        What?

           All eyes on him. Some suspicious. He looks back, and--

           She is gone.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I just... I thought I...

           He blinks a hundred times. Keep it together.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Nothing. Nothing. I was wrong.

                               (
                                pointed
                                 TUCKER
                                       )
                        You okay?

                                 WARREN
                        I thought I saw something. Nothing.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Wow.

           Christy ashes in a vase.

                                 RICHARD
                        Let's stay focused.

                                 WARREN
                        Very good.

                                 CHRISTY
                        You're all fucked.

           He goes to the window to lower the blinds. Trembling.

                                 WARREN
                        Privacy. Go ahead, Marie. I'm sorry
                        for interrupting. Go. Go.

                               (
                                spooked
                                 MARIE
                                       )
                        When your sister died, you were my rock.

                                 CHRISTY
                        No.

           She's ripping out her hair, one strand at a time. She glares
           at Warren. The hate is real. He's squirming in his seat.
           Sweating. He doesn't know what to do with his hands.
                                 MARIE
                        You were only six-years-old, but you
                        were so wise and full of love. I thought
                        I'd never get through it. There was so
                        much guilt. I blamed myself for being in
                        New York when it happened. Your father
                        blamed himself for being overworked. For
                        taking a nap when the dock gave out--

           Marie breaks down. Richard takes her hand and rubs her back.

                                 RICHARD
                        It's okay, baby, you're doing great.

           Tucker tries to do the same to Christy, but she rips her
           hand away in disgust.

                                 MARIE
                        --And you blamed yourself for being
                        afraid. For hiding. You were a kid,
                        you were only six years old. And I
                        know you've been carrying that guilt
                        with you ever since. You never
                        allowed yourself to grieve. There was
                        too much pain and guilt.

           Christy puts her smoke out. Stares at her shoes. Trying to
           process. Overloading. Muttering to herself.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        I'm here today to tell you once and
                        for all that it wasn't your fault,
                        and asking you to grieve with us. I'm
                        asking you to forgive yourself--

           --She jumps to her feet and tries to bolt, but Warren grabs
           her before she can reach the door.

                                 CHRISTY
                        GET THE FUCK OFF ME! NO!

           She breaks down in tears and falls into a heap. He tries to
           calm her down, but she's inconsolable.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        GET OFF ME! LET ME GO! OH GODDDD!

                                 WARREN
                        Finish it, Marie! Finish it!

           They stand over Christy, finishing the letter as Warren
           holds her down. The lights flicker. The wind howls. Marie
           reads the letter like it's some kind of incantation.
           Christy is weeping through it, sucking in little breaths.
           Rocking like it stings. Covering her ears.

                                 MARIE
                        Because you're killing yourself, and
                        you're killing me, and I can't go
                        through this again! I love you so
                        much! I can’t lose another daughter!
                        I won't! Accept our gift of
                        treatment! Do it for Ally! She's
                        looking down on you from heaven--

                                 CHRISTY
                        Ohhhh god... god... stop!

           Warren holds her close, it's the first time he's touched her
           in so many horrible years.

                                 MARIE
                        --Make her proud, because she looked
                        up to her big sister and now you live
                        for two! And I know that if she was
                        here today, she would tell you how
                        much she loves, and she would tell
                        you she forgives you and she would
                        tell you--

                                 CHRISTY
                        IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME!!!

           WHAMMMM!!! The front door is THROWN OPEN by a blast of wind.

           They all jump. Leaves blow inside.

           Christy breaks free and BOLTS OUT THE DOOR.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wind howls as Christy sprints towards the rusty Honda. The
           team gives chase. She jumps inside and slaps the locks
           closed a millisecond before Warren reaches for the handle.

           They lock eyes. And then Christy snaps into action.

           She grabs a ratty Ray Ban case from its hiding place under
           the seat. Snaps it open: Needle, spoon, lighter, dope.

                                 WARREN
                        CHRISTY!

           They're all surrounding the car. She uses the cell phone
           charger as a makeshift tourniquet, wrapping it snug around
           her arm. They're knocking, pounding, shaking the car.
                                 MARIE
                        Open the door!

           Christy finds a fat vein and stabs the needle in.

           She pushes the plunger. Her eyes roll back in her head. Her
           arm lifts slowly, like she's trying to touch God. And then
           it drops suddenly. She's foaming at the mouth. 

           Her face SLAPS against the window. Her nose smudges.

           Warren is punching the window -- WHAMM! WHAMM! -- Trying to
           break it -- WHAMM! WHAMM! WHAMM! His knuckles break instead.
           Blood smears.

           Christy's little wheezy breaths FOG THE GLASS.

           And then her breath stops altogether.

           Her jaw stiffens.

           She makes a croaky death rattle.

           Her eyes pin.

           And she dies.

                                 WARREN
                        No!

           A flash of lightning illuminates --

           Ally sitting in the passenger's seat. Rotten jaw dangling.

                                 MARIE
                        DO SOMETHING!

           Ally cradles Christy's dead body, runs her dead black
           fingers through her hair. Caressing her sister...

           The veins instantly collapse in Christy's arms, blue to
           black, like cracks on thin ice.

           SMASHHHH!!!!

           Warren throws A ROCK through the back window. Glass flies.

           Richard and Tucker pull her out of the car, and carry her
           into the house. Marie follows.

           Ally is gone.

           Warren sees Christy's STASH OF DRUGS on the seat.

           He pockets them.
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Chaos. They lay her on the ground. Face blue. Lips purple.

                                 MARIE
                        Warren?!

                                 WARREN
                        Got it, got it!

           Warren fumbles with his briefcase lock. Sweat blinds him.

                                 MARIE
                        WARREN!!!!!

           Warren gets the combination wrong. He tries again, hands
           trembling. Richard is giving Christy CPR and a hard sternal
           rub. She's unresponsive.

                                 WARREN
                        Coming now!

                                 RICHARD
                        There's no pulse!

                                 MARIE
                        WARREN?! NOW! NOW!

                                 WARREN
                        I CAN'T GET THE FUCKING--

           SNAP!!! Warren finally pops opens the briefcase, his Dear
           Christy letter scatters like leaves.

           He rips the syringe of Narcan Nasal Spray from plastic.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Move.

           Warren cradles Christy, sticks the Opiate Blocker into her
           nose. He hits the plunger, and the antidote works instantly.

           Her eyes crack open.

           She sucks in a massive breath of life. Her pupils swell.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Come back, baby. Stay awake.

           Warren rocks her. She throws up on him. He holds her hair. She
           looks around the world like a newborn baby.

                                 MARIE
                        Is she okay...?!
                               (
                                whispering
                                 WARREN
                                          )
                        It's okay, you had an overdose.
                        You're okay. We're gonna beat this.

           Christy just stares at him.

           Like she's looking right through him.

                                 MARIE
                               (
                                on the phone
                                            )
                        I need an ambulance to 135 Lake Shore
                        Drive. My daughter's overdosed.

                                 WARREN
                        Just lay back.

                                 CHRISTY
                        ...Daddy?

                                 WARREN
                        It's okay.

           Warren grabs a pillow and props her head. Touches her face.
           She snatches his arm. Too tight. Eyes like dinner plates.
           They're yellowing from jaundice.

                                whispers
                                 CHRISTY
                                        )
                               (
                        ...wakeup...

           He reels back. 

                                 WARREN
                        ...what?

                                 CHRISTY
                        Wake up, daddy.

           She pounds on the floor like it's a door.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        Wake up, daddy. Wake up, daddy! WAKE
                        UP, DADDY! WAKE UP!!!!

           CRASHHHH!!!!

           THE WIND SENDS THE TIRE SWING FLYING THROUGH THE WINDOW!

           Glass sprays. Warren ducks as the tire soars over his head
           and bounces around the room.

           Christy rises. Slowly. Like a sleepwalker.

           The tire swing rolls down the hall, hits the wall, and
           topples. And when they look back at Christy--
           She's staring out the broken window.

                                 RICHARD
                        You can't be moving around right now.
                        You have to stay down. 

           She is staring at THE DOCK.

                                 MARIE
                        Honey?

           She says nothing.

           Her hair whips in the howling wind.

           KABLOOOOM!!!!

           Lightning explodes outside the bay window.

           GZZZT! The lights go out and stay out. PITCH BLACK.

           They scramble to ignite their iPhone lights.

           But Christy is gone.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Where’d she-- Where'd she--

                                 RICHARD
                        Christy?

                                                            CUT TO:

           The team searches the house. They split up.

           Tucker checks UPSTAIRS.

           Marie checks the KITCHEN.

           Richard checks the BEDROOM.

           Nothing.

           Warren gathers up his Dear Christy letter from the floor.

                     ...they say if you always tell the truth...

           And then he hears the soft sobbing...

           It's coming from THE CUPBOARD under the stairs.

           Warren moves towards the dark green door.

           The cries are getting louder. 

                                 WARREN
                        Christy?
           He pulls it open, like he's ripping off a band-aide. 

           Inside, a flashlight shines on some naked Barbies sitting in
           a circle. Warren slams the door shut. Fuck that. 

           He drags the massive chest of drawers in front of the
           cupboard. And then he folds his Dear Christy letter and puts
           it back in his briefcase. LOCKS IT.

           Something catches his eye out the window.

           Christy is standing on the edge of the dock.

           EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

           Christy dips her toe in the water. Her reflection ripples.
           Like in his dream. Warren approaches. She just stares at the
           water, as if under a spell.

                                 WARREN
                        It's gonna be okay. Honey. I'm here.

                                 CHRISTY
                               (
                                distant
                                       )
                        So am I.

           She turns.

           Looks at Warren. 

           With sallow pinprick eyes.

           Like they're not her eyes at all.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        I've been here ever since.

           Lightning dances across the sky.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        And I'm never leaving.

           Warren takes a few careful steps towards her. She backs to
           the very edge. The balls of her feet hanging over.

           And then her eyes roll into her head and she faints
           backwards into the water.

           SPLASH!!!!!

           Warren doesn't think twice.

           He dives in after her.
           UNDERWATER

           Warren swims to Christy. She's floating there unconscious.

           He wraps her in his arms, and she comes-to in a blind panic,
           screaming air bubbles. Her survival instinct kicks in and
           she latches on to Warren because he's there and he floats,
           and she's using his body to push herself up, and taking him
           down with her.

           He's trying to subdue her, but it's impossible, they are
           sinking to the bottom, a tangle of flailing limbs.

           But they're not alone.

           A figure floating towards them in the cloudy gray water.

           ALLY COMES INTO FOCUS.

           Arms outstretched for a hug. Bound by seaweed shackles,
           wrapped around her legs and arms and neck. The fish that
           lives in her skull swims out of her gaping eye socket.

           Air bubbles explode as Warren screams underwater.

           Christy gets water in her lungs, and the fight stops. With
           the last of his strength, Warren pulls her to the SURFACE
           where he sucks in a breath, and tows her to the dock.

           Tucker, Richard, and Marie run down the path.

                                 WARREN
                        Take her hands!

           Richard and Tucker pull her on to the platform.

           Warren jumps out, and gives Christy CPR, and it works. She
           spits up water and starts hacking and coughing. She looks
           around, frantic. Slowly coming back to reality...

                                 CHRISTY
                        ...what... what happened?

                                 WARREN
                        You had an overdose.

                               (
                                dazed
                                 CHRISTY
                                 )
                        Where did I go?

                                 WARREN
                        Nowhere. I'm here, I have you.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Something's wrong with me. Why am
                        I... why am I out here?!
                                 WARREN
                        You blacked out.

                                 CHRISTY
                               (
                                          )
                                breathless
                        I was having nightmares!

                                 WARREN
                        You had an overdose.

                                 CHRISTY
                        There's a house! I saw it! There's a
                        house at the bottom of the lake!

                                 WARREN
                        It was just a dream.

           She returns to planet earth. Looks at the man who just saved
           her life, and it hits her--

                                 CHRISTY
                        Dad?

                                 WARREN
                        I have you. You're safe.

           She starts to crawl away from him.

                                 CHRISTY
                        No! Get away from me! What are you
                        doing you? Mom? Why is he here?!

                                 MARIE
                        Christy. This is your intervention.

           It all comes back to her at once. She faints.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The lights are still out and candles are everywhere.

           Christy lies in bed. Sleeps. Richard paces nervously. Warren
           sits soaking wet. He's in another world, watching Christy
           sleep. Her chest rising and falling. 

           Marie enters. 

                                 MARIE
                        What happened?

           Warren is locked on Christy. Staring at her black veins.  

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Warren.
           Nothing.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        WARREN?!

           He jumps out of his skin.

                                 WARREN
                        Huh?! Sorry--

                                 MARIE
                        --What did she say to you?

                                 WARREN
                        It's fine. She's fine. She's gonna be
                        fine...

                                 RICHARD
                        What are you, a medium?

                                 WARREN
                        I don't got a fuckin' crystal ball if
                        that's what you mean.

                                 RICHARD
                        I mean size. What size are you? You
                        want some dry clothes?

           Warren looks at Richard's muscle cut outfit. Frowns.

                                 WARREN
                        What are we doing here, Marie?

                                 MARIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 WARREN
                        We could have done it at your place.
                        Why did you bring me here.

                                 RICHARD
                        "Deal with the past before it deals
                        with you."

                                 WARREN
                        What does that mean?
                               (
                                to Marie
                                        )
                        Was this his idea?

                                 RICHARD
                        No. It was yours. Therapeutic
                        exposure. Hold the intervention at
                        the sight of the trauma, face it head
                        on. As a family. It's from your book.
                                 WARREN
                        I know what it's from, Richard. I
                        wrote it. I wrote the book.

                                 RICHARD
                        I was just following your--

                                 WARREN
                        --You should have told me that, you
                        can't not tell me that.

                                 MARIE
                        Nothing's working. Nothing. She
                        carries it with her. You know she
                        blames herself. She never talks about
                        it, she just pushes it down until it
                        takes her out... again and again. 

           Warren stares off into space.

                                 WARREN
                        This house does something to me.
                        Being back here. I don't know...

           The pipes SCREAM AND LAUGH behind the walls. He shudders.

           Tucker levels Warren with a hateful look. He catches it.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        You okay?

                                 TUCKER
                        What?

                                 WARREN
                        I dunno. You've been mad dogging me
                        all night. Is something wrong?

                                 TUCKER
                        I don't know. Is there?

                                 MARIE
                        Warren.

                               (
                                 WARREN
                                reels it in
                                           )
                        I'm sorry, look -- It's okay. She's
                        gonna be okay. I've seen this before,
                        the blackouts, confusion. It's a side
                        effect of the Narcan. It's a shock to
                        the system. She'll be okay.

           Tucker is satisfied. Richard is trying to catch a read.

           Warren's stomach somersaults.
                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I'll be right back.

           He speed walks out of the room. Richard's eyes narrow.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Warren runs past the photograph of Ally and Christy. Stops.
           It's hanging upside down. Weird, but he's in a hurry.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Warren falls to his knees and vomits into the toilet. He
           wipes the spittle and catches his breath. Flushes. He climbs
           to his feet, grips on the the sink like the world is
           spinning. 

           He washes his hands and face like he's trying to wash away
           the guilt. The pipes moan as SEAWEED AND SEDIMENT spit out
           of the faucet into the basin.

           Warren jumps back, confused because IT'S LAKE WATER.

                                 ALLY'S VOICE
                        Daddddddy.

           He freezes. Kills the faucet.

                                 WARREN
                        Hello?

           ALLY'S VOICE rattles with the pipes, an underwater garble,
           traveling behind the walls like it's riding on water.

                                 ALLY'S VOICE
                        Why didn't you teach me to swim
                        like you promised?

                               (
                                 WARREN
                                covers his ears
                                               )
                        Stop.

           Destroyed, he perches on the edge of the tub. Buries his
           head in his hands. Waging an internal war. And losing.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Fuckit.

           He takes Christy's drug baggie out of his pocket.

           Crinkles it between his fingers.

           Makes a fist and dumps a toot of heroin on his thumb.
           China white flakes catch the moonlight and sparkle.

           It looks like a warm hug feels.

           He's trying to talk himself out of it.

                                 ALLY'S VOICE
                        Do it.

           He looks up.

           Her voice is coming from the TOILET BOWL.

           Horrified, Warren peers inside.

           Reverberating from somewhere down deep:

                                 ALLY'S VOICE (cont'd)
                        Make it all go away.

           He slaps the heroin off his fist.

           Dumps the baggie in the toilet.

                                 ALLY'S VOICE (cont'd)
                        Do it you miserable Junkie fuck.

           He shuts the the lid shut with his foot, muffling Ally. He
           flushes. Her voice drowns away.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Warren emerges, white as paper. Richard is standing there
           and it jump scares him.

                                 RICHARD
                        Who were you talking to?

           Warren brushes past him. Richard folds his arms.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Warren returns. Shaky at best. Richard follows. Christy's
           awake now. As he crosses the threshold --

           WOOSH! A phantom breeze blows all the candles out at once.

           The room is now lit by the dull moon, but he can still see
           her staring at him, blankly.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I want to go to rehab.

           A collective sigh of relief from the team.
           Warren's eyes fill with hope.

           These words have snapped him back into presence.

           GZZZZT!!

           The lights turn back on. Power is restored and Christy looks
           worse for wear. She scratches her track marks.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I'll do anything.

                                 MARIE
                        It's the best one in the state.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I can't do this anymore.

                                 MARIE
                        You have to really want it, not like
                        last time.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I wasn't ready last time. I think can
                        do it. I can do it now.

           Warren wants to be a part of this, but he can't bring
           himself to over there.

                                 TUCKER
                        I know you can do it.

                                 CHRISTY
                               (
                                crying
                                      )
                        I'm so fucked up. I'm so sorry.

                                 MARIE
                        You're not fucked up, you're doing
                        the right thing.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I've been so shit to you all.

                                 RICHARD
                        We're gonna get you help.

                                 TUCKER
                        You're the most amazing girl. And
                        you're only gonna get, like, more
                        amazing. You know?

                                 CHRISTY
                               (
                                distant
                                       )
                        I'm gonna really do it this time.

           Mother and daughter hug. Richard and Tucker join.
           Warren stands across the room. Finally --

                                 WARREN
                        Silverdale. It's beautiful. There's a
                        four month wait list for a bed, but I
                        got them to-- I pulled some...

           They ignore Warren. They're too caught up in the moment.
           They're just a hugging mess of arms and tears. 

           Warren watches. Separate. Wanting desperately to be a part
           of it. But he's the interventionist tonight, not the father.
           He wipes the pesky tear.

           Christy peeks over the hug to look at him.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I want my interventionist to take me.

           Warren looks back. She smiles.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        We have a lot to talk about.

           This fills Warren with hope.

           REEEEEEEYOOOOOP!!!!

           The siren outside makes them all jump.

           Blues and reds flashing through the window play on Christy's
           face, making her look demonic. For lack of a better word.

           TIME CUT

           Christy sits on the edge of the bed. She's shivering. Tucker
           rubs her back. PARAMEDICS are checking her vitals, and
           rattling off questions.

                        ...miserable Junkie fuck.

           Warren's ears perk. He's the only one who heard it.

                        Speak up, honey.

           Christy looks at the Paramedic. Snaps herself out of it.

                                 PARAMEDIC #1 (cont'd)
                        What's your name?

                                 CHRISTY
                        Christy.

                        Pretty name. Mine's Barry.

           The Paramedic rips off her blood pressure cuff. Warren
           exhales the breath he's been holding in.

           Richard is scanning through Warren's book.

                                     CHAPTER TEN
                       "HOW TO IDENTIFY A LOVED ONE'S RELAPSE

           A call on the radio.

                                 WALKIE VOICE
                        We got another overdose down on Doyle

                        Yer gonna have to sign off.

           He hands Warren the papers for his signature.

           Something catches his eye --

           The tire. Rolling down the hallway.

           The frayed rope snaking behind it.

           It stops dead center.

           Like it's staring at him.

           And topples.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The ambulance is driving away.

           Hugs on the stoop. Warren is still a little wet. He helps
           Christy inside. Marie approaches.

                                 WARREN
                        There's a hospital in Derry. I'll get
                        her stabilized, and then I'll check
                        her into Detox.

                                 MARIE
                        When can we come and see her?

                                 WARREN
                        Not for a couple weeks at least. But
                        they let me hang out, and check in on
                        clients. I'll get a hotel up there,
                        and keep an eye on her.

                                 MARIE
                        You're good at this.

           They hug. Richard watches.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Thank you for everything.

                                 WARREN
                        We'll do this together.

                                 MARIE
                        Will you say what you say? To the
                        parents? Say it to me...
                                 WARREN
                        It's a family disease. One person may
                        use but the whole family suffers.
                        Opposite's true, too. I see families
                        recover. Rebuild. Stronger than ever,
                        closer than they ever thought they
                        could be. You'll know a new freedom
                        at the end of this, I promise.

                                 MARIE
                        I want that.

                                 WARREN
                        I believe it with all my heart.
                        That's why I do it.
                                smiles
                               (
                                      )
                        But, one thing at a time. I'll call
                        you from the hospital.

                                 MARIE
                        You have a captive audience.
                        Try and make the most of it.

                                 WARREN
                        I will.

           This is his chance, and he knows it.

           Marie hands Warren the keys.

           Richard takes Warren aside. Privately.

                                 RICHARD
                        Hey. Is everything okay with you?

           Warren looks at him.

                                 WARREN
                        Can I get back to you?

           INT. MARIE’S VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT - NIGHT

           Warren and Christy drive. Tension hangs like a thick fog.
           Warren turns on the radio. ALLMAN BROTHERS PLAYS.

                                 WARREN
                        Hey! "Whipping Post." Remember?
                        Saratoga? You must have been, what --
                        twelve? How cool is that, the Allman
                        Brothers is your first concert. Mine
                        was fucking Debby Boone. Thanks Nana.

           Christy slaps the radio off.

           Now she's staring at him. They drive in silence for a bit.
                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I know you're upset. I want to do
                        better. I really do.

           Nothing.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        The biggest regret of my life is not
                        being there when you needed me.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I'm shit.

                                 WARREN
                        What?

                                 CHRISTY
                        She was so good. She was creative.
                        She made toys, she put on plays. She
                        would have been an artist, and I've
                        done nothing but fuck up everything.

                                 WARREN
                        You broke the 100 breast record. By
                        two seconds. While high on fucking
                        heroin. Jesus, think of what you'll
                        do when your clean...

                                 CHRISTY
                        I'm a real piece of shit.

                                 WARREN
                        Listen to me. You're not bad trying
                        to get good. You're sick trying to
                        get well.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I hate this shit. It's fucking evil.
                        And I can't stop. I want to more than
                        anything. And I can't and I don't
                        know why...

                                 WARREN
                        You got the gene. You got it from me,
                        I got it from my old man. I don't
                        think I ever saw him draw a sober
                        breath. Your mother doesn't have it.
                        She can drink a glass of wine with
                        dinner and call it a night. You got
                        her good looks and my bad habits.
                        Hell, I knew you were one of us since
                        you were a little kid. You used to
                        sniff the gas pumps, remember, you
                        loved the smell.
                                 CHRISTY
                        I still do.

                                 WARREN
                        Me too. We drink and use because
                        we're drunks and addicts, that's all
                        the why there is sometimes.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I need help.

                                 WARREN
                        Saying those words is halfway there.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I miss you so much.

           He tires to touch her, but she pulls away.

                                 WARREN
                        I have to tell you something. I've
                        been trying to tell you for so long. 
                        The truth is... it's all a lie.

           Christy yelps in pain. She clutches her stomach. 

                                 CHRISTY
                        ...What?

                                 WARREN
                        This weight you've been carrying, all
                        this shame and guilt, it's not yours.

           Another sharp stab of pain. She's sweating bullets. Gritting
           her teeth in agony.

                                 CHRISTY
                               (
                                gasping
                                       )
                        Something's wrong.

                                 WARREN
                        You have to let it go, Christy. It
                        wasn't your fault.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Stop.

                                 WARREN
                        You're living a lie I made you tell.

           Her inside are on fire. Like a physical reaction to the
           truth. She looks at him. Trembling.

                                 CHRISTY
                                groans
                                      )
                               (
                        Dad... stop...
                                 WARREN
                        I relapsed that weekend--

           --Christy SCREAMS, and slaps her hands overs her ears and
           grits her teeth. Rattles it off like the Lord's Prayer:

                                 CHRISTY
                        You had a deadline, you were
                        overworked! You were taking a nap! I
                        was supposed to wake you up after the
                        Olympics! I promised I'd wake you up!

                     WARREN
           What are you-- No. That's
           not what happened, that's
           not what-- Listen to me!
                                                     CHRISTY
                                            --We weren't supposed to
                                            leave the house, but I
                                            wanted to go on the tire
                                            swing! And Ally wanted to
                                            swim, so I let you sleep!

                                 WARREN
                        You tried to wake me up. I wouldn't
                        wake up, you weren't hiding!

                               (
                                 CHRISTY

                                            )
                        I was in trouble. I ran under the
                        stairs. I hid in my secret hiding
                        place under the stairs! IT HURTS!!!
                        STOP!!!

                                                     CHRISTY
                                                (
                                                 covering her ears
                     WARREN
           That's what we told the
           police, but you weren't
           afraid. You were so brave. I
           couldn't wake up because I
           nodded out on the toilet,
           and you were scared, I made
           you lie for me, I made you
           cover it up, I was a coward,
           not you, you were--
                                                                  )
                                            And I hid for hours, and
                                            played with my Barbies while
                                            Ally was floating out there
                                            and you slept. And I
                                            pretended like it everything
                                            was okay, I pretended
                                            nothing happened. And she
                                            was out there and--

                        LIAR! LIAR! LIAR!

                                 WARREN
                        Stop it!
                                 CHRISTY
                        FUCK YOU!!! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR
                        FUCKING LIES!!!

                                 WARREN
                        It wasn't your fault!

                                 CHRISTY
                        IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME!

           Christy snaps and WHAMM!! WHAMM!! Starts pummeling him.
           Fists flying, and Warren ducks.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        I left her out there! I left her there
                        to rot and the birds ate her eyes!

           She throws her head back and screams from the pit for her
           gut, the scream bends and twists and fries her throat and
           singes her voice box and explodes out of her. The dead veins
           spreading down her arm, like an invading darkness. 

           And then... Calm. She takes a deep breath. Looks at Warren.

           But her eyes are wrong.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        You forgot to search me.

           Warren grips the wheel a little tighter. He finds himself
           speeding up, like he's trying to get away. The woods seem to
           be closing in on him.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        Wanna get high?

                                 WARREN
                        Huh?

           She wades through her purse. Pulls out some crusty charred
           tinfoil and a burnt glass pipe.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Put that away. Right now.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Wanna get high with me?

                                 WARREN
                        You can't do that--

           He reaches for the drugs, but she rips them away.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        You can't, we gave you Narcan!
                                 CHRISTY
                        I always wondered what it would be
                        like to get fucked up with you. You
                        were pretty crazy, huh? Like me.

           She pops the pipe between sore lips, sparks a lighter under
           the foil. Warren grabs the heroin and throws it out the
           window. Hate builds behind her twitchy eyes.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        You shouldn't have done that.

           Little red sores have begun to appear on her face.

                                 WARREN
                        The opiate blocker's still working.
                        If you do any more, you'll die.

           She smiles at him.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I know you're angry, and we can talk
                        about it, but you're--

                                 CHRISTY
                        She's not going to rehab.

                                 WARREN
                        What?

                                 CHRISTY
                        I'll never let her go.

           A flash of lightning and for a split second --

           Christy is gone and Ally is sitting in her seat.

           Almost like an X-Ray. If you blink you'll miss it.

           Thunder rumbles, and it's Christy again.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        There's a house at the bottom of the
                        lake for her.

           Warren shakes the crazy out of his eyes.

           THE RADIO explodes on by itself. The SHREDDING GUITAR SOLO
           from "Whipping Post" makes Warren jump out of his skin.

           And that's when --

           Christy leaps over the console and stomps on his foot.

           VROOOOOOMMMM!!!
           PEDAL TO THE METAL AND --

           The car launches forward, FLYING DOWN THE DIRT DRIVEWAY. The
           trees whip past in a green-black blur. Fishtails as they
           fight and she's strong.

                                 WARREN
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU--

           She stabs her arm into his neck, and jerks the wheel hard to
           the right. The car careens off the road, flying through the
           trees, down the embankment. The car hits a rocky outcrop,
           flies over the edge, and

           up is down

           and down is up and

           THEY PLUNGE INTO THE LAKE!

           Warren cracks the window with his head. Glass spiderwebs as
           his breath is ripped out of him, and the airbag punches him
           in the face.

           BLACK.

                                 YOUNG CHRISTY (O.S.)
                        Wake up, daddy! Wake up, daddy!

                                                            CUT TO:

           WARREN'S EYES CRACK OPEN!

           He's driving to the bottom of the lake. Headlights dulling
           against murky water. His nose is broken, blood spills from a
           gash in his forehead. He looks over at the passenger seat.

           Christy is gone.

           He's alone in the car and water is spilling in fast.

           It's up to his waist and rising.

           Whipping Post is playing, warped and warbled as the
           electrics fry. The dash puts on an eerie light show.

           Warren tries to open the window. It's no use. 

           The water is up to his chin now. He has to act fast.

           He rips off his headrest, and smashes the window with the
           metal rod. The glass breaks and WATER FLOODS IN.

           Warren swims out the window. Rockets towards the surface.
           EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

           Warren explodes out of the water and sucks in a breath. He's
           in THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE. Frantically treading. It's a long
           way to shore, and he's out of shape.

           He sees Christy walking out of the lake, up the embankment.
           He tries to call for her, but he gets a mouthful of water.

           He starts swimming, he can't think now, he just has to move.
           He swims and swims, and then a sharp pain stabs him and he
           cries out. A cramp. He treads water, groaning.

           And then he looks over and sees...

           ALLY.

           A hundred yards away.

           Standing on top of the water.

           Watching him.

           Like an osprey watches a fish.

           Horrified, he takes off swimming through the cramp.

           He hears the splashing behind him and cranes to see --

           ALLY RUNNING HIM DOWN!

           Running across the lake.

           Her SCREAMS are a horrible underwater garble.

           Warren swims like hell.

           Ally skips across the water like a stone, baring down.

           The shore is close. He sees it. He can make it. But she's
           closing in, and just as she's about to jump on him --

           Gravity takes hold and she falls through the water.

           And now she's under him.

           Somewhere under there.

           Adrenaline rockets through his body as he swims for shore.

           It's so close --

           WOOOSHHH!!!

           He's YANKED underwater by a tremendous force.

           He surfaces again, GASPING!
           Swims a little more, until he's

           YANKED UNDER AGAIN!

           For a moment, the lake is serene. Because Warren is in it.

           We take a moment to bask in nature's eerie night music.

           And then Warren shoots back up! Hacking and choking and
           crying and he swims, and swims, and finally makes it to --

           EXT. THE SHORE - NIGHT

           He collapses in a heap. Breathing like every breath is a
           gift. You don't know what you got till it's gone.

           And now he's crying with his face in the mud. Something
           stings. He starts itching his wrists. Sees something. His
           Rolex has stopped ticking. Dead.

           His wrist is burning. He scratches under there.

           And then he rips off his watch and there they are --

           FESTERING TRACK MARKS.

           In a perfect line on his wrist. Like bed bug bites.

                                 WARREN
                        No...

           Warren grabs his wrist, he can't believe what he's seeing.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        No. No, no.

           He scratches at them, trying to rub them off, but they're
           real and he's freaking out.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        What-the-fuck.

           He sits there a moment, trying to process. But he can't.
           Because it's insane. So he puts his watch back on to cover
           his tracks, climbs to his feet, and runs up the embankment.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Warren gallops down the driveway. It's hard because his
           clothes are sloshy, and every step stings.

           The lights of the lake house beckon in the distance.

           He finds her trail. Footsteps lead back to the house.
           He passes the tree where the the tire swing hung. Half the
           frayed rope swings in the wind. Like a broken noose.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Warren enters, SLAMS the door behind him. He collapses on
           the floor to catch his breath. He's been running and
           swimming and drowning.

                                 WARREN
                        Is she... is she here?

           Richard, Tucker, and Marie are just staring at him.

                                 MARIE
                        Warren.

                                 WARREN
                        Is she...

           The look in Marie's eyes is scarier than anything that just
           happened on that lake.

                                 MARIE
                        What happened?

                                 WARREN
                        What?

           Suddenly, Christy steps out from behind them.

           Soaking wet. She looks at Warren like she's afraid of him.

                                 MARIE
                        What did you do?

           Christy bursts into tears and hugs her mother.

                                 WARREN
                        There was an accident.

                                 CHRISTY
                        It wasn't an accident.

                                 WARREN
                        No. I guess it wasn't, was it?

                                 CHRISTY
                        He did it on purpose.

                                 WARREN
                        What?

                                 CHRISTY
                        He drove us into the lake.
                                 WARREN
                        What? No! That's not-- Christy, you
                        jerked the wheel!

                                 CHRISTY
                        He tried to kill me because I know.

                                 WARREN
                        Marie, this is insane.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I know his fucking secrets. I know
                        everything. He'd rather die than be
                        found out.

                                 MARIE
                        What secrets, what are talking about?

                                 CHRISTY
                        Everything about him is a lie.

                                 WARREN
                        I would never hurt her.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Check his wrist.

           Warren stops. Remembers. He starts to back towards the door. 

           They all take careful steps towards him. Like it's a hunt.

                                 RICHARD
                        What?

                                 CHRISTY
                        Show them your wrist.

                                 TUCKER
                        Please, Warren? Can we just see?

           Warren backs slowly towards the door. Tucker blocks his way.

                                 RICHARD
                        Warren. You have to just show us, I'm
                        sorry, but you're showing all the
                        signs. Irritability, confusion,
                        delusion. The Seven Deadly Signs of
                        Active Relapse--

           --Warren pivots down the hallway. Richard flanks. It's all
           very deliberate. Warren trips into the couch and stumbles.

           Christy is loving it. Warren's fear is music.
                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        Take off your watch and show me your
                        wrist right now.

                                 WARREN
                        No.

                                 RICHARD
                        What do you mean, no?

                                 WARREN
                        I mean fuck you, Richard. That's what
                        I mean. This is my house. You show me
                        your wrist. How about that?

                                 RICHARD
                        Sign four. Deflection.

                                 MARIE
                        What was I thinking? I must have been
                        insane to bring you here.

           Warren glances out the window at the driveway.

           He has the keys. He has an escape.

           Christy's Honda.

           THE PIPES MOAN. It almost sounds like a little girl crying.

           Christy's head lolls at the sound.

           Her eyes flutter.

           And she collapses on the floor in a heap.

           Everyone runs to her side.

           Warren runs out the back door and hurries across the lawn.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Warren!

           Richard gives chase.

           EXT. LAWN - NIGHT

           Warren runs towards the car. Richard tackles him, and they
           slide across the grass. He stabs a knee into Warren's back.
           Grabs his wrist, rips off his watch. Examines it.

           It's clean. No track marks. They've vanished, if they were
           every really there at all.

           Warren is even more surprised than Richard.
                                 RICHARD
                        I'll buy you a new watch.

           He drops the watch in the grass. Storms inside the house,
           past Marie.

                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        He's clean. I'll pull the Honda
                        around, we'll take her ourselves.

                                 MARIE
                        Stay with her, make sure she doesn't
                        run. I want to talk to him a second.

           Marie approaches, offers a hand. Warren refuses it.

           She sits criss cross in the grass beside him.

                                 WARREN
                        It's not her.

                                 MARIE
                        It's the drugs.

                                 WARREN
                        No. I mean it's not her. Something
                        happened when she died. She changed.
                        I brought her back, and something
                        came back with her.

                                 MARIE
                        You haven't seen her in years, of
                        course she's changed. She changed
                        when you walked out of her life.   

           Warren bows his head.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        This is it. This is what happens. She
                        says she wants to get sober and she
                        drives into the fucking lake. She drove
                        Richard's Audi into a 7/11 last
                        Christmas. That's not crazy, that's
                        Wednesday. It's been hell. Welcome to it.

                                 WARREN
                        I think I'm losing my mind.

                                 MARIE
                        Just tell me what's going on!

                                 WARREN
                        I'm seeing things. Ghosts.
                        Hallucinations. I don't know, it
                        started last night. I saw Pete.
                                 MARIE
                        Who?

                                 WARREN
                        My old sponsor. I saw him outside my
                        apartment.

                                 MARIE
                        What are you talking about? Pete's
                        not dead.

           Warren whips the prayer card out of his pocket. It's soggy.
           Marie's white as a ghost.

                                 WARREN
                        He couldn't get it, he went back out.
                        God. I've had such a resentment
                        towards him for so long.

           Marie looks at the card. Hand trembling. She lets it fall.
           She has tears in her eyes.

                                 MARIE
                        What did he do to you? Why do you
                        have a resentment?

                                 WARREN
                               (
                                hedges
                                      )
                        It wasn't any one thing really...

                                 MARIE
                        What aren't you telling me?

                                 WARREN
                        He just... wasn't there when I needed
                        him, you know? That's all. Hey,
                        what's wrong? Why are you crying?

                                 MARIE
                        I'm not. I'm just... I'm just...
                        surprised. He seemed like a nice guy.
                        I'm sad he couldn't get it.

           She looks away.

           SCREAMS from the living room. Richard knocks on the window.

                                 RICHARD
                        Guys! Something's wrong with her!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           They run inside, and Christy is moaning, clutching her
           stomach in pain. She grits her teeth. Her gums are bleeding.
           The sores on her face are weeping. She's barreling over.
                                 CHRISTY
                        Give it to me, fuck! Now!

           They help her to the couch. Her face spasms. The sores
           worsening. Spreading.

                                 WARREN
                        Withdrawals. 

           Possessed screams rattle the windows.

                                 MARIE
                        What's wrong with her face? Is that
                        from the crash?

                                 TUCKER
                        Do something!

                                 MARIE
                        Her eyes.

                                 RICHARD
                        Jaundice. I don't know.

                                 MARIE
                        We gotta get her to hospital.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I need it. I need a little bit.

                                 MARIE
                        Get up. We're leaving now.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I can't...

                                 WARREN
                        Just hold on, give her some space.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Give me my fucking shit. Now.

                                  WARREN
                        It won't work. You could do 30 bags
                        and you’re not gonna feel it.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Give me my shit. Tucker.

                     MARIE
                                                     CHRISTY
                                            Get the fuck off me!
           We're leaving now. You need
           a doctor. Get in the car.

           She pulls away. Vomits. Moans in pain, we can hear her
           stomach doing somersaults.
                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        Tucker. Fuck. Fuck.

                                 TUCKER
                        Can I?

                                 WARREN
                        Absolutely not.

           She screams. It makes him jump.

                                 TUCKER
                        Can we just give her a little bit...
                        to get her there? And then she can
                        detox. Look at her! I hate it when
                        she's like this!

                                 WARREN
                        She can't, her opiate levels are
                        still way too high, the Narcan won't
                        let her feel it--

           --Christy collapses on one side, clutching her stomach.

                                 MARIE
                        Get up, Christy. You're just gonna
                        have to white knuckle it, we'll get
                        you to detox and you'll be fine,
                        let's go now. Now!

           She's trying to pull Christy up but her insides are on fire.
           Rocking in a fetal position, like she's rotting from the
           inside out.

                                 CHRISTY
                        GIVE ME MY SHIT YOU LITTLE FUCKING
                        BITCHBOY! YOU FUCKING BITCH!

                                 TUCKER
                        Please don't be mad at me!

                                 CHRISTY
                        I'm getting right, fuck, I'm getting
                        right, I'll do whatever you want,
                        I'll go to rehab, I'll go to hell,
                        whatever you want just give me my
                        shit right the fuck now!

                                 MARIE
                        I hope you remember what it feels
                        like. I hope you never forget.

                                 CHRISTY
                        I know what you did, you disgusting
                        fucking whore.
           WHAPP!! Marie slaps Christy across the face as hard as she
           can. Thunder flickers lights.

                                 MARIE
                        Ohgod. I'm sorry I--

                                 CHRISTY
                        YOU LIAR! LIAR! LIAR!

           Wham! Wham! Christy is smashing her head against the floor
           now, as if to distract from the pain.

                                 MARIE
                        Stop it! Stop it!

           Thunder rumbles. Lights flicker. Pipes shriek.

           Warren grabs her. Holds her head, she's screaming tears.
           Liquid shit trickles down her leg and stains her sock.

                                 TUCKER
                        Screw this. I'm giving her some.

           He's digging through his pockets, and pulls out a bag.

                                 WARREN
                        Are you holding right now?

           Warren lets go of Christy and goes to Tucker.

                                 TUCKER
                        She was sick! I hold it for her
                        sometimes when she's sick, I didn't
                        know she had more in the car!

           Warren throws Tucker against the wall, pins him there and
           wades through his pockets. Tucker doesn't fight.

                                 TUCKER (cont'd)
                        It's safe this way. I'm in charge.

           Warren pulls out a few more balloons of heroin. Pockets the
           bags. Holds Tucker firm.

                                 MARIE
                        Have you been paying for her drugs?

                     TUCKER
                                                     MARIE
           No. I mean, sometimes when
           she can't. Once or twice but
           only when she's really bad--
                                            --I thought she was
                                            stealing. I didn't know how
                                            she could afford it.

                                 TUCKER
                        She's not getting high, she's just
                        using to stay regular.
                                 WARREN
                        Get the fuck out of here.

                                 TUCKER
                        I love her so much... I love your
                        daughter... I love her...

                                 WARREN
                        Now I know what she sees in you.

           Tucker cries. Warren lets him go.

                                 TUCKER
                        I just want everyone to be okay.

                                 MARIE
                        Christy?

           She's gone.

           They look around. The bathroom door SLAMS shut.

           We barely caught a glimpse of her going in.

                                 RICHARD
                        What is-- Is she shooting up?

                                 WARREN
                        I don't know.

                                 MARIE
                        Warren.

                                 WARREN
                        I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW!

           We hear the water running.

           They go to the door. Warren tries to open it, but it's
           locked. Warren is knocking.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Christy. Open the door.

                                 RICHARD
                        You can't do that, Christy! You can't
                        shoot drugs right now!

           Running water. Like she's drawing a bath to mask the sounds.

                                 MARIE
                        Open the door. Open it.

                                 WARREN
                        Stand back.
           He kicks the door as hard as he can. Nothing happens.

           He tries again with his shoulder, and hurts himself. Richard
           comes up behind him, and -- WHAMM! The door flies off its
           hinges and splinters. He goes inside and gasps --

           She's on her hands and knees with her head in the bathtub.

           DROWNING HERSELF.

           Wail of pipes score this nightmare.

           They try to pull her up, but she struggles to stay under.
           Her eyes are saucers. Fer face a blank canvas. Dunking her
           head with all the strength she can muster like a self-
           destructing robot, programmed to drown at any cost.

           They pull her head out, screaming for her to stop, but she
           breaks free and dunks her head in again.

           They wrestle her to the bathroom floor. Cheek against tile,
           like a fish out of water, struggling to return to the tub.

           WOOOOSHHH!!!!

           The pipes explode under the sink and a geyser of water
           sprays them all.

           She breaks free, and dunks her head in in again.

           UNDERWATER

           Christy breathes in, replacing oxygen with water. Bubbles
           explode out her mouth and nose as her lungs fill up. She
           sucks it in like a drug. And she smiles. Like it's
           beautiful. Eyes flutter, tongue dangles. She's getting high
           off the euphoria of drowning. They're trying to pull her up,
           but she's fighting, and then she's still.

                                                           BACK TO:

           Richard has Christy in his arms, gives her mouth to mouth.

           Christy shoots upright, vomits lake water, and seaweed, and
           A GUPPY. They jump back. The fish is alive.

           Dancing in her sick.

           He's holding her, and she's heaving there flapping and
           floundering. Se releases a banshee cry, and kicks free.

           She buries her face in the little PUDDLE of water on the
           tile, trying to drown in an inch of water, like a Junkie
           sucking up the last flakes from the carpet.
           They pile on top of her. Warren has her legs, Marie has her
           arms. She's fighting and kicking.

           It's takes all three of them. And then she just stops.

           Out cold. Dead weight.

           They carry her into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Towards the couch, but before they can get there--

           Christy starts to levitate.

           Floating right out of their hands.

           Higher. Floating in the middle of the living room, like
           she's floating underwater, in an invisible lake, hair rising
           up and rippling. Reminiscent of the opening scene.

                                 WARREN
                        Is this happening?! Marie?!

                                 MARIE
                        What the fuck?!

                                 WARREN
                        Do you see it?! Is this real?!

           She sees it. It's real. Richard sees it, too.

                                shock
                                 RICHARD
                                 )
                               (
                        Warren. How...

           She's turning slowly, head over heels, sinking to ceiling.

           Tucker watches with a gaping mouth. A warm dampness stains
           his crotch. Urine pools around his feet. He turns around.
           Very slowly. Walks out the door. And takes off running into
           the woods. Gone. Don't look for him, he's not coming back.

           Christy hits the ceiling like it’s the BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.

           Her head gently THUDS against the light fixture...

           And she’s out... suspended there... arms outstretched. Hair
           undulating like seaweed fronds...

           She's dragged across the ceiling, as if by a current.

           Warren tries to go to her, but gravity takes hold and --

           WHUMPP!!
           She lands hard on the carpet. At his feet. Out cold.

           Water pools around her from the bathroom. Even unconscious,
           she tries to suck it in, like the need is born in her.

           They all just look at each other.

           Speechless.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The clouds finally part with their great hoard of rain.
           Pummeling the lake.

           Sprinklers jut out of the lawn and fire away.

           It's rather excessive.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Rain sprays the windows like buckshot. Water is still
           exploding out of the bathroom. There's an inch carpeting the
           floor. They're so broken down, they just let it.

           Warren picks his cell phone off the table. It's been there
           all night.

           Ten missed calls from UNKNOWN CALLER.

                                mutters
                                 WARREN
                                       )
                               (
                        Jesus, Lenny.

           He pockets the phone, and joins the intervention circle
           where Richard and Marie are already sitting.

           Christy is tied to the hot seat with rope, bungee, and so
           much duct tape. Her face lost in her tangle of wet hair. The
           dead veins are spreading to her face. She looks like a
           cadaverous deathbed Junkie.

           The jaundice has spread to her skin. She's almost glowing
           pallid yellow, gums bleeding, hair thinning, she looks like
           she's lost twenty pounds in twenty minutes.

                                 MARIE
                        Her face, her fucking skin.

           Marie is crying into her hands.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Oh, God. Christy, I'm so sorry...

           Christy screams in harmony with the pipes. It's bad music.
                                 RICHARD
                        Warren? What do we do?

                                 WARREN
                        I'm trying to think.

           Christy sees the water pooling at her feet and it's trying
           to reach it, craning, struggling to drown.

           Warren catches a whiff of her. And it's bad.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Jesus.

                                 MARIE
                        Christy? Baby can you hear me?

           Christy ignores Marie. Straining for the water. Moaning like
           a dopesick Junkie and H20 is her drug.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        She's gone. Look at her. There's
                        nothing left.

                                 RICHARD
                        She's in there somewhere.

           Her tooth comes loose. She spits it on the carpet.

                                 MARIE
                        Do we call a priest?

                                 WARREN
                        It won't help.

                                 MARIE
                        What do we do?

           She's breathing heavy. We can see her cold plumes of breath.

           BEEP! BEEP! Warren jumps at the sound.

           It's coming from Christy's wrist.

           IT'S THE ALARM ON HER POOLMATE WATCH.

                                 WARREN
                        We have to finish the intervention.

           Warren grabs his briefcase, and takes out his letter.

                                 MARIE
                        What's that?

                                 WARREN
                        It's my turn.
                                 MARIE
                        When did you have time to write a
                        letter?

                                 WARREN
                        I've had twenty years.

           Marie shoots him a look. Nervous.

           Half an inch of water on the floor. Things floating by.

           Warren's leg is bouncing. The letter, his horrible truth, is
           trembling in his hands. It's a mess of cross-outs.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Dear Christy. They say if you always
                        tell the truth--

           Christy flinches at that word.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        --you never have to remember
                        anything.

           Rain is falling harder now. Spraying in the room from the
           broken window.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I have to remember everything.
                        Because it's all a lie.

           Marie shoots him a look. Christy flinches. A stab of pain.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        For twenty years now, I've lived like
                        a coward, in fear of being found out.
                        This weight you've been carrying, all
                        this shame and guilt, it's not yours.

                                 MARIE
                        ...What is this?

                                 RICHARD
                        It's Warren's turn now. Let him say
                        what he has to say.

                                 WARREN
                        I lied to you. I lied to your mother.
                        I lied to the police. I've been lying
                        to myself, and I've never stopped.

           Christy moans. Twists in her seat. So does Marie. The words
           are effecting them both. Christy's sores seem to be healing.
           IN THE KITCHEN, the pipes rattle and shake. Creeeeeek. The
           faucet turns on by itself. Spitting lake water into the
           sink. Seaweed and sediment clog the drain.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I've seen what my lies have done to
                        you, what I've done to you, to our
                        family, and my only hope is that this
                        letter gives you some peace.

           Christy start writhing in her chair.

                                 MARIE
                        I don't think this is a good idea...

                                 RICHARD
                        Shhh...

                                 WARREN
                        Here are the facts.

           IN THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM, the tub turns on by itself. Lake
           water spitting out. The sink turns on. Seaweed spews.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        The publishers were chomping at the
                        bit for a followup. We went to the
                        lake house so I could finish. So I
                        could start. I was in over my head. I
                        am not a writer, I'm a Junkie with a
                        thesaurus.

           Christy hisses. Bucking in her seat. The truth hurts. Marie
           is starting to sweat. Itchy.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I put everything I had into the first
                        book. I had nothing left but a few
                        half-truths, and a missed deadline.
                        Ally called it a "dead lie." And she
                        was right. I couldn't give back the
                        advance. It was the down payment on
                        the house.

           IN THE DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM, the toilet starts to overflow.
           Water spills on to the tiles. Joining the spray.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Your mother had her ten year college
                        reunion in New York and had to leave.
                        I knew it was a bad idea, but I
                        wanted her gone. I was feeling itchy.

           Marie is weeping into her hands. Richard hugs her close.
                                 RICHARD
                        It's okay. This is good.

           Warren can't look at her.

                                 WARREN
                        Ally wanted to learn to swim. She was
                        asking me all week. She wanted me to
                        teach her. I promised I would. Later.

           Christy starts screaming at the top of her lungs. The black
           veins in her arms are receding. The yellow is fading from
           her skin and eyes. Back to baby blues.

                                 RICHARD
                        Jesus, it's working. Warren keep
                        reading, don't stop!

                                 WARREN
                        I was holed up in my room, staring at
                        the blank page. Alone with my
                        thoughts. And that's the worst place
                        on earth for an addict to be.

                                 MARIE
                        ...what did you do?

                                 RICHARD
                        Let him finish!

           Thunder. GZZZT. The lights go out. The room is only lit by
           the candles and the hearth. Water everywhere.

                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        Tell the truth!

           Christy sucks in a breath. Her eyes are hers.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Dad?!

                                 WARREN
                        Christy...

                                 CHRISTY
                        There's a needle in my car.

                                 WARREN
                        What?

                                 CHRISTY
                        Under the seat.

           Sloshy footsteps. Warren looks up.

           Ally is standing in the shadowy hallway.
           Up to her ankles in water.

           Marie sees her and screams.

                                 MARIE
                        No!

                                 RICHARD
                        What's wrong!? What is it!

           A hushed serenity washes over Christy. 

                                 CHRISTY
                               (
                                to Warren
                                         )
                        Make it all go away.

                                 WARREN
                               (to Ally)
                        Stay the fuck away from her!

                                 MARIE
                        Ally... Ally?! Baby?!

           Ally is walking towards them. Step by herky jerky step.

                                 WARREN
                        Don't say that! That's not Ally! It's
                        not her!

                                 MARIE
                        It's her!

                                 WARREN
                        It's not her!

                                 CHRISTY
                        All that fear, and pain and guilt.
                        Make it stop...

                                 MARIE
                        My baby! My baby!

           She's trying to run to her, but Richard is holding her back.

                                 RICHARD
                        It's not real, there's nothing there.

                                 MARIE
                               (
                                trying to break free
                                                    )
                        I'm sorry, baby, oh god--

           CAW! CAW!

           There's a crow perched on Ally's chest.

           Pecking at her hollowed eye socket.
           And then Ally vanishes with a flash of lightning.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        No!!! Come back!!!

           Marie collapses on the floor, water explodes out of the
           walls and drenches her, and she bawls. Richard tries to
           console her, but it's impossible.

                                 CHRISTY
                               (
                                to Warren

                        Make it go away. You can live in the
                        lie, and there's no more pain,
                        there's only now. And now is perfect,
                        and life is beautiful after all.

                        There's a needle in my car for you.

                                 RICHARD
                        READ THE LETTER, WARREN! FINISH IT!

                               (
                                reading

                        I found a bag in my jeans. It was a
                        client's. I had confiscated it a few
                        weeks before. Forgot it was there. I
                        was calling Pete all weekend. Kept
                        going to voicemail. I called him a
                        hundred times. I knew he'd talk me
                        out of it, tell me I'm fucking crazy,
                        that I'm about to burn it all to the
                        ground. Truth is, I was secretly
                        happy he didn't answer--

                                 MARIE
                        --You son of a bitch! 

           --Marie snaps, and pounces on Warren, and starts slapping
           and hitting and screaming and Richard holds her back. She
           tackles him and they roll around the water.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        I FUCKING HATE YOU! I HATE YOUR GUTS!

           Christy is yellow again, bleeding from the mouth, the
           embodiment of a communicable disease devolving before them.

           WOOOSHH!! The pipes have broken below the kitchen sink and
           water is spraying everywhere.

                                 RICHARD
                        Sit down! Stop it!

           Marie cries, and hugs Warren. Beating him, and hugging him
           and crying in his chest as her punches grow weaker.
                                 MARIE
                        I wish you fucking OD'd, I wish you
                        were dead!

           Water floods into the room as Marie fights. It's up to their
           knees. Richard pulls her off, and Warren falls.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Whore. 

           They all turn to Christy. She's talking to Marie.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        You're the liar. Whore.

           Marie and Warren exchange a gruesome look.

                                 RICHARD
                        Don't listen to her, finish the
                        letter, goddamnit!

           It's raining from the ceiling, from the overflowing tub. An
           indoor downpour. 

                                 CHRISTY
                        Tell him where you were that day.

                                 WARREN
                        She was in New York.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Tell them where you were.

                                 RICHARD
                        Don't listen to it, it's trying to
                        throw you off, finish the letter.

                                 CHRISTY
                        You were two miles away fucking Pete
                        Miller while your little baby died.

                                         )
                        My reunion... I was at my...

                                 CHRISTY
                        And Warren called Pete. He needed
                        help. He and called called. But Pete
                        didn't answer, because he was busy
                        fucking you. Fucking you while your
                        baby girl drowned.

           Marie bursts into tears.

           Warren is stunned. Richard cringes. 
                                 RICHARD
                        Oh.

           Marie can't take it, she wades to the bedroom and slams the
           door behind her. Locks it. Weeping.

           Richard is knocking on the door, trying to coax her out.

                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        Marie--

                                 MARIE (O.S.)
                        FUCK OFF!

                                 RICHARD
                        --There's no judgments here!

           Warren is just sitting there. Stunned. Trying to wrap his
           head around it. Pipes moan, like the house is alive, and
           thirsty.

                                 CHRISTY
                        It's such a lonely way to die.

           Warren drops the letter. It floats away. The water erases
           all the words, they bleed together, and melt away. Water is
           raining down on Warren like a storm.

                                 CHRISTY (cont'd)
                        There's a house at the bottom of the
                        lake for you all. You can live there
                        together. You'll be a family again.

           The ropes snap and she rips her hands free from bondage. She
           gallops at Warren like a wild dog, and tackles him.

           She opens wide. Wider. Too wide. Gagging like a mother bird
           feeding her baby. She squeezes his face. Pries open his
           mouth. She hacks and chokes and growls and gags as --

           GUUUUHHHHHHH!!!!

           A geyser of lake water screams out of her mouth, spraying
           into his eyes and nose and throat and filling his lungs.

           Richard tries to pull her off, but she's so strong now, so
           much power, and she pushes him off and sends him sliding
           across the floor. Warren gags on muddy seaweed.

           GUHHHHHHHH!!!!

           An endless surge of water sprays from the bottomless lake of
           her gut. He's choking and crying and pleading with his eyes.
           Every breath he takes is killing him. 

           GUUUUUUUUUHHHHHH!!!
           An impossible high pressure spew. Silt and mud caked on his
           face. Behind the walls, THE PIPES sing for their new Queen.

           She douses him again, and he's drowning, and we're--

           UNDERWATER

           It's quiet down here below the sun dappled lake.

           Warren floats in milky gray water.

           He opens his eyes. A little fish swims by.

           But the hungry seaweed nips at his heels and wraps him up.

           He's pulled down by the icky green fingers and air bubbles
           explode with his screams.

           The seaweed is pulling him towards something.

           He can barely make it out.

           A cloud of silt parts to reveal the top of AN OLD STONE
           CHIMNEY, caked with algae.

           And then the GREEN TILES OF A ROOF.

           The house at the bottom of the lake.

           A horrible UNDERWATER SCREAM trickles out of the chimney
           with a burst of bubbles.

           INT. THE HOUSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.

           Warren's crack eyes open.

           He's sitting in the living room of the underwater lake
           house. It's exactly like the house up top, except the walls
           are covered in algae, moss growing on the ceiling. It seems
           to be alive, and spreading. The air is speckled with silt,
           shimmering water light ripples.

           The floor looks like old rickety dock from his dreams. A few
           fish are flapping on the floor like pests.

                                 WARREN
                        Hello?

           But his voice is muffled. Like he's talking underwater.

           He stands up. The rickety dock floor bends under his feet as
           he walks through the house.

           He looks out the window. Fish swimming past.
           The TV is there, it's caked with moss.

           It's playing the Olympics.

           Warren looks behind him.

           Bill, his 20-inch brook trout, is mounted on the wall. He
           hears the crying. And Christy is sitting in the cupboard
           under the stairs. Warren walks towards her.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Christy?

           The floor gives out and he falls through, and SPLASH!!!

                                                           BACK TO:

           Warren vomits up the water and regains consciousness.

           The moment he does, GUUUUUHHHHH!!!

           Christy showers him again for good measure. Just then --

           THE TIRE SWING falls around her waist like a lasso. Christy
           looks up. It's tethered to the rope.

           Marie is holding the other end for the tug of war. She
           summons all the strength she has, and yanks Christy off
           Warren, and then he jumps on her, and Richard uses the tire
           swing rope to hog tie her. She's screaming and --

           WHAPPP!!! Marie cracks Christy on the back of the head with
           her SWIMMING TROPHY, breaking it in half and knocking her
           out. The golden diver swims across the floor. 

                                 MARIE
                        I'm so sorry... I'm sorry...

           She's still. Marie drops the trophy, and collapses there.
           Cradling her daughter, a shadow of her daughter.

           Warren gets up and runs out the door.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Warren throws open the door and water spills down the stoop.

           A downpour of rain. He runs towards Christy's car. He jumps
           in and locks the door.

           Tires scream as he pulls away.
           INT. CHRISTY'S HONDA - NIGHT

           A getaway. Pedal to the metal. The house disappears in the
           rear view as he rounds the bend. It's raining so hard the
           change rattles in the cup holders.

           Once out of sight, he pulls over. Starts digging around
           under the seat for the needle. He finds Christy's kit, takes
           out the balloons, and it's like riding a bike. He gets to
           work cooking up the drugs like the Michelin star dope-chef
           he always was.

           He wraps the cell phone charger around his arm. Rain
           assaulting the car like it's trying to break in.

           The needle is locked and loaded, thumb over plunger, but he
           stops when he sees --

           KYLE STANDING THERE IN THE RAIN.

           Kyle from the opening. Standing at the hood. He's humming to
           himself, like he was in the car. Sadness in his eyes.

           Windshield wipers obscure him.

                                 WARREN
                        No.

           It hits Warren hard. He slowly removes the phone from his
           pocket. Ten missed calls from UNKNOWN CALLER.

           He sees the voicemails. He's praying to God. Plays it.

           It wasn't his bookie calling him --

                                 KYLE (MESSAGE)
                        It's me again. Where are you? I think
                        I'm in trouble. I never even went in.
                        I'm afraid to, I dunno, man, I just
                        went to the park. Across the street.
                        I'm sitting here, I don't know, I
                        have some. I kept some. And I think
                        I'm gonna do it, I don't want to, but
                        I will. So I'm fucked. I can't go to
                        rehab. Call me back, I don't have
                        anyone else to call. I'm sitting
                        here. Please...

           Warren tries to call him back. Straight to voicemail.

                                 KYLE'S VOICEMAIL
                        This is Kyle. Listen to the lady.

                                 THE LADY
                        To leave a voice message press one--
           --Warren hangs up and drops the phone and screams.

           Kyle is humming louder. Scared.

           Warren rips the tourniquet off his arms and has himself a
           little meltdown, slapping and punching the interior of the
           car. He tears off the visor, and it feels good.

           He gets on the phone. It rings.

                                 WARREN
                        Connie? No-- Is Connie there? Who's
                        on duty? Okay, listen to me, there's
                        a kid... he OD'd. I think he's in the
                        park on Sanford, yes, check the park,
                        he's a patient. No, I don't know
                        when, I just know he's there now--
                        send Mark or someone over there with
                        Narcan, and call an ambulance. Yes,
                        and call me back.

           The humming stops, and Kyle is gone.

           Like the squeaky wipers washed him away. 

           And Warren is alone. He looks down in despair.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I'm so sorry.

           He sits and listens to the windshield wipers.

           Sees something's poking out from under his seat. A BOOK. He
           picks it up. It's worn from overuse. Christy's copy of --

                                 THE INTERVENTIONIST
                        A story of addiction and redemption.
                                   By Warren Mann

           Warren sees his old self on the cover. His better self. He
           opens it. It's dog eared and underlined.

           Christy's bookmark falls to the floor. It's a photograph of
           her and Warren from her first swim meet. Happier times.

           Warren picks it up.

           EXT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Warren returns to the lake house. Idles there. Marie comes
           out of the house. She's on the porch.

           Warren gets out. Stands there in the rain. He has his book
           under his arm. She has to raise her voice over the storm.
                                 MARIE
                        We met at your book party, and we
                        just had this thing, and it was
                        insane. And it was exciting, and so
                        forbidden, and wrong, and -- great.

           Warren goes to her. They stand on the porch. Rain blows
           across the lake. They keep their distance.

                                 WARREN
                        He was the only guy I ever told.

           She looks at him.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I told him everything. A few weeks
                        after the funeral, it spilled out of
                        me, and we sat down and I told the
                        truth. And he dropped me. Like that.
                        He told me he couldn't sponsor me
                        anymore. No explanation. I couldn't
                        understand it. I thought it was the
                        moral high ground or something. I was
                        mortified. I never told anyone again.
                        I guess he carried that with him,
                        too. For the rest of his life.

                                 MARIE
                        It feels good knowing.

           They sit on the steps.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        I thought there might have been more.
                        But, I didn't want to know.

                                 WARREN
                        I've been holding my breath for
                        twenty years.

                                 MARIE
                        Breathe.

           She takes his book from under his arm. It's soaking wet.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Remember the purple pen?

                                 WARREN
                               (
                                laughs
                                      )
                        Are you kidding?

                                 MARIE
                        You used to get so mad at me.
                                 WARREN
                        Grammar Nazi.

                                 MARIE
                        You couldn't have done it without me.

                                 WARREN
                        I still can't.

                                 MARIE
                        I loved correcting your spelling.

                                 WARREN
                        A book on sobriety took me out.

                                 MARIE
                        It helped a lot of people, too. You
                        helped a lot of people.

                                 WARREN
                        I couldn't help Ally. I couldn't help
                        either of them.

                                 MARIE
                        "It's never too late. We're never too
                        broken, too scarred, or too far-gone
                        to get it right. There's forgiveness
                        at the end of this."

                                 WARREN
                        You remember that?

                                 MARIE
                        Sure, I put all the commas in.

           He looks at her.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Should we just say it? Like the book
                        says. Say it out loud? Say the words
                        and give them power?

                                 WARREN
                        Yes.

                                 MARIE

                                beat
                                    )
                        I'll go first.
                               (
                        I forgive you.

           He nods.

                                 MARIE (cont'd)
                        Your turn.
                                 WARREN
                        I forgive you.

                                 MARIE
                        And I forgive myself.

                                 WARREN
                        Me too.

                                 MARIE
                        Say it.

                                 WARREN
                        I forgive myself. And I've never
                        needed a cigarette more in life than
                        I do right now.

           Marie reaches into her coat pocket. Pulls out a pack. Slaps
           one out, and hands it to him.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        You're smoking again?

                                 MARIE
                        Nobody's perfect.

           They light up.

                                 WARREN
                        Richard maybe.

                                 MARIE
                        Maybe Richard.

           They smoke for a minute. Long, hard drags.

           SCREAMS from inside.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Warren!

                                 MARIE
                        Let's finish this.

           He nods. The shadows make the house look like a giant crying
           face. Window-eyes. A gaping mouth-door. They walk up the
           tongue-like stoop. And into the belly of the beast.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Warren sits in the water with Christy who is tied up.
           Screaming beneath the gag. Richard hands him the letter. All
           the words have bled away.
                                 RICHARD
                        I'm sorry. It's... gone.

                                 WARREN
                        It's okay. I know it pretty good.

           He turns to Christy. She snarls at him.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        ...I came-to four hours later. And
                        you were still sitting by the door.
                        It was night. She had been floating
                        there all day. I ran down, and
                        dragged her out.

           Marie lifts the tire off her, they starts to pick at her
           knots. Richard stands in the back, listening.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        I called the police. And sat you
                        down, and I told you that we had to
                        make up a story for the men who are
                        coming.

           The veins in her arms, disappearing. The sores healing. Her
           face swelling with health. Marie unties the ropes.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        They are going to have questions, I
                        told you, questions like a test in
                        school, and we have to have all the
                        right answers or we'll fail the test,
                        and daddy will have to go away for a
                        long, long time.

           Christy writhing, muffled screaming.

           INT. THE HOUSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.

           Christy steps out of the cupboard, and looks around.
           Warren's voice is echoing behind the walls. Echoing in the
           pipes, moving through the house, and she hears it all.

                                 WARREN'S VOICE
                        I ripped a few loose boards away from
                        the dock ten minutes before the
                        ambulance came. And they came, and
                        you told my lie. So well. You told
                        them that you were afraid to wake me
                        up. That you thought you were going
                        to get in trouble. That you hid under
                        the stairs and pretended like it
                        never happened.
                                                           BACK TO:

           Christy is untied, gag removed, and she's not fighting.

                                 WARREN
                        And they believed it. And you
                        believed it. And mom believed it. You
                        told it so well it became the truth.

           The water slowly stops gushing out of the walls. The rain is
           letting up. The sun is starting to rise.

           INT. THE HOUSE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LAKE.

           Christy stands in the middle of the house. Watching it break
           apart before her eyes. Water floods in and carries her out.

                                 WARREN'S VOICE
                        As the years went on, I even started
                        to believe it. Until I looked at you.
                        And every time I looked at you, I saw
                        my lie. So, I stopped looking. And I
                        let you down. And I lost you, too.
                        Because I was petrified, and here's
                        the truth. I was the Interventionist,
                        and I cared more about saving face
                        than I did about saving you...

           INT. THE LAKE.

           Christy is rising to the surface, rising towards the light.

                                                           BACK TO:

           Christy's eyes crack open. She sucks in a breath. And she's
           healed, almost glowing. 

                                 WARREN
                        I want you to know that I'm sorry.
                        I'm not asking for your forgiveness.
                        I'm only asking that you forgive
                        yourself. Because it wasn't your
                        fault. It wasn't your fault.  

           Dawn punches through the windows. It's a beautiful morning.
           Christy has tears in her deep blue eyes.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        Love, dad.

           She looks at her father. Really looks at him, like she's
           seeing him for the first time. She's in a sort of dream
           state. Somewhere between life and death.
                                 CHRISTY
                        Dad?

                                 WARREN
                        Hi, pie.

                                 CHRISTY
                        It wasn't my fault.

           Her eyes fill with tears.

                                 RICHARD
                        Are there neighbors?

           They all turn. And look out the window.

           ALLY IS STANDING ON THE DOCK.

           A pure vision. Not a waterlogged corpse. She dives into the
           lake and swims like a fish.

                                 RICHARD (cont'd)
                        Ohmygod.

           Marie is crying, holding her mouth.

           Ally swims across the lake. And then she's gone.

           And Christy bursts into to tears and runs into her father's
           arms, and he brushes her hair, and the healing begins. Marie
           joins the hug, and they stand by the window. It's the
           morning after a heavy rain, and the mist is a warm blanket,
           and everything is wet and fresh and clean.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Tell me about Silverdale.

                                 MARIE
                        It's the best rehab in the state.

                                 WARREN
                        There's a four month wait list for a
                        bed, but I pulled some strings.

                                 MARIE
                        Will you accept our gift of help?

                                 CHRISTY
                        Yes.

           And they're all just standing there hugging. The lake is a
           blank canvas. The sun is almost up, and it's perfect.
           Richard watches. Separate. Warren waves him over.

                                 WARREN
                        Get in on this, brother.
           And he does. And it's a weird family. Richard and Marie
           kiss. Warren and Christy hug.

                                 WARREN (cont'd)
                        What time is it? I could use a
                        meeting.

                                 CHRISTY
                        Me too.

           EXT. ST. MARY'S CHURCH - DAY

           All the JUNKIES and DRUNKS are waiting for the basement to
           open. Richard, Marie, Christy, and Warren pull up in the
           Honda, and limp to the door. Greetings and salutations, as
           they fumble inside. They look like warm hell. Bloodied,
           beaten. One EX-JUNKIE sees them, and turns to another.

                                 JUNKIE
                        Ooh. I been there, baby.

                                 JUNKIE #2
                        Rough night, eh?

           They start to enter the basement.

                                 JUNKIE #2 (cont'd)
                        Keep comin' back.

           Warren's PHONE RINGS. The call he's been waiting for. He
           answers. Braces.

                                 WARREN
                        Go ahead.

                        Thank God. Okay, listen... Tell
                        Kyle... listen to me, when you get to
                        the hospital -- tell him I'll be
                        there. Call his parents, make sure
                        they stay with him, and tell them
                        I'll be there later today. I'm with
                        my daughter now.

           FADE OUT.
