           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH GYM - PROM NIGHT

           Ill-fitting tuxedos, bedazzled dresses and desperately 
           covered up pimples litter the room. The stench of expectation 
           is masked only by Axe Body spray.  

           COOL KIDS pour vodka into the punch bowl as WALLFLOWERS shift 
           in their seats at the stag table watching the dance floor. 

           The music cuts out to the distinctive clink of a fork on 
           glass. On stage stands SEÑOR SULLIVAN, a late 30’s white dude 
           with a hacky fade in his hair in a desperate attempt to be 
           hip. We can’t hear what he says but we see him ramble 
           enthusiastically at the microphone.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        That’s Señor Sullivan. He’s trying 
                        to “organically” work his own high 
                        school experience into a night 
                        that’s supposed to be all about us. 

                        All you have to know is that back 
                        when America’s hot button issue was 
                        Shakespeare in Love winning best 
                        picture, Sullivan was popular. But 
                        who cares? Just like Gwyneth 
                        Paltrow became Goop, Señor Sullivan 
                        became old, which means there is no 
                        room for him in our story. 

           We see OLLIE ST. JOHN, a cute twink, impeccably dressed in an 
           emerald tux and a lavender orchid boutonniere that he no 
           doubt gave to himself. He studies the room.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        In case you’re illiterate or just 
                        hopelessly straight, my name is 
                        Ollie St. John, editor of the 
                        Harrington Herald and the 
                        Harrington Underground: the 
                        reigning Gossip Girl of all that I 
                        see. And I see all. Because high 
                        school is better than peak TV. It’s 
                        prestige, it’s real, it’s raw, and 
                        it’s free.

           We see JACKIE POWERS at the stag table, uncomfortably stuffed 
           into her dress, hoping to get through the night unnoticed.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        What? Was I not supposed to let the 
                        people in on when Jackie Powers let 
                        a Golden Retriever lick peanut 
                        butter off her snatch? 
           We pan over to CHRISTIAN KATZ, a cocky bro teaching a fellow 
           BRO how to butt-chug through very explicit hand motions. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Or how about when Christian Katz 
                        got gonorrhea and the only people 
                        who had to get checked were Madison 
                        McDonald and her little sister 
                        Chloe? Not very Christian of him, 
                        if you ask me.

           We search the crowd before finding HARPER WEST, the epitome 
           of high school chic. This girl was born for teen popularity.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Without a doubt, my prize subject 
                        has always been Harper West. 

           Harper is teen-girl-hot in a way that will one day mature 
           into beauty. And usually Harper would love that compliment 
           but tonight she’s busy brooding, swilling her punch.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I have spent four years dragging 
                        Harper through my gossip column 
                        without an ounce of pity or regret. 
                        And why not? Harper was the most 
                        popular girl at Harrington High. 
                        Someone needed to toughen her up. 

           Back on stage, Sr. Sullivan finishes laughing at his own joke. 

                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        And that’s why I can say with 
                        personal knowledge, how much Prom 
                        King and Queen will mean to you. 
                        Cherish it guys! 

           Señor Sullivan chokes up on his moment of indulgent self-
           reflection, then lifts up two plastic crowns.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        And here we are, the moment no one 
                        could’ve anticipated, but has 
                        seemed inevitable ever since Ava 
                        LaMonte arrived at Harrington High. 

           Hard cut to: AVA LaMONTE, an adorable ingenue with an edge, 
           dressed to the nines, listening attentively in the front row. 
           The BAND gives a light drum roll as Señor Sullivan fumbles to 
           open the envelope, milking every second.

                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        This year’s Harrington Queen is--
           We freeze on a very unflattering Señor Sullivan.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I’m going to stop us right here, 
                        because to truly understand the 
                        deliciousness of what will happen 
                        next, you need to understand how 
                        Ava LaMonte got here ready to 
                        accept Harper West’s crown.

           We see a frozen Ava, perfectly poised and ready to contort 
           her face into faux surprise.

           We cut to the frozen, unhappy face of Harper West, former 
           Most Popular Girl of Harrington High™.

           INT. FORMAL USA DRESSING ROOM - DAY - 4 MONTHS AGO

           Harper stares at herself in the dressing room mirror as some 
           shitty top 40 plays over the store’s speakers. 

           Harper is constantly seen as a hot girl more mature than 
           other teens, but right now she looks young and vulnerable. 
           She wears a glittery prom dress most girls couldn’t pull off, 
           but she’s not sure about it. She sucks her stomach in. 

           On the stool in the corner sits a small plastic tiara. Harper 
           picks it up. She takes a deep breath and sets it on her head. 
           Her face instantly breaks into an genuine smile when--

                                 APRIL (O.S.)
                        Stop jerking off to your reflection 
                        and get your boney butt out here! 

           Harper snaps out of it. She adjusts her crown confidently. 

                                 HARPER
                        Is that how you speak to your 
                        future queen? 

           INT. FORMAL USA - CONTINUOUS

           APRIL EAGAN, spazzy but loveable, perches on a couch. She 
           rocks a flapper dress complete with a feathered headband and 
           a long cigarette holder a la Holly Golightly. 

           The dressing room door swings open to reveal: Harper West, 
           Most Popular Girl of Harrington High™. 

           Harper holds an elegant pose, which she drops the second she 
           sees April. Harper tosses the crown on the couch. 
                                 HARPER 
                        Oh my god April, I know The Great 
                        Gatsby Spark Notes changed your 
                        life but this is prom, not a 
                        costume party.  

                                 APRIL
                        Open your eyes Harper, prom is a 
                        costume party. Right now you’re 
                        dressed as Prom Queen, I’m the Cool 
                        Lit Chick and Bertie--

           BERTIE CRUZ, a big butch lesbian, wanders in, busy with the 
           buttons on her rad lady suit. 

                                 APRIL (CONT’D)
                        ...is a dope power butch and my 
                        future prom date. 
                             (kisses Bertie)
                        Even if she hasn’t asked me yet.

                                 BERTIE
                        It’s January. We should be soaking 
                        up the last few hours of winter 
                        break. But instead we’re here--

                                 HARPER
                        Whenever people decide it’s prom 
                        season these racks will be as empty 
                        as Ollie St. John’s cold black heart. 

                                 BERTIE
                        Still salty about his latest column? 

                                 HARPER
                             (exasperated)
                        I didn’t get a boob job! I can’t 
                        even get a part-time job! 

           Harper turns to the mirror. April appraises. 

                                 APRIL
                        Let’s see it again with the tiara.

           Harper hands it over. April puts it on Harper’s head.

                                 BERTIE
                        You brought a crown with you? 

                                 HARPER
                        Obviously the Homecoming Crown is 
                        different from the Prom Tiara but--
                                 BERTIE
                        No, I meant like, isn’t it... a 
                        little... presumptuous? 

           Harper and April share a laugh off that preposterous thought. 

                                 APRIL
                        Babe, Harper will win. She doesn't 
                        have a choice. It’s who she is. 

           Harper shrugs in agreement, applying lipstick in the mirror. 

                                 HARPER
                        I technically could lose. I’d just 
                        be surprised.

           Harper blows herself a kiss in the mirror. 

           EXT. OUTLET MALL - FORMAL USA STOREFRONT - DAY 

           Harper, April and Bertie walk out with bags slung over their 
           shoulders. We’re somewhere in Connecticut, probably. 

           Now in civvies: Harper sports a Columbia sweatshirt, Bertie 
           is butch-chic in a short sleeve button-up despite the January 
           weather, April is dressed performatively in all black. 

                                 HARPER
                        So is this health-goth phase more 
                        than just a Winter Break look?   

                                 APRIL
                        This isn’t health-goth, it’s beach-
                        witch. And it’s not a phase. This 
                        is my college look. 

           Harper rolls her eyes, then gestures to her own sweatshirt.

                                 HARPER
                        This better be my college look or 
                        I’m going to University of My Mom’s 
                        Basement. 

                                 APRIL
                        You will so totally get in-- 

                                 HARPER
                        Whatever! Who cares about next 
                        year! It’s second semester senior 
                        year! It’s our civic duty to live 
                        it up. These four months will be 
                        the best ya ever seen-- 
                           APRIL
                                                         BERTIE
           Seniors 2019! 
                                              Seniors 2019! 

           They bump hips. It’s Donna and The Dynamos-esque. These guys 
           are real best friends. 

                                                           SFX: THUNDER

           INT. RAINFOREST CAFE - NIGHT

           Fake lightning strobes across the Rainforest Cafe. Stuffed 
           tigers emit animatronic roars. Fog filters across the floor. 

           Under the monkeys and next to the giraffes sits Harper West.  

                                 HARPER 
                        A bottle of champagne, please. 

           Harper flashes her 1000 watt smile at a teenage WAITRESS with 
           coke-bottle glasses (read: uncool) dressed in a full safari 
           outfit. Her name tag reads RANGER DEB.

                                 RANGER DEB
                        We don’t have that here. Can I 
                        interest you in a Mongoose Mai Tai? 

                                 HARPER
                        Mai Tais all around. Let’s be wild.

                                 RANGER DEB
                        ...can I see your I.D.? 

           Harper rummages through her purse, then feigns surprise. 

                                 HARPER
                        I must have left it in Brooklyn... 
                        where I live. I’m 23, 1995, year of 
                        the Pig!
                             (reading her name tag)
                        Think you can make an exception, 
                        Ranger Deb? 

           Harper repeats that same disarming smile. Ranger Deb caves.

                                 RANGER DEB
                        Three Mai Tais, coming right up.

           Ranger Deb leaves and Harper’s smile turns mischievous as she 
           looks across the table and winks.

                                 HARPER
                        Suck it, Dad! You owe me ten 
                        dollars, and an apology.
           Across from her sit SUSAN and DEAN WEST. They’re hot parents 
           straight out of a catalog. Hotness begets hotness - MLK Jr.

                                 DEAN
                        I don’t know whether to be proud or 
                        scared of your confidence. 

           Ranger Deb returns with the Mai Tais. Susan raises her glass.

                                 SUSAN
                        To the end of high school, bitches! 

                                 HARPER
                        Mom!

           Harper laughs and side eyes Ranger Deb as if to say not while 
           she’s still here. Ranger Deb skulks away in embarrassment. 

                                 DEAN
                             (toasting his glass)
                        To our--

           Suddenly a THUNDER STORM breaks out. Other PATRONS of the 
           Rainforest Cafe clap. Dean patiently waits. Once it passes--

                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        To our amazing daughter, the--

           THUNDER STORM! 

           We track over to the other side of the Rainforest Cafe, where 
           who should we see but AVA LaMONTE, in a safari outfit, staring 
           at the Wests as she flicks a switch labeled THUNDERSTORM on 
           and off. Every time Dean tries to speak.... THUNDER!  

           This Ava looks totally different than Prom-Ava. She’s mousey 
           with glasses and a ponytail. A movie version of a “loser”. 

           She watches as Harper laughs at Dean. Watches as Harper 
           tosses her silky hair over her shoulder. Ava tosses her oily 
           ponytail over her own shoulder in a sad imitation. 

           She watches as Harper’s perfect lips part to drink her orange 
           Mai Tai. Ava touches her own lips absentmindedly when--

                                 RANGER DEB
                        I slipped a Dulcolax in her Mai Tai. 
                        Think she’s a puker or a shitter?

                                 AVA
                        Again? Deb, why! 
                                 RANGER DEB
                        This bitch goes to my rival school 
                        and steals the Best Actress Cappie 
                        every year. She’s not even good, 
                        the judges are just repressed! 

           Ava takes a step toward Harper as if to warn her, when RANGER 
           TODD, a self-serious manager, stops her.

                                 RANGER TODD 
                        Not so fast, Ranger Ava! A kid 
                        vomited in the bush babies again. 

           Ranger Todd hands Ava a mop then flips the thunderstorm 
           switch off and gives Ava and Deb a suspicious look.

                                 RANGER TODD (CONT’D)
                        I’ve heard you both call kookaburra 
                        wings “chicken”. People don’t come 
                        here to eat chicken. They come here 
                        to go on a jungle safari. 

           Back at the table: the Wests eat their jungle fare. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Seems like only yesterday you were a 
                        ninth grader, practically in diapers--

           Harper is saved by her boyfriend, DIEGO OLVERA (17), who 
           rushes up to the table and slides into the booth.

                                 DIEGO
                        Sorry, I’m late! Practice ran long. 

           Diego is that high school hunk that “losers” have a crush on 
           because he takes the time to smile at them. Right now he’s in 
           a sweaty lacrosse uniform but he makes it look good. He 
           shakes Dean’s hand and gives Harper a quick cheek peck.

                                 HARPER
                        You’re going to blow my cover. 
                        Everyone here thinks I’m a 23-year-
                        old Brooklynite on Safari. 

                                 DIEGO
                        I could be 23.

                                 HARPER
                        Adults don’t play lacrosse. 

                                 DIEGO
                        This adult will. The coach at 
                        Fordham said he has his eye on me.

                        I’m going to apply early next year. 
                        Maybe we could both be New Yorkers? 

           Diego looks at Harper expectantly.

                                 HARPER
                        I haven’t gotten in yet, don’t jinx it. 

           Harper takes a huge, annoyed bite of her Rainforest Burger.

                                 DEAN
                        Speaking of New York, I pulled a 
                        few strings and got you an alumni 
                        call with Columbia this week. Just 
                        remember to slip in how much you 
                        love the school and what you’re 
                        excited for next year.

                                 DIEGO
                        I can’t wait for college. Dorms, 
                        parties, midnight breakfast, no 
                        parents!
                             (to Dean and Susan)
                        No offense.

                                                          DEAN
                           SUSAN
           Parents are lame.
                                              Parties rule. 

                                 DIEGO
                        I just can’t wait to get out of 
                        high school and start my life. 
                        Right, Harper? 

                                 HARPER
                        Why can’t we all just live in the 
                        now? You know? Carpe diem. Ever 
                        heard of her?

           She starts to look sicker and sicker. It’s Dulcalax o’clock. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        It’s like, why not enjoy high 
                        school? It’s always been really 
                        good to me. Best ya ever seen...

           Harper gags. Ranger Todd eagle eyes it from across the room--

                                 RANGER TODD
                        Not in the jungle! 

           Harper beelines for the door. 
           EXT. RAINFOREST CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           Harper makes it less than a foot out of the door before she 
           vomits bright orange Mai Tai EVERYWHERE...

           ...onto the feet of a disgusted Ranger Deb on a vape break, 
           making her bad day even worse. Harper looks up pathetically.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not really 23, Ranger Deb.

                                 RANGER DEB
                        Duh! I’m legally blind, not stupid! 
                        But it doesn’t matter. My Mom says 
                        my life only gets better from here. 
                        Dumb hot girls like you always peak 
                        in high school.

           The words reverberate in Harper’s head as we SMASH TO-- 

           INT. WEST FAMILY LEXUS - NIGHT

           Harper zones out in the back seat covered in bright orange 
           Mai Tai vomit. Dean, Susan, and Diego chat convivially, Diego 
           stroking Harper’s hand. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Like the Mongoose Mai Tai expelled 
                        from her body, so too did Harper 
                        throw up all of her confidence and 
                        composure that night. Ranger Deb’s 
                        words shattered Harper like the 
                        first brick thrown at Stonewall.

                        Speaking of Judy Garland, it’s time 
                        to talk about me.  

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR LOCKER HALLWAY - DAY

           Ollie St. John struts through the crowded hall. 

           Ollie is way overdressed for high school: he wears well-
           fitting pants and a button down with a slim tie. He observes 
           STUDENTS like animals in a zoo. Particularly the hot kids, 
           laughing in slow motion, flipping their hair.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I’d spent high school studying 
                        popularity like a scholar. I knew 
                        how it walked, talked, laughed, 
                        moved. I knew it washes over people 
                        like holy water on a cripple.

                        It clears your skin, boosts your 
                        ego and frees you of mortal 
                        burdens. 

           He stops in front of a chart on the wall which reads
           “WHERE WILL YOU BE NEXT YEAR?” 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        And I also knew I could never have 
                        it. So I’d decided to be the next 
                        best thing, an influencer.

           OONA STAMAKOS walks up and sheepishly writes down “UCONN”. A 
           pack of GIRLS run up and hug her. The crowd applauds. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        The Ollie St. John Social Treatment is 
                        all about PR plus positioning. Take 
                        Oona Stamakos. A recovering Horse Girl 
                        with a weakness for bedazzled denim and 
                        rainbow braces desperate to break into 
                        society. Luckily she came to me. All it 
                        took was a revamped wardrobe and a well 
                        timed game of Truth or Dare.  

           JERRY RIGGS struts up to the board wearing headphones. He 
           writes down “Chasing the dream in NYC”. People cheer. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Or Jerry Riggs, who was on the fast 
                        track for Most Likely To Smell Like 
                        Mayonnaise until I broke into 
                        Harper’s Pumpkin Day Soiree to get 
                        his mixtape into the right hands. 
                        Harper might be a tastemaker, but I 
                        have to tell her what to taste. 

           Ollie walks up to the board and confidently writes 
           “NORTHWESTERN JOURNALISM”. Ollie proudly turns around.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        But as our fates hurdled towards 
                        our ever looming graduation, I 
                        started wondering... to what end? 

           But everyone has left. Ollie is all alone.

           INT. HOME EC - DAY

           Harper stares into space when suddenly DR. VAJRAYANA zooms 
           into the room, slamming the door behind her. 
                                 DR. VAJRAYANA
                        I’m Dr. Vajrayana. You can call me 
                        Dr. V! I know what you’re thinking.

                        archaic to know how to do your 
                        taxes? Haggle down a broker’s fee?

                        You! What do you want to get out of 
                        this class? 

           Harper is caught off guard.

                                 HARPER
                        I thought we’d make cupcakes and 
                        like, learn how to sew?

                        For your future career as a 
                        character in Little Women? 

           Dr. V cracks up at her own joke. The class chuckles along. 
           Harper frowns, are they laughing at her?

                                 DR. V (CONT’D)
                        Everyone, please take out your 
                        winter break homework assignment. 

           Harper clearly forgot. She immediately turns on the charm. 

                                 HARPER 
                        Wow, talk about irony, Dr. V, but I 
                        must have left my Home-Ec assignment 
                        at home. I will totally get it to 
                        you first thing tomorrow morning.

           Harper flashes her most charming smile, but Dr. V looks at 
           Harper with disappointment then turns on her heels--

                                 DR. V
                        Pop quiz! What’s something that can 
                        make you or break you and once it’s 
                        gone, you can’t get back?

                        impression of you is that you came

                        now but next year is a whole 
                        different ball game. Time to build 
                        foundations for the future, people!

           Dr. V smiles at the class. Harper’s face is set in a panicked 
           grimace. We MATCH CUT TO: 

           INT. JOURNALISM CLASSROOM - DAY

           Harper West’s senior portrait is pinned up in the middle of 
           what looks like a conspiracy chart. We pull back to see--

           Ollie stands in front of a roll-away chalkboard covered in 
           mock-ups for The Harrington Underground. Early superlative 
           predictions, winter break rumors and the quarterly Hottie 
           List surround Harper’s central headshot.

           MS. KILGALLEN, a middle-aged teacher counting down the years 
           until retirement walks in. Ollie scrambles to flip around the 
           chalkboard, now showing mock-ups for The Harrington Herald.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Ollie.

                        It’s Ms. Kilgallen.

                        And it always will be. 

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                             (eyeing the chalkboard)
                        Let’s try something new this 
                        semester. Focusing on the school 
                        paper instead of that gossip rag 
                        you run behind my back? 

                                 OLLIE
                        All news is gossip, and all gossip 
                        is news. Doesn’t matter if it’s on 
                        TMZ or the Failing New York Times. 

           Ollie crosses himself and blows a kiss into the sky. Ms. 
           Kilgallen isn’t buying it. Ollie shrugs and flips the 
           chalkboard back to the Harrington Underground.
                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll level with you. I’ve spent the 
                        last four years driving Princess Di 
                        off the road for a snap of 
                        Harrington Royalty. But gossip is 
                        time and place, and with the time 
                        dwindling and the place fading, I 
                        don’t know what else I can say.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Why not take these last few months 
                        to just enjoy high school?

                                 OLLIE
                        That’s an oxymoron. 

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Uh-huh, well how about this, if I 
                        catch you covering students like a 
                        tabloid, I’m firing you as editor. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Is that a threat?

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        It’s a suggestion to befriend kids 
                        instead of reporting on them. 
                        You’re cute, smart and frankly, 
                        ruthless. There’s no reason you 
                        shouldn't be up here.

           Kilgallen taps Harper’s nose at the center of the chalkboard. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I’m like Ryan Reynolds in mid-
                        2000’s romcoms. I’m hot, I’m here, 
                        but it’s not my time. 

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Then make it your time. You’ve 
                        given half the students in this 
                        school the Ollie St. John Social 
                        Treatment. Maybe it’s time to treat 
                        yourself?

           A light bulb goes off in Ollie’s brain.

                                 OLLIE
                        You’re always saying you went to 
                        Harvard, Karen, but this is the 
                        first time I actually believe it.
           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR LOCKER HALLWAY - DAY

           Ollie confidently strides through the locker hall, swerving 
           through incoming students. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Harper and my relationship was very 
                        Liz and Dick, except all divorce and 
                        no marriage. But in the dog days of 
                        senior year, a little weaponized 
                        nostalgia can go a long way.

           INT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY

           Harper holds a stack of flyers as Bertie and April staple a 
           cluster of them on the bulletin board. The flyers read: 
           “Harrington Drama Presents The Unsinkable Molly Brown: Auditions 
           Tomorrow!” under which is a drawing of the Titanic sinking.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s just Home-Ec. Like, big whoop. 
                        It’s not indicative of my whole life. 

           Harper takes a flyer and staples it up aggressively. She sighs.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Guys, I think I’m having a quarter-
                        life crisis.

                                 BERTIE
                        Harper, you’re not even 18. 

                                 HARPER
                        My fake ID says I’m 23, at which 
                        point I’ll be showing off Ollie’s 
                        gossip pieces like they’re trophies 
                        of my youth. 

           As if on cue, Ollie struts in. Harper rolls her eyes and 
           staples up a flyer. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Harper! Funny running into you here.

                                 APRIL
                        I’m sure it was a total coincidence.

                                 OLLIE
                        Ok so I might have followed the 
                        trail of Titanic flyers. So! How 
                        was break? I heard your New Year’s 
                        party was truly something to 
                        journal about.
                                 HARPER
                        Oh, were you not there? I guess 
                        your invitation got lost in the 
                        void of my indifference.   

                                 OLLIE
                        Aw, you’d kill to be indifferent to 
                        me, wouldn’t you?

                                 APRIL
                        You’re scaring Kathy, Ollie.

           Ollie eyes KATHY, the shrewd front office lady listening to 
           the whole conversion like she’s watching TV.

                                 OLLIE
                        I think you’re doing that all by 
                        yourself, Vampyra. If you want to 
                        go Winona, your next phase should 
                        shade a little less Beetlejuice and 
                        a little more Girl, Interrupted. 

                                 APRIL
                             (for the last time)
                        It’s not a phase! 

                                 OLLIE
                             (back to Harper)
                        Speaking of our inextricable bond, 
                        as the sun sets on our high school 
                        career, why not call a social truce? 

           Harper looks at Ollie a moment then bursts out laughing. 

                                 HARPER
                        Ollie, Ollie, Ollie, I know we 
                        don’t always get along but I love 
                        that we can share a laugh. Honestly 
                        it’s a sign of our maturity.  

           Ollie’s eyes narrow. He grabs one of the flyers. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Imagine how mature our power-
                        friendship could be. Maybe I could 
                        even lend my beautiful tenor to 
                        your doomed luxury cruise.

                                 BERTIE
                        If you were on board, people would 
                        jump ship before the iceberg. 
                                 OLLIE
                        Oh, I’m sorry, Bertie, I forgot 
                        your pronouns were she/her/bitch.

           Kathy suppresses a snort. 

                                 HARPER
                        Run along now, Ollie, and as usual, 
                        keep my name off your chapped lips.

           Harper goes back to the flyers. Time slows as Ollie watches 
           Harper laughing with April and Bertie. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I stared down Harper’s perfectly 
                        symmetrical face and realized my 
                        four years of accumulated shit could 
                        not be wiped away with a single wave 
                        of Dido’s white flag. As long as I 
                        was Ollie St. John, I’d need an 
                        angle as strong as Faye Dunaway’s 
                        cheek bones to get in with the 
                        popular crowd.

           The door opens and in walks TOVAH SILVERSTEIN, a type-A with 
           crazy eyes so intense they might pop out of her head. 

                                 TOVAH
                             (mile-a-minute)
                        This is the front office! And-- Oh my 
                        god, and that’s Harper, April and 
                        Bertie! Hey ladies! New student alert! 

           Tovah steps aside to reveal: a girl we know as Ava LaMonte. 
           But no one else knows her at all. Ava bashfully waves. 

           Harper snatches the flyer out of Ollie’s hands and pointedly 
           gives it to Ava.

                                 HARPER
                        Welcome to Harrington, auditions 
                        are tomorrow. Hope you can come!

           Harper smiles her absolute most charming smile. Ava clutches 
           the flyer, a huge smile breaking across her face. She stares 
           at Harper like she’s a celebrity. 

                                 AVA
                        Thank you. I’m--

           But Harper is already halfway out the door, followed closely 
           by April and Bertie.
           Ollie looks wistfully after Harper until he notices that he’s 
           not the only one. Ava also gazes longingly after her.

           Ollie scrutinizes Ava. The glasses, the hair, the lost look.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Ava LaMonte. Like a movie loser 
                        sent from casting heaven. You know, 
                        the type of girl who takes off her 
                        glasses in the second act and is 
                        suddenly Rachael Leigh Cook? That 
                        was Ava. That was my opportunity.

           Tovah grabs Ava’s hand, leading her back to the hallway. 

                                 TOVAH
                        Now I’ll show you the science lab! Caleb 
                        Decker set a chemical fire in there this 
                        morning but if you close your eyes it 
                        kind of smells like s’mores! 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR LOCKER HALLWAY - DAY

           Ollie bursts into the hall, catching up with Ava and Tovah.

                                 OLLIE
                        Wait! Tovah! Harper was just saying 
                        how she has a special cameo for you 
                        in the play. 

           Tovah zooms down to Harper, April and Bertie at their lockers.

                                 TOVAH
                        What is it? Do I drown? I accept! 
                        Now that I’m in Drama, you three 
                        should totally come to the Student 
                        Government’s food drive next week! 
                        A can of succotash from Harper 
                        would go a long way for SGA’s PR! 

           As Harper humors Tovah, Ollie links arms with Ava. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Now I’m your tour guide and our 
                        first stop is my office-- 

           INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Beyond the mops is a relaxation station set up for the 
           janitor. Ollie takes Ava’s shoulders and sits her down on a 
           bean bag. Ollie sits on a real chair, backwards. 
                                 OLLIE
                        Hello. What the fuck might you be? 

                                 AVA
                        What’s going on? What’s it to you?

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s my job to know everyone, 
                        especially a little snack pack 
                        senior transfer like yourself. 
                        Ollie St. John, editor of the 
                        Harrington Herald.

           Ollie offers out his hand. Ava eyes it, considering, before 
           grabbing it to shake.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        So you met our reigning Queen, 
                        Harper West. Like what you saw?

                                 AVA
                        She seems really... nice. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Of course she seems nice, she’s 
                        popular. When you’re near popular 
                        people the sun shines on your face 
                        and you feel thankful. Unless you 
                        are human sunblock like me.

                                 AVA
                        My mom says popularity is a mirage.

                                 OLLIE
                        Your mom must be a loser. But that 
                        doesn’t mean you have to be. Where 
                        are you from? 

                                 AVA
                        Small town in Utah. This is my 
                        first real high school. 

           The gears in Ollie’s brain start churning. He paces.

                                 OLLIE
                        One stop past Nowheresville. Strong

                        walked out of the cornfield. 
                             (off Ava’s face)
                        No, it’s cute. For a bit. Then it 
                        becomes your identity.

                        You need to use it like a 
                        trampoline to launch yourself into 
                        society, then shed this Norma Rae 
                        act like a streaker drops a trench 
                        coat. With your clean record and 
                        ingenue energy, you have a chance 
                        to be snatched up by the beautiful 
                        people. But you’ll need my help. 

           Ava studies Ollie a moment. The bell rings. But they stay. 

                                 AVA
                        How do you know I even want that?

                                 OLLIE
                        Please. I saw the look you served 
                        Harper in the front office. You 
                        want to be just like her. That’s 
                        where I come in. I’ll make 
                        introductions and write you up in 
                        my column like you’re an unreleased 
                        Barbra Streisand song.

           Ava lets a smile slip out. The noise level outside rises as 
           students flood the halls.

                                 AVA
                        And what do you want in return?

                                 OLLIE
                        Bring me along. Invite me to 
                        parties, include me at lunch, 
                        normalize me.

                                 AVA
                        Why do you need me? 

                                 OLLIE
                        I’m damaged goods too proud to make 
                        myself over. So I won’t. I’ll make 
                        you over and bring myself along. 
                        Consider me your platonic Svengali. 
                        So I guess the question is, do you 
                        want to spend the last four months 
                        of high school at the bottom of the 
                        food chain or do you want to spend 
                        them on Harper’s right hand? 

           Ava considers for a beat. The noise quiets down outside. 
           Students are back in class.

                                 AVA
                        When do we start?
                                 OLLIE
                        Tomorrow. How’s your soprano? 

           Ollie snatches Ava’s flyer and holds it out in front of her: 
           Unsinkable Molly Brown Auditions.

           INT. WEST HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Harper picks at her food. Susan tries to break the silence.  

                                 SUSAN
                        So, auditions tomorrow. Break a 
                        leg? Yours or the competition’s?

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t have competition, Bertie’s 
                        casting me if I like it or not. 

                                 DEAN
                        Great! You should mention it in 
                        your phone interview. 

           Harper groans and drops her head down on the table. 

                                 HARPER
                        Who were the most popular girls in 
                        your high schools? 

           Susan and Dean are both taken aback by the question. 

                                 SUSAN
                        And why do you assume it wasn’t me? 

           Harper pops up, relieved.

                                 HARPER
                        It was you?

                                 SUSAN
                        No! Allyson Moorehead. She ran for 
                        Class President under the slogan 
                        “Ask for Moorehead and ye shall 
                        receive.” She spanked me in the 
                        polls. But I got the last laugh. 
                        She dropped out of college, coached 
                        Cheer at our high school and lived 
                        in her parent’s basement until they 
                        died and I got to personally 
                        foreclose on her house.

           Harper looks shook. Dean notices. 
                                 DEAN
                        Some people like high school too 
                        much. Similar thing happened to my 
                        school’s queen bee. Except she went 
                        to college, got married, had two 
                        kids, whole shebang. But ultimately 
                        she was dissatisfied. Spent her 
                        life dreaming of her glory days.

                                 HARPER
                        It said all of that in the alumni 
                        newsletter? 

                                 DEAN
                        No, her obituary! She put rocks in 
                        her pocket Virginia Woolf style and 
                        walked into the ocean on the beach 
                        where she used to lifeguard.

                                 HARPER
                             (after a long beat)
                        ...Can I be excused? 

           Harper leaves the room. Susan and Dean look at each other.

                                 DEAN 
                        Why do I feel like I just gave my 
                        kid a complex? 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harper flops on her bed. Harper’s room is that of a truly 
           loved child. Photos clutter the walls: Harper with her 
           parents, with April and eventually Bertie, with Diego. 
           Homecoming sashes and a Columbia pennant surround her Cappie 
           awards for excellence in high school theater. 

           But Harper isn’t looking at any of that. All Harper is 
           looking at is the ceiling, staring into the void.

                                 SR. SULLIVAN (PRE-LAP)
                        Look around you. Soon all of this 
                        will be gone. 

           INT. YEARBOOK - DAY

           Señor Sullivan stands at the front of the class, which is 
           actually just a half-dozen SENIOR GIRLS including Harper.
                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        All you’ll be left with is memories. 
                        Of friends, classes, teachers, and 
                        most importantly yourself. 

           Sullivan clicks on a projector. A photo of a late 90’s teen 
           boy shoots onto the wall. Bleached tips. Puka shell necklace. 
           It’s Sullivan’s high school yearbook picture. Underneath is 
           the quote: “I don’t care if it’s the blue pill or the red 
           pill, I just hope she’s on the pill!” 

           The whole class grimaces but Sullivan doesn’t notice.

                                 SR. SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
                        I look up there and say, who is 
                        that adorable hunk? 
                             (whispering, secretively)
                        It’s me! 

           Sullivan gazes admiringly at his younger self for a moment. 

                                 SR. SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
                        Without my high school yearbook I 
                        might have forgotten my sweet duds 
                        or my long eyelashes or killer 
                        sense of humor. Because a yearbook 
                        is a time capsule. 
                             (letting this wisdom drop)
                        This class is about preserving who 
                        you are now. Because who knows who 
                        you’ll be next year? 

           Something catches Harper’s eye in the hallway, it’s Diego. He 
           waves his hall pass and winks. Harper understands. So does 
           the rest of the class that just watched this interaction. 

           DARRAH JAY and MIWA TAKAHARA, the type of scary art girls who 
           watch Lars Van Trier movies for fun, scoff in unison.

                                 HARPER
                             (raising her hand)
                        Can I go to the bathroom? 

           Sullivan holds up a reflective vest with “HALL PASS” written 
           on the back, but as Harper reaches for it, he yanks it back.

                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        I want you to come back with one 
                        detail you want to remember. It can 
                        be big or small. Describe it to us.

           Harper gives a strained smile and takes the vest. 
           INT. GIRLS’ BATHROOM - DAY 

           Harper, now in the reflective yellow vest, slams up against 
           the stall making out with Diego. 

           Out of the corner of her eye she notices her detail: the wall 
           of flyers in the bathroom, more specifically one of her faded 
           flyers: a smiling photo of Harper with the words: Harper? 
           Homecoming? Harrington High? Hell yeah! 

           Harper pulls away, deep in thought as Diego kisses her neck. 

                                 HARPER
                        I might shave my head next year.
                        Or maybe get white dreads...

                                 DIEGO
                        Great, babe.

                                 HARPER
                        So you’d like me bald?

           Diego’s turn to pull away. 

                                 DIEGO
                        What? No! Do you have alopecia?

                                 HARPER
                        Why? Would you be repulsed by me? 
                        You’re really shallow, Diego.

           Harper is looking for a fight. Diego starts pacing. 

                                 DIEGO
                        Why are you doing this? I have my 
                        game against Davis later. I need 
                        confidence! Not... headfuckery! 

                                 HARPER
                        What about me? I have my Columbia 
                        call today and do you know what I’m 
                        excited for next year? Nothing!

           Diego softens and goes to comfort her. 

                                 DIEGO
                        But Columbia is your first choice! 

                                 HARPER
                        I mean, yeah, like in the abstract. 
                        Like how I talk about getting a 
                        septum piercing. It’s fun to 
                        imagine but I don’t actually want 
                        to do it. I like how I am. 
           Diego is truly not following. Harper sighs. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You’re a Junior, you don’t 
                        understand. 

                                 DIEGO
                        Calm down, you’re going to do 
                        great. You’re Harper West.

                                 HARPER
                        Exactly! But who will I be next 
                        year? Just some washed up Prom 
                        Queen you’ll dump for Harper West 
                        2.0.! Chloe McDonald’s pretty cute.

           Diego grabs Harper’s hands reassuringly. 

                                 DIEGO
                        I can’t wait until we’re just two 
                        dirty college kids together, eating 
                        midnight breakfast.

           Harper yanks her hands away. 

                                 HARPER
                        What is it with you and midnight 
                        breakfast! Eat eggs in the dark and 
                        save the tuition! 

                                 DIEGO
                        You’re being crazy, Harper!

           Diego pushes past Harper. Harper freezes, allowing this to 
           ring in her ears. The ringing morphs into...

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - DAY 

           ...the dulcet tones of “ZIP ZAP ZOP!”, floating out the door 
           to where Ava nervously watches with Ollie over her shoulder. 

                                 AVA
                        What if I’m not good enough?

                                 OLLIE
                        Join stage crew, I don’t care. Just 
                        get in there and get collected. 

                                 AVA
                        What about you? 
                                 OLLIE
                        They can’t see us together yet. I’m 
                        social poison.

                                 AVA
                        Do you really believe that? 

           Ollie is touched by Ava’s sincerity. Then shakes it off. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I’ve made my bed and I sleep like a 
                        baby. But I’ll sleep even better 
                        once we’re popular. Just remember: 
                        be whatever Harper West needs. 

           Ollie scoots Ava in the door. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           THEATER KIDS sit in a wooden LIFEBOAT on stage. April sits in 
           the middle holding a script, reading for Molly. The EXTRAS in 
           the lifeboat audition for Bertie, sitting front and center.

                                                          KID 2
           We’re going to sink! 
                                              We’re going to die! 

                                 APRIL
                             (completely dispassionate)
                        I won’t die because I’ve barely 
                        begun to live.

                                 BERTIE
                        April, everyone’s audition depends 
                        on each other. Some energy, please! 

                                 APRIL
                        I’m not auditioning. I’m helping. 
                        Be grateful for what you can get! 

           Just then Harper hustles down the aisle, extremely flustered. 

                                 HARPER
                        Boy problems! Sorry I’m late! 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 

           Harper grabs a blanket to drape herself in when her phone 
           buzzes: Reminder: 15 Minutes: Columbia Interview!!!  

           Harper throws her phone at the couch in a tantrum. She paces.
                                 AVA (O.S.)
                        You dropped this.

           Harper jumps, regains her composure. Ava holds up her phone. 

                                 HARPER
                        More like spiked it. Thanks.

                                 AVA
                        Is... something wrong? 

                                 HARPER
                        Besides everything? I’m late to 
                        Bertie’s auditions, Diego’s mad at 
                        me, and I’m getting pit stains from 
                        stress over this stupid Columbia 
                        interview--

           Ava offers a box of tissues, which Harper grabs, stuffing a 
           few under each armpit. She calms down a bit. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        And to cap it all off, I’m totally 
                        ranting to a stranger. I’m sorry--

                                 AVA
                        I’m freaking out too. Second 
                        semester senior year at my first 
                        real high school. What could go 
                        wrong? I’m Ava. 

           Harper looks at Ava thoughtfully, considering. 

                                 BERTIE (O.S.)
                        Harper, get your butt into this 
                        lifeboat and tell all these first 
                        class bitches it’ll be okay! 

           Harper gives Ava an apologetic smile and hustles on stage. 

           Ava writes her name on the Stage Crew sign up when she 
           realizes she’s still holding Harper’s phone. 

                                 AVA
                        Harper you--! 

           Harper can’t hear her, she’s up on stage talking to Bertie. 

           Suddenly the phone rings. Unknown number. Ava thinks fast. 

           Ava LaMonte answers the phone. 
                                 KELLY FROM COLUMBIA (V.O.)
                        Harper? This is Kelly, calling from 
                        Columbia University. I know I’m a 
                        little early, is this a good time? 

           Ava takes a long beat, staring at Harper on the stage. 

                                 AVA
                        ...Yes, this is Harper. 

           Ava mouths “holy shit” to herself. Takes a deep breath. 

           Then she turns it the fuck on. 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        This is a great time. So nice to 
                        finally get to talk to you. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        This is where you might ask, what 
                        the Hell-en Hunt is happening here? 
                        Well, fortune favors the bold and 
                        it turns out Ava LaMonte is the 
                        boldest motherfucker around.

                                 AVA
                        Will you give me a minute to find a 
                        quiet space to talk? 

           Ava hits the MUTE BUTTON and--

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           --rushes out of the stage door to a waiting Ollie. 

                                 AVA
                        It’s Harper’s college interview. I 
                        need you as my inside man if she 
                        tries to stump me. Can you help me?

           Ollie is taken all the way back by Ava’s sudden intensity. 
           But his face contorts itself into a grin. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Because a simpleton might sabotage 
                        their rival, but to succeed on 
                        their behalf? Honey, that’s 
                        intolerable cruelty.  

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - BACKSTAGE - LATER

           Harper panics. She flips couch cushions for her phone.  
                                 HARPER
                        Does anyone know where my phone is? 

           Ava comes running back into the theater. 

                                 AVA
                        Harper! Can I talk to you--

                                 HARPER
                        I have an interview in 5 minutes 
                        and I can’t find my phone--

                                 AVA
                        It’s about the interview.

           Ava is back to her Little Bo-Peep schtick. Ava holds up 
           Harper’s phone.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        I kind of sort of... did your 
                        interview for you. 

           Ava smiles innocently. Harper goes white with anger. 

                                 HARPER
                        You... 

                                 AVA
                        I know, I know, I’m sorry, I 
                        obviously shouldn’t have done it, 
                        but it went really well! 

                          HARPER
           Who the fuck-- 
                                                      AVA (CONT'D)
                                              Your dad talked you up so I 
                                              barely did anything--

                          HARPER
                                                      AVA (CONT'D)
           Holy shit.
                                              But you’re right, I’m so 
                                              sorry, it was crazy of me. 
                                              I’ll call the school and 
                                              apologize! 

           A long beat. Suddenly, a TEXT DING. Harper looks down: 

           DAD: JUST GOT AN EXTREMELY ENTHUSIASTIC CALL FROM KELLY AT 
           COLUMBIA. YOU NAILED IT! LOVE YOU! 

           Harper looks back up at Ava, who is braced for the worst. 

                                 HARPER
                        Apologize?! Ava! You’re my angel! 

           Harper grabs Ava in a bear hug. Ava beams.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        We have to celebrate! What are you 
                        doing Friday? You should come to 
                        the bonfire! 

           EXT. WOODS - BONFIRE - NIGHT

           A huge bonfire illuminates a clearing next to a stream.

           It also illuminates a ton of DRUNK TEENS partying their faces 
           off despite the cold weather. Teens are invincible! 

           Bottles and cans litter the ground as shitty house music 
           blasts into the trees. Tovah frantically cleans up trash.

                                 TOVAH
                        Come on guys, partying is cool but 
                        littering is not! 

           Just as she says it Jerry Riggs throws a liquor bottle into 
           the fire, shattering and causing a small explosion.

                                 TOVAH (CONT’D)
                        Stop! Drop! Roll! 

           Tovah instantly stop-drop-and-rolls. No one else does.

                                 JERRY
                        Best Ya Ever Seen! Seniors 2019!

           INT. ANCIENT VOLVO STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           Ollie white-knuckles the wheel as he drives slowly down a 
           dirt road. He sees the small explosion through the trees.

                                 OLLIE
                        I don’t think this is a good idea.

           Next to him sits Ava, girlishly primping herself in the 
           mirror, with more confidence than we’ve seen from her. 

                                 AVA
                        You wanted a party. Here’s a party.

           Ollie parks the car, revealing the scene.

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s too soon. If they see you with 
                        me they’ll think you’re my spy--
                                 AVA
                        No, they’ll think I’m-- 
                             (putting on a voice)
                        A simple new girl from Utah who 
                        just met a nice gay boy. 

           Ollie looks impressed if a little taken aback. 

           EXT. WOODS - BONFIRE - CONTINUOUS

           Harper stands at the beer-pong table across from Bertie, 
           whose hands are behind her back. April stands behind Bertie, 
           her arms fed through Bertie’s, playing and gesturing for her. 

                                 BERTIE
                        Are you sure you didn’t do the 
                        interview in a disassociated state? 
                        Maybe “Ava” is your Tyler Durden.

           April takes a shot for Bertie, not even hitting the table. 

                                 HARPER
                        For the last time, Bertie. I’ve 
                        made out in Fight Club six times 
                        and have never seen the movie. 

           Harper takes a shot, sinking it.

           ACROSS THE PARTY - Ollie takes a deep breath before he takes 
           Ava’s hand and leads her through the social scene, weaving 
           through the crowd and pointing out notables.

                                 OLLIE
                        Okay Utah, listen up. There’s a 
                        hierarchy to teen royalty and to 
                        infiltrate the high court you need 
                        to understand how it functions. 
                        Lucky for you, I’m a first-rate 
                        guide to who’s who in this cast and 
                        crew. Starting with Tiffany Beaver, 
                        at your twelve o’clock. 

           Above the crowd rises a horizontal TIFFANY BEAVER, currently 
           being bench pressed by a BRO. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Cheer Captain Beta Bitch who might 
                        have had a shot at Alpha if not for 
                        Rhonda Ross who dropped her on a 
                        simple basket-toss dismount at 
                        first cheer of freshman year. Don’t 
                        worry, her teeth broke her fall. 
           Tiffany smiles. Her teeth are gnarly. Some real British shit. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        If Harper ever gets pushed down the 
                        stairs, that’s the smile that did 
                        it. But snaggled or not, Beaver 
                        holds onto her power via put-downs 
                        and hook-ups. Her office is the 
                        sports shed and she has a bi-weekly 
                        meeting with sports hottie co-
                        chair, Christian Katz.

           Christian Katz dizzy-bats with his lacrosse stick, bongs a 
           beer, and rips a bong of weed. He immediately throws up.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Christian’s a lacrosse prodigy, 
                        whatever that means. He sports a 
                        1.4 GPA, 2.5 STD’s and has a secret 
                        thing for future gallery girls, 
                        which they do not reciprocate.

           Christian cradles a beer can in his lax stick as he saunters 
           over to Darrah and Miwa, who smoke cloves and drink PBR.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I thought you told me to send you a 
                        dick pic! 

                                 DARRAH
                        She told you to send her a diptych--

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        That is... confusing on purpose! 

                                 OLLIE
                        No politician would dare cut arts 
                        funding if they met Darrah Jay and 
                        Miwa Takahara. If their dripping 
                        condescension doesn’t turn you to 
                        stone, they’ll make you wish it did 
                        once they start on the merits of 
                        Vorticism.

           Darrah laughs and blows a puff of smoke into Christian’s face.

                                 TOVAH
                        No smoking in the woods! Are you

           Tovah rushes over and stamps out their cigarettes.

                        Tovah Silverstein, who you’ve met. 
                        President of Student Government, 
                        Valedictorian, and shoe-in for Most 
                        Likely to Be Stressed. But her hand 
                        in school politics gets her a seat 
                        at the table of small council 
                        members, who all ultimately bow to 
                        our Iron Throne. Harper West. 

           The crowd parts revealing Harper: poised and beautiful. Ollie 
           stares in admiration. Ava turns to Ollie.

                                 AVA
                        But what about you? 

                                 OLLIE
                        What about me? 

                                 AVA
                        Where do you belong? 

           Ava looks positively luminous in the light of the bonfire. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I...

           Harper spots them.

                                 HARPER
                        Ava! Over here!
                             (to Bertie and April)
                        See?

                                 BERTIE
                        I see Ollie St. John on her arm. 
                        You sure that interview went well? 

                                 HARPER
                        She’s new, she doesn’t know better. 

           Harper walks over and greets Ava with a big hug. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Hey girl! Thanks for coming.

                                 AVA
                        This place is great! Oh do you know 
                        Ollie? He writes for the paper. 

           Harper and Ollie share terse, mutually distasteful smiles. 
                                 HARPER
                        Ollie. Here to confirm whether I 
                        really chase vodka with Cheez Whiz?  

                                 OLLIE
                        Please, you have cheddar written 
                        all over you. But alas, no. Tonight 
                        is off the record. I... just want 
                        to be included. 

           Ollie chokes that out. Harper studies him, suspicious. Then--

                                 HARPER
                        Off the record: I did... just once. 
                        With Pepper Jack. 

           Ollie smiles. Harper is allowing him to stay. He lets himself 
           recede into the crowd. Harper leads Ava to April and Bertie.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ava, this is April Egan, she’s... 
                        trying a thing. 

                                 APRIL
                        For the very last time, it’s not a 
                        phase. This is the real me! 

           Bertie finds this cute and pathetic. She kisses April. 

                                 HARPER
                        And this is Bertie Cruz.

                                 BERTIE
                        Short for Liberty. It was 2002. My 
                        mom was stressed, pregnant and 
                        eating Freedom Fries.

                                 HARPER
                        Bertie is America’s favorite soft-
                        butch theater director and the 
                        Carol to April’s Therese. 

                                 AVA
                        ...What does that mean?

                                 BERTIE
                        It means April used to date Caleb 
                        Decker before entering the Ruby 
                        Fruit Jungle. 

           Bertie points to CALEB DECKER, a true Lax Bro currently 
           holding up a whole pizza, folded in half as a funnel, into 
           his mouth. Christian Katz pours two beers down the pizza. 
                                 LAX TEAM
                        Pizza Luge! Pizza Luge! 

                                 DIEGO
                        Guys! Pizza is Italian! You need a 
                        nice Lambrusco!

           Diego pours a bottle of wine down the luge, causing Caleb to 
           quickly start vomiting. The bros all laugh. 

                                 HARPER
                        Ugh, I should just go gay too.

                                 APRIL
                             (aside to Ava)
                        That’s Diego. Him and Harper are 
                        kind of on the rocks right now. 

           Harper angrily finishes her drink. 

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t even get another drink 
                        without entering Lax Land! 

                                 AVA
                        I’ll get it! 

           Ava dashes off towards the mountain of alcohol.

                                 BERTIE
                        She’s eager. 

           Ava walks up to the tower of bottles and 30 racks against a 
           tree. She grabs a bottle randomly, about to pour it when--

                                 DIEGO
                        I would not do that if I were you.

           Diego grabs the half-empty bottle from a startled Ava. Ava 
           stares at Diego’s dreamy lips until they form words--

                                 DIEGO (CONT’D)
                        Wasabi Vodka. Kevin Tang brings it 
                        to every party since freshman year. 
                        It sets your sinuses on fire.

           Ava laughs girlishly as Diego winks and walks away. Ollie 
           appears, holding up a bottle of 99 Peaches.

                                 OLLIE
                        Harper drinks 99 Peaches straight. 
                        So now you do too. 
           Ava grabs the 99 Peaches when suddenly, POLICE SIRENS. Lights 
           flash in the trees as Ava hurries back to the group.  

                                 HARPER
                             (calmly)
                        Time to go.
                             (off Ava’s face)
                        It’ll take them at least 20 minutes 
                        to find the turn for this place. 
                        It’s the perfect party spot. 

           Harper, Ava, April and Bertie start towards the parking lot. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Are you catching a ride with Ollie?

           Ava looks over Harper’s shoulder directly at Ollie.

                                 AVA
                        Um... I think he left. 
                                   (innocent)
                        I hope my parents don’t freak...
                        Maybe I can sneak in the back. 

                                 HARPER
                        Wait, is this your first party? You 
                        can totally crash at my place.

                                 AVA
                        Is that cool with your parents?

           INT. WEST HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dean and Susan curl up on the couch watching a conveyer belt 
           of jewels slowly rotate on The Home Jewelry Network. 

                                 ANNOUNCER ON TV
                        Call in the next minute and all of 
                        these diamonds are only $79.99! 

                                 DEAN
                        I have to call. What a deal! 

           In the other room the door opens, some giggles. Harper and 
           Ava are clearly trying to be quiet. But failing miserably. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Harper! Dad’s trying to blow your 
                        college tuition on blood diamonds!

           Harper walks in, followed by Ava. Harper puts on a Mom voice.
                                 HARPER
                        Susan West, it is one-thirty in the 
                        morning. What are you doing up?

                                 SUSAN
                             (playing along)
                        Oh no are you going to tell my mom?

           Harper frowns, dropping the act.

                                 HARPER
                        Mom, grandma just died.

                                 SUSAN
                        Then I guess I’m off the hook.

           Susan and Dean high five. This whole interaction is so 
           foreign to Ava, she drinks it in.

                                 DEAN
                        You however smell of... dare I say 
                        alcohols? Let’s call your 
                        punishment cleaning the bathroom. 
                        And family din-din. 

           Harper rolls her eyes playfully and leads Ava out of the room. 

                                 SUSAN
                        Good night Harper and Harper’s friend 
                        who we will one day meet sober! 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Harper flops on the bed. Ava studies the room admiringly. 

                                 AVA
                        Your parents are... so cool. 

                                 HARPER
                        I know. I’ve had zero things to 
                        rebel against... which is a totally 
                        lame thing to complain about.

                                 AVA
                        No, everyone has their own stuff.

                                 HARPER
                        Lately it feels like my stuff’s 
                        been escalating into a tornado. And 
                        I’m that cow in Twister that’s 
                        going to splatter on a windshield.
           Harper sees Ava looking at a picture of her and Diego. Harper 
           flops back into her pillow. She’s Drunk Monologuing. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I just keep thinking all of this 
                        will go away next year. Like 
                        nothing will ever be as good as it 
                        is right now, like I’ll never be as 
                        good. And I keep daring Diego to 
                        prove me right... you think I’m 
                        crazy. Everyone else does.

           Ava perches next to Harper on the bed, and gazes at her 
           compassionately... almost lovingly. 

                                 AVA
                        I think you’re human. And Diego is 
                        too. He’ll understand. 

                                 HARPER
                        I tried to talk to April about it 
                        but she’s so hyped on Bertie and 
                        college... you’re a really calming 
                        presence, Ava. 

           Harper and Ava smile at each other. Harper is drunk. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if it’s the future or 
                        all 99 of those Peaches but... 

           Harper runs into the bathroom and starts vomiting. Ava 
           dutifully holds Harper’s hair back as she pukes.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        The puke hair hold. Friendship 101. 
                        A second to learn, a lifetime to 
                        master. Because it’s so much more 
                        than keeping yesterday’s enchiladas 
                        out of those ombre’d locks. It’s 
                        about support. Trust. The favorite 
                        saying of hot girls everywhere: if 
                        you can’t handle me at my worst, 
                        you don’t deserve me at my 
                        marginally better. 

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY 

           Harper’s car pulls up and out hops both Harper and Ava, to 
           the surprise of April and Bertie, but they shrug it off.
                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I imagined I would be spending the 
                        semester coaching some yokel in the 
                        mores of high school society but 
                        this one came ready made. And I 
                        immediately reaped the benefits.

           Ollie watches across the parking lot with a devious smile.

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH CAFETERIA - DIFFERENT DAY

           Harper, Ava, April and Bertie eat lunch together. Harper 
           applies lipstick on Ava. Ava waves over Ollie. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Days after the bonfire, Ava invited 
                        me to the royal round table.

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH CAFETERIA - DIFFERENT DAY

           Ollie sits next to a lightly annoyed Bertie. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        By the following week, I no longer 
                        had to ask permission.

           On the other side of the table, Ava squeezes in between 
           Harper and April, who doesn’t like being pushed aside. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR HALLWAY - DAY

           Harper walks down the hall in her usual fashion, all eyes on 
           her. Except for the few eyes that wander next to her... to 
           Ava. Who isn’t wearing glasses anymore. She looks... hot! 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        With the help of contacts and 
                        yellow journalism, PR was up.

           Ollie watches as students read the Harrington Underground. 

           Splashed across the front page is a picture of Ava with the 
           headline “Southwestern Heatwave: Global Warming? Or 
           Harrington’s Newest Hottie?”. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - DIFFERENT DAY

           Harper sits in the lifeboat with OTHER ACTORS. Ava fixes 
           Harper’s hair, takes away her script, and scurries off stage.
                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Even Harper was in a better mood. 
                        Because Ava’s all-consuming 
                        attention quelled Harper’s fears 
                        while also making her feel like 
                        high school would never end. Even 
                        if her pussy posse didn’t always 
                        love their newfound member. 

           The scene begins. A tense Bertie watches next to April, who 
           stares disdainfully at Ava, mouthing the lines in the wings. 

                                 HARPER
                        And that’s what I got, hope! For 
                        some place better, some place 
                        cleaner, and hell, if I gotta eat 
                        catfish heads all my life... I’d... 
                             (breaking character)
                        I don’t know, kill myself?

                                 BERTIE
                        Cut! Harper! Did you read the 
                        script at all? 

                                 HARPER
                        I watched the movie? Well part of 
                        it. Then I just watched Titanic. 
                        I’m sorry, Bertie.

                                 BERTIE
                        Sorry isn’t getting me into 
                        Julliard. Sorry isn’t allowing NYU 
                        to bleed my parents dry. We open in 
                        two weeks! Get it together! 

           Ava hustles back on stage with a script to show Harper. 

                                 BERTIE (CONT’D)
                        Ava! Stage Crew is Papier-mâché-ing 
                        the iceberg in the gym right now. 

                                 HARPER
                        She’s helping me.

                                 BERTIE
                        I’m sorry, I forgot you had an 
                        assistant! And were suddenly too 
                        famous to learn your lines! 
           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - GREENROOM - LATER 

           Ava removes Harper’s make-up in front of a vanity mirror. 
           Folded up on the table is another Harrington Herald and 
           another front page picture of Ava LaMonte.

                                 HARPER
                        Can’t she see I’m trying?! I have a 
                        lot on my plate right now! 

                                 AVA 
                        Don’t worry, I’ll help you run 
                        lines. It’ll be fun. 

           Harper smiles thankfully at Ava in the mirror. Ava gazes back 
           with pure love and devotion. 

                                 TOVAH (PRE-LAP)
                        I love you!

           INT. HOME EC - DAY 

           An extreme close-up of Tovah’s angry face. 

                                 TOVAH
                        But you don’t appreciate me! 

           Extreme close-up of Harper, a little uncomfortable.

                                 HARPER
                        I had a long day at work and--

                                 TOVAH
                        What do you think I do all day? Sit 
                        on my ass? I have dreams too, you 
                        know! I’m not just here to support 
                        you! I made a five course dinner 
                        and all you wanted was a beer! 

           Tovah fights back tears, channeling some real emotion here. 
           Harper is at loss, this got real real, real fast.

                                 DR. V
                        Time out! 

           Dr. V steps in, this is an exercise in front of the class.

                                 DR. V (CONT’D)
                        Love the energy, Tovah. But Harper, 
                        I asked for a productive spousal 
                        fight! Not some namby-pamby 
                        bullshit about how you work harder. 
                        Tovah bore your children! 
           Tovah gently rocks a bag of flour with a martyred expression. 
           Dr. V takes Harper aside. 

                                 DR. V (CONT’D)
                        You’re defensive. You want Tovah to 
                        forgive you but you’re not explaining 
                        yourself. You need to think about her. 
                             (to the class)
                        Communication people! Again! 

           Tovah and Harper reset, then--

                                 TOVAH
                        I dropped out of medical school to 
                        raise Harper Jr.!

                                 HARPER
                        I’m sorry, Tovah. I put my bad day 
                        on you, which wasn’t fair.

           Harper glances at Dr. V, who nods encouragingly. Go on.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been taking support without 
                        giving it. We should use my 
                        Christmas bonus for childcare so 
                        you can go back to school...?

           Dr. V leads the whole class in a round of applause. Tovah 
           runs into Harper’s arms, crying on her shoulder. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR LOCKER HALLWAY - DAY

           Harper walks down the hall with April, Bertie and Ava. April 
           struggles to balance her books and read Harper’s palm.

                                 APRIL
                        Okay so this is your heart line. 
                        It’s kind of squiggly, which either 
                        means you have a complicated love 
                        life... or a heart murmur?

           April checks her guide book. Harper sees Diego at his locker. 
           He makes eye contact with her then scurries down the hall.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m going to talk to him. Today. 
                        I’m going to lay it all out on the 
                        table and apologize. 

                                 AVA
                        Won’t that ruin his--
                                 HARPER
                        I don’t care about his game. This 
                        is more important. 

                                 AVA
                        But it’ll stress him out on his--

                                 HARPER
                             (snapping a bit)
                        This is between me and my boyfriend 
                        so maybe just stay out of it, Ava. 

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH LACROSSE FIELD - DAY

           Harper walks up to the lacrosse field, determined.

                                 HARPER
                             (to herself)
                        Diego, I’ve put my stress on you...

           She sees Diego sitting on the bleachers, and hustles over.

                                 DIEGO
                        You wanted to talk?

                                 HARPER
                        Diego! Hey so... I’ve been really 
                        worked up about next year and...

           Diego rolls his eyes. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What!? I’m apologizing! I’ve been 
                        totally in my head lately--

                                 DIEGO
                        Seriously, Harper? Why can’t today 
                        just be about me? 

           Suddenly a CYMBAL CRASH. The MARCHING BAND stomps out onto 
           the field playing a jazzy HAPPY BIRTHDAY. A confused Harper 
           looks around to see whose birthday it is.

           Then ENTIRE LAX TEAM bursts out of the dugout, in cheerleader 
           uniforms and full makeup. They look ridiculous, but great. 

                                 CHRISTIAN KATZ
                        Give me a D! 

           The whole team cups their junk and screams--

                                 TEAM
                        D!
           Harper freezes. She looks at Diego, who smiles ear to ear. 

                                 CHRISTIAN KATZ
                        Give me an I!

           The team starts FLOSSING or whatever kids do these days, 
           continuing their “DIEGO” cheer. Harper starts sweating.

                                 HARPER
                        Listen, Diego--

           But Diego isn’t listening, he’s lapping this up! Harper takes 
           a deep breath. The team finishes the cheer--

                                 THE TEAM
                        Happy Birthday Diego! Love, Harper!

           Harper’s jaw drops. Me?

                                 DIEGO
                        Babe! I thought you forgot! 

           Harper tries to play it off. 

                                 HARPER
                        ...Surprise? 

                                 DIEGO
                        I keep thinking you’re being 
                        selfish but you’re just stressed 
                        and I haven’t been there for you. 

                                 HARPER
                        I... just didn’t know how to say 
                        sorry. 

           Diego pulls her into a crushing hug. On the other side of the 
           embrace Harper notices Ava sitting in the dugout next to 
           Ollie. Ava gives Harper a thumbs up. What the fuck?

           INT./EXT. DUGOUT/LACROSSE FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Ava and Ollie huddle on the bench. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Getting Christian Katz in drag was 
                        almost too easy. I knew there was 
                        some curiosity there. 

           But Ava isn’t listening, she stares intensely at Harper.
                                 AVA
                        She told me to stay out of it. Me! 
                        Harper hasn’t talked to Diego in 
                        weeks and picks today of all days to 
                        apologize? She’d be lost without me. 

           Ollie side-eyes Ava, studying her.

                                 OLLIE
                        Maybe we’ve been thinking too 
                        small. Popular adjacent is nice but 
                        know what’s nicer? Prom Queen.  

           Ava lets that sink in. Ollie gets up to leave. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Keep up the good work, killer. 

           Ollie slips out just as Harper rushes into the dugout. Ava 
           gives an innocent smile, but Harper looks perturbed. 

                                 AVA
                        Surprise! Did he like it? 

                                 HARPER
                        What? Yeah, he did. 

                                 AVA
                        Apologizing on his birthday was a 
                        great idea! I’m sure you got him 
                        something incredible but I just 
                        wanted to help. 

           Ava smiles as Harper’s guilt sets in.

                                 HARPER
                        ... Thanks. I think. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - GREENROOM - DAY

           A sign on the door reads: DRESS REHEARSALS TOMORROW!  

           Harper, decked out in a turn of the century gown, appraises 
           herself in front of a mirror as a tense April hems her dress. 

                                 HARPER
                        Is it a little long in the back? 

           April accidentally pricks Harper with the needle. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ow! Watch it! 
                                 APRIL
                        Just get Ava to do it. 

           April puts down the sewing kit. Harper has struck a nerve. 
           Bertie walks in, flipping through the script.

                                 HARPER
                        Does Ava seem a little off to you? 

                                 APRIL
                        You’re the one keeping her around. 

                                 HARPER
                        No, she’s great just... The whole 
                        birthday thing--

                                 BERTIE
                        Saved your ass. Look, we’ve been 
                        over this, Ava’s weird. She’s got 
                        that creepy home-schooled vibe and 
                        I don’t know if she wants to have 
                        your babies or wear your skin as a 
                        coat. But as long as you know your 
                        lines, I don’t care. 

                                 HARPER
                        I know I forgot Diego’s birthday, 
                        but why didn’t she just tell me? 

                                 APRIL
                        I don’t want to talk about her 
                        anymore. Let’s talk cast party. 

                                 AVA (O.S.)
                        There’s a cast party? 

           Ava walks out of the wings, how long has she been there? 
           Harper, April and Bertie exchange a look. Harper resets.

                                 HARPER
                        Tracy Liman’s parents used to throw 
                        a rager. They were “if you’re going 
                        to drink, do it here” parents. 

                                 BERTIE
                        But Tracy graduated last year. 

                                 APRIL
                        We could have it at my step-mom’s 
                        but we’d have to pay the Betty tax.
                                 HARPER
                             (to Ava)
                        She lets us throw parties but only 
                        if she gets to attend. And the 
                        woman gets sloppy. 

                                 BERTIE
                        We can always just do midnight IHOP 
                        and spike the coffee.

                                 HARPER
                        I did not learn 100 pages of period 
                        gibberish for dollar pancakes and 
                        burnt coffee with Kahlua. 

           Ava’s gears turn as she takes over hemming Harper’s dress.  

           INT. WEST HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Harper walks in and drops her backpack when Dean and Susan 
           rush in, catching Harper in a bear hug and a kiss sandwich. 

                                 HARPER
                        Wow, honestly, I needed this! 

                                 DEAN
                        And we needed this! 

           Dean holds up an overnight bag. 

                                 SUSAN 
                        You remembered our anniversary. 

                                 DEAN
                        This means a lot sweetie.

           Harper is extremely confused. 

                                 SUSAN
                        We’ll miss opening night but we’ll 
                        be back for the Cappie show. 

           A knock on the door. Ava walks in, this is clearly routine.

                                 AVA
                        I thought I heard celebrating! 
                        Happy Anniversary!

           Harper gapes as if she’s seeing Ava for the first time. 
                                 DEAN
                        Wedding anniversaries are just guilt 
                        trips parents keep in their back 
                        pocket. Why would a kid remember? 

                                 SUSAN
                        But ours did. We’re going to miss 
                        you so much next year but we are so 
                        proud of the woman you’ve become. 

           Susan carries bags to the other room. Dean whips out two 
           tickets to The Great Wolf Lodge. 

                                 DEAN
                        Now excuse us. We have an early 
                        morning. I didn’t know there was a 
                        Great Wolf Lodge in Utica but I’ll 
                        be damned if I get stuck in a long 
                        line for the water slide. You know, 
                        you have to grow older but you 
                        never have to grow up. 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Harper slams the door behind Ava.

                                 HARPER
                        What the fuck was that? 

                                 AVA
                        I just thought that--

                                 HARPER
                        You’d send my parents on vacation?

                                 AVA
                        You’ve just done so much for me--

           Ava steps towards Harper deliberately... suggestively? 

                                 HARPER
                        What are you doing? This crosses a 
                        line. Go tell them what you did--

           But then Harper’s phone starts buzzing. Texts flood in.

           April: You are a party angel. Skinny Girl on me. 

           Bertie: You’re an evil genius. 

           Drama Group Text: Cast Party tomorrow night at Harper’s! Bow 
           down to your Unsinkable Queen. *prayer hands emoji*
                                 AVA
                        I’m sorry, I just knew you wanted 
                        this year to be perfect. Best Ya 
                        Ever Seen! Seniors 2019! 

           Harper sits on her bed. Not sure what to say.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to run lines?

                                 HARPER
                        No! No. I think you better just 
                        go... I’ll see you tomorrow. 

                                 AVA
                        I really just wanted to help you 
                        throw the perfect cast party. 

           Ava closes the door behind her. 

           INT. JOURNALISM ROOM - NIGHT

           Ollie works late on the school paper. He pauses to look at a 
           “CAST PARTY AT HARPER’S!!” Instagram post by Ava. 

           He calls Ava. It rings and rings. She doesn’t pick up. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I should’ve realized I was losing 
                        control. That our scheme was 
                        becoming her scheme, but I was too 
                        caught up in the glamour of it all 
                        to notice. And, off the record, I 
                        was having the time of my life.

           Ollie flips around the Harrington Underground chalkboard and 
           pastes a picture of Ava in the center, right next to Harper. 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harper paces as she Facetimes with Diego, she’s freaking out.

                                 DIEGO
                        Babe, calm down-- 

                                 HARPER
                        Calm down? Diego this girl just 
                        sent my parents on vacation. She’s 
                        like an... evil travel agent! 
                                 DIEGO
                        Well... it kills two birds with one 
                        stone! We get a cast party and your 
                        parents get a vacation. 

                                 HARPER
                        Why are you taking her side? 

           Harper slams down her phone and flops on her bed, tearful. 
           She stares up at her Columbia pennant.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        For the first time Harper West looked 
                        like any other teen. Her royal glow 
                        had fully given way to paranoia, self-
                        doubt and even... a pimple.

           Harper suddenly reaches her hand to her face. A lone pimple 
           has just sprouted on her chin, as if Ollie willed it. 

           EXT. WEST HOUSE - MORNING

           Harper rushes out of her house to check the mailbox. Nothing. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        But no matter how craterous her 
                        zit, Harper’s crisis would barely 
                        make the second page. Because 
                        heading into opening weekend, there 
                        was something greater in the air. 
                        Hopes, dreams, acceptance letters. 

           Harper groans, then hops in her car and jerks away.

           INT. HOME EC - DAY

           Dr. V hands back quizzes. Tovah gets a 83%.

                                 DR. V 
                        Tovah, I’m sorry--

                                 TOVAH
                        No, you’re NOT sorry!

           Tovah stands up, crumples her quiz, and punts it. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        The blood pressure of the entire 
                        senior class was spiking harder 
                        than the first time I saw the 
                        volleyball scene in Top Gun. 
           INT. YEARBOOK - DAY

           Half-finished collages sit in front of the distracted class. 
           Everyone compulsively checks their phones, including Harper.

                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        I know everyone’s excited about the 
                        future, but this class is about the 
                        present! So if we could just--

           Darrah hops out of her seat with a shriek! 

                                 DARRAH JAY
                        YES! RISD! 

           Miwa’s face drops. She frantically refreshes her phone.

                                 MIWA
                        I need Wifi! 

           Miwa dashes out of the room, without even taking the vest. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        And long simmering tensions were 
                        bubbling to the surface. 

           Miwa stomps back into the room, right up to Darrah, angrily 
           sweeping her yearbook supplies off her desk.

                                 MIWA
                        Your bicycle was derivative trash! 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR LOCKER HALLWAY - DAY

           Harper walks down the hall by herself. She has dark circles 
           under her eyes. She looks stressed and a little paranoid.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        It would take Spencer Pratt and 
                        Heidi Montag’s entire crystal 
                        collection to neutralize the energy 
                        of the senior class this week. 

           People say hi to her, and wave, but Harper just stares 
           forward. Unable to please the masses. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - GREENROOM - DAY

           Harper bursts in only to find Ava wearing Harper’s costume. 
           This is the last goddamn straw. 
                                 HARPER
                        What the fuck is going on here? 

           Ava turns around, startled. But Bertie wanders in, nose 
           buried in some technical directions. 

                                 BERTIE
                             (nonchalant)
                        I couldn’t find you for your final 
                        fitting, and Ava pointed out that 
                        you guys are the same size.
                             (to off-screen)
                        SWEENEY! Why does the lighting 
                        schema for Belly Up To The Bar just 
                        say “house lights”? Are you daring 
                        NYU to rescind my acceptance?

           Bertie rushes back to the stage. Ava smiles and starts to 
           disrobe. Harper watches, speechless. Shook.  

                                 AVA
                        Harper? Are you okay? 

           Ava looks comically innocent. Harper doesn’t respond. 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re under a lot of stress 
                        with the play tonight, and 
                        admissions decisions this week...

                                 HARPER
                        What colleges did you apply to? 

           Without missing a beat.

                                 AVA
                        I’m going to a community college 
                        while I save money to transfer. 
                        It’s no Columbia but...

           Harper looks embarrassed, then realizes how crazy she looks.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m so sorry, I--

           That’s all Ava needed. 

                                 AVA
                        It’s okay. I’m sorry if I 
                        overstepped. I was trying to help. 
                        I’ve never had such a good friend 
                        before and I’m still... learning. 

           Harper softens, guilt sets in. She rubs her eyes.
                                 HARPER
                        I’m going crazy.

                                 AVA
                        No you’re not. You have a big 
                        night. I’ll tell the front office 
                        you’re in rehearsals all afternoon. 
                        Go to the teachers’ lounge and 
                        relax. It’s closed all day for the 
                        exterminator, but he already left.

           Ava offers Harper a pill. Harper looks skeptical.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        It’s Xanax. My mom takes them all 
                        the time. Chill out, rest up and in 
                        a few hours you’ll be ready to kick 
                        some Titanic ass.

           Harper softens, accepting the pill and water. She downs it. 

                                 HARPER
                        Thanks, Ava. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Thanks, Ava. Not quite as iconic as 
                        Et Tu, Brute? but no less foreboding--

           INT. HARRINGTON TEACHERS’ LOUNGE - DAY

           Ava was right: the door to the teachers’ lounge has an 
           exterminator’s keep-out sign. Harper pushes the door open. 
           It’s empty. She nestles into the couch and clicks on the TV 
           on a roll-away cart. Home Jewelry Network. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Roman politicians might stab each 
                        other in the back but teenage girls 
                        are partial to poison apples. 

           She sleepily watches the huge diamonds go around the conveyer 
           belt, her eyelids getting heavier with each rotation until--

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A HIVE OF ACTIVITY as the cast and crew prepare last minute.

                                 TOVAH
                        Peanut Butter! Watermelon! Peanut 
                        Butter! Watermelon!  

           Bertie paces as April makes last minute costume alterations.  
                                 APRIL
                        Bertie. It’s fine. She’ll be here.

                                 BERTIE
                        She’s just cutting it so close. 

           Bertie runs off. Diego arrives, bearing flowers. 

                                 DIEGO
                        Hey! Where’s Harper? 

                                 APRIL
                        Shh! We don’t know. Bertie is 
                        freaking out, so keep it down. 

           INT. HARRINGTON TEACHERS’ LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           Harper snoozes on the couch as diamonds and rubies float 
           across the TV with the lull of the announcer.

           Her phone lights up and buzzes: BERTIE. Adding to her phone’s 
           trillion notifications. But Harper is passed the fuck out. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           Bertie nervously watches the crowd file in. Full house. She 
           whips around to a scared April and Diego. She’s PISSED. 

                                 BERTIE
                        Curtain is up in fifteen minutes! 
                        I’m allowed to panic now! 

           Ava walks in innocently, noting everyone’s stressed faces. 

                                 AVA
                        Where’s Harper? 

                                 BERTIE
                        She’s out fucking up my future! 

                                 APRIL
                        Maybe we can push curtain? 

                                 BERTIE
                        No! The school has a curfew!!! 

                                 AVA 
                        ...I could do it. 

           Everyone turns towards Ava. 
                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been helping Harper practice 
                        her lines, I know it all. It’s 
                        crazy but... I can do it.

           Bertie looks around the room, aghast. The entire CAST AND 
           CREW watch. Including Ollie, hiding in the back. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I blessed myself. In the name of 
                        Judy and Liza and Vincente 
                        Minnelli. If this went wrong, it 
                        would all be over. 

                                 AVA
                        I can do it. 

           Bertie grabs the Molly Brown costume from the stacks. 

                                 BERTIE
                        Then you’re on. 

           April bites her lip. She gives Harper one more try. 

           INT. HARRINGTON TEACHER’S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           April’s face lights up Harper’s screen, then fades. Harper 
           rolls over, still fast asleep. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - CONTINUOUS

           The OVERTURE plays on shitty school speakers. Lights UP on 
           the curtains... which open to reveal: Ava LaMonte in tattered 
           “country” clothes. The audience gasps and whispers. 

                                 AVA
                        I ain’t down yet! And even if I 
                        was, you’d sure never hear it from 
                        me! I hate that word down! But I 
                        love the word up! Because up means 
                        hope! And that’s just what I got, 
                        hope! For some place better, some 
                        place cleaner. Hell, if I gotta eat 
                        catfish heads all my life, can’t I 
                        have them off a plate once?

           Ava steps back and begins to sing-- 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        And then! Someday! With all my 
                        might and all my may! I’m gonna 
                        learn to read and write! 
           And holy SHIT... Ava is spectacular. The crowd goes WILD.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Science isn’t my strong suit, but I 
                        paid enough attention in Astronomy 
                        to learn that when one star burns 
                        out... another star is born. 

           INT. HARRINGTON TEACHER’S LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           Harper JOLTS UP. She’s groggy. She looks around at the DARK 
           ROOM and realizes what’s happened. FUCK.

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck

           She checks her phone. 8:30. 40 missed calls. Harper SCREAMS.

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - LATER

           The final scene. Ava stands up in a rowboat wearing formal 
           wear. The Titanic sinks in the background. 

                                 AVA
                        Stop it! Sit down! You’re rocking 
                        the boat! Stop yelling! 

           Harper sneaks in the side of the theater. Her jaw drops.

                                 CREWMAN
                        We’re going to die!

                                 AVA
                        No, we ain’t! I ain’t ready to die! 
                        Hell, I’m just learning how to live! 

           The sound fades as Harper internalizes Ava’s performance. 

           Harper internalizes the phone interview. Ava’s perfect lips 
           and teeth chatting up Kelly the Interviewer are superimposed 
           on either side of Harper’s face.

           The image changes to Christian Katz in drag giving Diego a 
           D... to Harper’s parents on a Water Slide... to Ava in 
           Harper’s costume, feigning surprise... to Ava giving Harper 
           the pill... Something is very wrong here. 

           Sound floods back in as Ava hits one last perfect note. 

           A RAUCOUS STANDING OVATION. Flowers fly to the stage!  

           Harper sees Bertie applauding backstage like never before.
                                 BERTIE
                        Holy shit. This is the best show 
                        I’ve ever put on. 

                                                            SFX: WHOOSH

           EXT. HARPER’S BACKYARD - NIGHT 

           Tiki lamps line the yard: nice, big, with an outdoor pool.

           The DRAMA CLUB stands in a circle playing “pass the sound”. 
           One person says “Whoosh” and swings their arms towards the 
           person next to them, passing the “Whoosh” around the circle.

           The Whoosh crescendos. Bertie stands in the center and uses 
           her spatula as a faux microphone--

                                 BERTIE
                        Ladies and gentleman, and every 
                        identity in between. I give you: 
                        The Unsinkable Molly Brown! 

           The backyard gates fly open to reveal Ava, walking in on the 
           arm of Ollie. The crowd goes WILD.

                                 OLLIE
                        Go get ‘em, killer.

           Ollie releases Ava into the waiting crowd, where she is 
           quickly swallowed.  

           Bertie flips burgers. April delivers her drink.

                                 APRIL
                        It feels weird having the cast party 
                        in Harper’s backyard without Harper. 

                                 BERTIE
                        She better be down a limb at the 
                        very least for missing tonight. 

           Just then, the gate blows open and in walks Harper. April and 
           Bertie rush over. Harper pretends nothing is amiss. 

                                 APRIL
                        Harper! We were so worried! 

                                 HARPER
                        I’m so sorry you had to cancel the 
                        performance but I promise I will 
                        make it up to you tomorrow night. 

           April and Bertie both flush. Unsure what to say.
                                 BERTIE
                        Harper look...

                                 APRIL
                             (blurting out)
                        Ava went on instead. 

           Harper looks at them like they must be kidding.

                                 HARPER
                        Ava? Ava Ava? As... Molly? 

                                 BERTIE
                        We waited as long as we could. Ava 
                        knew the part... it was kind of a 
                        disaster but we got through it. 

           Harper studies Bertie’s face. Then stops a FRESHMAN.

                                 HARPER
                        Be a dear and get me Vodka Redbull, 
                        with a twist.

                                 FRESHMAN
                        What’s the twist?

                                 HARPER
                        The twist is you do it without 
                        talking to me. 

           Bertie and April share a look. April tries to pull Harper 
           aside, but Harper spies Ava talking to Diego.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Ava! Or should I say... Molly?

           Ava turns around and rushes to Harper. Her body language 
           immediately changes. She’s small, subservient. 

                                 AVA
                        Harper! I was so worried.

                                 HARPER
                             (eyes on Diego)
                        It seems like you’re managing. 

                                 AVA
                        What happened? Did you oversleep?

                                 HARPER
                        If you call drugging me 
                        “oversleeping”. 
           Bertie and April squirm. Ava puts her glasses on, almost like 
           a shield, but Harper snatches them off her face. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You’re getting on fine without 
                        these bad boys.

           Harper puts on Ava’s glasses.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Look, now I’m you and you’re me. 
                             (mocking Ava)
                        Harper are you hungry? Harper do 
                        you need a back rub? Harper do you 
                        need your ass wiped?
                             (dropping it)
                        Now you do me! 

           Ava stares at Harper, unsure what to do. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What? I thought it was easy to be 
                        me. You already did once tonight. 

           The Freshman hands Harper her drink, which she downs in one 
           chug and throws on the ground. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Hold onto your tits, it’s going to 
                        be a bumpy fucking night. 

           Harper beelines across the backyard toward Diego. 

                                 DIEGO
                        Are you drunk? 

                                 HARPER
                        Wouldn’t you be? 

           Harper snatches the drink out of Diego’s hands and chugs it, 
           then immediately spits it out on the ground.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What is this?

                                 DIEGO
                        Blue Cherry Gatorade. I have a 
                        tournament tomorrow. 

                                 HARPER
                        Blue cherries aren’t real! 

           Harper is causing a scene. Everyone is watching. Across the 
           party, Ollie walks up to Bertie and April.
                                 OLLIE
                        Looks like someone still needs 
                        their dose of the spotlight 
                        tonight. Cappie’s show is tomorrow. 
                        Which Molly will we see? 

           Bertie looks deep in thought. 

           Back with Harper and Diego:

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t believe I thought you’d 
                        wait until next year to upgrade me. 

                                 DIEGO
                        Harper, please don’t start this. 

           Harper stares across the party at Ava, who is attempting to 
           smooth things over with the crowd. 

                                 HARPER
                        What did she possibly say to you? 
                        If it’s anything like what she says 
                        to me, I know it’s hard to say no. 

                                 DIEGO
                        You’re drunk and paranoid. Ava’s 
                        like a kid sister to me.

                                 HARPER
                        Do you make out with Camilla too? 
                        Do I need to report this? 

                                 DIEGO
                        This was supposed to be your night, 
                        but you fucked it up so you have to 
                        ruin it for everyone. Why can’t we 
                        just have fun tonight? 

                                 HARPER
                        You want fun? I can have fun! 

           Harper does a running jump into the pool. Harper gasps as she 
           comes up for air. Clearly the pool isn’t heated yet. People 
           walk over to witness the scene. Ollie comes up to the edge. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                             (teeth chattering)
                        Let me guess, tonight is on the 
                        record? 

                                 OLLIE
                        I couldn’t suppress this story if I 
                        tried. Which I won’t. 
           Bertie rushes over.

                                 BERTIE
                        Harper, let’s get out of here.

                                 HARPER
                        Why are you whispering? You think 
                        I’m going to FREAK OUT? 

           Harper climbs out of the pool. She grabs a roasting fork and 
           casually roasts a hot dog on the grill, still sopping wet. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Because I’m fine. See? I’m popular! 
                        I have everything! That’s what you 
                        all think, right? 

           The crowd is frozen. No one wants to make a sudden move.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Say it with me guys, hot people 
                        don’t have problems. 

           Harper laughs a little too loudly then stops, pointing the 
           hot dog at the crowd threateningly. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re all chorus members 
                        but you can remember one line, 
                        right? Ava remembered all of mine.  
                             (eyeing Ava with a smile)
                        Now say it with me. Ready? And--
                        Hot people don’t have problems.

           The crowd is silent. Harper throws the hot dog on the ground.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Well, screw you all! I gave you my 
                        house, I gave you (to Ava) my part, 
                        and I gave you all the best years 
                        of my goddamn life! 

           That’s enough. Bertie and April each grab one of Harper’s 
           arms and carry her away. Harper shouts on her way out--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        At our reunion remember me as the 
                        girl who was so hot she burned up 
                        in high school! 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Bertie and April toss Harper on the couch. 
                                 APRIL
                        Harper, calm down.

           Harper hops up, standing on the couch, Tom Cruise style.

                                 HARPER
                        I hate that word down! But I love 
                        the word up! Because up means hope--

           Harper stumbles and tips over the back of the couch. THUD. 
           April and Bertie lean over the couch to see Harper flat on 
           her back.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                             (more subdued)
                        Guys, she’s stealing my life. 

                                 APRIL
                        No one could ever replace you, 
                        Harper.

                                 HARPER
                             (sharper, at Bertie)
                        Really? Because I heard it was the 
                        best production you ever put on.

           Bertie’s face falls.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been saying all semester 
                        something wasn’t right with Ava--

                                 BERTIE
                        You let us look like idiots out 
                        there explaining ourselves to you--

                                 HARPER
                        Yet you’re the one who allowed her 
                        to finally ruin my life.

                                 APRIL
                        Harper, that’s unfair- 

                                 BERTIE
                        Just because she ruined your life 
                        doesn't mean you can ruin mine! You 
                        knew how important tonight was to me. 
                        This is my last chance at a Cappie--

                                 HARPER
                        It’s just high school theater!
                                 BERTIE
                        Well if it’s just high school theater 
                        then why do you care so much?

           Bertie storms off. April shakes her head at Harper and goes 
           after Bertie. 

                                 APRIL
                        Cool off. This isn’t you.

           EXT. HARPER’S BACKYARD - NIGHT 

           The crowd outside is a little shaken up. Ava approaches 
           Diego, licking his wounds on the outskirts of the party.

                                 AVA
                        I’m sorry if I made things worse.

                                 DIEGO
                        It’s not you, it’s Harper. I try to 
                        help but she keeps pushing me away.

           Ava rubs Diego’s arm consolingly... suggestively.

                                 DIEGO (CONT’D)
                        She has this insane idea I only like 
                        her because she’s popular, it’s like 
                        she’s daring me to leave her.
                             (a sigh)
                        You’re a good friend. Thanks for 
                        sticking by her. She’s not usually 
                        like this.

                                 AVA
                        I just want to be there for her. 
                        But instead I’m here... with you.

           Diego looks up. Suddenly, Ava goes in for the kiss. It’s only 
           a short moment until Diego pushes her away but the crowd 
           TAKES NOTE. Diego is furious. 

                                 DIEGO
                        What the fuck, Ava? 

           Ava licks her lips.

                                 AVA
                        Is that blue cherry? 

           Diego storms out of the party. Ava locks eyes with Harper who 
           saw everything. Harper turns around but Ava chases after her.
                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        Harper wait! 

                                 HARPER
                        You took my part, you took my 
                        parents, you took my friends, and 
                        now Diego. What else do you want? 
                        You want the shirt off my back? 

           Harper takes her wet shirt off. 

           Harper and Ava lock intense eyes. 

           As Gilda says, hate is a very exciting emotion. That’s when--

           Ava fucking does it. She goes in FOR THE KISS. 

           Everything slows down, the sound drops out. In the background, 
           party-goers lose their minds. Ollie drops his drink in shock.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Yes Ava took the starring role. Yes 
                        Ava took the leading man. But until 
                        now it was all just imitation. 

           By the time Ava releases Harper, Harper is in a complete 
           daze. Unsure what to do. Sapped of her power. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Ava had out legged Harper by a mile 
                        but now she dominated her. Turned 
                        queer subtext into text. A perfect 
                        teenage moment that would have 
                        graduated to myth and legend unless 
                        someone wrote it down. And everyone 
                        wrote it down. 

           People text and snap pics of this legendary event.

           Harper tears herself away and leaves the party. But not in 
           anger, in fear. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - THE NEXT NIGHT 

           The crowd files into their seats. The front two rows are 
           roped off for “Cappies - Student Theater Critics”. 

           Ollie takes his seat, notebook at the ready. He opens the 
           program and sees Harper is still in the cast list. 
                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        The next night, Bertie put Harper’s 
                        name in the cast list but no one, 
                        not even Bertie, actually expected 
                        her to go on. It might as well have 
                        said “In Loving Memory.”

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bertie dials Harper’s phone number, it rings and rings. She 
           makes eye contact with Ava, who starts doing her makeup. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - NIGHT

           The house lights up, Ollie sees Ava, in full costume, peek 
           out from the wings and give him a thumbs up. He smiles.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        It’s crazy but I almost felt bad 
                        for Harper. But alas I--

           Another CAPPIE knocks into Ollie, cutting off his internal 
           monologue as she tries to shuffle past to her seat.

                                 OLLIE
                        Excuse you, Diane Keaton. You 
                        dropped your lobster. 

           The Cappie mimes picking something off the ground and pulls 
           up her middle finger. 

           It’s RANGER DEB-- out of the safari outfit and into an over 
           the top “I’m a theater kid, did you know?” outfit, which is 
           basically just Annie Hall, hat and all.  

                                 RANGER DEB
                        What are you supposed to be? An 
                        emaciated Alan Cumming?

           Ollie is less stung than impressed. He is about to retort 
           when the lights flicker and a drum roll starts. Ava runs on 
           stage in her tattered costume. 

           Ranger Deb gasps. 

                                 AVA
                        I ain’t down yet! And even if I 
                        was, you’d sure never hear it! 

           Ava starts the opening number which continues over--
           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harper lies in her dark bedroom, eyes dried out from crying. 
           She looks at her phone, littered with missed calls and texts. 

           A door SLAMS. Shuffling downstairs. Harper pops up, confused. 

                                 HARPER
                        Mom? Dad? 
                             (off no response)
                        Diego? 

           No response. Harper grabs a baseball bat and goes downstairs.

           INT. WEST HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Dean and Susan harriedly unpack their suitcases. They are 
           surprised to see Harper. 

                                 DEAN
                        Why aren’t you at your show? 

                                 HARPER
                        I... it’s a long story -- 

                                 SUSAN
                        Are you doing pot, Harper? Because 
                        I really don’t know what’s going on 
                        with you these days. Was this trip 
                        some idea of a joke? 

                                 DEAN
                        That wasn’t the Great Wolf Lodge. 
                        It wasn’t even a Good Wolf Lodge! 

                                 SUSAN
                        It was just a motel run by a ghoul 
                        named Ichabod! Who snuck in our 
                        room in the middle of the night to 
                        smell my underwear! 

           Dean opens the recycling bin and pulls out a vodka bottle. 

                                 DEAN
                        What’s going on, Harper?  Did you 
                        want your mom’s underwear to get 
                        sniffed? Did you want me to day 
                        dream of water slides in an itchy 
                        bed in the woods? Or was this all 
                        just a ploy to throw a party?

           Dean and Susan wait for an answer but Harper bursts into 
           tears and turns to run upstairs. Dean and Susan deflate. 
                                 SUSAN
                        Wait! Harper. 

           Harper comes back into the kitchen. 

           Susan hands her a letter from Columbia University. Harper 
           tearfully opens it. She takes a deep breath. Sighs.

                                 HARPER
                        Waitlisted. 

           Without another word, Harper turns around and leaves the 
           kitchen. Susan and Dean look at each other. Well. Damn. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - NIGHT

           The curtains close on intermission. The audience ROARS-- 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ava sits in front of her lighted mirror reviewing the script 
           as one KID does her hair and ANOTHER touches up her makeup.

           Ollie walks in, slow clapping. He shoos away her attendants. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Buzz in the Cappie row is 
                        phenomenal. The scrappy little 
                        nobody next to me literally gasped 
                        when you walked on stage.

           Ava smiles smugly. Ollie puts his hands on her shoulders and 
           leans down. He puts his face next to hers, cheek to cheek. 
           They stare at themselves in the mirror.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Where does my star wish to go 
                        tonight? Sardi’s is a hike but I 
                        bet Caleb Decker’s unfinished 
                        basement could be just as wicked. 
                        We can bathe in cheap Pinot and 
                        watch the sun rise on our new life. 

           Ava’s smile drops a bit, she pats Ollie’s hand patronizingly 
           and shakes him off. She goes back to primping her hair. 

                                 AVA
                        Ollie, dear, I’ve been meaning to 
                        tell you. With your fair skin, I’m 
                        not sure popularity is such a good 
                        shade on you. Perhaps you should 
                        stick to criticism.
           Ollie’s face drops. 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        I have plans tonight, and I’m 
                        afraid with you there, people will 
                        assume it’ll be on the record. 

           Ollie’s face hardens as we match cut to:

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - NIGHT

           Ollie watches, stone-faced, as Ava, in full evening wear, 
           tries to cheer everyone up as the Titanic sinks behind them. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I was Frankenstein and Ava LaMonte 
                        was my monster, here to ruin me, 
                        mock me, put me in a hell of my own 
                        making. And even as my plan 
                        crumbled around me, I couldn’t help 
                        but respect her killer instincts. 

           Ollie begrudgingly stands with the rest of the crowd in an 
           ovation. But his claps are slow, his eyes narrowed. 

           Next to him Ranger Deb sits still, not clapping at all.

                                 OLLIE
                        No applause? Are you immune to her 
                        girlish charms? 

                                 RANGER DEB
                        I’d rather fuck a cactus with chlamydia.

                                 OLLIE
                        Lord knows you need the action. But 
                        what do you possibly have against 
                        Harrington’s newest ingenue, Ava--

                                 RANGER DEB
                        Ranger Ava. And she’s no ingenue. 

           Ollie’s eyes light up. We punch in close. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I am full on bisexual for your 
                        information. 

           INT. JOURNALISM ROOM - NIGHT

           Ollie and Ranger Deb are only illuminated by moonlight. 
                                 RANGER DEB
                        Are you actually bisexual?

                                 OLLIE
                        Don’t insult me. 

                                 RANGER DEB
                        I want a plug in your school paper. 
                        I’m playing Tevye in our 
                        Experimental Drama Showcase.

                                 OLLIE
                        No one is going to Fiddler. It’s not 
                        Cappie qualifying. I’m supposed to 
                        review it and I’m not even going.

           Ranger Deb hands him her “card”. Jr. Manager, Rainforest Cafe. 

                                 RANGER DEB
                        No plug, no dirt. Find me in the 
                        jungle once you’ve sung my Yiddish 
                        praises. 

           Ranger Deb turns tail and leaves. Ollie’s glare is illuminated 
           by the moonlight. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        But as thirsty as I was for Tevye’s 
                        dirt, everything melted away as we 
                        entered National Hot Kid Holiday... 
                        Spring Break.

           INSERT: INSTAGRAM VIDEO - Diego cannonballs into the pool 
           with a splash! Ava and Tiffany Beaver perch on Christian Katz 
           and Caleb Decker’s shoulders in a game of chicken.

           INT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY

           Ollie watches this video under a mahjong table, surrounded by 
           OLD LADIES.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        While I’d usually find vicarious 
                        joy watching pretty people do dumb 
                        things, this year I felt robbed and 
                        I wasn’t handling it well.

           DORIS plays a tile. Ollie instantly snatches it up.

                                 OLLIE
                        This is a dominos tile, Doris! And 
                        don’t you dare use dementia as an 
                        excuse! You know what you’re doing! 
           Ollie navigates to his messages to text Ava. We can see that 
           she hasn’t responded in a while. Ollie puts his phone away.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        The only solace I could find was 
                        that for the first time in our 
                        intertwined lives, Harper was in 
                        the same situation. 

           EXT. WEST HOUSE - POOL - DAY

           Harper floats by a la The Graduate, alone and discontent, but 
           still glamorous.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Harper’s version of it at least. 
                        Beautiful, sad, self-indulgent. 

           Susan walks out and bends down by the pool.

                                 SUSAN
                        April’s here, honey.

                                 HARPER
                        Well tell her I’m not. 

           Harper rolls off her float, splashing into the water. 

           We follow Harper UNDERWATER as she willfully sinks to the 
           bottom of the pool.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        A washed up beauty queen at only 
                        18. Harper’s senior year spring 
                        break melted away faster than the 
                        popsicle from her iconic July 2017 
                        profile picture. By the time we 
                        were back in school, Harper West 
                        was a memory from a fading dream. 
                        Replaced by a new world order.

           A TV SCREEN FILLS UP THE FRAME

           Ava’s face fills up the screen on the morning announcements. 

                                 AVA
                        Good morning Harrington High! I’m 
                        Ava LaMonte, your guest anchor 
                        filling in for Marta Chang! 

           MARTA CHANG leans into frame and waves.
                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        Today I’m here with a special 
                        senior bulletin! Prom is officially 
                        two weeks away! Boys, start 
                        planning your promposals now! It’s 
                        2019, girls might beat you to the 
                        punch! 

           Marta Chang walks back on screen. Ava nods encouragingly. 

                                 MARTA CHANG  
                             (to camera, deadpan)
                        Breaking news... Dylan Costello has 
                        just learned that he will be asked 
                        to Prom by Marta Chang... no word 
                        yet on whether or not he accepts.

                                 DYLAN COSTELLO (O.S.)
                        ... What?

           Marta Chang smiles directly at the camera. The camera itself 
           tilts up and down. Yes. Marta smiles and runs off screen. The 
           camera tilts down to face the ground, clearly forgotten. We 
           hear furious teenage making out.  

           Ava leans down, just into frame.

                                 AVA
                        Don’t forget to vote for Prom Court 
                        because we’re all Kweens but 
                        there’s only one crown!

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Harper watches the end of the Morning Announcements. She 
           slams her locker shut. Hard.

           Harper trudges down the hall in sunglasses and a hoodie, 
           trying to go unnoticed. She passes Tiffany Beaver and the 
           Cheer Biddies who snort with laughter.

                                 TIFFANY BEAVER
                        Oh my god, Harper? You’re serving 
                        some ‘07 Britney realness. 

           Harper stops, mustering all she has.

                                 HARPER
                        Well... Britney is a national 
                        treasure wronged by society so...

           Tiffany and her cheer biddies lose it laughing. 
           Just then, Ava rounds the corner carrying a cup of coffee. She 
           SLAMS into Harper, spilling coffee all over her. Harper could 
           have sworn she did it on purpose but Ava plays innocent. 

                                 AVA
                        Harper! Are you okay? 

                                 HARPER
                        Stay away from me.

           Harper storms down the hall. She rips a Harrington Herald out 
           of a KID’S hand, using it to mop up the coffee.

           She holds up the soggy paper: Ava as Molly. She hurls it down 
           the hall with a shriek.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN (PRE-LAP)
                        I asked you to write a current 
                        event piece... and you wrote a 
                        dating profile... for me.

           INT. JOURNALISM ROOM - DAY 

           Ms. Kilgallen stares at an apathetic ACNE SCARRED JUNIOR. 

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Who told you I had osteoporosis?

           Ollie strides into the room, completely ignoring Acne Scars.  

                                 OLLIE
                        Karen! I have a code red. And if I 
                        don’t get your undivided sympathy I 
                        will Meet Joe Black myself into 
                        oncoming traffic! 

           Ms. Kilgallen sighs and hands the profile back to Acne Scars.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Take this to detention, and drop my 
                        class. 

           Acne Scars scurries out of the room. Ollie flips his chalkboard 
           to the Harrington Underground, which now centers on Ava. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I hate to tell you this, Karen, but 
                        everything is better when you’re 
                        popular! And after a glorious few 
                        months in the sun, I’m back 
                        shivering in the shadows. 

           Ollie dramatically flops down at a desk.
                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Okay let’s slow this down. When you 
                        say Meet Joe Black...?

                                 OLLIE
                        Have one car hit me, launching me 
                        into another car, which will 
                        then... also hit me. 

           Ollie mimes this. Kilgallen gives the go-ahead to continue. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        I followed your advice, I put Ava up 
                        there. But I’m back in the gutter.

           Ollie gestures to Kilgallen’s classroom as “the gutter”.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        You went to “Harvard”, what would 
                        you do? 

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Ollie, this whole conversation 
                        feels like I’m risking my job but 
                        frankly, I hate this place, so I’m 
                        going to give it to you straight. 
                        You put Ava up there. She cut you 
                        out. So put somebody else up there.

                                 OLLIE 
                        The sheeple wouldn’t buy someone 
                        new this late in the game. Even Ava 
                        was a PR nightmare.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN 
                        Then don’t get someone new. Get 
                        someone... old... and blonde.

           Just then Harper, covered in coffee, throws open the door. 

                                 HARPER
                             (out of breath)
                        Ollie. You. Now. 

           Ms. Kilgallen does a “told you so” face. 

           INT. JANITOR’S CLOSET - DAY

           Ollie sits on the bean bag this time. Harper stands across 
           from him impatiently.

                                 HARPER
                        What is this place?
                                 OLLIE
                        I gave Frank the seed money in 
                        exchange for exclusive privileges. 
                        Have a seat.

           Harper doesn’t budge. 

                                 HARPER
                        I want your help taking down Ava.

                                 OLLIE
                        Now, why would I do that?

                                 HARPER
                        I didn’t see your pasty shoulders 
                        in any of Ava’s Beach Week pics but 
                        I did see you check into Harold’s 
                        Seafood Palace.

                                 OLLIE
                        I knew Doris wasn’t just looking up 
                        the weather. Well, luckily our 
                        interests align. Stumbling at the 
                        finish line after a four-year-reign 
                        is a bad look. But nothing Prom 
                        Queen couldn’t fix. 

                                 HARPER
                        What, are you my publicist now?

                                 OLLIE
                        For a price.

                                 HARPER
                        Name it. 

                                 OLLIE
                        You take me as your King. 

                                 HARPER
                        You’ve spent four years trying to 
                        ruin me and now we’re going to be 
                        some happy couple. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I never wanted to ruin you. I just 
                        wanted to know... what it was like 
                        to be you.

                                 HARPER
                        Well this is me. And I’m in a 
                        closet. With you. Begging for help.  
                                 OLLIE
                        I can’t believe I’m saying this, 
                        but I want to help you. But we need 
                        to act fast. Because Ava LaMonte is 
                        playing dirty.

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH CAFETERIA - DAY

           Ava flits around the cafeteria handing out cupcakes with 
           icing crowns. She stops by April in line for some lunch goop.

                                 AVA
                        Hey April! Want a treat?

           Ava hands April a cupcake and keeps moving down the line. As 
           soon as her back is turned, April lifts the cupcake to throw--

                                 APRIL
                        I’ll give her a treat...

           But Diego catches her arm.

                                 DIEGO
                        Hey, have you talked to Harper?

                                 APRIL
                        She’s dodging me. She’s always had a 
                        narcissistic, “I’m the only person 
                        with problems” schtick but usually 
                        it’s kind of cute. This is testing me. 

                                 DIEGO
                        I don’t care how bad she’s been. I 
                        want to help.

           Bertie comes rushing over, out of breath, but exuberant. 

                                 BERTIE
                        You guys!! We were nominated! Molly 
                        was nominated! We’re going to the 
                        Regional Cappies! NYC baby! 

                           DIEGO
                                                          APRIL
           Wait what!! That’s amazing!
                                              Babe! I’m so proud of you!

                                 BERTIE
                        We get to put on a number for the 
                        showcase! We’ll do the Lifeboat 
                        number, I think...

                                 APRIL
                        Are you going to take Harper?
                                 BERTIE
                             (”obviously no”)
                        I don’t know, am I insane? 

           April and Diego’s smiles fade.

                                 BERTIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh come on guys! 

           April points over to Ava giggling with some Drama Biddies.

                                 APRIL
                        Bertie. There is something rotten 
                        going on here and we both know it. 

                                 BERTIE
                             (kind of whining)
                        But I’m going to be on the same 
                        stage as Laura Benanti so I don’t 
                        care right now!
                             (shouting to the caf)
                        We’re going to the Cappies!!!

           Ollie, a few people behind in line, raises his eyebrows. 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - NIGHT

           Susan opens the door to find Ollie with an overnight bag. He 
           puts on a comically innocent tone.

                                 OLLIE
                        Hello Mrs. West, is Harper home?

                                 SUSAN
                        Harper, there’s a Jehovah's Witness 
                        here to see you.

           Harper walks in. Ollie drops the act. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Pack your bags. Bertie was 
                        nominated for the Cappies. 

                                 HARPER
                        She was?

           She looks happy but also sad she’s hearing about it this way.

                                 OLLIE
                        I voted for Baxter High’s bold 
                        interpretation of Spider-Man: Turn 
                        Off The Dark, but alas.
                                 HARPER
                        I need to call her.

                                 OLLIE
                        No you need to go to New York. I 
                        have a perennially under-utilized 
                        plus one. We leave first thing in 
                        the morning so...

           Ollie holds out an overnight bag. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Warm up your Mezzo-Soprano because 
                        if we play our cards right, we will 
                        get you on that stage, and a second 
                        shot in the spotlight.

                                 HARPER
                        You mean win my friends back?

                                 OLLIE
                        I’m not your life coach. I’m the 
                        devil on your shoulder. And the 
                        devil says...
                             (sniffing the air)
                        Is that pot roast?

           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harper struggles with an air mattress as Ollie investigates 
           Harper’s room like a serial killer. 

                                 HARPER
                        You know, I could have just picked 
                        you up in the morning.

                                 OLLIE
                        And pass up a chance to see the 
                        innermost lair of Harper West?

           Ollie continues to poke around. In a drawer Ollie sees--

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Kevin Tang’s Wasabi Vodka?

           He holds up the bottle, shaking it. Harper smirks.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s actually mine. I’ve been 
                        pinning it on the guy for years.
           Harper and Ollie both make eye contact, smiling.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Harper and Ollie lay head to toe on the air mattress passing 
           the vodka. Ollie takes a big swig. Sinuses on fire. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Biggest scandal I never knew about?

                                 HARPER
                        You know sophomore year when the 
                        Winter Ball was canceled so I threw 
                        that rager in the model home my mom 
                        was trying to sell? 

                                 OLLIE
                        How could I forget! Grounded for 
                        three weeks. You died for our sins 
                        and rose again as a folkhero.

                                 HARPER
                        I asked my mom’s permission first.

           Ollie bolts up, stunned. Harper takes a swig. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Biggest story you ever made up?

           Ollie looks at Harper, considering her. He lays back down.

                                 OLLIE
                        ...Bray Wilson never cheated on you 
                        with Tiffany Beaver. 

                                 HARPER
                        I broke up with him over the PA 
                        system. I told everyone! 

                                 OLLIE
                        He did cheat on you. Just not with 
                        Bucktooth Beaver. 
                             (long beat)
                        He cheated with me.

           Harper bolts up, spilling some vodka, which is for the best.

                                 HARPER
                        Bray was gay?! Honestly that would 
                        explain some things.

                                 OLLIE
                        Questioning at the very least. 
                                 HARPER
                        But that would’ve been a big story. 
                        And a serious status boost for you.

                                 OLLIE
                        Even my ruthlessness has its limits. 

                                 HARPER
                        Oh my god. Is this confirmation 
                        that Ollie St. John does in fact 
                        have a beating heart?

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s sickening, I know. 

           Harper crawls off the air mattress and tumbles onto her bed. 

                                 HARPER
                        You know, being popular wasn’t as 
                        perfect as it seemed.

                                 OLLIE
                        Liar.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE MARRIOTT OR SOMETHING LIKE IT - DAY

           A banner hangs: “Welcome Teen Thespians!”. Excited TEENS in 
           various costumes dash in.

           INT. MARRIOTT AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE

           Bertie peeks through the wings to see some prepubescent TEENS 
           sing an inappropriate version of Chicago’s Cell Block Tango 
           for some uncomfortable JUDGES.

                                 BERTIE
                        A 14-year-old is about to do Velma 
                        Kelly’s Sister Act alone. We have 
                        them beat by a mile. Huddle up. 

           Bertie huddles up with Ava and the Theater Biddies, all in 
           evening wear, ready to do the lifeboat number.

           MEANWHILE

           Ollie and Harper rush down the aisle towards backstage. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Here’s the plan: We discredit Ava. 
                        Rub a little dirt on it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OLLIE (CONT'D)
                        Then you hit the notes, win your 
                        friends back, the Cappies go all 
                        over social media, and you become 
                        beloved again.

                                 HARPER
                        So what’s the dirt? 

                                 OLLIE
                        If you tell someone “I know your 
                        secret” 8 out of 10 people will 
                        react by divulging a secret. Let’s 
                        just hope Ava carries around 
                        something worse than a swear jar. 

                                 HARPER
                        That’s the best you have? Wing it? 
                        I thought you had information! 

                                 OLLIE
                        She’s hiding something, I just 
                        don’t know what! Fiddler doesn’t 
                        open until next week! 

           INT. MARRIOTT AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           Ava and the Biddies have taken their places in the row boat, 
           which April and Diego roll into place. 

                                 BERTIE
                        Looks great. Thanks for the back up 
                        today, guys.

           Suddenly, they all hear--

                                 OLLIE (O.S.)
                             (bickering with security)
                        Yes, I’m a critic but I have a good 
                        reason to be back here--

           Ollie and Harper, shaking off security, appear backstage, 
           face to face with a shocked Bertie. 

                                 BERTIE
                        What are you doing here? 

           Harper puts on a smile. 

                                 HARPER
                        I know how important this is to 
                        you. I’m showing up this time. 
                                 BERTIE
                        It’s too late. Ava got us here, 
                        Harper. Not you. This is the real 
                        world, not high school--

                                 OLLIE
                        Unsinkable Ava, Ranger Deb wanted 
                        me to tell you to... break a leg.

           Ava narrows her eyes, studying Ollie’s face.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        And that’s not all she told me... 
                        so if you want to step down and let 
                        Harper take over, it’s okay.

           Everyone exchanges looks. Bertie is panicking.

                                 BERTIE
                        Ava, what’s he talking about? 

           Ava never takes her eyes off Ollie, talking slowly.

                                 AVA
                        It seems that Ollie has discovered 
                        my deep dark secret... that I... 

           Ava takes a deep breath.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        ...work for the Rainforest Cafe. 
                        That’s right, I’m not fully 
                        dedicated to the theater... I have 
                        an after school job. 

           Ollie and Harper exchange despondent looks. Fuck. Molly’s 
           music cue starts. Bertie pushes Ava on. 

                                 BERTIE
                             (to Harper)
                        Get the fuck off my stage. 

           EXT. STAGE DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           April bursts out right behind Harper. 

                                 APRIL
                        You wouldn’t see me over break but 
                        you’ll show up in New York? 

                                 HARPER
                        I came to support Bertie.
                                 APRIL
                        You came to support Harper. 

                                 HARPER
                        Can you blame me? I slide down the 
                        social ladder and suddenly lose all 
                        my friends?

                                 APRIL
                        If you’re connecting those two 
                        things you are seriously deranged. 

           Just then Bertie comes out.

                                 BERTIE
                        You know you didn’t have to try to 
                        ruin my show again. A simple 
                        apology would have done the trick.

                                 HARPER
                        Is that what you want from me now? 
                        An apology? Well I’m sorry Bertie. 
                        I’m sorry my nervous breakdown got 
                        in the way of your musical! I’m 
                        sorry no one bothered even asking 
                        if I got into Columbia, which I 
                        didn’t by the way! I’m sorry that 
                        I’m terrified about graduating! 

                                 APRIL
                        Why didn’t you just... talk to us?!  

                                 HARPER
                        How am I supposed to talk about being 
                        afraid of the future to someone who 
                        changes all the time! It’s always 
                        ‘not a phase’ until the next phase 
                        takes over! Last year it was cheer 
                        and this year it’s Bertie.

           Harper catches herself but it’s too late. She’s gone too far.

                                 APRIL
                        Come on. We’re going.

           April grabs Bertie and opens the door to BOOMING APPLAUSE.

           INT. MARRIOTT AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Harper rushes in behind April and Bertie to apologize but 
           stops in her tracks at the sight of--
           Ava is on stage, on one knee to Diego, who has clearly just 
           been pulled on stage, looking like a deer in the headlights.

                                 AVA
                        Will you go to Prom with me? 

           Harper gasps. 

           Diego looks truly stuck as he considers the crowd. Considers 
           his friends, considers Harper. But he doesn’t cause a scene. 
           He nods. The crowd goes wild. 

           EXT. STAGE DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Harper bursts out, fully in tears. Really ugly crying. Ollie 
           rushes out behind her trying to comfort her. 

           A triumphant Ava steps out and eyes Ollie.

                                 AVA
                        I see you inherited my dead-weight. 
                        He’s the one who put me up to it, 
                        you know? I just wanted to be your 
                        friend. He wanted your life. 

           Ava walks back inside, leaving Harper alone with Ollie. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Harper I--

           Harper doesn’t want to hear it. She leaves. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

           Harper wanders up the street in a daze until she sees--

           EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

           Harper nervously wanders onto campus. Like at any moment 
           someone will realize she doesn’t belong. But then--

                                 VOICE
                        Harper West? 

           Harper turns to see a COLLEGE CUTIE walking towards her.

                                 HARPER
                        ...Bray? Bray Wilson? 

                                 BRAY
                        Oh my god, are you going here?
                                 HARPER
                        Hopefully! I was waitlisted. 

                                 BRAY
                        I hope you get in! I love it here. 

           A HILARIOUSLY HOT MAN jogs over and kisses Bray.

                                 BRAY (CONT’D)
                        This is my boyfriend, Giancarlo. If 
                        you come here, look us up! 

                                 HARPER
                        Wait! Bray! ...You liked high 
                        school, right?

           Bray stops and thinks for a moment. 

                                 BRAY
                        Yeah, wow, it feels like such a 
                        blur now. I had a good time, 
                        despite its inherent shittiness. 
                             (with a wink)
                        Don’t you remember? I was Prom King.

                                 GIANCARLO
                        Really babe? That’s so funny. 

                                 HARPER
                        You... didn’t even tell your 
                        boyfriend you were Prom King? 

                                 BRAY
                        Just never thought to, I guess. I’d 
                        love to stay and chat but I have to 
                        get to class! Nice seeing you! 

           Bray smiles and waves as he and his hunk boyfriend walk away.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

           Harper sleeps against the window. 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Harper walks in, despondent. Susan rushes over.

                                 SUSAN
                        Where have you been? 

           But Harper just walks upstairs. 
           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harper stares at her Columbia pennant before rolling over. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        In just a few months I went from 
                        pariah to included to nobody to 
                        Harper West’s best friend, if only 
                        for a night. But it still wasn’t 
                        over. I had one more card to play.

                                 RANGER DEB (PRE-LAP)
                        Tradition! Tradition! 

           INT. DAVIS HIGH SCHOOL THEATER - NIGHT 

           Ollie puts his head in his hands, suffering through Ranger 
           Deb’s tiresome portrayal of Tevye. 

           INT. RAINFOREST CAFE - NIGHT

           Ollie slams down a copy of the Harrington Herald on the 
           Rainforest Cafe’s Tiki bar. The Arts headline says “Nothing 
           Traditional about Davis’s Female Fiddler.”  

                                 OLLIE
                        I’ll take a margarita, a booth, and 
                        whatever sex, lies and videotapes 
                        you can muster.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           Ollie sucks down a frozen margarita opposite Ranger Deb. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay Ranger Tevye, spill. And make 
                        it worth my time. That paper won’t 
                        run until Monday and I can retract 
                        it before you can say Yentl.

                                 RANGER DEB 
                        What story has she been feeding 
                        you? I need to know how much I’m 
                        going to blow your mind. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Transfer from Nowheresville. First 
                        real high school experience. But 
                        I’ve already surmised that’s not 
                        true. What are we talking here? 
                        Larceny? Grand Larceny? Army Brat? 
           Ranger Deb closes her eyes. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 RANGER DEB
                        I’m savoring this moment.

           Ollie waits impatiently. Ranger Deb takes a deep breath. 

                                 RANGER DEB (CONT’D)
                        Ava isn’t from Utah. She’s from Davis.

           Ranger Deb slides a YEARBOOK across the table, open to senior 
           portraits, more specifically: AVA SCHATZ. A four-eyed loser 
           with braces, pimples, frizzed hair, the whole shebang. But 
           make no mistake: this girl is who we know as Ava LaMonte. 

           Suddenly, a rumble of thunder. Ranger Deb slams the yearbook 
           shut. Faux lightning flashes across her face as she says: 

                                 RANGER DEB (CONT’D)
                        Class of 2013. 

           Ollie completely freezes, his face is unreadable. Finally... 
           a single tear falls from his eye as he starts a slow clap for 
           Ranger Deb in the empty Rainforest Cafe. 

                                 OLLIE
                        You just gave this gay the greatest 
                        thrill of his young life. 
                             (finishes his drink)
                        We’re going to need another round. 

                                 RANGER DEB
                        That’s a virgin. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Aren’t we both. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH SENIOR HALL - DAY

           The hallway buzzes with prom excitement. Ava parts the hall 
           with a POSSE speaking loudly and projecting for all to hear:

                                 AVA
                        I’d be surprised if Harper even 
                        shows up at Prom. Hasn’t she 
                        embarrassed herself enough already? 

           Harper hides in her locker, waiting for Ava to pass, then 
           slams it shut and hurries down the hall. Ollie tentatively 
           follows, but Harper keeps walking.
                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I intended to tell Harper, I really 
                        did. In our brief friendship I 
                        caught a glimpse of the person 
                        behind the popularity, which though 
                        jarring, was ultimately... nice. 
                        But I didn’t come this far to make 
                        friends. High School functions like 
                        a reality show. And I came to win 
                        the grand prize. 

                                 PA ANNOUNCEMENT (PRE-LAP)
                        Ava LaMonte to the Front Office. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH FRONT OFFICE - DAY

           Kathy releases the intercom and looks up at Ollie.

                                 KATHY
                        He’ll be out for another 30 
                        minutes. Our secret, as long as--

                                 OLLIE
                        Your son will win “Most Likely to 
                        write the Great American Novel” 
                        even though I promise you he won’t, 
                        Kathy.

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Ava walks in hesitantly. The back of the chair faces her. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Thank you for joining me Ava.
                             (spinning around)
                        Or should I say Ranger Ava.

                                 AVA
                             (rolling her eyes)
                        Again? I’m a teenager with a job--

                                 OLLIE
                        You have a job all right, but your 
                        teen years melted away long ago.

           For the first time in a long time, Ava looks nervous.

                                 AVA
                        Excuse me? 

                                 OLLIE
                        You’re 23, you crazy cun--. 
           Ava lunges across the desk but Ollie jerks back.

                                 AVA
                        How dare you--

                                 OLLIE
                        Hey! I did not bribe the front 
                        office lady for some girl-on-girl 
                        violence. I came to talk. 

           Ollie motions for Ava to sit down on the coach. She complies.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        And I know you’re nervous but that 
                        couch is 100% leather so don’t shit 
                        yourself. Or is it Schatz? 

           Ava looks like the girl she once was: small... pathetic.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to know the how, only 
                        the why. For instance, why would a 
                        grown-ass adult scheme her way back 
                        to gym class?

           Ava takes a breath. Her eyes brim with over-the-top tears.

                                 AVA
                        Oh Ollie, I’ve wanted to tell you 
                        for so long. You were my first true 
                        friend at Harrington--

                                 OLLIE
                        We’re past this little act, Mommie 
                        Dearest. Give me the details.

           Ava hardens. Then softens. 

                                 AVA
                        Fine. I was a loser in high school. 
                        Ugly, lonely. I loved the stage but 
                        was too “weird” to be cast.

           This hits for Ollie. He’s listening. 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t wait for high school to 
                        be over but when I got to the real 
                        world I felt the same. Like failing 
                        in high school sealed my fate. And 
                        then one night I saw Harper West. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        How she smiled, how people smiled 
                        at her and I thought, if I could 
                        redo high school, be more like 
                        Harper, maybe everything would be 
                        better. Maybe I would be better. 
                        And from there it was easy to--

                                 OLLIE
                        To destroy Harper West’s world?

                                 AVA
                        To get a second chance. You are not 
                        blameless in this situation.

                                 OLLIE
                        I told you to become her friend. 
                        Not Single White Female her.

                                 AVA
                             (shrugging)
                        Are you going to tell everyone?

                                 OLLIE
                        Well I did write up a beautifully 
                        savage article on the hopes and 
                        dreams wrapped up in teen popularity 
                        and how one psycho bitch Never Been 
                        Kissed her way back to high school. 

           Ollie holds his phone out, open to the article, but right 
           when Ava leans towards it, Ollie snatches it back.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        But! I was taught to respect my 
                        elders so... I thought I might 
                        forget the whole thing... providing 
                        you fulfill some promises. Starting 
                        with taking me to the top with you. 
                        More specifically, Prom.

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH LACROSSE FIELD - DAY

           Diego checks Christian hard. He falls to the ground, 
           whimpering like a baby. COACH WU blows his whistle.

                                 COACH WU
                        Olvera! Hit the bench.

           Diego throws his lacrosse mask in anger. Coach Wu jogs over.
                                 COACH WU (CONT’D)
                        Save it for Davis, not Katz. 
                             (off Diego’s sullen face)
                        My guy my guy my guy, all this bad 
                        female energy is messing you up! 

                                 DIEGO
                        It’s not bad female energy, it’s 
                        just bad energy. Get misogyny out 
                        of sports! 

           But on cue, Ava saunters straight across the field, to Diego.

                                 AVA
                             (bluntly)
                        Diego, I have to un-invite you to 
                        prom. My needs have changed and 
                        honestly, my date can’t be a loser. 

           Coach Wu I-Told-You-So’s Diego. 

                                 DIEGO
                        Who cares? I never wanted to go 
                        with you anyway. 

                                 AVA
                        I’ve been asked to prom six times 
                        so I find that hard to believe.

           Ava leaves. Diego picks his mask up and throws it again.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I’m not going to lie and tell you I 
                        blackmailed Ava out of the goodness 
                        of my itty bitty heart. 

                        But I did hope that Ava dumping 
                        Diego might give Harper a chance to 
                        get back on the horse. But Prom 
                        waits for no man, and as Prom Fever 
                        spread through the halls of 
                        Harrington, Harper West looked as 
                        lifeless as Jackie Powers’s hair. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH CAFETERIA - DAY

           Harper sits next to Jackie Powers, sullenly watching as Caleb 
           Decker flexes in front of ASHLEY, a cheerleader. In Sharpie 
           one muscle says: HEY, the other says: ASHLEY then he lifts up 
           his shirt and across his abs reads: “PROM?” Yes! 
           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH THEATER - DAY

           Bertie, sweaty, nervous, and teenage, kneels in front of 
           April. She reads from a crumpled piece of paper: 

                                 BERTIE
                        Roses are red / you’re super cute / 
                        let’s go to prom / I’ll wear a suit? 

           Bertie winces. But of course April says yes! They kiss.

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY

           Christian Katz puts the finishing touches on a car windshield 
           painted to say “PROM?” Then ducks behind another car.

           Miwa walks up, sees the car and Christian, then wordlessly 
           gets in and turns on the windshield wipers. 

           INSERT - INSTAGRAM

           Christian Katz running out, dejected, plays over and over.

           INT. HOME EC - DAY

           A crowd huddles around watching the video, laughing. Tovah 
           sidles up to a quiet Harper. 

                                 TOVAH
                        Are you going to the after party in 
                        Caleb Decker’s basement? I heard he 
                        has cough syrup on ice. But I’ve 
                        had enough bad experiences with 
                        sizzurp to last a lifetime. 

           Harper looks at Tovah like: really? 

                                 HARPER
                        I’m busy this weekend. 

                                 TOVAH
                        ...You’re not going to prom?

                                 HARPER
                        Though Prom seems like an exciting 
                        opportunity to hit a new personal 
                        low, I’d rather not give Ava the 
                        satisfaction. You braving it stag?

           Tovah looks mildly offended.
                                 TOVAH
                        No, I’m going with... okay yes. I’m 
                        too mature for teen boys.

           Harper smiles. Dr. V enters the room.

                                 DR. V
                        I know you guys are Prom crazy, so 
                        today is for practicing civil 
                        conversations with co-workers. 

           The students don’t react.

                                 DR. V (CONT’D)
                        That means stay in the room but you 
                        can chat amongst yourselves. 

           Chatter resumes. But Harper just scrolls through her phone. 

                                 DR. V (CONT’D)
                        Harper? Can I see you up here?

           Harper begrudgingly walks over.

                                 DR. V (CONT’D)
                        I know you’d rather wallow in teen 
                        angst right now but I want to throw 
                        it back to day one. Know what my 
                        first impression really was? 
                             (beat)
                        That you were scared. That you were 
                        staring down your future like a deer 
                        in the headlights and that you were 
                        trying to hide from the pressure in 
                        Home-Ec, land of the easy A.

                                 HARPER
                        ... did I get it?

                                 DR. V
                        B+. But that’s my point. It doesn't 
                        matter. Right now everything feels 
                        huge. But when you get to my age, 
                        you’ll wish you just enjoyed it all 
                        a bit more. So if I were you, I’d 
                        focus on the good times, like how I 
                        made out with Joey Parker at my 
                        prom. And let go of the bad ones. 
                        Like how I vomited on his shoes a 
                        minute later. You’re going to be 
                        fine, Harper.

           Harper gives a weak smile just as the bell rings. Sullivan 
           waits at the door to hand out yearbooks to exiting students. 
                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        Who wants to smile at memories! 
                             (seeing Harper)
                        Harper! Time-capsule?

           Sullivan holds out a yearbook which Harper accepts.

           The music is BUMPIN’. The lights are STROBIN’. The Prom Limo 
           is full of Harrington’s hottest hotties. The High Court. 

           Miwa and Darrah take a droll selfie. Caleb whispers something 
           naughty in Ashley’s ear. Christian and Tiffany make out. 

           Bertie and April hold hands and look out the window sulkily. 

                                 APRIL
                        I can’t believe the year is ending 
                        like this. 

                                 BERTIE
                        I know, but we’ll have fun 
                        tonight... Right? 

           April doesn’t answer. 

           INT. WEST HOUSE - HARPER’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Harper lays on her bed, scowling at the Instagram of Ollie 
           and Ava. She switches gears, flipping through her yearbook. 
           She looks at pictures of her, Diego, April and Bertie. 

           Dean knocks on the open door. Harper looks up.

                                 HARPER
                        Have I been a nightmare lately?

                                 DEAN
                        Teens are nightmares. That’s why 
                        when you hit puberty, adults lock 
                        you all up in high school. 

           Dean smiles but Harper doesn't. He sits down on Harper’s bed.
                                 DEAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. Will I ever go on a 
                        Harper vacation again? Probably 
                        not. But you’re allowed to screw 
                        up. Especially now. No matter how 
                        good or bad it gets, one day high 
                        school will fade into a rosy, if 
                        still traumatic memory. 

                                 HARPER
                        That’s kind of what I’m afraid of.

                                 DEAN
                        One day, when your body chemistry 
                        evens out, you will love not being 
                        able to remember what it’s like to 
                        be a teenager... but while you’re 
                        still in the thick of it, you might 
                        want to say hi to the cutie 
                        standing on our lawn. 

           Harper looks confused. Suddenly the jammin’ vibrations of 
           Cher’s “If I Could Turn Back Time” float through the window. 

           EXT. WEST HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Harper sticks her head out the window. Diego holds a portable 
           speaker over his head a la Say Anything. 

                                 DIEGO
                        I don’t care if you’re Prom Queen 
                        or if we dance alone all night! And 
                        I don’t know what will happen next 
                        year or the year after that! If 
                        you’ll get white dreads or trade me 
                        in for Diego 2.0. All I know is 
                        when you’re old and gray and trying 
                        to remember high school, I want you 
                        to remember going to Prom with me! 

           Harper breaks into a smile.

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH GYM - NIGHT

           Light flashes out of the windows of the gym. Muffled music 
           blares. Balloons spelling out PROM are tied to the staircase.

           COUPLES and GROUPS spill from their cars into the gym. ONE 
           KID puts out her cigarette on the “O” balloon, popping it. 
           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH GYM - FUTURE TUNNEL - NIGHT

           The hallway outside the gym has been converted into a papier-
           mâché and Party City disco ball version of the Tunnel in 
           Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. 

           UNDERCLASSMEN VOLUNTEERS hold fans to create a wind tunnel. 

           Something like a remix of “Virtual Insanity” by Jamiroquai 
           blasts as the seniors make their grand entrance through the 
           tunnel, which spits them out into--

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH GYM - PROM NIGHT

           We’re back to Prom Night! Same ill-fitting tuxedos, same 
           bedazzled dresses. 

           The gym is made over in a very homemade “The Future” theme. 
           Glow sticks litter the floor, kids pose with robot cut-outs.

           Tovah stomps around cleaning up crumbling decorations.

           KIDS sloppily eat from a chocolate fountain then promptly get 
           in line to see Dr. V who uses a Tide Stick to get stains out.

           Jerry Riggs deejays in a fedora, tries to hype up the crowd. 

                                 JERRY 
                        There’s a hundo p chance we’re 
                        about to get turnt!

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        And here we are. Back to where we 
                        started. But now burdened with 
                        backstory.

           Ava sits at the Royal Round Table, surrounded by the High 
           Court: Christian with Tiffany, Darrah and Miwa both with 
           septum pierced TWIN ART BOYS, and a sullen April and Bertie.

           A steady flow of people greet Ava: compliment her dress, ask 
           her to sign yearbooks, tell her she has their vote for Queen.

           Meanwhile, April grumpily checks her phone and the door.

                                 BERTIE
                        April, can we have a good time? We 
                        can’t do anything about Harper--

                                 APRIL
                        But it’s Senior Prom. We’ve talked 
                        about this since fourth grade when 
                        we watched Carrie at a sleepover.
           ACROSS THE ROOM: Kilgallen mans the punch table in a lady 
           suit. Ollie walks up, swilling his cup of foamy pink liquid.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Shouldn’t you be with your date?

                                 OLLIE
                        It’s a lavender marriage, hence the 
                        boutonniere.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Are you going to miss this at all? 

                                 OLLIE
                        Are you kidding? On the way in here 
                        I saw kids alternating shots of 
                        tequila and the caf’s beef chili. 

           Ms. Kilgallen looks at Ollie. His face softens. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Against my better judgement, there 
                        are things I will miss.

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Me too. 
                             (Off Ollie’s face)
                        I just gave my notice. You were 
                        such a nightmare that I started 
                        writing again. A book actually.

                                 OLLIE
                        So I was an inspiration. Is it 
                        about a young gay navigating his 
                        way through adolescence?

                                 MS. KILGALLEN
                        Close! It’s a dystopian lesbian 
                        robot romance called LGBTQ-AI.

                                 OLLIE
                        I’m happy for you, Karen. 

           They clink their plastic cups in a toast. 

           ACROSS THE ROOM: Harper nervously emerges from the tunnel, 
           arm in arm with Diego.

                                 DIEGO
                        None of these people matter, okay?

           Harper tries to believe him, but everyone is staring at her.
           Ava excuses herself from her table and beelines for Harper. 
           Harper takes a deep breath, readying herself. 

                                 AVA
                        Can’t believe you showed your face.
                             (eyes Diego)
                        Bringing my sloppy seconds seems on 
                        brand though.

                                 HARPER
                        You know Ava, I’ve been so scared 
                        for high school to end but 
                        honestly, every time I see you, I 
                        can’t wait for college. 

           Before Ava can retort, Harper grabs Diego’s hand. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I came here to party.

           Harper drags Diego to the dance floor and they start burning 
           it the fuck down. This is why they’re Harrington’s It Couple.

           Ollie watches from the punch table. 

           Watches as Harper and Diego dance like nobody is watching, 
           perhaps the hardest thing for a teenager to do. 

           Watches as Ava monologues to her mostly unhappy table.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        I don’t know if it was the wine-
                        drunk feeling I got from actually 
                        being wine-drunk or I was getting 
                        soft in my old age, but I suddenly 
                        realized how much I was going to 
                        miss Harper West.

           Ollie takes it all in, then nods, takes a deep breath, downs 
           his punch and marches over to his seat next to Ava. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Hello prom date, dear. A word?

           They both lightly scoot their chairs back, leaning together.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the deal. You’re going to 
                        stand up, you’re going walk back 
                        through the tunnel and you’re going 
                        to disappear into the night. I will 
                        never tell a soul and you will 
                        enter into Harrington Myth. Stay 
                        and I publish my article. 
           Ava simpers, not shaken by this at all. 

                                 AVA
                        Oh Ollie, sweet, dear, fake Ollie. 
                        I expected some last minute show of 
                        faux-gallantry. You have a deranged 
                        idea that you’re a victim in all of 
                        this. Like a brave little high 
                        school crusader. But you’re not. 
                        And you won’t tell anyone.

           Ava condescendingly pats Ollie’s cheek.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        Here’s what will actually happen. 
                        They’ll announce my nom de plume, 
                        and I’ll bring you on stage with 
                        me. Rising together and sharing the 
                        crown, just like we always planned. 

           Ollie looks at Ava longingly, like this is all he wants. 

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        Because you and I are the same, 
                        Ollie and it doesn’t make us 
                        villains. It makes us honest.

           Ava casually leans back to the table, leaving Ollie shaken. 

           The music ends. A distinctive clink of a fork on glass.

           Everyone clears the floor, including Harper and Diego, who 
           wind their way to an open table in the back of the room. 

           Sr. Sullivan grabs the mic but we can’t hear what he says. 
           Instead we’re on Ollie, deep in thought. 

           Finally, Sr. Sullivan finishes laughing at his own joke then 
           gets back on track. He lifts up two plastic crowns.

                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        And that’s why I can say with 
                        personal knowledge, how much Prom 
                        King and Queen will mean to you. 
                        Cherish it guys! 

           The BAND gives a light drum roll as Sr. Sullivan fumbles to 
           open the envelope, milking every second.

           Ava straightens out her dress and puts on a Vaseline smile. 
           Harper fidgets in her seat, accepting her fate.
                                 SR. SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
                        This year’s Harrington Queen is... 
                        Ava LaMonte! 

           Suddenly everything slows down. In slow motion we see:

           Ava cups her mouth in overdone surprise. Very Sally Field at 
           The Oscars. She hugs Ollie, grabs his hand, and together, 
           they walk towards the stage. Ollie scans the room as they 
           climb the stairs. 

           The senior class beams at them. Applauding him. Loving him. 
           This is all Ollie has ever wanted. We see close ups of the 
           crowd. They are truly just teenagers... kids. Pimples, 
           braces, ill-advised cummerbunds. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        In that moment, looking around the 
                        room at the wonderful, pimpled, 
                        stressed faces of my peers, I 
                        realized that Ava and I weren’t 
                        alike at all. I was a teenager with 
                        raging hormones, confusing brain 
                        chemistry, and no outlet for my 
                        angst. And she, Ava Schatz, was a 
                        grown adult preying on kids during 
                        their most vulnerable years.

           Ollie pulls his hand away from Ava’s. Ava continues up the 
           stairs without him. Ava looks Ollie directly in the eyes as she 
           takes the mic. But then Ollie is completely forgotten to her.

                                 AVA
                        Let’s give it up for Prom, ya’ll!
                        I’d like to thank all the ladies 
                        out there. I might have the crown, 
                        but we’re all queens! 

           Ava looks directly at Harper, who coldly raises her glass to 
           Ava only to pour the drink out into the flower arrangement. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        And as the sun set on the cruel 
                        experience that is High School, I 
                        realized that all of us, losers and 
                        hotties alike, would go on to 
                        change and evolve and become 
                        different people. Except for one... 
                        The one who is not a teen trouble 
                        maker but a real life villain. 
                                 AVA
                        When I came here, I’d never been to 
                        a real school before, but you made 
                        me feel like I belong!

           Ava forcefully smiles at Ollie, who still stands halfway up the 
           stairs. Ollie smiles back as he takes out his phone and smugly 
           hits a button. A loud NOTIFICATION goes off in the crowd.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        It’s only been 4 months--

           Another notification goes off. A few phones vibrate.

                                 AVA (CONT’D)
                        --but I consider Harrington my home.

           Suddenly phones across the crowd start lighting up, 
           vibrating, chiming. It’s like an amber alert in here. 

           People stare at their phones, no one listens to Ava anymore. 

                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        Hey guys! Let’s make some memories--

           Sr. Sullivan’s phone chimes. He checks it, mesmerized. Ava 
           tries to bumble on, not sure what to do.

                                 AVA
                        But now that I have the crown I... 

           Harper’s phone vibrates. It’s a Harrington Underground update 
           from OLLIE ST. JOHN.

               She makes eye contact with Ollie. He nods for her to open it. 

                     ALL ABOUT AVA LaMONTE: THE 23-YEAR-OLD IMPOSTER. 

           The article follows. Harper’s jaw falls open, she laughs through 
           her shock, then looks at Ollie, who smiles apologetically.

           Sr. Sullivan scrolls through his phone.

                                 SR. SULLIVAN
                        Well this is... troubling. Ava--

           Sullivan looks up only to catch Ava running towards the exit. 

                                 SR. SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
                        Catch that grown up! 

           Coach Wu rips off his bowtie and takes off after her.
           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH GYM - FUTURE TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Ava sprints through the tunnel with one hand on her crown. 

                                 UNDERCLASSMAN
                        Congrats on Prom Queen! 

           Too late, Ava blows out the door. 

           A beat later, Coach Wu comes tearing after her. 

           INT. HARRINGTON HIGH GYM - PROM NIGHT

           Sr. Sullivan stands on stage awkwardly, stalling. 

           Harper walks up to April and Bertie.

                                 HARPER
                             (trying to break the ice)
                        I hate to say I told you so... so I 
                        won’t. I’ll say I’m sorry for--

           April launches into Harper’s arms.

                                 APRIL
                        Oh thank god. We know you’re sorry, 
                        we love you. 

           Harper smiles but turns to Bertie, sobering up.

                                 HARPER
                        Bertie, I’m sorry I almost ruined 
                        your show--

                                 BERTIE
                        Twice.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m sorry I almost ruined your show 
                        twice. How can I make it up to you?

                                 BERTIE
                        Never act in my stuff again and... 
                        get in here.

           Bertie pulls Harper and April into a bear hug. Diego rushes 
           over to join in. It’s a giant pile on.  

           Coach Wu comes back, he raises his arms. A shrug. She’s gone.
                                 SR SULLIVAN
                        Okay well... while Coach Wu 
                        notifies the proper authorities I’m 
                        going to move onto... Prom King?

           A half-hearted drumroll starts but no one is listening.

                                 SR SULLIVAN (CONT’D)
                        Christian Katz...! 

           Christian shrugs and grabs the crown. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Dope! 

           ACROSS THE ROOM: Harper walks up to Ollie at the punch table.

                                 OLLIE
                        Before you thank me, I didn’t do it 
                        for you. Did you read that Pulitzer 
                        shit? I’m going to renegotiate with 
                        Northwestern for a full ride. 

           Ollie glances over at Harper and softens into a smile.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe there’s some popularity award 
                        I can win in college. 

           Ollie and Harper share a smile. Suddenly the music cuts, as 
           Tovah runs on stage.

                                 TOVAH
                        Stop the music! According to Prom 
                        Court rules, if a winner is 
                        disqualified, in this case due to 
                        age, the runner up will be awarded.

           Tiffany Beaver primps herself as--

                                 TOVAH (CONT’D)
                        Harper West? You’re runner-up so... 
                        (searching the crowd)
                        On behalf of the prom committee, 
                        accept this sash.

           Tovah holds up a DIY toilet paper sash that reads: QUEEN. 
           Harper’s face falls in shock, she walks towards the stage.

                                 JERRY RIGGS
                        Oh shit! Another Queen! Can we get 
                        an ID check on her? Ma’am, do you 
                        remember Y2K?
           People circle around Harper. Tovah puts the sash around her. 

           Jerry tosses a mic to Harper. She turns to face the crowd.

                                 HARPER
                        Thanks everyone but... honestly I 
                        don’t really want to be Prom Queen. 
                        I did. I actually wanted everything 
                        about this semester to be perfect.
                             (palming the sash)
                        Which is crazy because... nothing 
                        about high school is perfect. Even 
                        with the best friends in the world--

           Harper looks at April, Bertie and Diego, who smile at her.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Or “popularity”, or Prom Queen. At 
                        the end of the day, a 23-year-old 
                        psychopath systematically ruining 
                        my life feels really on brand for 
                        how horrible high school is.

           Kids and a few teachers cheer. Yeah, high school does suck. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        But a safari ranger once told me 
                        life only gets better from here. 
                        And I don’t know about you but I 
                        can’t fucking wait for the future. 

           Big cheers from the crowd. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        But while I’m temporarily in power, 
                        I suggest we give this sash to the 
                        true Queen of the senior class. 
                             (beat)
                        Ollie... will you accept this roll 
                        of royal TP? 

           Ollie’s face drops, and does a point to himself, like me? 

           He makes his way towards Harper, who removes her sash and 
           places it on Ollie.

           Ollie takes the stage in a daze. 

                                 OLLIE
                        I mean it’s no crown but...

           Christian Katz tosses his crown up to Ollie. 
                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Um... wow... earlier tonight I came 
                        to the conclusion that high school 
                        popularity didn’t matter... because 
                        high school doesn’t define us.
                             (beat, palms his crown)
                        But honestly, now that I’m Queen. I 
                        can confidently say I was wrong. 
                        Being popular rules and has 
                        instantly solved all my problems. 

           Ollie smirks, flipping imaginary hair over his shoulder. 

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what the future will 
                        be like, but fuck me if it’s bad 
                        enough to go back to high school.
                             (beat)
                        I guess what I’m trying to say is, 
                        HAGS bitches, see you at our five 
                        year, I’ll be the one too famous to 
                        show up.

           Ollie blows a kiss to the crowd. And, in a perfect end of 
           senior year way, they love it. Harper leans into the mic.

                                 HARPER
                        Afterparty at my place! 

           The crowd cheers as the sound slowly melts away. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        So there you have it, all along I 
                        was telling you this story to brag 
                        about being Prom Queen. This should 
                        surprise no one. 

           CUT TO BLACK... FOR A LONG BEAT

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        As if I could resist a follow up. 

           EXT. HARRINGTON HIGH - LACROSSE FIELD - GRADUATION DAY 

           The stands are filled with caps and gowns. A boring BUSINESS 
           MAN jabbers on at the podium but we can’t hear him. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Don’t mind him, that’s just some 
                        local commencement speaker 
                        explaining how ninth grade band led 
                        him to open a super market.

                        But you don’t care what became of 
                        him. You care what became of us.

           April wears a cap painted with her Zodiac sign (Libra, duh). 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        April went to Bard, and just like 
                        she threatened, became a full on 
                        Queer Lit Witch, majoring in 
                        Women’s Studies and flannel. Every 
                        weekend she took the train into the 
                        city to see her very much not a 
                        phase girlfriend, Bertie. 

           Bertie falls asleep then abruptly nods awake. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Who went to NYU for theater. Junior 
                        year she dropped out to become 
                        Bernadette Peters’ assistant, and is 
                        currently about to open her first 
                        one act at the Fringe Festival.

           We move to Diego, cheering on the sidelines.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        The next year, Diego went to Fordham, 
                        played lacrosse, and ate midnight 
                        breakfast any chance he could. He 
                        loves it so much he’s staying to open 
                        a 24-hour diner so he can eat 
                        breakfast anytime he wants. 

           We move to a truly, genuinely happy and relieved Harper. 

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Harper didn’t get into Columbia. 
                        She went to Syracuse where she was 
                        offered a bid to every sorority on 
                        campus but declined in favor of 
                        running campus politics. She now 
                        works for the DA’s office in 
                        Brooklyn, which one could say is 
                        working for a grown-up popularity 
                        contest. But I’m not saying that.

           Ollie sits in the bleachers, relaxed.

                                 OLLIE (V.O.)
                        Oh, and as for Little Ollie St. 
                        John? I went to Northwestern on a 
                        full ride... which I lost when I 
                        wrote an exposé on my advisor’s 
                        kinky internet presence.

                        But it didn’t matter. I graduated 
                        with honors and considered founding 
                        what Karen would call “a merciless 
                        gossip blog” but believe it or not, 
                        I decided to be the bigger person.

           The students walks across the stage, accepting diplomas.

                        And by that I mean, I’m following 
                        the footsteps of investigative 
                        journalist Ronan Farrow, who I will 
                        either marry or kill. Whatever it 
                        takes to be on top, honey.

                        Tonight, at our five-year reunion I 
                        plan to downplay my accomplishments 
                        as a power move. Who cares if I’m 
                        in 30 under 30? And by that I mean, 
                        who cares if I tell them. But if 
                        they find out organically-- like if 
                        a student working the event asks 
                        for my autograph on a copy of 
                        Forbes I gave him along with $50-- 
                        Now that would be something. 

           Everyone throws their caps into the air in pure celebration.

                        As for Ava LaMonte... she was never 
                        seen again. And yes, I’m an 
                        investigative journalist now, and 
                        yes I could easily find her. But I 
                        don’t want to. She lives now only 
                        in high school myth, passed down 
                        from generation to generation... 
                        and in the “scandal” section of 
                        Harrington's Wikipedia.

                        A bottle of Champagne please.

           Harper flashes her smile at a nervous TEENAGE RANGER.

                                 TEEN RANGER
                        Can I see your ID? 
           Harper hands it over. She’s 23 and does live in Brooklyn now. 

           She looks a little more mature and a little less crazy, but 
           hot people don’t age. Dean and Susan smile at her lovingly. 

                                 DEAN
                        I remember my high school reunion.

                                 HARPER
                        I thought you refuse to go to them?

                                 DEAN
                        That’s because at my ten-year I 
                        smoked a J behind the bar, set off 
                        the fire alarms and was accused of 
                        coming back from the grave to haunt 
                        Principal Tomlin. My photo was on the 
                        deceased table. Who knew?

                                 HARPER
                        Who knew that you were a ghost? 

           Dean shrugs. Susan considers responding but moves on.

                        Will April and Bertie be there? 

                                 HARPER
                        April got in last night and Bertie 
                        is flying in from Edinburgh, I 
                        think she gets in at eight. 

           The Teen Ranger returns with champagne. 

           The Wests hold the glasses in a toast, but Harper freezes. 

           She sees her: AVA LaMONTE. 

           Harper blinks hard and looks again. It’s... not Ava? 

                                 SUSAN
                        Everything okay, sweetie? 

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah... it’s just. Never mind.

           It’s just a FACELESS TEEN. Harper breathes a sigh of relief.  

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m just so glad I’m not in high 
                        school anymore. 

                                                               THE END!
