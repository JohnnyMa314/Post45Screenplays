           FADE IN:

           INT. BREEDING SHED - DAY

           A large, rustic barn of rough-hewn timbers and aged wood. 
           Raked dirt floor. Morning sunlight blades through open 
           windows, catching nervous swirls of dust. 

           Double doors open from an adjacent paddock... 

           A gorgeous seal brown ARABIAN MARE emerges. Her perfect, 
           flowing mane spills over, shining brilliantly, as her hooves 
           clap proud across the dusty earth. 

           A creature of incredible power and beauty. 

           Beside her, a rugged, experienced HANDLER leading her reins. 
           His soft, sensitive eyes watch her every move (we’ll call him 
           “SOFTIE” for now). 

           He jogs the mare in a lazy circle.  

           The mare NICKERS, excited. A bit flustered. She’s in estrous 
           (heat) and, just like us, those hormones can cause some 
           acting up. 

           The mare kicks out -- her hind hooves like the force of 
           jackhammers. 

           Softie drops the reins, evades her kick. Doubles back and 
           snatches them up again, resuming control, and easing her 
           down. Never too forceful. A balancing act.  

           These two have a connection.

           He whispers to her, petting her mane. Brings the mare back to 
           a peaceful state. Then --

           Softie glances toward the paddock. Gives a cautious nod. A 
           hint of fear in his eyes. Fear for her. For what’s about to 
           happen...    

           OTHER HANDLERS enter the shed. They accompany a mighty, black 
           PRIZE STALLION. 

           A brooding, ominous presence about the stud. He moves slow. 
           Lumbering. Possessed. 

           The mare WHINNIES at the sight of him. Juts backward, 
           hesitant. Softie stumbles with her AND --
           Oh shit... Almost gets his foot caught under her hoof. He 
           slips from harm’s way just in time, then motions to the other 
           handlers: keep him back. 

           The stud’s handlers oblige, keeping him at a distance. 

           Softie lets the mare settle as the stallion eyes her, 
           smelling her estrous scent. 

           The stallion’s gaze, unnerving. Hungry. 

           Softie takes the mare for another circle, then brings her 
           back around, offering her tail end to the stallion. 

           As Softie whispers to her, the mare senses the stallion 
           approach and whips her tail to the side... a gesture that 
           signals she’s ready to mate.  

           The stud’s handlers bring him in closer, checking his 
           underside to make sure he’s hard.

           He is.

           The stallion rears up on hind legs to mount her (a live 
           cover).      

           The mare bucks in discomfort as the stallion’s front hooves 
           slide over her, his weight bearing down on her. 

           Softie gives the mare all his attention as --

           The stud’s handlers insert the stallion into the mare (no 
           bullshit, they actually do this). 

           Softie pets the mare as the stallion thrusts into her. Again, 
           a balancing act. 

           The mare NICKERS, agitated. Something’s not right. She starts 
           to buck. 

           The stallion arcs down and BITES AT HER. 

           The mare freaks the fuck out. SCREAMING. KICKING.

           The stud’s handlers try to pull the stallion off, but he 
           won’t go. Thrusting. Primal. Vicious.  

           Softie SCREAMS at the stallion, batting him away. 

           The stallion stumbles off her. 

           Softie fights to calm the mare, but he loses the reins.

           The mare spins, knocks Softie to the ground beneath her AND -- 
           AAAARRRRGH!

           a HOOF comes crashing down on his face --

           SPLASH! A TIRE hits a puddle spitting muddy water against a 
           road sign:

                                 WELCOME TO THE BERKSHIRES
                             AMERICA’S PREMIER CULTURAL RESORT

           INT. RORY’S VOLVO - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           At the wheel: RORY, 38. Reformed. Recovered. Repentant. Next 
           door: his fiancée, MAXINE. Younger. Yoga-perfect. Plump 
           engagement ring.     

                                 RORY
                        You get the photo? 

           Maxine checks her phone. Opens an OLD PROM PHOTO of Rory and 
           his cute blonde ex-girlfriend (Kelly) from high school. 

                                 MAXINE
                        She’s pretty. 

                                 RORY
                        Yearbook committee voted her Most 
                        Affectionate.   

                                 MAXINE
                        What does she look like now?

                                 RORY
                        Curious about that myself. Her 
                        Facebook’s all horses and Far Side 
                        jokes. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Creepy. 

                                 RORY
                        What? 

                                 MAXINE
                        You don’t think horses are creepy?
                                 RORY
                        Not really.
                             (then)
                        She’s pretty, right?

                                 MAXINE
                        I just said she was.

                                 RORY
                        Oh, I didn’t hear you. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Whatever, I’m not jealous of your 
                        prom date from twenty years ago.  

                           RORY
           I didn’t think you were --   
                                                     MAXINE (CONT'D)
                                              Sounds a little desperate to 
                                              me.  

                                 RORY
                        What?

                                 MAXINE
                        Obviously you’re in need of some 
                        sort of validation. 

           Rory goes silent. 

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                        Look, you’ve worked really hard to 
                        get here. It’s important to stay 
                        focused and honest. What are you 
                        feeling right now? 

           Rory exhales deeply, fighting the words.

                                 RORY
                        I feel like I want a drink. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Good. Work the steps. 

                                 RORY
                        I’m working them. 

                                 MAXINE
                        You’re angry. Why are you angry?

                                 RORY
                        It’s that whole cult mentality 
                        thing. Like I don’t have a say in 
                        what happens to me anymore.
                                 MAXINE
                        You haven’t seen or spoken to her 
                        in twenty years. It’s not like 
                        she’s going to wither up and die 
                        just because you need to get 
                        something off your chest. 

                                 RORY
                        Yeah, but she thinks we’re just 
                        there to catch up. I mean, it’s a 
                        little deceptive.

                                 MAXINE
                        It doesn’t work the same over the 
                        phone. Believe me, I’d rather you 
                        declined the invitation to her 
                        hillbilly horse farm, but 
                        whatever... 

                                 RORY
                        She grew up around horses. She’s 
                        not a hillbilly.

                                 MAXINE
                        Take your time, say what you need 
                        to say, but don’t pussy out.

                                 RORY
                        Yessir, Captain Sobriety!

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Late summer sun blazes over a stately COLONIAL FARMHOUSE 
           surrounded by expansive green fields. 

           A large HORSE STABLE adjacent to the house. Less ‘barn’, more 
           ‘facility’. A professional operation. Horse handlers and 
           grounds crew milling about. 

           Rory’s older-model VOLVO pulls up to an impressive wooden 
           gate (opened). The fence encircles the entire property. 

           Rory and Maxine take in the smack-mouth beauty of the place.  

                                 RORY
                        Guess it belongs to her husband’s 
                        family.  

                                 MAXINE
                        What’s his name again? 

                                 RORY
                        Jeff? George?  
           Someone steps out the front door of the farmhouse. Waves at 
           them from the porch. 

           Rory and Maxine wave back. 

                                 MAXINE
                        You know I love you. Let’s just 
                        stick to the plan, okay?   

                                 RORY
                        I’ll be fine. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I’d rather not stay for dinner if 
                        we can help it.  

                                 RORY
                        Just let me feel it out.  

           Rory drives forward, clutching the wheel white-knuckled.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Rory and Maxine park at the farmhouse. 

           KELLY, 38, strides over, arms outstretched:

                                 KELLY
                        Oh my god, look at you!

                                 RORY
                        Sorry we’re late -- WHOA --

           Kelly wraps Rory in a tight embrace, lifting him off the 
           ground. Once athletic, now more than slightly overweight. New 
           dress. Layers of make-up. She put a lot into this. (Still, a 
           rather blunt evolution from her prom photo.) 

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        So good to see you!

                                 KELLY
                        You’re even more handsome now than 
                        you were twenty years ago!

           Kelly smiles with such emotion some tears dribble down her 
           face. She quickly wipes them away. Noted by Maxine. 

                                 RORY
                        You look great. Seriously.
                                 KELLY
                        Thank you for saying so. 
                             (to Maxine)
                        Hi! I’m Kelly. You’re Maxine?

                                 MAXINE
                        Very nice to meet you, Kelly. 

           They hug. 

                                 KELLY
                             (to Rory)
                        Now, she’s beautiful. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Oh, thank you.  

                                 RORY
                        Quite a place you got here. 

                                 KELLY
                        Isn’t it awesome? It’s great for 
                        the horses. Over thirty acres.    

                                 RORY
                        How many horses?

                                 KELLY
                        One stallion, four mares. 

                                 RORY
                        Lucky guy...

                                 KELLY
                        Come on in. Todd should be back 
                        soon. 

           As they head inside, Maxine looks over at the stable...

           A MAN IN A MASK gapes back at her. Bandages wrapped tight 
           around his head like the fucking Invisible Man. He’s dressed 
           like one of the handlers. Dusty jeans and a wrangler shirt.    

           Maxine double-takes... 

           And then he’s gone. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Kelly leads her guests in. The farmhouse: as lovely inside as 
           out. Crown moulding, braced ceilings, walls adorned with 
           framed B&W PHOTOS, all of them of horses. 
                                 RORY
                        Man, this place is beautiful!

                                 KELLY
                        It’s not easy to keep up. We hire 
                        cleaners, a grounds crew, handlers 
                        for the horses... 

                                 MAXINE
                        Must be expensive. 

                                 KELLY
                        It’s an inheritance. Todd’s mom. 
                        She passed away a few years back.

           They walk through a DINING ROOM with a long mahogany TABLE... 

           A stylized HORSE SYMBOL inlaid in pure ivory across the 
           tabletop. A rendering of an ancient PETROGLYPH. Handmade. 
           Elegant.

                                 RORY
                             (re table)
                        Damn...

                                 MAXINE
                        What this place needs is more 
                        horses!

           Maxine laughs, but Kelly doesn’t. Crickets. 

                                 KELLY
                        Well, they’re our life, really. Our 
                        whole life.

           Maybe a hint of regret in that statement.

                                 RORY
                        So how did you two meet?

                                 KELLY
                        Oh, you know, equestrian circles. 
                        Todd and his mom were highly 
                        regarded breeders.

           They continue into the kitchen... as we admire the oddly 
           fascinating petroglyph.   

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Kelly gazes across the table at Rory as he and Maxine nibble 
           at a light lunch. Maxine’s rock of an engagement ring 
           sparkles in the sunlight.   
                                 KELLY
                        Gosh, your ring is unbelievable. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Thank you. Rory picked it out. 

                                 RORY
                        Uh, with some direction. I’ll be 
                        paying it off until I’m eighty. 

                                 KELLY
                        How long have you been engaged? 

                          MAXINE
           Few months. 
                                                          RORY
                                              Eighteen months.

           Awkward...

                                 MAXINE
                        It’s a work in progress. 

                                 KELLY
                             (to Rory)
                        I was shocked to get your email. 
                        It’s been so long. 

                                 RORY
                        Thought a lot about you over the 
                        years. Always wondered what you 
                        were up to. 

           Kelly smiles, touched.  

                                 KELLY
                        How’s your dad?   

                                 RORY
                        He’s good. You know. Misses mom. 

                                 KELLY
                        And work?

                                 RORY
                        It’s okay. Spreadsheets. Typical 
                        accounting stuff. Boring, actually.

                                 KELLY
                        I never saw you working in an 
                        office.  

                                 RORY
                             (explaining to Maxine)
                        The drama club. I did some plays. 
                                 KELLY
                        Uh, you did musicals, too. And you 
                        were phenomenal in both.  

                                 MAXINE
                        We’ve talked about it. 

                                 RORY
                        Obviously it wasn’t something I 
                        took all that seriously. 

                                 KELLY
                        Super-talented, and you should’ve 
                        told your parents where to stick 
                        it. 

                                 RORY
                        They were just looking out for me. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Exactly. Live in the real world. 

           Some awkward, painful laughs. Maxine catches Rory biting his 
           fingers, a nervous tick. She whispers:

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                        Stop biting. 

           Rory obeys. 

           INT. BATHROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Rory enters, pensive sigh. His index finger, chewed raw and 
           bleeding.

           He washes it in cold water. Then stops suddenly. Shuts the 
           water off, and just stands there. Staring. 

           The weight of this visit bearing down on him. 

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Kelly cracks open a beer. 

                                 KELLY
                        Sure you don’t want one? 

                                 MAXINE
                        No, thank you. We don’t drink. 

                                 KELLY
                        Oh? 
                                 MAXINE
                        Clean and sober.

           As Kelly sits, Maxine rises. Brings her plate to the sink. 

                                 KELLY
                        That’s great! Rory was quite a 
                        party animal when I knew him. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Oh I know. We met in AA. I’m his 
                        sponsor, actually. I know: conflict 
                        of interest.  

                                 KELLY
                        It’s admirable to admit you have a 
                        problem.

                                 MAXINE
                        Life is hard. You start getting 
                        older, realize you can’t do the 
                        same things you did in your 
                        twenties. It just gets ahead of 
                        you. That’s what happened to me 
                        anyway. Well, that and a bad 
                        breakup. Nick... 

                                 KELLY
                        Nick?

                                 MAXINE
                        My ex. He was my soulmate.

           Maxine loses herself in that for a beat. Then:

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                        That is such a pretty dress. Isabel 
                        Marant? 

                                 KELLY
                        APC.

                                 MAXINE
                        Would you mind standing up, just so 
                        I can get a sense for the 
                        tailoring? 

                                 KELLY
                        Oh... sure.

           Kelly stands, faces her. Maxine does a not-so-subtle 
           comparison of their shapes. 
                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        It would look way better on you.  

                                 MAXINE
                        Too sexy. You have to be careful of 
                        that with my job.

                                 KELLY
                        What do you do? 

                                 MAXINE
                        Therapy. MSW.

                                 KELLY
                        Oh, great. 
                             (then)
                        Do you workout? Your body’s 
                        amazing. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Thank you. Yoga. Diet. You have to 
                        keep up with it, or else...   

           They link eyes. Kelly nods, tense.

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                        What about you? Do you work? 

                                 KELLY
                        Riding lessons. Grooming. Some 
                        amateur photography.   

                                 MAXINE
                        No kids? 

           Kelly lingers on that question a beat. Shakes her head no. 

                                 KELLY
                        What about you? 

                                 MAXINE
                        When we’re ready. I have time. I’m 
                        thirty-two. You’re a bit older, 
                        right? Late thirties? 

           Kelly smiles tight. 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Rory exits the bathroom, hears Kelly and Maxine faux-chatting 
           in the kitchen. Saunters further down the hall. 

           Picture frames on each side. More B&W horse photography.  
           He passes a GUEST BEDROOM, then a DEN...  

           At the end of the hall, a door slightly ajar...  

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Rory peeks inside. There’s a large bed, neatly made. Some 
           dusty clothes strewn over a chair. Silver-tipped cowboy 
           boots. 

           A spruce GUN CABINET with beveled glass. Five neatly stored 
           hunting rifles.  

           Rory stares at it. Arched eyes. 

           He moves to the bedside table. A digital camera set on top. 
           High-end.  

           Nosey, he tries the bedside drawer. Inside: Moleskin journal. 
           Breath mints. Fingernail clippers. Lubricant.  

           Rory takes the journal, flips it open. 

           Handwritten passages marked “PRAYER I”, “PRAYER II” and so 
           on. Latin. Carefully transcribed. 

           Rory examines the pages, trying to figure it out. 

                                 KELLY (O.S.)
                        You always were a snoop.  

           Rory flinches, shoves the journal back into the drawer. Faces 
           Kelly at the door, embarrassed.  

                                 RORY
                        Sorry. I’m... shit. You caught me. 

                                 KELLY
                        I’d probably do the same in your 
                        place. 

                                 RORY
                        You probably wouldn’t. My place 
                        isn’t nearly as big. 

                                 KELLY
                        How’s Boston? 

                                 RORY
                        It’s good. Better since I sobered 
                        up. 
                                 MAXINE
                        Maxine mentioned you were in AA. 
                        That’s great, Rory. 

                                 RORY
                        After mom, I kinda hit bottom 
                        and... took a look at my life and 
                        felt... disgust. All the things I 
                        never accomplished. All the people 
                        I hurt. All those years of being so 
                        scared to face it. I didn’t 
                        recognize any part of myself. I 
                        still don’t, for the most part. But 
                        if I can be honest with myself, and 
                        others, if I can stay that way, 
                        maybe things will turn around. 

           Kelly approaches him. Takes his hand. 

           They smile at each other. 

           EXT. ENTRANCE GATE - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           A murder of crows perched on the gate, fighting over some 
           shreds of meat. 

           A PICKUP TRUCK peals through the gate on its way up to the 
           farmhouse. The crows fuck off.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The driver of the parked pickup kicks open the door and 
           hoists out... Kelly’s husband, TODD, 40’s. Portly arrogance 
           busting out of a too-tight flannel. 

           He nods to some of the handlers by the stable, gives an Ozzy-
           like ‘Rock On’ hand sign. 

           The handlers erupt in APPLAUSE. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Kelly gives a back rub to Todd enthroned at the head of the 
           table with a bottle of scotch while...

           Rory and Maxine admire a photo album of Kelly’s horse 
           photography.
                                 RORY
                             (re photos)
                        You took all these? They’re 
                        beautiful. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I could totally see you doing, 
                        like, Hallmark cards for horse 
                        people. 

           Kelly grins to herself, digs her knuckles into Todd’s back. 

                                 TODD
                        UGH, fuck. Go easy, babe. These 
                        overnights are killing me...

                                 KELLY
                             (to Rory and Kelly)
                        Todd’s the breeding expert in these 
                        parts.   

                                 RORY
                        Why overnight?  

                                 TODD
                        Foaling. Delivered a filly at the 
                        Bridges Farm in Fitchburg.  

                                 RORY
                        I used to work third shift at a 
                        firm in Boston. It was rough. 

                                 TODD
                        My grandfather was a logger in 
                        Jackman, Maine. During the war he 
                        worked the shipyards. That’s rough. 
                        That’s the thing today, there’s no 
                        skilled labor. What do you do if 
                        there’s a war?   

                                 RORY
                        Right. 

                                 TODD
                        I’m asking you. What do you do? 

                                 RORY
                        You mean for a job?

                                 TODD
                        I know what you do for a job. Least 
                        I think I do. I’m asking what you’d 
                        do if there’s a war.
           Awkward pause from Rory as he sits across from Todd.  

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        See what I mean? Not judging you. 
                        Just making a point. 
                             (then)
                        So tell me about your job.

                                 RORY
                        Finance. I crunch numbers for an 
                        investment bank. 

                                 MAXINE
                        It means he’s cheap. 

                                 TODD
                        You’re at a desk all day? 

                                 RORY
                        Well, standing desk, thank god. 
                        It’s actually a pretty cool setup --

                                 TODD
                        See, that’s what I mean. People 
                        like you, people who have made a 
                        decision to actually be sedentary --

                                 KELLY
                        I think parents should teach their 
                        kids to follow their dreams. 

                                 TODD
                        It’s about feeling like you’re 
                        contributing in a real way. Someone 
                        like you, I’m not saying you, but 
                        someone like you, would probably 
                        cease to exist if, say, there were 
                        no more computers. 

                                 RORY
                        Take my dad... Machinist, retired 
                        now, but real good with his hands. 
                        Skilled. He wanted his kid to be 
                        the same way...   

                                 TODD
                        And you could’ve if you had some 
                        application. 

                                 KELLY
                        Todd...
                                 RORY
                        Sometimes you want something so 
                        much it ruins your chances of 
                        achieving it. He had zero patience. 
                        It was like he didn’t want to have 
                        to teach it. He just wanted me to 
                        know it. 

                                 TODD
                        Well then he was frustrated for not 
                        realizing his potential.

                                 KELLY
                        Can we talk about something else 
                        please? 

                                 RORY
                        What’s this symbol on the table? 

           Todd receives a quick-fire look from Kelly. 

                                 TODD
                        That’s the Uffington White Horse. 
                        Prehistoric chalk carving in the 
                        English hillside. West Indian 
                        mahogany inlaid with Egyptian 
                        ivory. 

                                 MAXINE
                        What’s the symbolism? 

                           KELLY
                                                          TODD
           It’s just a decoration. 
                                              Epona. Celtic deity. 
                                              Protector of horses.  

           Todd and Kelly share another tense exchange. Todd tips back 
           his scotch. Rises. Taps Rory on the shoulder. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        You workout, dude?  

                                 RORY
                        Yeah, sure.  

                                 KELLY
                        Seriously? Are we doing this now? 

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, we’re doing this now. 
                             (to Rory)
                        C’mon bud.

           Rory stands, slightly begrudgingly, exits with Todd. 
           Kelly lobs a half-smile at Maxine, who sighs to herself 
           knowing it’s just the two of them again.

                                 MAXINE
                        Would you excuse me? I have to make 
                        some calls. 

           Maxine heads out. 

           Kelly takes a big pull from Todd’s scotch. 

           INT. BASEMENT - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Todd leads Rory downstairs into a converted basement.   

                                 TODD
                        Sorry if I was a bit of a prick 
                        back there. Long night... 

                                 RORY
                        No worries. Breeding expert, huh? 
                        Is that like a vet? 

                                 TODD
                        No, it’s like a breeding expert. 
                        Basically I consult. Breeding 
                        season’s February to July.    

                                 RORY
                        Do you get paid? I mean, is it 
                        something you have to do? 

                                 TODD
                        What do you mean? 

                                 RORY
                        Well, you got this massive house. 
                        It’s like an estate. And with the 
                        horses and stuff, I just figured... 

                                 TODD
                        Oh, I see. You think I should just 
                        sit on my ass and live off the 
                        inheritance. 

                                 RORY
                        That’s not what I --

                                 TODD
                        Some people would, I guess. Not in 
                        my nature. That’s kind of what I 
                        wanted to show you down here...
           Todd leads Rory into a home gym area with an odd-looking 
           NAUTILUS MACHINE on rubber mats. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Custom-made. Perfectly calibrated. 
                        Works every muscle group.   

           Rory assesses the machine. Sculpture-like. Artful iron wings 
           blossoming from its core. Twisting Gothic cowls. Intricate 
           and cage-like. It looks ripped from a Tim Burton movie.      

                                 RORY
                        You made this?  

                                 TODD
                        You see a brand name on this 
                        motherfucker?

                                 RORY
                        It’s ... wow ...

                                 TODD
                        Bet I know what you’re thinking: 
                        what’s this fat ass cowboy doing 
                        with state-of-the-art gym 
                        equipment? Am I right?

                                 RORY
                        Wasn’t thinking that at all, man. 

                                 TODD
                        Go ‘head. Give ‘er a spin. What’s 
                        your max, two-fifty? 

                                 RORY
                        Uh, probably closer to two. 

           Rory awkwardly climbs aboard the machine. Grabs the chest 
           press. Grits teeth, popping blood vessels, as he sort of 
           lifts the weight. One sad rep.  

                                 TODD
                        Shit, man. You need some anabol. 

           Rory gets up and Todd takes his place -- but not before 
           sliding the weight pin up to four hundred pounds. 

           He LIFTS IT. Not easily. But not laboriously either. One rep. 
           Two reps. Three reps. Rory looks on. Holy shit. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        You know what that is? Serenity. 
                        Utility. Kelly’s got it, too. Me 
                        and her, we’re like a symphony. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        You got something like that with 
                        Maxine? 

                                 RORY
                        Not really sure I know what you’re 
                        talking about. 

           Todd climbs off the machine, making sure to look Rory 
           straight in the eyes. 

                                 TODD
                        Look, between us: I’d be lying if I 
                        said I didn’t think this was a 
                        little weird, hanging out with my 
                        wife’s ex-boyfriend. I mean, you’ve 
                        been inside her, right? 

                                 RORY
                        Uh...

           Todd LAUGHS, giving Rory a good ‘ol boy slap on the back that 
           hurts.

                                 TODD
                        I’m just messin’ with ya, dude. I 
                        know you fucked her. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Maxine wanders outside, checking her phone. She watches 
           HANDLERS milling about the horse stable. Some of them lead 
           the MARES in a nearby field. 

           Some LAUGHTER draws her to the far side of the stable where a 
           group of handlers mingle by a water trough. One of them in 
           particular catches her eye...

           Jesus... A twenty-something bandana-clad stud-bolt named, of 
           all things, COLT. Shirtless. Full of dirt. Washing himself in 
           the trough, splashing his comrades.  

           Maxine checks to make sure no one’s watching... and SNAPS A 
           PHOTO of him with her phone. 

           She opens the photo and enlarges the image. Water glistening 
           off this criminally hot beefcake. And something else... 
           something on his arm. A tattoo. 

           She enlarges it further. The horse petroglyph. The same 
           symbol inlaid on the dining table. Only it doesn’t look like 
           a tattoo so much as a ... scar ...
                                 COLT (O.S.)
                        Hi there.

           Maxine stifles her flinch, trying to act cool, shoving her 
           phone in her pocket. Colt’s still shirtless. Damn...

                                 COLT (CONT’D)
                        I’m Colt.

                                 MAXINE
                        Obviously. Maxine. 

                                 COLT
                        Kelly’s friend? 

                                 MAXINE
                        Sort of. She and my fiancée went to 
                        high school together. 

                                 COLT
                        Nice! Old flames?

                                 MAXINE
                        Right. So, what do you do? 

                                 COLT
                        Oh I just help out with the horses. 
                        Little of this, little of that. 

           Colt decides to throw on his shirt, but Maxine’s able to get 
           a pretty good look at his arm -- yep, that’s a scar alright. 
           Like he was branded. 

                                 MAXINE
                        That’s a pretty tattoo. 

                                 COLT
                        Oh yeah, the White Horse. They say 
                        it’s magic. It’s not a tattoo, 
                        though. It’s a burn. 
                             (then)
                        Enjoy that photo.

           Maxine stammers awkward -- fuck, he caught me! Colt takes 
           leave, smirking all alpha-male as he scuffs away. 

           Maxine turns from him, flustered. Pulls her phone to delete 
           the photo. Then notices something else in it... 

           In the background behind Colt and the other handlers... the 
           MAN IN THE MASK... Once again staring back at her. WTF...

           BEHIND HER
           Rory steps outside with Kelly and Todd, the hosts in riding 
           gear. Todd with his silver-tipped cowboy boots.

                                 TODD
                        Giddy-on-up, motherfuckers!

           EXT. HORSE FIELD - DAY

           Kelly and Todd ride two ARABIAN MARES over a course of 
           verticals and oxers. Accomplished riders navigating the 
           course with accuracy.  

           Rory and Maxine watch from the fence. Hard not to be 
           impressed. 

           Kelly hits a triple bar and lands perfectly. Waves at them, 
           beaming. In her element.    

                                 RORY
                        She’s amazing, huh? 

                                 MAXINE
                        When are you going to tell her?   

                                 RORY
                        When I’m ready.

                                 MAXINE
                        I don’t like it here.  

                                 RORY
                        Why? 

                                 MAXINE
                        They’re fucking weird, Rory. 

                                 RORY
                        She wasn’t always like this. I 
                        mean, with all the horse stuff... 

                                 MAXINE
                        Those symbols are all over the 
                        house. And one of the handlers has 
                        it burnt into his arm. 

                                 RORY
                        What? What handler?  

                                 MAXINE
                        This guy I ran into outside the 
                        stable. Total beefcake.
                                 RORY
                        “Beefcake”? 

           Maxine smirks as Todd rides over. 

                                 TODD
                        Wanna ride, Maxine? 
                             (pats the horse)
                        Mabel’s a real charmer. 

                                 RORY
                        She doesn’t like horses. Afraid of 
                        them, I guess. 

           Maxine faces Rory. Always up for a challenge. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Rory and Maxine ride the mares with Todd and Kelly walking 
           alongside, leading with the reins. Late afternoon sun burning 
           bright. 

                                 TODD
                        We’re doing a serving tomorrow for 
                        some local mares.   

                                 RORY
                        A serving? 

                                 TODD
                        Late season mares that haven’t 
                        conceived yet. 

                                 KELLY
                        We’ve been having some trouble with 
                        Poseidon, our prize stallion.

                                 RORY
                        Poseidon... cool name. 

                                 TODD
                        He can’t run with our mares. Too 
                        much of a badass. 

                                 RORY
                        So they bring their horses here 
                        to...  

                                 TODD
                        Fuck basically. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Lovely.
                                 KELLY
                        Lot of people don’t like to pasture 
                        breed when you can artificially 
                        inseminate, but we try to do it in 
                        a more controlled environment.   

                                 TODD
                        Conception rates are higher in 
                        pastures. We have a breeding shed 
                        for live cover, but then your 
                        handlers are at risk. Pros and 
                        cons.     

                                 MAXINE
                        It all sounds so... technical. 

                                 KELLY
                             (then)
                        So why don’t you like horses, 
                        Maxine? You have a bad experience? 

                                 MAXINE
                        No, I just --

                                 RORY
                        She thinks they’re creepy. 

           Bitter silence from Maxine. 

                                 TODD
                        Well, they are creepy. People like 
                        to romanticize horses. Like they’re 
                        spirit animals or some shit. But 
                        you get one staring at you, with 
                        those big black pearls that see in 
                        every direction, sends a chill down 
                        your spine like nothing else. If 
                        there’s a Hell, it’s teeming with 
                        fucking horses.

                                 KELLY
                        I think you’re born with a 
                        connection to them or not. Like 
                        something that was meant to be. You 
                        can’t learn it. It just is. Like 
                        soulmates. 

           Maxine fires a look at Kelly.  

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Maxine angrily digs through her bag as Rory sits on the bed, 
           arms folded. 
                                 RORY
                        I’m having second thoughts. It 
                        doesn’t feel right, Maxine. I don’t 
                        want to mess with her like that. 

           Maxine grabs a BOOK from the bag. 

                                 MAXINE
                        How am I supposed to trust you if 
                        you can’t come clean?   

                                 RORY
                        I don’t see how my situation with 
                        Kelly has anything to do with us.   

           Maxine flips open the book - the BIG BOOK (AA’s Twelve Steps 
           tome) - and reads:

                                 MAXINE
                        “Above all, we should try to be 
                        absolutely sure that we are not 
                        delaying because we are afraid.” 

                                 RORY
                        And this is why you don’t get 
                        involved with your sponsor.   

                                 MAXINE
                        “For the readiness to take the full 
                        consequences of our past acts is 
                        the very spirit of Step Nine.”

                                 RORY
                        Make direct amends whenever 
                        possible, except when to do so 
                        would injure them or others.

           Maxine’s speechless for a second. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I don’t believe this. You’re 
                        fucking scared.  

                                 RORY
                        You know how delicate this is. 
                        Kelly’s a total sweetheart, and 
                        she’s obviously still kind of 
                        infatuated with me, or a memory of 
                        me. Confessing a betrayal when 
                        it’ll clearly hurt her is not the 
                        way to go.  

                                 MAXINE
                        You don’t get to decide that.
                                 RORY
                        Not telling her. End of story.

           Off Maxine, eyes piqued in insult -- 

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Kelly and Todd prepare dinner. Rory and Maxine’s inaudible 
           argument tremors through the walls. 

                                 KELLY
                        She’s a disaster. Poor Rory. And by 
                        the way, she’s still in love with 
                        her ex -- “Nick.” 

                                 TODD
                        What about him? Fucking slouch, 
                        wants everything handed to him. 
                        This is the guy you were obsessed 
                        with all those years?

           Todd grabs a salad bowl, hauls it into the --

           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- and sets it on the table. 

                                 TODD
                        Doesn’t seem like the Kelly I 
                        know... 

           Kelly enters with plates of vegetables. 

                                 KELLY
                        He was a significant part of my 
                        life. Can’t you understand that? 

           Todd notes a PACKAGE in golden wrapping paper on the table. A 
           card on top. 

                                 TODD
                        What’s this? 

                                 KELLY
                        A gift. For Rory.

                                 TODD
                        What kind of gift?

                                 KELLY
                        Just something he’ll appreciate.
           Kelly exits. Todd stares at the package. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           A bloody sunset. The farmhouse in hazy silhouette. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Rory unwraps the gift as Kelly looks on, hopeful. Todd and 
           Maxine gnaw on veggies. MUNCH, CRUNCH. 

           Rory opens the box. Finds a colorful ensemble of silk pants, 
           red velvet vest and a fake ruby necklace.  

                                 KELLY
                        It’s your costume from The King and 
                        I.

                                 RORY
                        Oh... Awesome!

           Todd rolls his eyes, gulps his scotch. Pours more.

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        How did you...?

                                 KELLY
                        I asked Mr. Flynn. He knew we were 
                        dating; gave me the costume. I said 
                        I was your biggest fan. And I am. 
                        ... Was.

                                 MAXINE
                        Cute. And you kept it all this 
                        time...

                                 RORY
                        Thank you, Kelly.  

                                 TODD
                        You shave your head? To play The 
                        King?

                                 RORY
                        Uh, no. Thought about it, but...

                                 TODD
                        Didn’t want to commit? 

                                 RORY
                        Didn’t want to emulate Yul Brynner. 
                                 KELLY
                        King Mongkut wasn’t bald, actually.

                                 MAXINE
                        He also wasn’t a white kid from 
                        Beverly.

                                 RORY
                        We didn’t have that many Thai kids 
                        in my school. Did you?

                                 MAXINE
                        I went to a science and technology 
                        school, so yeah, I did, actually. 

                                 TODD
                        Plenty of other musicals out there 
                        that don’t inspire whitewashing.

                                 MAXINE
                        Exactly. Thank you. 

                                 KELLY
                        Anyway, Rory, it was just something 
                        I thought you’d enjoy. 

                                 RORY
                        It’s awesome. Really. Thank you. 

           Rory and Kelly share a warm smile. 

                                 TODD
                             (to Maxine)
                        So who’s this Nick character? 

                                 MAXINE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 TODD
                        That his name? Nick? 

           Maxine sets her eyes on Kelly. 

                                 RORY
                             (to Maxine)
                        How’s he know about Nick? 

                                 MAXINE
                        I... must’ve mentioned him at some 
                        point. 
                             (to Todd)
                        He’s an ex. 
                                 TODD
                        Gotta love those exes. They do not 
                        go gentle into the night. 
                             (then)
                        You folks religious?

                           RORY
           No.
                                                         MAXINE
                                              As it relates to the program 
                                              we are. We’re in AA.

                                 TODD
                        AA? Huh. Well, I guess that makes 
                        sense. You haven’t touched a drop. 
                        My father did it for twelve years. 
                        One day he turned to me, drunk as a 
                        syphilitic pirate, having just beat 
                        the shit out of my mother, and 
                        said: “What problem?” 

           Todd belts a hearty LAUGH. He’s the only one.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I was just going to make 
                        the point that moving on requires 
                        faith. Worship. 

                                 RORY
                        I’m comfortably secular, thanks. 

                                 TODD
                        You don’t seem comfortable. 

                                 KELLY
                        He is comfortable, Todd. Just cuz 
                        you’re not...

                                 TODD
                        I think the secular perspective 
                        lacks eternal wisdom, that’s all. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Rory, maybe this is a good time to 
                        tell them why we’re really here.

           Awkward pause as Rory and Maxine exchange silent threats.

                                 TODD
                        Oh? 

                                 RORY
                        It’s nothing. 
                                 MAXINE
                        We believe in the steps. We believe 
                        in earnestly asking for God’s help 
                        and guidance. 

                                 KELLY
                        I’m sorry. I don’t know what we’re 
                        talking about so I’m just going to 
                        clear some of these plates. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Tell her, Rory. 

           Rory glares at Maxine. 

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                        Tell her.

                                 KELLY
                        Tell me what? 

           A long, squeamish pause. 

                                 RORY
                        Part of working the steps is making 
                        amends to the people we’ve hurt. 
                        I’ve been doing that over the past 
                        six months or so, kind of working 
                        backwards on a time line. And you 
                        were the last person on my time 
                        line. 

                                 KELLY
                        I mean... you left for college. I 
                        was hurt, but it’s not something 
                        you need to make amends for, Rory. 

                                 RORY
                        I cheated on you. 

                                 KELLY
                        ...What?

                                 RORY
                        Pretty much the whole time we were 
                        together. Three years or so.

           Beat.  

                                 KELLY
                        Wait... What? 
                                 MAXINE
                        Your whole relationship was pretty 
                        much a lie. Look, it was a long 
                        time ago. I’m not saying it isn’t 
                        important, but I think we can all 
                        put it into perspective. Rory’s 
                        trying to better himself and I 
                        applaud that. I hope you can too. 

           Ouch. Kelly looks frozen in fucking carbonite.

           Todd catches eyes with Rory. Something cold, decisive and 
           dangerous in it.  

           Kelly blurts an incredulous chuckle. Eyes well with unwanted 
           emotion. 

           Todd slowly, very slowly, CLAPS... 

           CLAP. CLAP. CLAP. CLAP. CLAP.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Kelly shoves out the front door. Heartbreak in her eyes. Rory 
           steps out after her. 

                                 RORY
                        Kelly?

                                 KELLY
                        You should go, Rory.

                                 RORY
                        I just wanted to --

                                 KELLY
                        It’s not a big deal. It was so long 
                        ago. It’s just awkward, you know? 

                                 RORY
                        I didn’t want to say anything. I 
                        didn’t want to hurt you.  

                                 KELLY
                        Like I said, not a big deal. It was 
                        good to see you. Make sure you take 
                        your costume. 

                                 RORY
                        I went through some tough years as 
                        a kid. Had some bad things happen 
                        to me. Never told anybody about it. 
                                 KELLY
                        Bad things?

                                 RORY
                        I don’t want to make it sound like 
                        some bullshit excuse. 

                                 KELLY
                        No, we wouldn’t want that.

                                 RORY
                        An older kid. Neighborhood kid. He 
                        made me do things I didn’t want to 
                        do, so I was sexualized at a young--  

                                 KELLY
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 RORY
                        It’s true. 

                                 KELLY
                        I know all about bad things that 
                        happen. Bad things you don’t tell 
                        anybody about. Especially after 
                        confessing what you just did.  

                                 RORY
                        Kelly, I loved you. As much as a 
                        sixteen-year-old knows what that 
                        is, I loved you. I just had no idea 
                        how to respect you.   

                                 KELLY
                        You still don’t. 

           Kelly continues to the stable. Storms past a crew of handlers 
           hanging out by the fence, smoking weed. 

           Colt’s there. He nods hello but she doesn’t acknowledge him. 
           Obviously pissed. Colt looks over at Rory, accusatory. 

           Rory drops his head, what a fucking disaster. 

           INT. HORSE STABLE - NIGHT

           Kelly leans against the stall, quietly sobbing. Lights on 
           bright in here to simulate longer days and trigger estrous. A 
           MARE whinnies. Nudges her. Kelly pets the horse. 

           Not surprisingly, the stable’s in immaculate shape. Slate 
           stone walls with wrought iron box stalls. Beveled glass and a 
           vaulted ceiling of cherry oak stretching to infinity.
           Then... 

           WHISPERS float into the space. Barely audible at first, then 
           growing louder, more insistent. Coming from another 
           paddock... 

           Kelly shuts her eyes. 

           The whispers soon become GASPS. Louder, harsher. Tormented 
           cries.

           Kelly covers her ears, trying to drown it out, as it reaches 
           a high pitch AND:

                                 COLT (O.S.)
                        Kell? 

           The whispers CUT OUT sharply. Kelly wipes her eyes as Colt 
           approaches.

                                 COLT (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 KELLY
                        Feel like I’m in high school all 
                        over again. Crazy, right? So long 
                        ago. It’s just so stupid. 

                                 COLT
                        It’s not stupid. Hell, you never 
                        forget your first. 

                                 KELLY
                        I’ve always liked the douchebags.

                                 COLT
                        We’re typically more interesting.  

           Kelly smirks. Colt takes her hand. 

                                 COLT (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let him see you.  

                                 KELLY
                        No, don’t bother him. 

                                 COLT
                        Aw hell, he don’t care none. Mares 
                        been teasin’ him all day... 

           Colt leads Kelly past the mare stalls, the horses staring at 
           them, heads turning as they go. Toward... 
           The STALLION PADDOCK. Above the doorway, the horse petroglyph 
           carved into a slab of mahogany.

           Four additional stalls, but just one horse back here -- the 
           PRIZE STALLION. POSEIDON. 

           His pitch black coat like a void gleaming in the artificial 
           light. An unnatural stillness about him. As if he’s just... 
           watching them. Calculating.

           Kelly observes him, cautiously. 

                                 KELLY
                        It’s getting worse. The voices...

                                 COLT
                        Yeah... Not ideal.    

                                 KELLY
                        It never happened before. Only 
                        since the offerings ramped up. 

                                 COLT
                        You know how many we got out there 
                        now?

                                 KELLY
                        Running out of rocks. 

                                 COLT
                        Todd’s probably gonna talk to me 
                        about your friend.  

                                 KELLY
                        I’m sure he will.     

                                 COLT
                        What do you want me to do?  

                                 KELLY
                        Nothing. Roll with it. We’ll see 
                        what Poseidon wants.

                                 COLT
                        I got some “friends” coming over 
                        tonight. Should I cancel? 

                                 KELLY
                        No... at least someone should have 
                        some fun around here.

           Off the stallion -- his glistening eyes gazing upon them.
           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Maxine helps Todd clear the table.  

                                 MAXINE
                        I want to apologize for Rory...

                                 TODD
                        So all this “catching up” was just 
                        pretense, huh?    

                                 MAXINE
                        It’s supposed to be face-to-face. 

                                 TODD
                        Courageous.     

                                 MAXINE
                        I think there’s something to be 
                        said for looking someone in the 
                        eye. Don’t you? 

                                 TODD
                        You bet your perky little tits I 
                        do.

           Maxine sets the dishes down.

                                 MAXINE
                        Well. I guess I should be going. 

           Todd smiles petulant. Unnerved, Maxine quickly exits. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Maxine grabs her bag, getting ready to leave AS --  

           Todd moves into the doorway.

           Maxine stops. A beat. Offers her hand to shake.

                                 MAXINE
                        Thank you for your hospitality. I’m 
                        sorry it couldn’t be under better 
                        circumstances.

           Todd accepts. A firm grip.

                                 TODD
                        You know that song “Policy of 
                        Truth”? 
                                 MAXINE
                        Duran Duran?

                                 TODD
                        Depeche Mode. 

                                 MAXINE
                        What about it?

                                 TODD
                        Just feels appropriate.

           Maxine pries her hand away, waits for Todd to move aside. But 
           he doesn’t budge. 

           And now Maxine gets her shrink on.

                                 MAXINE
                        You know, Todd, I’m the last person 
                        you want to fuck with. I clocked 
                        your inadequacies the second you 
                        parked your silly, provincial ass 
                        at the table.   

                                 TODD
                        Is that right?

                                 MAXINE
                        It’s something men like you never 
                        seem to figure out until it’s too 
                        late: porn rewires your frontal 
                        cortex so that the only way you can 
                        get it up is if you’re watching a 
                        bunch of hard, perfect dicks fire 
                        loads into girls half the size of 
                        your wife’s thighs. It’s an 
                        addiction. And it can be solved 
                        much in the same way Rory is 
                        solving his. By facing the truth.    

           Todd’s eyes go blank. For a moment it seems like he might 
           take a swing at her... 

           But then he counters with a fake, distant smile. Shit, he’d 
           be lying if he said he wasn’t impressed.  

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Maxine stomps outside, finds Rory leaning against the Volvo, 
           pissed.    

                                 MAXINE
                        Ready to go? 
                                 RORY
                        I told you I didn’t want to tell 
                        her. I told you. 

                                 MAXINE
                        And? 

                                 RORY
                        And what? What the fuck kind of 
                        sponsor are you, Maxine? 

           Todd slinks up behind them. 

                                 TODD
                        You folks know anything about 
                        eugenics? Or paganism? 

           Their voices overlapping:

                                                      TODD (CONT'D)
                                              Been around a long time. 
                                              Older than Jesus...
                          MAXINE
           It’s done, Rory. Okay? Let’s 
           just get the fuck out of here 
           please. 

                           RORY
                                                      TODD (CONT'D)
           I really don’t want to go 
           anywhere with you.  
                                              Something goes wrong, we 
                                              don’t “ask for guidance” from 
                                              some holy ghost...  

                          MAXINE
                                                      TODD (CONT'D)
           What, you wanna stick 
           around...for this? 
                                              But we do reconcile. We do 
                                              quite a bit of reconciliation 
                                              around here.

                                 MAXINE
                        That’s great, Todd. I can tell 
                        you’re really on top of things. 

                                 KELLY (O.S.)
                        Everything okay? 

           Kelly walks over.  

                                 MAXINE
                        We were just leaving. 

           Kelly glances at Rory, who can barely look at her. 

                                 KELLY
                        You forgot your costume.  

           Kelly runs into the house. 
           Another supremely awkward beat with Todd staring down the 
           guests. 

           Eventually, Maxine decides to wait in the car. 

           Now it’s just Rory and Todd. 

                                 RORY
                        Look, man, I’m sorry it went down 
                        like this. It’s been a real battle 
                        for me with the program and --

                                 TODD
                        Fate brought you here, Rory. It 
                        wasn’t your precious twelve steps. 

           Rory meets Todd’s gaze. 

           Kelly comes back out with the costume. Hands it off. 

                                 KELLY
                        You’re still the most talented 
                        person I’ve ever met. Nothing will 
                        ever change that. 

           Kelly gives him a quick hug. Rory’s a lump of self-loathing, 
           but he works a thankful smile. 

                                 RORY
                        It was really good to see you, 
                        Kelly. I’m really sorry. 

           With that, Rory climbs into the Volvo, starts the engine and 
           backs out, revealing...

           A black puddle of oil dripping from the undercarriage. 

                                 TODD
                        Like I said... 

           Rory and Maxine get about twenty yards down the driveway 
           before the car seizes up and sputters the fuck out. 

           Todd cracks a shiteating grin and kicks some dirt over the 
           oil slick.

           Kelly looks back at him.  

           INT. RORY’S VOLVO - CONTINUOUS

           Rory tries the engine over and over. It won’t go. Thick smoke 
           bleeds from the hood as Maxine borders on eruption. 
                                 MAXINE
                        No way. No fucking way. Somebody 
                        did this to us. He did this... 

                                 RORY
                        Calm down please. 

                                 MAXINE
                        He did this!

                                 RORY
                        It was my fault.

           Maxine’s got lasers shooting out her eyes.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Kelly powers up an electric tea kettle. Packs loose leaf tea 
           into an infuser. Rory’s on his phone as Maxine eyeballs him 
           from the doorway and Todd washes his oily hands in the sink.    

                                 MAXINE
                        You “Googled it”?

                                 RORY
                        I was trying to save money.

                                 MAXINE
                        It’s an oil change.

                                 RORY
                             (into phone)
                        ...No, the oil cap is gone. There’s 
                        oil all over the engine and, and...
                             (to Todd)
                        What happened again?

                                 TODD
                        It starved the pump. 

                                 RORY
                             (into phone)
                        It starved the pump... 

           Todd grabs a beer from the fridge and cracks it open in front 
           of Maxine, spraying her with the spit from the can.

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                             (hanging up)
                        Triple A can’t get out here until 
                        tomorrow. 
                             (off Maxine)
                        I fucked up, alright?
                                 MAXINE
                        Call a Lyft.

                                 RORY
                        Back to Boston? It’s a hundred-and-
                        fifty miles. What about my car?

                                 MAXINE
                        I’ll be waiting outside.  

                                 KELLY
                        You don’t have to wait outside. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I’d prefer it, actually. 

           Maxine directs her ire at Rory, then Todd, and bolts. 

                                 KELLY
                        There’s a hotel a few miles --

                                 TODD
                        Aw, Kell, come on. They’re guests. 
                        They should crash here for the 
                        night. 

                                 RORY
                        Uh, yeah, that’s probably not the 
                        best -- 

                                 KELLY
                        It’s late... and getting a car 
                        service out here is like... 

                                 TODD
                        Hey you guys should stick around 
                        for the serving tomorrow.

                                 RORY
                        I’m sure Maxine would love that.

                                 TODD
                        It’s a hell of an experience. 

                                 RORY
                        I’m sure it’s fascinating, I just 
                        think Maxine would --

                                 TODD
                        She can’t decide everything for 
                        you, right? Or can she?  

                                 KELLY
                        Todd...
                                 TODD
                        Alright, whatever. I got some 
                        things to do in the shed. You 
                        decide on a hotel, I’ll give you a 
                        lift. Let me know.  

           Todd gives Kelly a deep, forceful kiss that makes both Kelly 
           and Rory uncomfortable. 

           The kettle SCREAMS and clicks off. Todd separates from Kelly 
           and exits. 

           Kelly and Rory face each other. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Maxine’s sitting on the steps with her phone as Todd shoves 
           out the front door scaring the shit out of her.  

                                 TODD
                        Tough day, huh? Been feeling a 
                        little insecure, to be honest. 
                        Those two really have a connection, 
                        huh?  

           Todd and Maxine share a beat of pensive silence over it. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                             (then)
                        Greenleaf Farm’s going artificial 
                        with their broodmare. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Like I know what a “broodmare” is. 

                                 TODD
                        Oh I’m sorry. Figured it was 
                        obvious. It’s a horse used for 
                        breeding. 

                                 MAXINE
                        How wonderful for her.

                                 TODD
                        If you see Colt around, tell him I 
                        need him in the shed. He’s usually 
                        down at the fire pit, smoking 
                        bowls. 

           Todd points to the back of the house and heads to the stable.

           Off Maxine -- 
           INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Kelly sips her tea while Rory lingers in the doorway. 

                                 RORY
                        I’m so sorry, Kelly. I didn’t want 
                        it to come out like that.  

                                 KELLY
                        It was difficult to hear, but I 
                        really do appreciate your honesty.    
                             (then)
                        Who was it? I mean, just curious. 
                        The girls you were with?

                                 RORY
                        You know. Like I said, it was over 
                        the course of -- 

                                 KELLY
                        Allison? Allison Ames?

                                 RORY
                        To be honest, I’m surprised you 
                        never knew.

                                 KELLY
                        She was my best friend! Was it like 
                        a one-time thing or -- 

                                 RORY
                        I was basically drunk throughout 
                        high school --

                                 KELLY
                        We all were. We were getting drunk 
                        and stoned every weekend.

                                 RORY
                        Yeah, but that was me during the 
                        week. 

                                 KELLY
                        Yeah, but did that mean you had to 
                        go and fuck all my friends? 

                                 RORY
                        They weren’t your friends. Neither 
                        was I. 

           The rub. They’re staring at each other. 

           Rory looks away. Notes a framed knitted panel on the wall -- 
           the horse petroglyph. 
                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        So this White Horse thing... 

                                 KELLY
                        I know. It’s... different.

                                 RORY
                        Which is totally fine, it’s just  
                        not how I remember you.

                                 KELLY
                        We have a communal bond with the 
                        horses. To us, they’re purity, 
                        strength and virtue. Virtue above 
                        all else. We worship the goddess 
                        Epona.

                                 RORY
                        Worship like...?

                           KELLY
                                                      RORY (CONT'D)
           Christianity.
                                              Cults?

                                 KELLY
                        Faith. 

                                 RORY
                        Oh. Okay...

           Kelly grabs the bottle of scotch and spikes her tea with it. 
           Rory can practically smell the booze from across the room. 

                                 KELLY
                        I mean, it’s not...

                                 RORY
                        What?

                                 KELLY
                        It’s not necessarily what I 
                        pictured for myself.

                                 RORY
                        What do you mean? 

           Kelly struggles with this. How to put it, how not to put it. 

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        Todd? 

                                 KELLY
                        He’s trying to get me to convert... 
                        it’s complicated. He has a very 
                        rigid belief system. 
                                 RORY
                        Kelly, are you okay? I mean, do you 
                        need help? 

           Kelly looks at him. Rory goes to her. 

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        I want to help you but I need to 
                        know what’s going on. 

                                 KELLY
                        I can’t... I can’t...

           As Kelly tries to stifle her emotion, she and Rory fall into 
           a tight embrace. One that lingers. Pressing into each other. 
           A powerful, nostalgic attraction between them. Still.

           Then:

                                 MAXINE (O.S.)
                        Rory?

           A jolt. Kelly peels away from Rory and runs out as -- 

           Maxine eye-fucks him from across the room. 

                                 RORY
                        She’s upset. 

                                 MAXINE
                        So?

                                 RORY
                        What do you mean, so? 

                                 MAXINE
                        I can’t get a car service, can you?

                                 RORY
                        They offered to put us up for the 
                        night. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Oh, so we’re doing a fucking 
                        sleepover now, is that it?? 

           Rory SHUSHES her, pulls her into the --

           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           -- where they bark at each other in hushed anger:
                                 RORY
                        What do you want me to do? You want 
                        a hotel? How much you think that 
                        costs in The Berkshires?  

           Maxine gives him the finger with her engagement ring. 

                                 MAXINE
                        You want the fucking thing back?    

                                 RORY
                        You know, Maxine, you haven’t made 
                        this very easy on me.

                                 MAXINE
                        On you? Oh I see. A few minutes in 
                        the presence of honesty and we’ve 
                        regressed to narcissism and self- 
                        pity. Sounds familiar...

                                 RORY
                        Okay, you want honesty? Fine. I 
                        want to stay. I want to hang out 
                        with her. Right now, I’m feeling 
                        about this fucking big after you 
                        hijacked my recovery and I’d like 
                        to feel better. How’s that? 

                                 MAXINE
                        Romancing the fat girl you fucked 
                        over in a drunken stupor? So sweet.

                                 RORY
                        Wow, you are such a bitch right 
                        now.

                                 MAXINE
                        We have no reason to stay here. 

                                 RORY
                        I think something’s going on with 
                        Todd, okay? I think he’s in a cult. 
                        I think he’s forcing it on her.   

                                 MAXINE
                        A cult?

                                 RORY
                        A horse cult. A horse worshipping 
                        cult. 

           Maxine stares intense, and then...

           BUSTS THE FUCK OUT LAUGHING.
                                 MAXINE
                        Oh my god, you are in love with 
                        her! I should’ve fucking known!

                                 RORY
                        You’re the one who freaked out over 
                        all the horse shit!

                                 MAXINE
                        You’re the one who’s using it as an 
                        excuse to rub her down! 

                                 RORY
                        I want to help her! I owe it to her 
                        and so do you!

           Maxine glares, tempering herself. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Okay, Rory. You wanna stay? Let’s 
                        stay. 

                                 RORY
                        I need you to be on my side a 
                        little bit here.

                                 MAXINE
                        No, I get it. If she’s in crisis, 
                        we should help her out. It’s only 
                        right. 

           A peaceful beat. Rory vents a charged breath. A battle he 
           thinks he’s won. 

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                        I left my bag in the car. I’m gonna 
                        go grab it. Okay? 

           Rory nods. Maxine gives him a distant kiss and, with that, 
           she’s gone. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Maxine exits, bottled rage. Looks around the back of the 
           house... where Todd mentioned Colt might be... 

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Rory wanders back in. Finds the bottle of scotch on the 
           counter, calling to him.   
                                 KELLY (O.S.)
                        She’s a real firecracker. 

           Rory turns to Kelly, who’s holding a decorative STORAGE BOX 
           in her arms, which she sets down on the kitchen table.  

                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t have put you two 
                        together. 

                                 RORY
                        She’s been good for me in a lot of 
                        ways. Keeps me focused and, you 
                        know, she’s a therapist, so... 
                             (then)
                        Who do you see me with? Out of 
                        curiosity? 

                                 KELLY
                        Someone who appreciates you. 
                        Someone who sees the artist in you.

           Kelly opens the storage box, allowing Rory to see inside... 

           Mix tapes, board games, CDs, journals, empty perfume bottles, 
           folded notes. High school era shit.

                                 RORY
                        Oh... what?? My notes? My mix 
                        tapes? Look at all this stuff!

                                 KELLY
                        Basically everything you ever gave 
                        me. You might even find an STD in 
                        there if you look hard enough.

           He gives her a look. They begin sifting through the box. Rory 
           takes out a folded chess board.

                                 RORY
                        Nice, our old chess set!

                                 KELLY
                        I used to kick your ass. 

                                 RORY
                        Yeah, cuz the loser had to drink. 

           They chuckle morbidly at that fact.
           EXT. TERRACE - NIGHT

           A gorgeous summer night, and out here you can see about a 
           million stars. 

           Maxine follows a cobblestone path to the terrace at the rear 
           of the farmhouse. A fire pit blazes, surrounded by lounge 
           chairs.  

           A MAN with his back turned stands before the fire pit, 
           smoking a jay. Must be Colt. 

           Maxine wanders over... 

                                 MAXINE
                        You wouldn’t happen to be man 
                        enough to know how to fix a ‘96 
                        Volvo, would you? 

           The MAN turns. It’s not Colt... unless his face suddenly took 
           a vicious kick from a horse leaving him horribly disfigured. 

           Maxine GASPS, backpedaling at the sight of him, his face 
           punched in, smeared to the side and framed by a weal in the 
           shape of a fucking horseshoe.  

           Seconds before Maxine belts a scream, Colt runs over:

                                 COLT
                        No, no, no, it’s okay, it’s okay!

           The MAN fumbles something from his pocket and quickly pulls a 
           bandage MASK over his face. Name’s RAYMUNDO, 40’s, a handler 
           (or ”Softie” from the beginning of the movie).

                                 COLT (CONT’D)
                        It’s just Raymundo. He works here. 
                        It’s okay, seriously. He’s cool. 

           Raymundo lumbers off, tugging the mask tight over his head. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I’m sorry. Jesus. I just -- didn’t 
                        expect that. 

                                 COLT
                        Poor Raymundo got kicked in the 
                        face on a serving. Lucky to be 
                        alive. Doctors tried to fix it but 
                        with all the coke he did over the 
                        years his nasal cavity was like a 
                        sinkhole. 
                                 MAXINE
                        Shit... So he just wears a mask 
                        around everywhere? 

                                 COLT
                        Well, yeah. I think he’s more 
                        comfortable with it. He’s a good 
                        dude, though. Loyal. 

           Maxine sighs, plops herself down on a lounge chair. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Our car broke down. Looks like 
                        we’re staying the night so my 
                        fiancée can suck up to his ex-
                        girlfriend. 

                                 COLT
                        You don’t sound too happy about 
                        that. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Would you be? 

           Colt grins, lights a jay.     

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Rory and Kelly play old mix tape tracks on their phones, 
           singing along to the lyrics. They know the words by heart. 

                                 RORY
                        Nice... I still listen to this one. 

                                 KELLY
                        Oh my god, love it!

           Before long, Kelly pulls off her shoes and starts dancing. 
           Rory stays seated, watching her. Enamored.

                                 RORY
                        We went to their concert at the 
                        Garden, remember that? 

                                 KELLY
                        Uh-huh...

                                                     KELLY (CONT'D)
                           RORY
           We took a “limo”!
                                              We took a “limo”!

                                 RORY
                             (laughing)
                        That was friggin’ awesome! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RORY (CONT'D)
                        Those tickets were scalped, too. I 
                        was so impressed with myself...

                                 KELLY
                        I was always so impressed with you. 
                        You were like... I was so into you.

           Their eyes link for an extended beat. But then Rory starts 
           thinking about what a dick he was back then... and looks 
           away.

           The music cuts out as Kelly’s phone BUZZES. 

           She checks the number...

                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, it’s the Bridges Farm, I should 
                        take this. 

                                 RORY
                        Sure. 

           Kelly takes the call in the other room. 

           While she’s gone, Rory keeps looking through the storage box.  
           Memories take him back. 

           He finds a folded piece of notebook paper. Opens it up... 

           A sketch of a monster drawn by Rory in high school. A demon 
           of some sort. Black eyes. Razor jaws. Pale face peppered with 
           lipstick kisses.  

           The handwritten caption over the sketch: 

                                  “I AM DRUNK DEMON...” 

           Rory stares, recognizing it. Disturbed. Then:

                                 KELLY
                             (returning)
                        It’s about the foal. I’ll have Todd 
                        call them back. He’s in the shed.

           She sits to put on her shoes. Rory folds the sketch, stuffs 
           it deep into the box.

                                 RORY
                        Don’t bother, I’ll go. You mean the 
                        stable? 
                                 KELLY
                        Are you sure? Yeah, all the way to 
                        the back. Just tell him Don Bridges 
                        called -- you know what? I’ll go. 

                                 RORY
                        Don’t worry about it. Seriously. 
                        Keep your shoes off. I always liked 
                        your toes. 

           Rory flirts a smile at her as he walks out. 

           After he’s gone, Kelly admires her toes a beat. Then --

           She looks at the chess board displayed on the table. Some of 
           the pieces are missing. She folds the board, drops it into 
           the box. 

           A white pawn falls out. 

           She picks it up, thinking about it. 

           INT. HORSE STABLE - NIGHT

           Rory enters. Lights on in the mares’ paddock. Saunters past 
           the box stalls. The mares gape back at him. Anxious.     

           He moves to the entrance of the... 

           STALLION PADDOCK 

           Glancing at the horse petroglyph above the doorway, Rory 
           enters. 

           Lights on in here as well (artificial light increases sperm 
           count). But cooler. Cold, actually. 

           Passing Poseidon’s stall... The prize horse. Watching him.   
           The big stallion’s stillness, unsettling.   

           A BRIGHT FLASH draws Rory’s attention. He looks to an opened 
           DOORWAY at the end of the paddock... 

           INT. BREEDING SHED - NIGHT

           Large space, vaulted ceiling, dirt floor. Todd wears a 
           welding helmet as he blowtorches the metal frame of some sort 
           of device. 

           When he’s finished, he flips the helmet off and sets the 
           torch down. Grabs a beer from a nearby workbench.   
           Detailed pencil sketches of these “devices” occupy the bench. 

           Rory idles in the doorway. Watches him. Unnoticed. Or so he 
           thinks...

                                 TODD
                        What can I do for you, Rory? 

                                 RORY
                        Oh. Hey. Kelly just wanted me to 
                        let you know that Don Bridges 
                        called about the foal... 

                                 TODD
                        She’s sending you on errands now, 
                        huh? 

                                 RORY
                        What? No, no, I just -- 

                                 TODD
                        Don’t take long, does it? Falling 
                        back into familiar patterns... For 
                        you, though, I imagine that’s the 
                        last thing you wanna do.  

                                 RORY
                        I’m not falling back into -- 

                                 TODD
                        I get it, Rory, I do. I went to 
                        high school, too. It’s hard to 
                        shake. ... Course, my experience 
                        was a little different than most. 
                        We moved around a lot.   

           Rory walks closer, looking for a way to connect with this 
           guy. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Dad was a “man of faith” who didn’t 
                        really know the first thing about 
                        divinity, but used it as a way to 
                        control people. My mom most of all. 
                        He started his own church at one 
                        point.  

                                 RORY
                        Is that what you practice here, 
                        with the horses?  

                                 TODD
                        Kelly tell you that? 
                                 RORY
                        She just said --

                                 TODD
                        To answer your question, no. My 
                        father didn’t have anything to do 
                        with my beliefs. Least not 
                        directly.  

                                 RORY
                        But indirectly. 

                                 TODD
                        Let’s just say... he scarred me. 
                        Early on. And Mom let it happen. 

           Todd plods back to the device he was just working on. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        This one needed repair. It’s about 
                        ready to go now. You wanna give me 
                        a hand? 

           Rory approaches the device. Todd and Rory flip it over. Damn, 
           it’s heavy! Must be about two hundred pounds. A padded shell 
           on top. Like a gymnast’s pommel. 

                                 RORY
                        What is this thing? 

           Todd grins, guzzles down his brew.  

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Kelly steps outside, looking out at the stable. She spots 
           Raymundo (masked) hauling bales of hay into stacks... 

                                 KELLY
                        Raymundo? Que pasa?

           Raymundo doesn’t acknowledge her, enters the stable. 

           INT. BREEDING SHED - NIGHT

           Rory watches as Todd adjusts a pin on the stabilizing leg,  
           then crosses to the workbench to grab something. 

                                 TODD
                        You mind holding this? 
           Todd sets a cylindrical TUBE in Rory’s arms, about two feet 
           long, six inches wide. Then heads out the double doors to the 
           stallion paddock.   

                                 RORY
                        Uh, what am I supposed to do with -- 

                                 TODD
                        Do me a favor. Slide that thing 
                        into the receptacle at the end of 
                        the phantom. 

           Rory can see Todd meet up with someone in the stallion 
           paddock, then disappear behind the doors...

                                 RORY
                        The phantom? 

           Puzzled, Rory looks back at the “phantom.” There’s a hole on 
           the end of the padded layer. 

           He approaches the hole and awkwardly slides the cylinder into 
           it. It doesn’t go in all that easy and he has to fuss with it 
           a bit. 

           With his back turned, he doesn’t notice Todd and Raymundo 
           leading POSEIDON up behind him...  

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                             (locking the cylinder in)
                        Alright, I think I got it...

           Rory turns around AND --

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhhh shit!

           POSEIDON CHARGES AT HIM -- Rory stumbles back as the stallion 
           hoists up on hind legs and MOUNTS THE BREEDING PHANTOM. 

           Rory SMACKS to the dirt floor as Poseidon THRUSTS into the 
           artificial vagina. GRUNTING. POWERFUL. PERVERSE.

                                 TODD
                        Get in there, boy! Get ‘er good!

           Rory gapes back in terror as Poseidon comes, staring right at 
           him, and dismounts. SPITTING and NICKERING VICIOUSLY.  

           Then Raymundo leads the horse back to his stall as Todd 
           breaks out LAUGHING at Rory. 

           And Kelly arrives, arms folded.
                                 KELLY
                             (to Todd)
                        Happy now? 

                                 TODD
                        Hahaha! I think your boyfriend just 
                        shit himself! 

           As Todd doubles over, Kelly goes to help Rory.

                                 KELLY
                        Are you okay?

                                 RORY
                        I...

                                 TODD
                        You did great, man! Your first 
                        collection! Congratulations!

           Kelly helps Rory to his feet.

           Todd goes to the breeding phantom and pulls the collector 
           (artificial vagina) from the mount, inspecting the contents. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Damn, that’s a big load. You 
                        inspired him, Rory!  

                                 KELLY
                             (to Rory)
                        It’s a collection for artificial 
                        insemination. 

                                 RORY
                        Oh.

                                 KELLY
                        You could’ve really hurt him, Todd! 
                        What the fuck is wrong with you?

                                 TODD
                             (capping the collector)
                        Aw, come on. No hard feelings, 
                        Rory. Seriously. Me and Raymundo 
                        had your back. Right, Raymundo?

           They turn to the masked man standing in the doorway, who 
           doesn’t say a word. 

                                 KELLY
                        He works for us. 
                                 RORY
                        Okay... 

           Kelly leads Rory out.

                                 TODD
                        Hey, where ya going, Rory? We’re 
                        cutting heads off chickens next!

           Kelly gives Todd a nasty look. Todd keeps laughing. Kelly and 
           Rory exit through the paddock. 

           As soon as they’re gone, Todd’s laughter abruptly drops out. 

           Raymundo walks over. Todd hands him the collector, the gears 
           behind his eyes churning with menace. 

           EXT. HORSE STABLE/FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Rory and Kelly exit the stable. Rory, shellshocked:

                                 RORY
                        I think we should probably be going 
                        now. 

                                 KELLY
                        He’s a dick. He just -- he gets 
                        carried away.  

                                 RORY
                        He literally almost fucked me with 
                        a horse. 

                                 KELLY
                        He’s threatened by you.   

                                 RORY
                        I need to find Maxine. 

                                 KELLY
                        I’m not good at this. I’m not good 
                        at asking for help.

                                 RORY
                        Your husband’s hobby is breeding 
                        phantoms. I’m not sure there’s a 
                        crisis hotline for that. 

                                 KELLY
                        Please stay. 
                                 RORY
                        I came here to tell you how bad I 
                        fucked you over -- and your husband 
                        wants to feed me ass first to a 
                        horse that should be listed as a 
                        registered sex offender. Clearly, 
                        I’ve outstayed my welcome.  

                                 KELLY
                        I’m trying to figure out how to...

                                 RORY
                        This isn’t you. This isn’t even 
                        close.

                                 KELLY
                        I have things I want to say to him 
                        and I... I don’t know how to...

                                 RORY
                        You don’t know how to what?

                                 KELLY
                        Tell him. 

                                 RORY
                        Tell him what?

                                 KELLY
                        That I can’t be with him anymore. I 
                        don’t want to be with him anymore.

           Rory pauses, gets the gravity of it.

                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. This isn’t me. No one 
                        knows me like you do. 

                                 RORY
                        But then I think: I don’t really 
                        know you. I knew you in high 
                        school. That’s it. I’m not the same 
                        person I was in high school. Least 
                        I hope not... 

                                 KELLY
                        I’m trying to figure out when to 
                        tell him. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe 
                        after the serving. I just need some 
                        support. Is that okay? Is that too 
                        much to ask? 

           Rory shrugs. Giving in.
           EXT. TERRACE - NIGHT

           Colt hands Maxine his jacket, a dusty suede blazer that’s 
           been lived in. 

           Maxine wraps the jacket over her shoulders. It smells like 
           him. They’re sharing the joint.

                                 MAXINE
                        So you live in “town,” wherever 
                        that is, but you hardly ever go 
                        home... 

                                 COLT
                        Not much during the season. They 
                        put some of us up at the house.  

                                 MAXINE
                        What about girlfriends and stuff 
                        like that? 

                                 COLT
                        What, you mean like privacy and 
                        that sorta thing? The property’s 
                        huge. I know every inch of it. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Always wondered about the sex lives 
                        of horse whisperers. 

                                 COLT
                        Farrier, technically. Horseshoes.  

                                 MAXINE
                        You must get a real kick out of 
                        your friend’s complexion.

                                 COLT
                        I’mma tell him you said that. 

           Maxine laughs, catches herself gazing at him.

                                 COLT (CONT’D)
                        But really what draws me to this 
                        place is something kinda... well... 
                        spiritual. I found “God” in a way. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Oh, that reminds me. Rory thinks 
                        your boss is in a cult. 

                                 COLT
                        Does he now? 
                                 MAXINE
                        He’s neurotic and needs to feel 
                        superior in light of his 
                        shortcomings. 

                                 COLT
                        It’s no cult. Just a way of 
                        thinking about things. Hell, I’da 
                        never been able to handle the White 
                        Horse without it. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Oh right... the burn. And why did 
                        you burn yourself? 

                                 COLT
                        Rite of passage.  

                                 MAXINE
                        From cowboy to cow?  

           Colt moves closer. 

                                 COLT
                        No different from any other time-
                        honored tradition. 

           He takes her hand, holds her engagement ring to the light. 

           Their eyes locked. A charged moment.

           Maxine puts some distance between them as Colt grins at a 
           thousand watts.

           INT. HORSE STABLE - NIGHT

           Todd exits through the mares’ paddock. Checks his watch. The 
           lights are on timers. He waits. 

           The lights CLICK OFF. As he heads for the door... 

           WHISPERS... layering on top of each other. Desperate cries. 
           They could be words... HELP ME... but it’s hard to discern.  

           The chorus ECHOES from Poseidon’s stall as the mares SNORT, 
           ears flicking back. Terrified.   

           Todd ignores it... continues out of the stable. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Rory lies in bed watching a YouTube video on his phone. 
                                 RORY
                        You know how many views these horse 
                        breeding videos get? This one’s got 
                        ten million.

           Maxine’s in the adjacent GUEST BATHROOM washing her face. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Ten million and one.  

                                 RORY
                        You should’ve seen that thing 
                        pounding away... Terrifying. 

                                 MAXINE
                        And you want to see more of it.  

           Rory puts the phone down, crosses to the bathroom doorway.

                                 RORY
                        I think she’s leaving him. She 
                        asked me to stay. Offer support. 

                                 MAXINE
                        That is not your responsibility.  

                                 RORY
                        Look, I know this is messed up, but 
                        she’s my oldest friend. I want to 
                        be here for her. 

                                 MAXINE
                        You said you weren’t her friend 
                        because of the way you treated her.

                                 RORY
                        You know what I mean. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Rory, these people are... simple. 

                                 RORY
                        Simple? 

                                 MAXINE
                        Easily manipulated. People like 
                        that are dangerous. So are their 
                        horses, apparently. 

                                 RORY
                        You need to stop judging people. 
                        Fuck, when was the last time you 
                        had a good time anywhere?  
                                 MAXINE
                        This is a good time? You’re having 
                        fun? 

           Maxine sneers, brushes past him. 

           Rory glances at a decorative tile over the sink... 

           Another fucking petroglyph.  

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Kelly slides the storage box back into the closet as Todd 
           sits on a chair, taking off his clothes. 

                                 TODD
                        What’s in the box? 

                                 KELLY
                        Just some high school stuff. 

                                 TODD
                        He seems like a real catch.    

           Todd pulls off his shirt. The petroglyph burned into his arm, 
           just like Colt. Kelly shuts the closet and takes a nightgown 
           from the dresser. 

                                 KELLY
                        He’s trying to turn his life 
                        around. 

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, I noticed. 

           Kelly disrobes before a mirror, appraising her body. Full-
           figured. No petroglyph scar. 

           She’s beautiful, but she doesn’t see it.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        I remember when Mom ditched the 
                        preacher. The thing that finally 
                        broke her wasn’t the booze, his 
                        fists, his lies... It was that when 
                        she looked in his eyes, it wasn’t 
                        her he was seeing. Men like that 
                        don’t change. 

                                 KELLY
                        Not everybody’s a version of your 
                        father. 
                                 TODD
                        That’s for sure.

           Still seated, Todd removes his underwear. And something else. 
           A tube and a pouch. Only a glimpse. He’s fully nude now. 

           He rises, crosses to her. His back to us, his bare ass 
           jiggling toward her. They stare at each other in the mirror.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t be more unlike him. But 
                        every time I look in the mirror... 
                        all I see is him. 

           In the reflection, Todd reveals a castration scar. No cock. 
           No balls. Just a rough, discolored patch of scar tissue 
           between his legs. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        If you think about it, this all 
                        works out perfectly. Doesn’t it? 

           Todd kisses her. Deeper than she wants. Kelly pulls away, 
           avoiding his eyes as she slips on her nightgown.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Crystalline night sky. Moonlight casting bright against the 
           farm. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Rory lies awake in bed. Maxine’s asleep beside him. He’s 
           anxious. Angry. Pent up. 

           After a beat, he rises.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Kelly and Todd are asleep as... a soft THRUSTING SOUND 
           rumbles beneath them. 

           Todd stirs awake.  

           THRUST, THRUST, THRUST...

           He sits up, checks the clock: 12:14 AM. 
           INT. HALLWAY - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Todd exits the bedroom (in pajama bottoms). Down the hall, 
           the door to the basement lulls open. 

           The THRUSTING comes from downstairs.

           INT. BASEMENT - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Todd descends the stairway. Someone’s in the gym area. He 
           turns the corner and finds...

           Rory on the exercise machine, doing reps.  

           Todd watches him a beat before announcing himself by flicking 
           on the overheard lights.  

                                 RORY
                        Oh, hey man. Sorry if I woke you. 
                        Hope you don’t mind. Couldn’t 
                        sleep.
                             (re machine)
                        This thing’s awesome. You’re an 
                        artist.

           Todd just stares at him. 

           Rory climbs from the machine. Wipes off with a towel. Notes 
           the petroglyph burn on Todd’s arm. 

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        Kelly says you worship Epona. The 
                        horse god, right?  

                                 TODD
                        The Mother Goddess. Protector of 
                        Horses. 

                                 RORY
                        Right. So, how did you get into all 
                        this?  

           Todd smiles to himself, moves to the machine. Starts pulling 
           pins, adjusting the arms and seat. Bars and supports slide 
           fluidly and lock in.  

                                 TODD
                        You try the back press? Now that’s 
                        the sweet spot, if you ask me. 
                                 RORY
                        Kelly was agnostic when I knew her. 
                        I went to Bishop Fenwick before 
                        high school. She’d always get so 
                        pissed when I tried to get her to 
                        Sunday mass. 

                                 TODD
                        Comfortably secular, huh? 

                                 RORY
                        Well, maybe that’s why I liked to 
                        drink. The Irish-Catholic in me 
                        runs deep.  

                                 TODD
                             (re machine)
                        Go for it. 

                                 RORY
                        Looks like a tight squeeze. 

                                 TODD
                        You don’t want too much wiggle 
                        room. Targets the muscles better. 

           Rory works himself into the machine, facing downward, his 
           chest pressing against the bench. 

           Once he’s in position, Todd slides a bar across his back, 
           locking him in. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Now press upward; works your 
                        abdominal obliques. 

           Rory presses the weight. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        So, you wanna know about Epona? 

                                 RORY
                        If you don’t mind.

           Again, Todd smiles at that, appraises the machine with an 
           engineer’s eye as Rory continues pressing the weight. 

                                 TODD
                        We’re servants of the Mother 
                        Goddess. 

                                 RORY
                        The Mother Goddess... okay. Can 
                        anyone be a servant?
                                 TODD
                        No, man. This ain’t fucking Costco. 
                        You have to prove your devotion. 

                                 RORY
                        How? 

                                 TODD
                        With a sacrifice.  

           Rory laughs.

                                 RORY
                        A sacrifice? 

                                 TODD
                        Yeah, a sacrifice. Like Lent. You 
                        give something up. Something 
                        important. Fuck are you laughing 
                        at? This is serious shit.

           Rory keeps laughing, slaps the weight down -- CLANG! -- 
           collapsing against the bench. 

                                 RORY
                        Sorry. I don’t mean to... And 
                        Kelly’s down with all this? 

                                 TODD
                        She’s getting there. 

                                 RORY
                        See, that’s the thing, man. You 
                        just wanna make sure she’s not 
                        feeling... you know... cornered.  

           Todd adjusts something on the machine. 

                                 TODD
                        Try that. 

           Rory tries to press the weight back up, it’s heavier now. He 
           lowers back down, but the bar doesn’t catch this time. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Cornered? 

                                 RORY
                        Uh... can you help me out of this 
                        thing please? 

           Todd doesn’t respond. Rory gives him a look like:
                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, I need some help. 

           Todd watches him, head tilted, as if pondering something 
           existential. 

                                 TODD
                        You ever feel cornered, being in a 
                        program? ... But you persevere. You 
                        endure. Because it’s that or... 

                                 RORY
                        Todd, help!  

           Just as the weight becomes unbearable, Todd reaches in with 
           one hand and hoists the bar off.   

           Rory spills from the machine -- and Todd lets go of the 
           weight, letting it SMASH down. BANG!

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                             (gasping)
                        Shit...

                                 TODD
                        Feels great, right? Now that’s a 
                        fucking set, dude! It’s at the 
                        point where you think you’re gonna 
                        break, see? That’s when you make 
                        gains.

           Todd offers his hand. Rory reluctantly accepts. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Maxine stirs awake. Notices Rory’s absence. Sits up. Looks 
           around the room. Full of shadows and faint moonlight. 

           Some commotion out the window. Maxine rises, looks outside:

           Colt’s out back with two WOMEN. They’re laughing, drunk, 
           stoned. 

           Maxine watches them. 

           At one point, Colt gazes up at Maxine in the window. Smiles 
           at her. 

           Maxine rescinds, can he see me? 

           She watches them sneak into the stable.  
           INT. BASEMENT - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Classic rock playing on a turntable. Todd digs a beer from a 
           mini-fridge. Tosses Rory a bottle of water.  

                                 TODD
                        I mean, look, it was like twenty 
                        years ago, right? I get it. It’s 
                        just... my thing is like, dude, 
                        just keep it to yourself.

                                 RORY
                        It’s part of the steps, man. You 
                        make amends. You own up to it. I 
                        committed to this. I need this kind 
                        of structure in my life.  

                                 TODD
                        Okay, I think we can both agree: 
                        women don’t want you to cheat on 
                        ‘em. But if you do, I’m thinking 
                        they don’t wanna fucking know about 
                        it. They may not say that, but 
                        they’re sure as hell thinking it. 

                                 RORY
                        You think that’s what Kelly’s 
                        thinking? 

                                 TODD
                        I know it. 

                                 RORY
                        I dunno, man. I think she’s 
                        thinking something else. I think 
                        sometimes you get so caught up in 
                        what you think you know, it ends up 
                        taking you by surprise.

           Todd thinks about that. Then:

                                 TODD
                        Women are fucking deadly, man!

           Todd laughs. Rory laughs a little too. 

           INT. HALLWAY - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Maxine exits the guest bedroom and stops at the basement 
           door. She can hear Rory and Todd laughing, chatting it up. 

           She passes the doorway and continues onward. 
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Maxine steps outside, careful not to make much noise. The 
           moon, big and bright, casts a pale sheet across the farm. 

           Maxine makes her way toward the stable. 

           INT. HORSE STABLE - NIGHT

           The door cracks open and Maxine slips inside. 

           The lights are off, but she can hear... sounds... back toward 
           the stallion paddock. Giggles... and giggles... footsteps 
           sliding across the floor.

           Maxine hesitates. She can see the mares quiet in their 
           stalls. Barely moving. Barely breathing. 

           More laughter. Maxine heads toward the paddock.

           INT. BASEMENT - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Todd and Rory are playing darts. Todd pulls open a cabinet 
           and takes out a bottle of añejo. Swigs it as Rory sticks a 
           bull’s eye. 

                                 TODD
                        Damn, you’re a fucking marksman!

                                 RORY
                        I told ya, I’ve spent a lot of time 
                        in bars. I got my name engraved on 
                        a foosball table at McSorley’s.  

                                 TODD
                        It defies conventional wisdom, but 
                        I’m better at this drunk. 

                                 RORY
                        An exercise in futility, my man. 
                        There’s two things in this world at 
                        which I am virtually unbeatable: 
                        self-loathing and darts. 

           Todd takes another swig, sets the bottle down on a small 
           table between them. 

                                 TODD
                        Tell you what. Best of ten. Loser 
                        empties this three-hundred dollar 
                        bottle of Gran Patron. 
                                 RORY
                             (laughs)
                        I’m not wagering my sobriety on a 
                        dart game. 

                                 TODD
                        You’re not wagering your sobriety. 
                        You’re wagering my respect. You 
                        want my respect, don’t you? I want 
                        yours.

                                 RORY
                        Todd, why does it always have to be 
                        some sort of challenge--

                                 TODD
                        Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. It is what 
                        it is, big boy. This is a peace 
                        offering. A reconciliation. 

                                 RORY
                        I’m not gonna --

                                 TODD
                        You hurt my wife. In my home. You 
                        wanna bury the hatchet? Now’s your 
                        chance.

           Rory stares, torn and guilt-ridden. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                             (then)
                        Hell, if you’re as good as you say 
                        you are, I’m the one’s gettin’ 
                        drunk!

           INT. HORSE STABLE - NIGHT

           Maxine quietly makes her way toward the stallion paddock. She 
           can still hear the women giggling, and Colt whispering things 
           to them.  

           A flicker of light shines from a crack in the paddock doors. 
           Maxine approaches, peeks through the crack:

           There’s Colt, leaning over Poseidon’s stall. He’s holding a 
           Zippo lighter, gazing in at something. Cowboy smirk flashing 
           mischievous. 

                                 COLT
                        Get a little closer. That’s it. He 
                        won’t hurt you. He loves it.   
           Maxine angles her view through the crack. 

           A RUSTLING within Poseidon’s stall. She can see the horse, 
           chest up, and... his black, beady eyes... Is he looking at 
           her? 

           Then --

           MOANING. Hard. Grinding. Deep, dark fucking pleasure. 

           Maxine stares through narrow slits in the stall. Seeing 
           fragments of:

           THE WOMEN... doing things... to the horse. With the horse. 
           With each other. As Colt watches. 

           ON MAXINE, eyes wide, turning away, then back again. 

           The Women drift up, entwining in Poseidon’s mane. The 
           stallion leans into them, soaking in their touch. 

           Maxine can hear the WHISPERS... Faint gasps... Tortured 
           screams... Agony.  

           EXT. HORSE STABLE - NIGHT

           Maxine exits, lightheaded. Shuts her eyes, leaning against 
           the door. Breathe...

           She opens her eyes and --

           BAM. There’s RAYMUNDO, right in front of her, his bandage 
           mask gaping back like a killer scarecrow. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Oh shit...

           He SPEAKS, his voice graveled and soft: 

                                 RAYMUNDO
                             (Spanish)
                        You shouldn’t be here. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I... I’m sorry, I was...

           He steps toward her, almost lunging. Maxine tenses up, 
           anticipating... who the fuck knows. 

           But Raymundo moves past, sets his ear against the stable 
           doors. Hearing their sick mischief. 
                                 RAYMUNDO
                             (Spanish)
                        The God’s hunger can no longer be 
                        quenched in a natural way.
                             (then)
                        It’s HIM. Him and his... “people.” 
                        They have no respect for the beauty 
                        of these animals. All they’ve done 
                        is twist them into lechery. They 
                        took everything from me. Ruined my 
                        mare. My Lucy...   
                             (then)
                        We will destroy them all. Soon. 

           Raymundo throws a fist at the stable door, spins at her: 

                                 RAYMUNDO (CONT’D)
                             (Spanish)
                        This place is evil. Leave while you 
                        still can. 

           With that, Raymundo storms off, leaving a stunned Maxine. 

           INT. HALLWAY - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Todd helps Rory (totally fucking tanked) up the basement 
           stairs. 

                                 TODD
                        One more step... there you go. 

                                 RORY
                        Hold up. Maxine... What do I tell 
                        her?  

                                 TODD
                        What do you mean? You’re the Truth 
                        Will Set You Free guy, aren’t you? 
                        Unless of course you think she 
                        might not wanna know...

                                 RORY
                        It’s not like I can hide it from 
                        her. 

                                 TODD
                        But you would if you could. Because 
                        the consequences of this are... 
                        fuck, knowing her? Kill me now. 

           Rory stares back, unsteady. Sweatin’ it. 
                                 RORY
                        You planned this, didn’t you? 

                                 TODD
                        Told you, drunk darts are my thing.
                        Least we’re square. Man to man. 
                        That’s something, right? 

           Rory stares, assessing him through his drunken lens.

           Todd spots a DADDY LONGLEGS skitter across the hallway. He 
           reaches down for it, lets the spider creep into his hand. 

                                 RORY
                        I know you, Todd. Guys like you 
                        always have an angle. You never let 
                        anybody see the real you. 

                                 TODD
                        I don’t?

           When Todd turns around...

           ...a MONSTER gapes back. Pale-skinned. Black eyes. Lipstick 
           kisses. Smeared and smudged. Rory’s “DRUNK DEMON” --

                                 DRUNK DEMON
                        Then what the fuck is this? 

           Drunk Demon’s RAZOR JAWS spread WIDE, eyes spinning shark 
           white, AND --  

           Rory shudders, backpedaling... 

           FALLING BACK... AND BACK... AND...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GARDEN - DAY

           Rory snaps awake in a bed of thorns. Punctured and scratched. 
           Disorientated. Pain everywhere. AS --

           An ORDERLY reaches in and helps him up. An empty bottle falls 
           from his lap, SMASHING to the sidewalk. 

                                 ORDERLY
                        Rory? 

                                 RORY
                        What happened?
                                 ORDERLY
                        You passed out. Your father’s 
                        looking for you. 

           Rory tries to stand on his own but can’t. The Orderly assists 
           him. He’s covered in blood and booze. 

                                 ORDERLY (CONT’D)
                        Rory, your mother’s getting ready 
                        to go. Do you understand what I’m 
                        saying to you?  

           It takes a moment for that to sink in, then Rory moves 
           forward anxiously as the Orderly tries to help him. 

           He shuffles along a winding walkway through this lush garden 
           (which is actually part of a hospice facility)...

           And approaches a patio with a sliding glass door. Curtains 
           drawn.  

           Rory stumbles to the glass door and pulls it open, slapping 
           the curtain back...

           INT. PATIENT ROOM - HOSPICE - CONTINUOUS

           Rory enters. His MOTHER is in bed... She’s already gone. 

           His FATHER hovers close to her. He looks at Rory. The state 
           of him. Disgust.

           Rory approaches his mom’s bedside. Takes her hand. Cold. 
           Swollen.

           His blood drips between their fingers. 

           Something SLURPS from below...

           Rory looks down... 

           DRUNK DEMON’s on the floor, eagerly slurping up the drops of 
           blood, its tongue flapping wild, perverse. 

           Rory tries to scream, but he can’t. Nothing comes out. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           A red horizon over the farm. 
           EXT. HORSE STABLE - MORNING

           Handlers open the stable, prepare for the day. Lead the MARES 
           out to pasture.

           INT. BREEDING SHED - HORSE STABLE - MORNING

           Todd welds the frame of a new breeding phantom. Angry sparks 
           spit into the mask shielding his face.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Rory stirs awake. Vicious hangover. Finds Maxine sitting 
           across the room. Waiting. Anxious. 

                                 RORY
                        I’ll get to a meeting as soon as --

                                 MAXINE
                        I take the blame for some of this. 
                        I pushed too hard. 

                                 RORY
                        No. No, this is me. All me. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I wanted you to get hurt. I mean, 
                        I... I think I wanted you to suffer 
                        for it. Not for what you did to 
                        her, but for what Nick did to me. 

                                 RORY
                        You were just trying to help me. 

                                 MAXINE
                        No. 

           A beat. Rory looks at her. 

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                             (then)
                        I saw something last night... One 
                        of the handlers, he was with some 
                        women. They were in the stable and 
                        they were... with the horse. 

           Rory stares, sits up, wipes his face. 

                                 RORY
                        What?
                                 MAXINE
                        It doesn’t matter. Just get up and 
                        walk with me out the front door. 

                                 RORY
                        I’m trying to understand what 
                        you’re say-- 

                                 MAXINE
                        I am not staying here another 
                        fucking minute. That’s what I’m 
                        saying. 

                                 RORY
                        I told Kelly I would be here for 
                        her. 

                                 MAXINE
                        Fuck Kelly. Fuck her. Duplicitous 
                        bitch. Takes one to know one. Let’s 
                        go.

                                 RORY
                        What were you doing in the stable 
                        with one of the handlers? 

           Maxine rises, slings her bag over her shoulder.

                                 MAXINE
                        I think these people want to hurt 
                        us. 

                                 RORY
                        So do you apparently. 

                                 MAXINE
                        I am walking out the fucking door.

                                 RORY
                        Go. 

           Maxine stares, helpless. Eyes brimming. She heads for the 
           door. Stops. Then:

                                 MAXINE
                        My Spanish sucks, but I caught some 
                        of it. He said this place is evil. 

                                 RORY
                        Maxine, I think --

           Maxine walks out and shuts the door, cutting him off. 
           Rory looks at the bedside table... where Maxine’s engagement 
           rings sits. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Maxine shoves out the front door and keeps walking. Down the 
           driveway. Past the Volvo. Past the gate. Doesn’t stop. 

           Todd and Colt exit the stable just in time to catch her 
           vacate.  

                                 TODD
                        That’s one down.

           Todd gives Colt a playful smack on the shoulder.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Kelly’s in her bathrobe, sitting alone, sipping tea, staring 
           off.  

           Rory appears in the doorway, watches her unnoticed for a few 
           beats. Then:

                                 RORY
                        She left. 

                                 KELLY
                        I’m sure she just needs some space.

           Rory looks down at the engagement ring in his hand.

                                 RORY
                        Yeah, no.

           Kelly sees the ring, but doesn’t comment. Rory scuffs to the 
           table and sits. 

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any... ? 

           Kelly opens a sugar jar... filled with Ibuprofin. Rory downs 
           a few tablets. 

                                 KELLY
                        Was this your first time? 
                        Relapsing? 

                                 RORY
                        No. But it’s been awhile. So 
                        stupid.
                                 KELLY
                        Todd put you up to it?

                                 RORY
                        It wasn’t his fault. I wanted to 
                        beat him. I’m an idiot. 

                                 KELLY
                        He’s manipulative. Like his father.

                                 RORY
                        I tried to get him to talk about 
                        your...

                                 KELLY
                        It’s just gonna piss him off if he 
                        thinks you’re mocking him.

           Rory grabs some coffee from the counter. Through the kitchen 
           window, he can see Maxine walking off toward the main road.

                                 RORY
                        Mom always thought you were the 
                        one. I keep thinking about when she 
                        died, what she had to hold on to. 
                        Only son’s a drunk. No kids. Total 
                        fuck up.   
                             (then)
                        If I could do it all over again, 
                        and I know that’s silly to think 
                        about, but if I could... I never 
                        would’ve left. 

           Kelly rises. Sets her cup in the sink. Beside him. 

                                 KELLY
                        You know how I was always obsessed 
                        with that painting -- The Storm -- 
                        by that French guy, what’s his 
                        name?

                                 RORY
                        You had it framed above your bed.

                                 KELLY
                        Right. The reason I liked it so 
                        much was because I thought it was 
                        us. Running from the storm. It 
                        always just felt exactly right. It 
                        still does.

           They’re staring at each other.
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Kelly exits the farmhouse followed by Rory a few steps 
           behind. 

                                 KELLY
                        They should be here soon. I’m not 
                        sure if we’ll do a live cover or 
                        pasture breed.

                                 RORY
                        So the mares they’re bringing, 
                        they’ve met the stallion before? 

                                 KELLY
                        They’ve run together a number of 
                        times, but it has been awhile.  

           Todd meets up with them. A wary look from Rory.

                                 TODD
                        Morning! We let the mares out. 
                        We’ll do three live covers in the 
                        shed, space ‘em out a few hours 
                        apart.
                             (to Rory)
                        You good? 

                                 RORY
                        Sure. 

                                 TODD
                        Saw Maxine a little while ago. I 
                        woulda’ given her a ride somewhere.

                                 RORY
                        She’s upset. I think she wants to 
                        be alone.  

                                 TODD
                        Shit, man, I’m sorry. We hit it too 
                        hard last night. I shoulda’ known 
                        better.

                                 KELLY
                        Ya think?

                                 TODD
                        You gotta admit though, Rory -- 
                        that’s some of the best worm juice 
                        you ever had. Am I right? 

           Todd goes in for another back slap -- 
           But Rory swerves out of the way. 

           EXT. HORSE STABLE - DAY

           A small fleet of HORSE TRAILERS parked beside the stable 
           hauled by rugged pickup trucks and SUVs. 

           The horse petroglyph can be seen as an emblem affixed to the 
           rear bumpers on some of the vehicles. Like the Christian 
           ichthys (Jesus fish). 

           INT. BREEDING SHED - DAY

           Handlers lead a silver-gray BROODMARE into the shed and fit 
           her hind hooves with boots attached to ropes that prohibit 
           her from kicking. 

           Rory and Kelly enter with the BREEDERS, who have traveled 
           with their mares for cover by Poseidon. Experienced farmers. 
           Beards, double-knit sweaters (even in summer) and baseball 
           caps abound.  

                                 KELLY
                        Usually he’s at eighty percent 
                        fertility but, I don’t know what it 
                        is, the mares aren’t responding to 
                        him. 

                                 BREEDER
                        Well, he’s older now; hormones, 
                        different phenotypes...  

                                 KELLY
                        I know but adult stallions produce 
                        more sperm, and Todd’s been very 
                        selective with his broodmares...

           Behind them, Todd, Colt and Raymundo (masked) lead Poseidon 
           from his paddock. The mighty stallion is as intimidating as 
           ever. The fucking grim reaper.

           Kelly watches Poseidon. Vacillating somewhere between terror 
           and reverence. She’s not alone. Just about everybody quiets 
           down for the stud’s big entrance... 

           Including the Broodmare awaiting her mate. The Breeder 
           explains to Rory:

                                 BREEDER
                        What’s happening now is, he’s gonna 
                        tease her a little. Make sure she’s 
                        ready to mount. 
           Todd leads Poseidon closer to the broodmare, who NICKERS and 
           trots a bit as her handlers try to keep her calm. 

           The Breeder zeroes in on Poseidon’s underside, gaping at his 
           emerging member.  

                                 BREEDER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, you see that? You see his 
                        cock hanging out there? See how 
                        it’s growing? He can smell her. 
                        He’s hard now, see?

                                 RORY
                        Is it weird that we’re all just 
                        standing around watching this?

                                 BREEDER
                        We’re watching to see if she 
                        rejects him. 

                                 RORY
                        Why would she reject him? 

                                 BREEDER
                        Nature gives her a sixth sense for 
                        studs with the highest probability 
                        of success. Genetics, virility, 
                        intangibles like pheromones...

                                 RORY
                        How does he know if she rejects 
                        him?

                                 BREEDER
                        See her tail, how it’s whippin’ to 
                        the side like that? That’s telling 
                        him she’s ready. He can smell her, 
                        too, like I said. I gave her an 
                        ultrasound this morning. She’s 
                        estrous. She’s ready.     

                                 RORY
                        What if she rejects him? What then?

                                 BREEDER
                        Depends on whether or not he still 
                        wants to bother. And if he does, 
                        whether or not she can make him pay 
                        for it. 

           The Breeder’s excited, which is fucking strange, but there IS 
           a certain electricity in the room. 
           Rory can’t take his eyes off the horses, even though 
           something about this is... well, fucked.  

           Todd leads Poseidon closer... 

           ON KELLY, watching Poseidon mount the broodmare. As the event 
           unfolds, these two massive animals fucking before a live 
           audience, her eyes fill. And fill. And spill over.   

           It takes all of twenty seconds. When it’s done, and Poseidon 
           hops off the mare, the Breeders give both horses a healthy 
           APPLAUSE.  

           A successful cover. 

           Todd congratulates Poseidon with a warm pat, combing his 
           mane, whispering to him. 

           Kelly wipes her eyes, slaps on a fake smile, shaking hands, 
           giving hugs. 

           As the Breeders mingle and the horses are lead back to their 
           stalls, Kelly tries to sneak away unnoticed... 

           But Rory sees her... and follows her out.  

           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Kelly takes a new bottle from the liquor cabinet. Pours 
           herself a double and shoots it down. 

           Rory comes in.

                                 RORY
                        You okay? 

                                 KELLY
                        I don’t like to watch it so much 
                        anymore. 

                                 RORY
                        It’s definitely strange. Like the 
                        coordination of it all, how 
                        manipulated it is.  

                                 KELLY
                        That’s not the part that bothers 
                        me. It’s just... Lately it’s just 
                        making me think about getting 
                        older, shit like that.
                             (then)
                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        We’re not really set up for it. Me 
                        and Todd. And even if we were...

           Rory moves closer, looking at the petroglyph etched in the 
           dining table. 

                                 RORY
                        Epona’s the goddess of fertility, 
                        right? 

           Kelly pours another shot. 

                                 KELLY
                        She is. But I’m not part of the 
                        family yet. Still have to convert.   

           Rory watches her as she downs it.  

                                 RORY
                        Todd mentioned something about a 
                        sacrifice. 

                                 KELLY
                        It’s more like an offering. A vice.  
                             (holds up her glass)
                        Like this. 

                                 RORY
                        Like me. 

           Kelly looks at him. Forces a laugh. 

                                 KELLY
                        Are you volunteering? 

                                 RORY
                        You know me, I’m all about 
                        recovery.  

                                 KELLY
                             (then)
                        You wanna take a walk? 

                                 RORY
                        You think that’s a good idea?

                                 KELLY
                        I dunno. Probably not. 

           Off Rory --
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Slow rolling THUNDER on the horizon. A summer storm 
           approaches. 

           Rory and Kelly head outside. Kelly grabs Rory’s hand and 
           leads him around the far side of the house, away from the 
           stable. 

           REVERSE ON TODD, hanging outside the stable, watching them 
           depart. 

           EXT. FIELD/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Winds picking up. Rory and Kelly walk beside a stone wall. 
           Rory looks up at the darkening clouds. 

                                 RORY
                        We’re gonna get caught in it.  

                                 KELLY
                        We won’t be gone long. I just want 
                        to show you something up here. 

                                 RORY
                        Feeling a little guilty about 
                        Maxine. Maybe I should’ve gone with 
                        her. 

                                 KELLY
                        Maybe you should’ve. 

                                 RORY
                        But I want to be with you. 

           Kelly smiles, links arms with him. 

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        Are you really gonna leave him? 

                                 KELLY
                        Why?

                                 RORY
                        I dunno, I’m just trying to think 
                        about how all that’s gonna play 
                        out. Won’t my being here make it 
                        worse? 

                                 KELLY
                        For him maybe. 

           Kelly pulls him off into the woods. 
           EXT. FOREST/POND - DAY

           Kelly leads Rory to the edge of a small pond filled with 
           lilies. The lilies blanket the surface with soft pink and 
           yellow flowers. Dandelion florets drift through the air like 
           cinders.

           Kelly approaches the shoreline, staring up into the darkening 
           sky. Blades of sunlight shifting as storm clouds move in. 

                                 KELLY
                        Did you know that Poseidon is the 
                        god of horses? Most people think 
                        it’s just the seas. They forget all 
                        about the horses. 

                                 RORY
                        Earthquakes too, right? I remember 
                        that from Ms. Connolly’s class. 

           Rory stands behind her, watching as the sunlight blankets her 
           in ethereal sheets.  

                                 KELLY
                        The spirit of Poseidon was cast 
                        from the water into a mighty 
                        stallion, who roams the mortal 
                        Earth collecting the souls of the 
                        wicked.   

           INT. STALLION PEN - HORSE STABLE - DAY

           ON POSEIDON -- waiting. Perfectly still. Bulbous eyes 
           glistening.

           EXT. FOREST/POND - DAY

           Rory shields his eyes from the wind as Kelly stares 
           transfixed into the coming storm.  

                                 KELLY
                        Poseidon chose our leader. The 
                        purest, most reverent.   

                                 RORY
                        Todd. 

                                 KELLY
                        He’s lost. Damaged. He has to go, 
                        but he has their support.    
                                 RORY
                        Who?

                                 KELLY
                        The breeders. Every farm we work 
                        with. They have to go too. 

                                 RORY
                        I don’t understand. Are you worried 
                        they’ll ostracize you if you leave 
                        him? 

           Kelly turns to him. 

                                 KELLY
                        No.

                                 RORY
                        Good, because I think --

           Kelly sinks a deep kiss to his lips. Rory falls into her 
           embrace. Hungry hands all over each other.

           This freight train ain’t stoppin’. 

           Cinder-florets dance about, as if drawn to them, in a 
           swirling funnel.

           INT. STALLION PEN - HORSE STABLE - DAY

           ON POSEIDON -- staring back at us. 

           EXT. PASTURE/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Rory and Kelly hurry back across the field, hand in hand, as 
           the storm intensifies. 

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           The gun cabinet. Todd stalks over. Yanks it open. 

           INT. HORSE STABLE - DAY

           Kelly and Rory run into the stable just as the sky opens up 
           in a DOWNPOUR. 

           They’re laughing, exhilarated, UNTIL -- 
           They’re greeted by Todd. Holding a rifle. Colt and Raymundo 
           at his side. The Breeders flanking them. As if they were all 
           just waiting for them.

           Rory looks at Todd, holding the gun tight. Then he turns to 
           Kelly, who’s looking back at him, not laughing anymore. Face 
           blank. 

                                 KELLY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 RORY
                        For what?

                                 TODD
                        For what’s about to happen to you. 

           Kelly locks the stable doors behind them. Thunder CRACKS from 
           outside. Rory laughs uncomfortably. 

                                 RORY
                        What’s going on here?

                                 TODD
                        You’ve been chosen. You’re the 
                        unclean. 

           Rory turns to Kelly, gauging her vacant stare. 

                                 RORY
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 TODD
                        Rory... did you just fuck my wife? 
                        I think you might’ve just fucked my 
                        wife. Is that accurate?
                             (to Kelly)
                        Honey?

                                 KELLY
                        That’s accurate. 

           Rory’s like: uhhh........

                                 TODD
                        Well alrighty then! 

                                 RORY
                        Wait a minute. We... she has 
                        something to say to you.

                                 TODD
                        I think she said it, don’t you? 
           Todd RACKS the action. Steps toward him. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Rory, we have a code here. A very 
                        strict code of conduct. And you... 
                        have basically shit all over it 
                        from the second you arrived. I 
                        mean, even your own bony-ass bitch 
                        of a fiancée couldn’t deal with 
                        your incessant fucking weakness. 
                        All you had to do was walk away. 
                        Instead, you fucked my wife.  

           Todd raises the rifle at him. 

           Rory goes fifty shades of oh fuck.

                                 RORY
                        Todd...

                                 TODD
                        Rory...

                                 RORY
                        I love her.

           Beat. And then everybody busts the fuck out LAUGHING. THUNDER 
           and LIGHTNING screaming from outside. 

           And Rory, gaping back at the insanity of it, and thinking... 
           fuck this.

           Rory spins around, tries to unlock the doors. Frantic. Fuck, 
           how the fuck do you open the -- 

           WHAP!

           Rory’s body seizes. He stumbles, falling to his knees, 
           gasping, as his body fails him. 

           A TRANQUILIZER DART STICKING IN HIS BACK.

           He slaps to the floor, paralyzed. 

           Kelly and Todd approach, staring down at him. 

                                 TODD
                        You should be honored. It’s 
                        supposed to be someone important. 

           OFF RORY, gaping back, unable to move, as we --

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:
           INT. BREEDING SHED - HORSE STABLE - DAY

           FROM BLACK -- A HAZY POV -- EYELIDS SLOWLY OPENING...

           Kelly and Todd come into focus. Then the Breeders. 

                                 TODD
                        Can you hear us, Rory?

           Todd splashes a bucket of water INTO CAMERA. 

           REVERSE ON RORY -- DRENCHED.

           Blinking awake from a heavy drug-induced state. Immobile. 
           Wearing his costume from The King and I. 

                                 RORY
                        Wha... What’s going on? 

                                 TODD
                        You’re about help us with Kelly’s 
                        conversion.

                                 RORY
                        I don’t... I can’t move.

                                 TODD
                        No, it’s better if you don’t move 
                        around too much when he’s mounting 
                        you. Otherwise it gets messy.

                                 RORY
                        Wait... What the hell is this?

                                 KELLY
                        This part was Todd’s idea, Rory. I 
                        just want to make that clear. 

           For Rory, the implication slowly sinks in as he realizes: 
           he’s strapped to a fucking breeding phantom. Locked in place 
           by welded bars and leather belts. Ass up. A fuck cage. 

                                 TODD
                        I’ve been trying to crack this 
                        design for awhile. Seeing you on my 
                        machine helped me understand how to 
                        modify the phantom. Application, 
                        remember? Ya gotta have fucking 
                        hobbies, dude!

                                 RORY
                        Wait... You can’t do this. Kelly 
                        help me...
                                 KELLY
                        I can’t. We had a deal. 

                                 RORY
                        What fucking deal?!

                                 KELLY
                        Todd and me. I get your sperm, he 
                        gets your ass. 

                                 RORY
                        WHAT??!

                                 TODD
                        Like a collection, Rory. I can’t 
                        really provide for her in that way, 
                        unfortunately. But, you know, she 
                        really wants to be a mom, so... In 
                        exchange, I get my sacrifice. 

           The Breeders separate, allowing Colt and Raymundo to bring in 
           Poseidon. 

           The stallion froths and kicks, eyeing Rory. Lascivious.   

                                 RORY
                        OH GOD... What the FUCK, Kelly! 

           Rory battles against his restraints. Poseidon NICKERS and 
           struts, kicking up dirt as Colt and Raymundo pull his reins.

                                 RORY (CONT’D)
                        Kelly, please! Please don’t do 
                        this!

                                 KELLY
                        You didn’t think I’d forgive you 
                        for what you did to me back then, 
                        did you? 

                                 RORY
                        It was TWENTY YEARS AGO!

                                 KELLY
                        Twenty years of lies.

           Todd throws a thick leather pad over Rory, securing it tight 
           around the phantom. 

                                 RORY
                        What the fuck are you doing?! Get 
                        off me!
                                 TODD
                        Relax, Romeo. This is just to 
                        protect Poseidon from hurting 
                        himself while he fucks your ass. 

                                 RORY
                        Todd... Todd, don’t do this, man. 
                        Please.  

                                 TODD
                        All this bitchin’ and moanin’s a 
                        bad look for you, bud. 

           Colt and Raymundo loosen the reins, allowing Poseidon to 
           approach Rory. The horse SPITS at him. 

                                 RORY
                        NO! GET AWAY FROM ME! FUCK OFF!

           Poseidon sniffs and kicks near Rory, getting aroused. Our 
           Breeder/pervert with the play-by-play:

                                 BREEDER
                        Okay, you see that? You see his 
                        cock hanging out? See how it’s 
                        growing? He can smell him. He’s 
                        hard now, you see? 

                                 RORY
                        I’m a PERSON! I’m a fucking PERSON!

                                 TODD
                        Not to Poseidon you’re not. You’re 
                        the broodmare, Rory. First for 
                        Kelly, now for us. What do you 
                        think I poured all over you? That’s 
                        estrous urine, tough guy... 

           Poseidon attempts to mount the breeding phantom. Rory 
           SCRRREEEAMS and FIGHTS him off.  

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Aw, come on, Rory. Don’t be that 
                        way. Poseidon’s had so much trouble 
                        with mares this season... I’m 
                        worried about his confidence.  

                                 RORY
                        You people are SICK! FUCK YOU!

                                 TODD
                        Maybe we need a little easier 
                        access...
           Todd pulls a pocket knife. Slices into the back of Rory’s 
           costume pants, exposing his ass. 

           Poseidon drags his hooves across the dirt floor like a bull.

                                 RORY
                        HELP ME, SOMEBODY FUCKING HELP ME!!

                                 TODD
                        Ezekiel 23:20 -- “There she lusted 
                        after her lovers, whose genitals 
                        were like those of donkeys and 
                        whose emission was like that of 
                        HORSES.” Man, that is just FUCKED 
                        UP. You Christians are something 
                        else...

           Poseidon rears up and mounts. 

           Rory SCRRREAAAMS until he’s pressed so hard he can barely 
           breathe. 

           Kelly looks to Raymundo... Raymundo to Colt... Conspiracy 
           passing between them. 

           Kelly grabs Todd’s rifle --

           Colt and Raymundo pull SERRATED HUNTING KNIVES. The storm 
           shorts the lights, snapping in strobes AS --  

           Kelly starts taking SHOTS at the Breeders -- 

           WHAP, WHAP, WHAP! 

           Tranquilizer darts slap into them, one after the other! 
           SCREAMS and CHAOS. 

           Poseidon leaps off the phantom, leaving Rory gasping.

           THEN --

           Colt and Raymundo attack the Breeders in a bloody frenzy, 
           cutting throats, stabbing chests, splaying arteries. Blood 
           sprays in terrible gouts.

           Fast and brutal. Todd doesn’t know what the fuck’s happening 
           until it’s too late. 

           The Breeders’ bodies hit the floor. A vicious bloodbath. 

           Finally, Kelly takes aim at Todd. The last of them. 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?! 
                                 KELLY
                        Rory isn’t the sacrifice... you 
                        are. 

                                 TODD
                        I run this fucking place! Poseidon 
                        chose ME! 

                                 KELLY
                        You’re right. He did.

           Poseidon creeps behind Todd, arcing over him and --

           BITES the top of his head, slicing off a layer of scalp!

                                 TODD
                        AAARRRRGH! 

           Todd tumbles to the ground, writhing. Blood cascades down his 
           face. He glares back at Kelly: 

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Faithless WHORE. 

           WHAP!

           Kelly FIRES a tranquilizer dart into Todd’s chest. Todd 
           arches, gasping. 

           Raymundo releases Rory from the phantom. Rory spills to the 
           dirt, pure trauma in his face.

           Kelly goes to Poseidon:

                                 KELLY
                        You want him?

           Poseidon smiles. FUCK YES.  

           Raymundo and Colt grab Todd, rip his jeans off, and drag him 
           to the phantom, locking him in the cage. 

           Rory stumbles to his feet, retreating, as Kelly, Colt and 
           Raymundo CHANT:

                                 ALL
                             (”Please accept this 
                              sacrifice, Great One...”)
                        Placet accipere hoc sacrificium 
                        unus Magna... 

           Poseidon circles around, dragging hooves.  
           Todd wakes to find himself locked in the cage, awaiting 
           penetration. Defiant:  

                                 TODD
                        Fuck it.

           Poseidon draws near.  

           Rory looks away in total revulsion as Todd SCRRREEEAAAAMS.

           EXT. PASTURE - DAY

           Sunlight piercing heavy clouds. Todd’s broken body is thrown 
           into a ditch behind the stable. 

           Kelly, Rory, Colt and Raymundo surround the grave. Rory in a 
           fragile, post-traumatic glaze.

                                 KELLY
                             (to Rory)
                        Sorry I had to put you through 
                        that. We had to take them off-
                        guard. 
                             (then)
                        I mean, maybe there was a small 
                        part of me that wanted to scare 
                        you. Just a little. 

           Rory looks at her. 

                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not like you didn’t deserve 
                        it.

           Colt and Raymundo grab shovels and cover the grave.

           A SHORT TIME LATER

           With the grave completely covered, Colt and Raymundo set 
           white rocks on top of it. Like gravestones.

           Going WIDE OVERHEAD ... the white rocks fill the pasture in a 
           large design... the petroglyph... stretching the length of 
           the field.  

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           A TOW TRUCK pulls up in front of the Volvo. A MECHANIC hoists 
           out... followed by... 

           MAXINE, climbing from the passenger side.   
           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Kelly’s seated at the dining table, her finger outlining the 
           ivory petroglyph. At the window, Rory, dressed, cleaned up, 
           spots Maxine and the tow truck.  

                                 RORY
                        I used to think about how our lives 
                        would be... if I never lied to you.

                                 KELLY
                        I wonder how they’d be if you kept 
                        lying. 

                                 RORY
                        Aren’t you worried I’ll say 
                        something? About all this? 

           Kelly thinks about it... then:

                                 KELLY
                        You’re an awesome actor. 

           Rory turns to her. Grim. 

           INT. TOW TRUCK - DRIVING - DUSK

           Hauling the Volvo. Rory and Maxine seated beside the 
           Mechanic.  

                                 MAXINE
                        Well? Did she leave him? What did 
                        he say? Was he pissed? Did he try 
                        to hurt you? 

           Rory doesn’t even begin to know how to answer that. 

                                 MAXINE (CONT’D)
                        Rory? ... Rory?

                                 RORY
                        They’re gonna try counseling. Try 
                        to work it out. They might even try 
                        the steps. I told them, “You know, 
                        being in a program isn’t easy. A 
                        lot of ups and downs. But if you 
                        commit to it, if you really give 
                        yourself over to it, it can save 
                        your life.” They want to be honest 
                        with each other. Like us. 

           Maxine tries to wrap her head around that, given everything. 
           Rory looks out the window at the beautiful sea of green. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DUSK

           The tow truck speeds away in the opposite direction of the 
           road sign:

                                 WELCOME TO THE BERKSHIRES
                             AMERICA’S PREMIER CULTURAL RESORT

           EXT. TERRACE - DUSK

           Raymundo pulls a red hot BRANDING IRON (in the shape of the 
           petroglyph) from the fire pit. Hands it off to Colt, who then 
           hands it off to Kelly. 

           Kelly takes the branding iron and... presses it to her arm. 

           SSSSSSSS... leaving a deep burn. 

           INT. STALLION PADDOCK - HORSE STABLE - DUSK

           Kelly enters, approaching Poseidon’s stall. The stallion 
           gapes back at her as TODD’S CONDEMNED SOUL screams from 
           within:

                                 TODD (V.O.)
                        Help me... Help me... HELP ME!!! 

           Kelly smiles. Poseidon smiles back. 

           EXT. HORSE STABLE - DUSK

           Raymundo and Colt throw open the stable doors. Kelly bursts 
           from the stable, riding Poseidon. 

           EXT. FIELD - DUSK

           Kelly races Poseidon across the open field, a vapor trail of 
           dust in their wake... 

           It looks like fire.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
