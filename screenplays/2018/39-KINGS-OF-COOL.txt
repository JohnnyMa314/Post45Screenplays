           OVER BLACK.

           A ROUSING jazz-rock INSTRUMENTAL, welcomed with raucous 
           APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

           The familiar nails-on-chalk VOICE of...

                                 JAY LENO  (V.O.)
                        ... It hailed!  It hailed here like 
                        three hours ago.  Isn't that 
                        unbelievable?  Hail.
                            (punchline beat)
                        Ya know, people out on Hollywood saw 
                        those tiny white pieces of ice, and 
                        they thought it was crack--

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW - DAY

           SHAMELESS LAUGHTER.  We peruse the thoroughly entertained
           CROWD -- a snapshot of America, WHITE and BLACK locals seated
           next to BLACK and WHITE tourists.  Too busy cackling, knee-
           slapping, and ogling a late night legend to realize the social
           relevance of this integration.

           TITLE OVER: Los Angeles, California, 2004

           Jump-cutting through the stock footage, we land on--

           JAY LENO, sitting behind his oak desk, jutting his fabled 
           chin, shaking his fabled head.  Adjacent to the stage, band 
           leader KEVIN EUBANKS can't stop smiling.

                                 JAY LENO
                        ...and Chad Michael Murray, so we've 
                        got good guests all week.
                            (then)
                        Let's get right to it -- my first
                        guest you know from films like Pulp
                        Fiction, Star Wars, Triple X, and
                        one of my favorites, Shaft -- he's a
                        bad motha--

                                 KEVIN EUBANKS
                            (chuckling)
                        Shut yo mouth.

                                 JAY LENO
                        He'll next be lending his voice to
                        the character of Frozone in the
                        animated movie The Incredibles, please
                        welcome the King of Cool, Samuel L
                        Jackson.
           Back on the ECSTATIC crowd -- the standing ovation FADES 
           into an audience glued to their chairs, a sea of eyeballs 
           fixated on...

           The venerable actor supreme, the foul-mouthed poet, SAMUEL L 
           JACKSON.

           As he lounges in his plush guest chair, Kangol hat cocked 
           backwards, beady eyes and venomous smile exuding a unique 
           combination of confidence, humility, and give-no-shits 
           charisma, we realize that "King of Cool" is apropos as fuck.

                                 SAMUEL L JACKSON
                        Of course.  I wouldn't have said it 
                        if I didn't mean it.
                            (then)
                        Do you think more actors of color 
                        are worthy of Oscars than nominations 
                        suggest?

           Jay squirms ever so slightly under the heat of Jackson's 
           accusatory gaze.  Giggles from the gallery.

                                 JAY LENO
                        I one hundred percent agree with 
                        anything and everything you say--

           More LAUGHTER.

                                 JAY LENO (CONT'D)
                        Moving right along -- well, we all 
                        know it's an election year.  Now, 
                        I'm not going to ask who you voted 
                        for--

                                 SAMUEL L JACKSON
                        Cause I'm sure everybody already 
                        knows the answer.

                                 JAY LENO
                        But I will ask if you've ever run 
                        for office yourself?

           Jackson smirks as he adjusts in his chair.

                                 SAMUEL L JACKSON
                            (stroking chin)
                        Yeah.
                            (then)
                        Ran for president once actually.

           Jay feigns surprise, as if his producer hadn't hand-fed him 
           the question and answer pre-show.  Skeptical, the audience 
           forces a guffaw.

                                 JAY LENO
                        Really?
                                 SAMUEL L JACKSON
                        No I'm serious.  It wasn't on the
                        big stage or anything, but it was
                        kinda intense.  In high school, there
                        was this cat... he was like this
                        teacher's pet kinda dude.
                            (then)
                        I ran for school president against 
                        him.

           Having curbed their doubt, the audience collectively GASPS, 
           leans in -- they're eating up the suspense, imagining a 
           teenage King of Cool clashing with a teacher's pet.

                                 JAY LENO
                        Well?  Did you win?

           Off Jackson, eyes narrowing, considering--

                                                          SMASH TO BLACK.

           SHAMELESS LAUGHTER.

           TITLE: ...told to Jay Fucking Leno.

           TITLE: So, you know... a completely unexaggerated and honest 
           reenactment of events.

           The laughter fades, replaced with distant CHIRPING birds and 
           a WHISPERING breeze in the hot south, where...

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           The trunk of a large oak tree stares at us -- a HOLLOW in it 
           shaped embarrassingly similar to a lady's naughty bits.

                                 MORGAN (O.S.)
                        What that look like to you?

           Two BLACK BOYS study the tree from a couple yards away.

           TITLE OVER: Chattanooga, Tennessee, 1965

           The PINT-SIZED one, with skin so fair and freckly you'd doubt 
           his blackness, scratches his cheek.  The breeze bobbles his 
           robust, CINNAMON-TINGED AFRO -- a dandelion dipped in Cheeto 
           dust.

           This isn't a young Samuel L Jackson, because Samuel L Jackson 
           isn't the hero of this story.  No, this is a young SKIP "RED" 
           DORSEY (17), the wannabe-cool "teacher's pet" known as MY 
           DAD.

                                 RED
                        What's it look like to you?
           He stands beside his darker, more average-heighted friend 
           MORGAN GINNIS (17, all talk, would steal from a collection 
           plate to buy nudie mags).

                                 MORGAN
                        C'mon, negro -- just say it.

                                 RED
                        You say it.

                                 MORGAN
                        You don't even know what it is--

                                 RED
                        You don't, and you want me to say it 
                        so you don't feel stupid.

           They return their focus to the sexy tree hole.  Skip looks 
           at Morgan out the corner of his eye, then quickly looks back 
           at the tree.

                                 MORGAN
                        Same time then.

                                 RED
                        Fine.

                                 MORGAN
                        One--

                                 RED
                        Two--

                                 MORGAN
                        Three--

                                                     MORGAN
                        RED
                Quercus virginiana.
                                             A pussy.

           Morgan BURSTS out laughing.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        What?!

                                 RED
                        That's what it is!  Also known as a 
                        southern live oak--

                                 MORGAN
                        Not the tree, negro!  The hole -- 
                        ain't you seen a pussy before?

                                 RED
                        Man, of course I have.

           Red cocks his head, studies the tree further as Morgan 
           collects rocks.
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                            (not sold)
                        There's no bush.  It's virtually 
                        unrecognizable without the pubic 
                        hair.

                                 MORGAN
                        Tummy afro, no tummy afro -- pussy's 
                        pussy.

           They sling rocks at the hole, target practice.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        My cousin showed me Playboys growin' 
                        up.  So I don't get lost down there 
                        when it's time to...

           Morgan CLUCKS his tongue as he scores a bullseye.  Red's 
           throws keep RICOCHETING off the side of the tree.

                                 RED
                        Confounded!

                                 MORGAN
                            (chuckling)
                        Maybe when the moss grows in around 
                        the clit you'll figure it out.

           He scores again.

                                 RED
                        First of all, moss doesn't grow on 
                        trees around here.  We're too far 
                        north.

           Morgan rolls his eyes.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Secondly, who in the heck copulates 
                        from the free throw line?

           Red suddenly runs up and DUNKS a rock inside the hollow, 
           they crumble with laughter.

           But the unmistakable and glorious sound of GIGGLING GIRLS 
           alarms the boys -- they scramble to hide behind the massive 
           tree trunk, watching as...

           An unaware crew of three BLACK GIRLS stroll by, carrying 
           school books and book bags.

                                 MORGAN
                            (whispering)
                        Think moss grows on them?
           But Red's in another dimension, wonderstruck by the group 
           tomboy, PATSY PALM (17, quirky dreamer, future bra burner), 
           as she catches up to her friends, TRISH and VI (17).

           Morgan clocks Red's disgustingly doting face, SCOFFS.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                            (caressing tree)
                        Negro, you best tend to the woman 
                        you got right here.  Good woman.  
                        Sturdy.  Can't run away--

                                 RED
                        Keep your voice down.

           As soon as the gaggle of girls distances itself, Red scoops 
           his book bag off the grass and trails them with stealth, 
           sliding behind a bush.  Morgan shakes his head, but follows 
           suit.

                                 MORGAN
                        Wait up.

           ON PATSY AND THE GIRLS

           Strolling home from school.  The neighborhood is quaint, 
           remnants of 1950s suburbia.  Due to "white flight", only 
           BLACK NEIGHBORS and BLACK FAMILIES pepper the streets and 
           pilot the CLASSIC CARS cruising by.

                                 PATSY
                        You know what?  It's Jim Crow all 
                        over again, except this time they're 
                        separating women from the top of the 
                        food chain instead of blacks!

                                 VI
                        I know that's right -- Jane Crow is 
                        upon us!

           The girls giggle as they pass a house, where Red and Morgan's 
           heads suddenly POP into view, still stalking from a distance.

                                 MORGAN
                            (whispering)
                        My cousin said girls don't like it 
                        when you sneak up on 'em.
                            (thinking)
                        Maybe that's why he's in prison...

                                 RED
                            (whispering)
                        I'm not sneaking, confounded.

           Red quickly TIP-TOES onto the sidewalk, Morgan shadows him -- 
           they mirror the girls' pace from the other side of the street, 
           mesmerized by the rhythmic BOUNCE of their curves.
           ON PATSY AND THE GIRLS

           Oblivious.

                        and chew gum at the same time.  What 
                        makes you think he can stop racism 
                        and sexism at the same time?

                                 VI
                        Child, I know that's right--

                        But see, accepting it is just as 
                        dangerous as the "it" itself--

                                 TRISH
                        I'm sure the school election board 
                        has a reasonable explanation--

                                 PATSY
                        Yeah, they don't want a woman 
                        president!

                                 TRISH
                        Well, what you gon' do?  Chop off 
                        your tits?
                            (spanking Patsy)
                        You'd have to narrow your hips too.  
                        And do something with that hair.

                                 VI
                            (nodding)
                        Yeah, them big ol' child-bearers 
                        scream woman.

           Off their giggles...

           ON RED AND MORGAN

           Red considers crossing the street to make contact, but stalls.

                                 MORGAN
                            (whispering)
                        If you're gonna make a move, make a 
                        move--

                                 RED
                        Get your hands off me.

           Morgan gives Red another little shove.  Heart pounding, eyes 
           ballooning, Red makes his move--

           HONK!  A rusty BLUE '56 CHEVY PICKUP screeches to a halt, 
           nearly clipping Red, causing him to jump back.
           The driver, a dusty, glowering WHITE LADY (50s), snarls at 
           the frozen boys.  She narrows her eyes, then slowly drives 
           off.

           Red looks up just in time to see Patsy and her friends 
           disappear around a corner.

           ON PATSY AND THE GIRLS

           An unhinged Patsy digs through her book bag.

                                 PATSY
                            (searching)
                        If the election board wants a man...

           She draws a banana from her bag, unzips her pants, and JAMS 
           the phallic fruit through the zipper opening, exposing her 
           "penis" to the world.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        I'll give 'em one!

           The girls SQUEAL as Patsy attacks them with her makeshift 
           cock.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        And maybe, just maybe, if I dangle 
                        my meat just right, drag my knuckles 
                        ever so slightly, and slow my speech 
                        to a crawl?  They'll be fooled!

           Patsy THRUSTS her hips, pretending to hump invisible woman 
           after invisible woman.  The girls can't stop laughing.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                            (best man voice)
                        Oh c'mon, baby -- gimme some sugar!

           As Patsy strokes her banana, they round a corner and the 
           other girls suddenly stop laughing and straighten up.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        Watch me spread my seed--

           She's the last to notice...

           Three strapping, BLACK TEENAGE BOYS painting a wooden fence. 
           The shirtless one, with abs for days, wipes his brow, smiles
           at his blushing audience.  This is the captain of the
           Riverside High School Basketball Team, DOUGLAS (17, too smooth
           to be humble).

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Ladies...?

           The boys stare curiously at Patsy's penis -- embarrassed,
           she quickly ZIPS UP her fly, causing the smooshed banana to 
           squeeze out of its peel and PLOP onto the sidewalk.  Douglas's
           TEAMMATES recoil in horror.

                                 TEAMMATES
                        Goddamn.

                                 TRISH
                            (twirling hair)
                        We don't know her.

                                 VI
                        I know that's right--

           Patsy smacks Vi's shoulder as she stuffs the remaining peel 
           down her pant leg and closes the zipper.  Douglas chuckles, 
           scoops the banana off the warm concrete.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Very attractive.

           The girls melt.  Douglas tosses the fruit into a trash bag.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
                        To ants.  Can't be having them all 
                        over the sidewalk.

           Patsy deflates a little.

                                 TRISH
                            (fake as shit)
                        I keep sayin', litter bugs are the 
                        plague of our generation!

                                 TEAMMATE #1
                        Y'all comin' to the game on Wednesday?

                                 VI
                            (coy)
                        Maybe.  Y'all got special seats for 
                        us?

                                 TEAMMATE #2
                        The best seat in the house is right 
                        here on my lap.  I'll reserve it--

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Now how she gon' sit on your lap if 
                        you're playing in the game?

           Teammate #2 realizes his fucked up logic.

                                 TEAMMATE #2
                        Hell, I'll ride the pine then!

                                 TEAMMATE #1
                        You're a goddamn fool.
                                 TEAMMATE #2
                        At least I have the option of pullin' 
                        my ass off the bench.  Coach ain't 
                        called your number since the 
                        Greensboro Four went hungry--

           Teammate #1 pushes Teammate #2 in the chest, his fist 
           tightening.

                                 TEAMMATE #2 (CONT'D)
                        Don't start nothin' you can't finish, 
                        now.

                                 PATSY
                            (to girls)
                        Let's go--

           Douglas steps through the testosterone-filled jocks, wiping 
           his paint-stained hands, flaunting his shiny teeth.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        How 'bout you, Ms. Patsy Palm?  Your 
                        Friday nights free?
                            (then)
                        Or you got a date with another banana?

           As Patsy absorbs the attention of Riverside's most popular 
           student, and the other girls swoon, we RISE above the half-
           painted fence to the steep...

           ROOFTOP

           Of a one-story HOUSE, where Red and Morgan inconspicuously 
           inch towards the lip of the gutter, giving them a perfect 
           view of the flirt-party they weren't invited to.

                                 MORGAN
                            (whispering)
                        Well.  She's in Douglas's web now.
                            ("rest in peace")
                        She'll be missed.

           Morgan scoots away from the edge, but a focused Red isn't 
           giving up that easily.

                                 PATSY
                            (to Douglas)
                        What I do with my Friday nights is 
                        none of your business.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Oh, c'mon now.  Don't miss out on a 
                        chance to witness stallions at work 
                        on account of your pride--
                                 PATSY
                        And what makes you think we'd be at 
                        all interested in... in...
                            (re: his body)
                        Whatever you want to call this.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        My body?

           Douglas turns to find Trish and Vi giggling as the boys flex.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
                        Just a guess.

           She rolls her eyes -- her friends are not helping her argument 
           at all.

                                 PATSY
                        You know, you're very lucky.  Popular
                        with the girls, popular with the
                        boys.  And I'm assuming you've got a
                        real banana to boot -- you could run
                        for school president and help change--

                                 DOUGLAS
                            (scoff)
                        That nonsense is for losers and 
                        squares--

                                 PATSY
                        It's an honor.  One not afforded to 
                        everyone, so you should respect it!
                            (day dreaming)
                        Besides, leaders are... sexy.  Nelson 
                        Mandela, Malcolm X -- heck, even 
                        President Kennedy had a certain 
                        allure.  For a white boy...

           Red's eyes LIGHT UP.

           Patsy looks down from the clouds to find Douglas is no longer 
           paying attention to her.  He's staring at the fence.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Watching the paint dry.

           Well fuck you, asshole -- offended, Patsy drags the girls 
           away by their arms, storms off.

                                 PATSY
                        I hope y'all lose!
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Come again?  I can't hear ya over 
                        the paint.

           The boys laugh and slap skin.

           Red watches Patsy march down the street, smiles.

                                 MORGAN
                            (whispering)
                        Hurry up.

           Excited, Red rises and creeps towards the opposite side of 
           the roof where Morgan descends a ladder...

                                 RED
                            (whispering)
                        I have a plan--

           But a shingle SLIPS beneath his footing and he TUMBLES down 
           the steep slope and off the roof, barely GRABBING the gutter -- 
           his feet dangle just above the startled fence painters.

                                 TEAMMATE #2
                        What in the fuck!

           Losing his grip...

                                 RED
                            (to Morgan)
                        Help--

           But as Morgan reaches back for his friend, Douglas and the 
           jocks YANK Red to the ground by his legs.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        The hell you doin' on the roof?!

           Red rises, dusts himself off.  He GULPS as the three towering 
           athletes close in.

                                 TEAMMATE #1
                            (shoving Red)
                        He asked you a question.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        What, you spying on us?

                                 RED
                        I was hired to fix the membrane 
                        shrinkage.  Causing some cracks up 
                        there.
                            (then)
                        Lack of roof maintenance is a roof's 
                        worst enemy.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Oh, okay.

           Douglas smiles.  Red smiles.  The teammates smile.  Douglas 
           suddenly SNATCHES Red's collar and drags him off the grass 
           and into the street.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
                        I'm gonna kick your ass--

                                 RED
                        Wait, why?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Membrane shrinkage?  That's something 
                        a commie spy would say--

                                 RED
                        I'm not a spy!

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Well, put up your dukes and we'll 
                        find out.

           Douglas releases Red's collar, takes a boxing stance, and 
           circles his terrified prey.

                                 RED
                        No.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        You're gonna catch this beating dukes
                        up or dukes down.  If you put 'em
                        up, at least there's a chance some
                        of my blows careen away from your
                        face.

                                 RED
                        My face?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Yeah.

           Red POUTS, raises limp wrists and loose fists.

           A scared Morgan watches, hidden by the side of the house.  
           He "yells" at a decibel nobody can hear.

                                 MORGAN
                            (weak)
                        No!  Leave him alone!  I'll avenge 
                        you, Red!

           Douglas cocks back to throw a punch, so Red hops away and 
           cowers.
                                 RED
                        Talking fixes things.  Let's talk.

           The boys laugh as Douglas shoots them a look -- "is this 
           nigga serious?"

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Talking fixes broken toys and skinned 
                        knees, pahtna.
                            (then)
                        It don't fix grown man shit.

           Douglas charges but halts when...

                                 TEAMMATE #2
                        Hey Douglas, man.  I don't know about 
                        you, but I ain't tryin' to deal with 
                        no repercussions from beatin' down a 
                        cracka.

           Confused, Red peaks up from his cowering position -- "cracka?"

                                 DOUGLAS
                            (holding frozen punch)
                        Didn't they pass the Civil Rights 
                        Act last year.

                                 TEAMMATE #1
                        Man, you know history takes its sweet-
                        ass time.
                            (then)
                        You kick this white boy's ass and 
                        cops will be swarmin' our streets 
                        like milkmen be swarmin' Pookie mom's 
                        bedroom.
                            (then)
                        Standin' room only, ya dig--

           Teammate #2 (aka Pookie) shoves Teammate #1 in the chest, 
           who returns the favor, and an all out shoving match commences.

           Douglas sighs, drops his frozen punch, spits on the pavement.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Scram, white boy--

                                 RED
                        Now, wait one confounded minute -- 
                        I'm not white.  Don't you see the 
                        fro?

                                 DOUGLAS
                            (snickering)
                        Sure.

                                 RED
                        We go to school together!
           Ignored.  Douglas strolls back towards the blossoming fight 
           between his teammates -- he tries to break it up, but gets 
           sucked into the roughhousing after stepping in paint.

           Morgan utilizes the diversion, scurries over to Red.

                                 MORGAN
                        Let's split.

           But Red simmers, unwilling to let this go.

                                 RED
                            (to Douglas)
                        We've gone to school together for 
                        the past two and a half years!

           Amongst his black peers, Red might as well be a ghost -- the 
           meatheads are more focused on circling each other in street, 
           knuckles up.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Riverside?  The all black school?!

           Morgan desperately yanks on his appalled friend's elbow.  
           See, Morgan has a healthy 1960s fear of white people and 
           just now he spots...

           That dusty WHITE LADY a kitty-corner away, unloading junk 
           wood from the back of her blue Chevy pickup.  We notice GIANT 
           WOODEN SCULPTURES in her front yard.  Hideous art.

           She doesn't seem to mind the swelling commotion, continues 
           to pull wood pieces from her truck.

                                 MORGAN
                            (nervous)
                        C'mon, Red!  While the gettin's good.

           But Red rips his arm away, picks up a rock...

                                 RED
                        I am NOT WHITE!

           And LAUNCHES it towards Douglas's crew to get their undivided 
           attention -- unfortunately, his throw clears them and manages 
           to sail across the street, THUMPING one of those ugly fucking 
           pieces of art.

           Morgan's eyes bulge as the White Lady pauses, eye twitching, 
           then abruptly draws a Louisville Slugger from her truck and 
           marches towards the tomfoolery.

           Red and Morgan freeze with fear.

                                 WHITE LADY
                        Hey!
           But the jocks don't notice her, so she swings and CRACKS a 
           mailbox five times -- overkill, but it works.

                                 WHITE LADY (CONT'D)
                        Which one of you threw it?!

           Silence.  She studies their faces, baseball bat extended.  
           She WHACKS the mailbox again.

                                 WHITE LADY (CONT'D)
                        I will not be intimidated, you
                        understand?!
                            (then)
                        Don't care how many of y'all move
                        'round here, I ain't leavin'!  And
                        if I have to come over here again,
                        it'll be with a shotgun and the full
                        force of the Nooga police!

           That word "police" makes all the boys shudder -- Morgan and
           Red run off as she turns on a dime and stomps back towards
           her house.  The jocks strut back to their fence painting.

                                 DOUGLAS
                            (sotto)
                        Racist bitch.

           ON RED AND MORGAN

           Doubled over, catching their breath from a safe distance. 
           Red smirks.

                                 MORGAN
                        Why you smilin'?  You could've gotten
                        us all killed! 

                                 RED
                        Because Patsy Palm thinks presidents
                        are sexy.

                                 MORGAN
                        So?

                                 RED
                        So, I'm going to run--

                                 MORGAN
                            ("yeah right")
                        You mean, you're gonna lose.

           As a mischievous smile crawls across Red's face, Dance of
           the Sugar Plum Fairy from THE NUTCRACKER SUITE plays.

                                 RED
                        You can't lose if nobody else is
                        running.
           Off the magical high octave, staccato MUSIC NOTES--

                                                          SMASH TO BLACK.

                              3 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION...

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA MIDDLE SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

           TIGHT on a perpetually vexed black face -- chiseled jaw,
           clean haircut with a pomade sheen, familiar beady eyes
           squinting as he drags on a JOINT that's been reduced to a
           roach.  A kettle not yet hot enough to blow.

           This, my friend, is the young "King of Cool", the teenage
           "SAM" JACKSON (17)...

           WIDER to reveal his tall, gaunt frame, overstated by the
           tight BALLERINA TUTU and WHITE LEGGINGS he casually wears as
           he leans against the brick facade.

           As Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy fades, Sam checks his watch,
           takes one last drag until--

                                 AUNT MAVIS (O.S.)
                        Sam?!

           Shit!  He extinguishes the roach against the brick, launches
           it as far as he can with all of his might, then shimmies and
           waves his hands violently to curb the smell.

           The back door creaks open and out pops his sweet AUNT MAVIS 
           (40s).

                                 AUNT MAVIS (CONT'D)
                            (rushed)
                        You're almost on, baby!

           She shoots him an accusatory glance, but then beams, pinches 
           his dimple.

                                 AUNT MAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Don't you look perfect.

           Sam gives her a cheek-busting grin, then follows her inside, 
           dropping the smile once her back is turned.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA MIDDLE SCHOOL - BACKSTAGE AUDITORIUM - LATER

           From stage left, Sam watches anxiously as BLACK MIDDLE SCHOOL 
           KIDS (13) perform The Nutcracker Suite to an audience of 
           enthralled BLACK PARENTS.  He's suddenly startled by--

           Aunt Mavis and his lovely, hard-working Christian mother, 
           SARAH (40s).
                                 AUNT MAVIS
                        Didn't I tell you he looks perfect.

                                 SARAH
                        He sure looks like somethin'--

                                 SAM
                        I'm n-n-n-not doin' it.

           And just like that, we realize that Sam has a heavy STUTTER.

                                 SARAH
                            (sympathetic)
                        Is it an N day?

                                 SAM
                        Why are we even doin' n-n-n-nutcracker 
                        in September?

                                 AUNT MAVIS
                            (pointing at her brain)
                        So we ain't gotta compete with the 
                        white production.
                            (then)
                        Listen, baby, it's like I said -- 
                        you ain't got any lines.  You just 
                        gotta be... fairy like.

           Sam walks away, but Sarah pulls him back by the hand.

                                 SARAH
                        The way I see it, you made a 
                        commitment to your auntie.  She asked 
                        for your help, and you obliged.

           Aunt Mavis watches her production on pins and needles, 
           cringing.  The PIANIST starts to play Dance of the Sugar 
           Plum Fairy, but the performers look around confused.

                                 AUNT MAVIS
                        Lord I'ma have a heart attack -- the 
                        critics'll eat me alive if I ain't 
                        got no Sugar Plum Fairy!

           Sarah lifts Sam's chin, stares into his eyes.

                                 SARAH
                        When you commit, you commit good and 
                        hard.  Now, be the best fairy you 
                        know how.  For your auntie.
                            (whispering)
                        But really, for your momma.

                                 SAM
                        Yes, ma'am.
           A momma's boy through and through, Sam can't help but smile -- 
           Aunt Mavis claps HARD to get the pianist's attention, motions 
           for him to start over.  She grabs Sam by the arm and swings 
           him towards the stage.

                                 AUNT MAVIS
                            (to Sam)
                        Remember, with passion!

           ON STAGE

           The SPOTLIGHT rocks Sam, stunning him -- the audience, 
           shrouded in darkness, seems to extend forever -- the belt-
           high child performers impatiently gawk.

           Snapping out of it, Sam finds the rhythm of the staccato 
           piano notes.  He twirls and parades across the stage, mouthing 
           the poorly choreographed steps to himself.

           The weed kicks in as he spins back towards the spectators, 
           whose eyes now GLOW YELLOW like wolves at night -- snow-
           covered TREES and TOY SOLDIERS come ALIVE on stage.

           Frightened, Sam looks over to Sarah and Aunt Mavis who slowly 
           nod with delight.

           He fights through the terror, audience members and kid 
           performers stifling laughter as the music SWELLS and the 
           Sugar Plum Fairy's dance ends with a flurry of pirouettes.

           Silence.

           Sam stares out into the darkness, then abruptly DARTS off 
           stage, brushing passed his mom and aunt.

                                 AUNT MAVIS
                        Bravo, I said bravissimo!

                                 SARAH
                            (concerned)
                        Baby--

           But Sam POPS the backdoor and disappears.

           ON STAGE

           APPLAUSE from the audience -- it's the kind of penny-budget 
           production parents adore.  The OVATION carries us to...

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Where Sam smokes a fresh joint, eyelids shut.  Therapy.  The 
           CLAPPING continues as Sam blindly hands the weed to a large, 
           rotund teen sitting beside him.  This is DARIUS BLACK (17, 
           overgrown teddy bear, an easy punching bag given his shyness).
           They're both sitting Indian-style, so in-tune they don't 
           need to see in order to seamlessly pass the mary jane back 
           and forth.  But just as the APPLAUSE crescendos, Sam breaks 
           concentration, pops his lids, and the CLAPPING stops--

                                 SAM
                        I'm tired of waiting!

           Now wearing crisp slacks and a polo shirt, Sam snarls.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        You w-w-wanna dine, you wanna ride,
                        you w-w-wanna pick your dang teeth,
                        you gotta w-w-w-wait for the so called
                        superior race to do it first!  I'm
                        tired of it!

           Darius shrugs.

                                 DARIUS
                        You bring any Yoo-hoo?

                                 SAM
                        Shut up and hand me my trunks, I'm 
                        going swimmin'.

           Darius peeks over a fallen tree, down an embankment to the 
           river below where WHITE TEENS swim and play.

                                 DARIUS
                        But white folk still down there.

                                 SAM
                        W-what did I say?

           Darius digs through Sam's backpack, curiously pulls out the 
           tutu and leggings.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Don't dirty the tutu.  Gotta give it 
                        back to my auntie.

           He stuffs the tutu back in the bag, hands Sam his swim trunks.

                                 DARIUS
                        Your auntie turning you into a 
                        thespian?

                                 SAM
                            (scoff)
                        I'm n-n-no actor.  I hate that 
                        froufrou stuff.  I'm an activist.  
                        Like Dr. King.

           Darius stares blankly as Sam disrobes.  Sam pauses.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (beat)
                        Go on, put yours on too.

           Darius SIGHS, but follows orders.

           LATER

           Looking like a human number 10, Sam and Darius stand side by 
           side at the edge of the embankment with nothing but their 
           swim suits on -- they stare nervously at the activity down 
           at the river below.

           Darius suddenly turns to leave, Sam grabs him.

                                 SAM
                            (re: white people)
                        They're like sharks -- they'll eat 
                        your fear, but respect your power.

                                 DARIUS
                        I don't know, Sam--

                                 SAM
                        N-now, to keep them on their toes, 
                        you should go first--

                                 DARIUS
                        What?!

           Darius shakes his head.  Sam scoffs.

                                 SAM
                        You're such a b-b-baby.

           But Sam can't quite muster the courage either.  And just 
           when he does--

           A white boy, TAYLOR (17), approaches from behind, joined by 
           a WHITE GIRL and WHITE BOY (17) -- frolicking towards the 
           river with towels.  They're slightly startled by the black 
           teens, but otherwise pleasant.

           Darius gasps, stares at the ground despite towering over 
           everyone.  Sam holds his poise, smiles warmly.

                                 TAYLOR
                            ("greetings")
                        Boys.

           Sam fights his instinct to stare at the ground, makes eye 
           contact with Taylor, nods.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Nice out here, ain't it?  Perfect 
                        day for a swim.
                                 SAM
                        N-n-n-nice.  Yeah.

           The white kids stifle chuckles.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Right on.

           And as the white folks pass through, Sam nods to the girl.

                                 SAM
                        Ma'am.

           Taylor suddenly stops.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Say what now?

           Darius hyperventilates.

                                 SAM
                        I d-d-didn't--

                                 TAYLOR
                        D-d-didn't what?
                            (then)
                        You eyein' my girl?

           Defiantly, Sam locks eyes with the bully.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        That's some mighty fine swim wear.  
                        I bet you'll be the shiniest garbage 
                        man in the city.
                            (then)
                        You do know you ain't gonna be nothin' 
                        more than a garbage man, right?  Not 
                        like that's news.

           Sam's jaw tightens.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Well, shoot.  I'm gonna do you a 
                        solid and give ya your first lesson 
                        in waste management.

           He digs in his pocket, pulls out a stick of gum.  Taylor 
           chews it slowly, then crumples up the wrapper and tosses it 
           on the ground.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Pick up that trash.

           Giggles.  Sam's eyes burn from not blinking.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Don't fail my course now.
           Darius, eyes still glued to the dirt, leans in to pick it up 
           himself--

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Nope.  I want Shiny to do it.
                            (staring at Sam)
                        So what's it gonna be, Shiny?

           Sam boils, opens his mouth to speak, but then... he abjectly 
           bends down and picks up the gum wrapper.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        There.  Now that's a goddamn garbage 
                        man.
                            (then)
                        I'm sure we'll be done before dark.

           Laughing, the white folks head down the embankment, leaving 
           a deflated number 10 in their wake.

                                 SAM
                            (beat)
                        They lucky they left when they d-
                        did.  I was about to--

           But Darius has heard enough, turns away to collect his things.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        W-w-where you goin'?
                            (nothing)
                        Fine, ya big b-baby.  But w-w-when I 
                        go to Morehouse and follow in the 
                        footsteps of Dr. King, don't come 
                        crawlin' b-back.

           Darius mumbles something under his breath.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (livid)
                        What?!

                                 DARIUS
                        You ain't going to Morehouse.
                            (then)
                        Not with your grades.

           Looking up, Darius finally clocks Sam's furious eyes boring 
           through him and trails off.

                                 DARIUS (CONT'D)
                            (scared)
                        But if you added a major 
                        extracurricular activity to your 
                        resume...

                                 SAM
                        I'm drum major!
           Darius frowns -- that ain't enough.

           Sam absorbs this, then squeezes Darius's shoulders.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Grab my b-bag.
                            (then)
                        We've got work to do.

           Determined to keep his dream alive, Sam strides off, leaving 
           an incredulous Darius to pick up both of their bags and catch 
           up.  Suddenly, the loud RING of a school bell...

           EXT./INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A classic facade, kempt and sturdy enough -- but as we glide 
           through the front doors...

           And into a hallway brimming with a SEA OF BLACK STUDENTS 
           scampering to their respective classrooms, we notice peeling 
           tiles on the floors and cracked walls with crumbling plaster.

           A MAINTENANCE MAN (50s, black) kicks a bucket in place to 
           catch water drips from a leaky pipe.  He's satisfied until a 
           second drip line splats his head.  Sigh -- new day, same 
           shit.

           We dip in and out of various classrooms, a couple with boarded-
           up windows, ALL packed to the gills with an abnormal amount
           of BLACK STUDENTS -- wobbly desks practically on top of each
           other.  Students along the perimeter sit with no desk at
           all, balancing notebooks and textbooks on their knees.

           Even still, we push back outside into the PARKING LOT where 
           a row of parked SCHOOL BUSES house more students in makeshift 
           classrooms.

           INT. SCHOOL BUS CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

           We find dozens of students sitting in the bus seats.  They 
           have the exuberance of typical teenagers, oblivious to their 
           school's inadequacies.

           At the head of the "class", a black teacher, MR. IRVING (40s), 
           hands a stack of WORN TEXTBOOKS to Red, who distributes them 
           to his classmates.

                                 MR. IRVING
                            (to class)
                        These are new editions, used, but at 
                        least no pages are missing.
                            (then)
                        And as a result, we will be able to 
                        continue our exhaustive studies of 
                        the American history.  In.  Its.  
                        Entirety.
           Collective GROANS from the students.  Red hands out a couple 
           of books, moves down the aisle, stops at the row of...

           Patsy Palm.  He just stares.

                                 PATSY
                            (hello?)
                        May I have one?

                                 RED
                        Yeah, of course.

           He struggles to pull a textbook from the middle of his 
           teetering stack rather than from the top.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        This one looks like it has the 
                        crispest pages.

                                 PATSY
                        Crisp is good, thanks.

           He just stares.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        Yes?

                                 RED
                        Do you like that one?  You can have 
                        anyone you want really, I just -- I 
                        could take his back.

           Red tries to repossess a book he already handed out but the 
           owner hangs on for dear life.

                                 PATSY
                            (blushing)
                        No, this is...

           She pops open her book and notices a black square, as if 
           someone had covered writing with marker.  She rubs the square, 
           then curiously flips to the next page where the writing has 
           left an impression -- she closes the book.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        It's great, thank you.

           Red nods, keeps it moving with an unbreakable smile.  As 
           soon as he leaves, Patsy reopens the book and lightly rubs 
           pencil lead over the impression, spelling out "DIE NIGG" -- 
           she SLAMS the book shut, no need to finish that.

                                 MR. IRVING (O.S.)
                        Remember.  Cherish these books,
                        protect them.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. IRVING (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        They will be yours for the remainder
                        of the year, but they will be someone
                        else's thereafter...

           Patsy deflates.

           Done helping, Red takes a seat next to Morgan towards the 
           back of the bus.

                                 MORGAN
                            (whispering)
                        I'm shocked teacher let you off your 
                        leash--

                                 RED
                            (whispering)
                        Fool, it's a quid pro quo.  I hand 
                        out the books, and he'll let me hand 
                        out these after class.

           Red opens his backpack, filled with handmade FLIERS that 
           read "VOTE SKIP DORSEY FOR PRESIDENT".  Morgan nods -- nicely 
           played.

                                 MORGAN
                        Too bad your charm only works on 
                        educators.

                                 RED
                        What?

           He follows Morgan's gaze to the front of the class, where 
           Patsy exchanges the textbook Red gifted her for another one.

           Red sulks in his chair.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

           A crack in the wall is abruptly covered with a basic-ass 
           poster that reads "FEEL BLUE NO MORE, VOTE RED FOR 
           PRESIDENT!".  Beneath the slogan is a picture of a sad sack 
           next to a black & white photo of an awkwardly smiling Red.

           Red finishes mounting the poster, Morgan stands behind him, 
           unimpressed.  Nobody in the crowded hall seems to care.

                                 MORGAN
                        Spent a lot of time on that did you?

                                 RED
                            ("fuck off")
                        I only need one vote.

           Red heads for his rusty locker, struggles to pry it open.
                                 MORGAN
                        Your slogan shoulda been more
                        provocative -- like "what does the
                        blood of Christ and your next
                        president have in common?  They're
                        both Red!"

           Dramatically, Morgan mimics Christ dangling from the cross.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        With your head on his body, suffering 
                        for the people.  Blood everywhere--

                                 RED
                        Sounds remarkably blasphemous.

                                 MORGAN
                            ("suit yourself")
                        My cousin says controversy is like 
                        your mornin' coffee, it wakes you 
                        the hell up.

                                 RED
                            (working locker door)
                        Don't hurt yourself.  All I have to 
                        do is give the requisite speech at 
                        assembly today and I'm a shoo-in--

                                 PATSY (O.S.)
                        Having trouble?

           They spin to find Patsy calmly leaning against the next 
           locker, studying Red's flier.

           Fearful of embarrassment, Red fights even harder with his 
           stuck locker door.

                                 RED
                        Not at all.

                                 PATSY
                            (re: flier)
                        I'm impressed.  I was starting to 
                        think nobody would run.

                                 RED
                        It's my patriotic duty.  I'm surprised 
                        nobody else had the guts to put their 
                        name in the hat.

           She blinks away her frustration.

                                 PATSY
                        As a matter of fact, I put my name 
                        in the hat--
           Morgan belly laughs as Red continues to strain against the 
           rusty locker.

                                 MORGAN
                        That's rich -- a girl president?!

                                 PATSY
                            (seething)
                        I suppose you agree with the Election 
                        Committee then -- that I'd be more 
                        suited running for Miss Riverside?

           Just then the reigning MISS RIVERSIDE (18) struts by, stealing 
           everyone's attention -- a vapid black debutante in a flowing 
           halter dress and a SASH around her torso that reads "Miss 
           Riverside".

           Catching whiffs of her passing perfume, the BOYS in the hall 
           melt.  She stops for her audience, does a twirl and curtsey, 
           all while giggling like a field mouse.

                                 MORGAN
                            (still distracted)
                        I dunno, that's a mighty big sash to 
                        fill--

           Red flicks Morgan's shoulder, then gives one last yank, 
           CRACKING open his locker door.  Proud of himself.

                                 RED
                        I think you'd be a fantastic Miss 
                        Riverside--

           She SLAMS the locker door shut.

                                 PATSY
                        Miss Riverside doesn't have the ear 
                        of faculty, the president does.  
                        Now, how do you plan on bettering 
                        our school?

                                 RED
                        Come again--

                                 PATSY
                        This black facility is in a shameful 
                        state--

                                 RED
                        Now wait a minute, we're in no worse 
                        shape than everyone else.  Black or 
                        white.
                            (then)
                        Every school has its headaches.

           Patsy shakes her head, smirks at the naivete.  She steps in 
           close, fixes Red's collar, which makes him and Morgan gulp.
                                 PATSY
                        You are doing this for the right 
                        reasons, aren't you?

                                 RED
                            (sweating)
                        Of... of course, but--

                                 PATSY
                        And if you win, you'd do everything 
                        in your power to enrich the 
                        educational experience of our student 
                        body, wouldn't you?
                            (seductive)
                        Like, say, making sure we don't have 
                        to use hand-me-down books anymore?

           Red can only muster a nod.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        Outta sight!  Then I hope you beat 
                        Sam Jackson.

           On a dime, she perks up, and skips down the hallway.

                                 MORGAN
                            (beat)
                        I change my mind.  She definitely 
                        has what it takes to be Miss 
                        Riverside.

           But the swooning is short lived -- Red's eyes suddenly bulge.  
           He grips Morgan by the lapels.

                                 RED
                        Confounded, who the heck is Sam 
                        Jackson?!

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - BACK LAWN - LATER

           The SHRIEK of a WHISTLE.

           It's nestled between the lips of Sam Jackson as he marches 
           on the grass, twirling a baton.  He uses the whistle in an 
           attempt to command the pitiful BLACK MARCHING BAND following.

           They're all wearing civilian clothes during practice, though 
           Sam rocks his formal white hat adorned with a large blue 
           feather.

           Yards away, Red and Morgan spy, hiding beneath a school bus.

                                 RED
                            (nervous)
                        He's the confound band leader?!
                                 MORGAN
                        This cat ain't nothin'.  I heard he 
                        lives on the wrong side of the tracks.  
                        And get this, he barely speaks, a 
                        total loner, ya dig?

           As Red watches Sam shimmie and shake his hips, a goddamn 
           dancing machine, his confidence wanes.

                                 RED
                        I'm not exactly James Brown--

                                 MORGAN
                        Damn right, you're not!  But nobody's 
                        as popular as James Brown, cause 
                        nobody's as good!

                                 RED
                        Amen.

                                 MORGAN
                        I don't care what the white man says, 
                        Elvis got twice the jaw and half the 
                        charisma.

                                 RED
                        A disgrace to even mention them in 
                        the same breath.

                                 MORGAN
                        But here's the rub, negro.  You've 
                        got a true gift, the gift of gab -- 
                        all you have to do is win 'em over 
                        with a bitchin' speech.

           Red's fixated on Sam jutting that baton up and down, up and 
           down, up and down...

                                 RED
                            (steely eyed)
                        The pen is mightier than the baton.

           Confidence rising.

                                 MORGAN
                        Pretty sure that ain't a saying, but 
                        fine.

           Red and Morgan scoot back, disappearing into the darkness of 
           the bus shadow.

           ON SAM

           As he whistles and marches with confident steps, but the 
           band lags off beat, nowhere close to following its leader.
           Sam finally turns to face them, recognizing the lack of 
           enthusiasm and blatant disrespect.

                                 SAM
                        C'mon, p-p-people.  We haven't found 
                        the tempo yet.  And we certainly 
                        haven't f-found the formation.  
                        Where's your sp-pirit?
                            (then)
                        Blue and white, fight fight!

                                 MARCHING BAND
                            (singing, no energy)
                        We are the Trojans, mighty, mighty 
                        Trojans...

           They defiantly wave him off.

                                 BAND MEMBER #1
                        We get your concern, but here's the 
                        thing: we don't care.

                                 SAM
                        Excuse me?

           Collective MOANS and heavy eye rolls as the band members 
           slowly peel away, leaving Sam behind with his feathered hat.

                                 BAND MEMBER #2
                        He didn't stutter.

           Sam opens his mouth to call after them... but doesn't.  He 
           sighs.

                                 DARIUS (O.S.)
                        I think they're warming up to you.

           Darius is seated beneath a tree, sipping a tasty Yoo-hoo.  
           Sam strides over to him...

                                 SAM
                        Shut up.

           And SLAPS the chocolate beverage out of his hand, then storms 
           off.  Darius pouts.

           EXT./INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           Silence.  The buses and classrooms are curiously empty.  But 
           as we make our way through the deserted hallways, the THUNDER 
           of a thousand footsteps mounts, growing bigger and bigger 
           until we enter the...

           GYMNASIUM

           Which is OVERFLOWING with impatient students, STOMPING their
           feet in the packed stands.  
           Their collective chatter is deafening.

           At the front of the auditorium, the reigning Miss Riverside 
           completes a horrendously sultry, Marilyn Monroe-esque cover 
           of The Star Spangled Banner.  A mixed bag of applause and 
           boos.

           Mr. Irving takes the podium, testing the microphone with 
           echoing taps.  He's flanked by Red and Sam, both seated, 
           both sweating bullets.

                                 MR. IRVING
                        Thank you, Miss Johnson for that... 
                        flavorful rendition of our nation's 
                        anthem.
                            (then)
                        The Election Committee is happy to
                        announce we finally have not one,
                        but two candidates for Student Council
                        President.  Mr. Sam Jackson and Mr.
                        Skip Dorsey!

           The audience follows Mr. Irving's lead in clapping, though 
           most students share confused looks like "who?".

                                 MR. IRVING (CONT'D)
                        Now, since it took so long for us to
                        find these brave gentlemen, they'll
                        only have a matter of days to campaign
                        before the big election.  So let's
                        get started, shall we?

           Mr. Irving steps away from the podium, to find Red, in a 
           full suit and tie, waiting to greet him with a firm handshake.

                                 RED
                        I won the coin toss.  Thank you for 
                        your eloquent introduction.

           What the fuck -- Mr. Irving forces a smirk, shakes the boy's 
           hand.  Red makes his way to the seated Sam, extends a hand.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Good luck, young man.

           Sam furrows his brow, looks away without shaking.  Red smiles.

           At the podium, Red clears his throat, organizes his index 
           cards, then adjusts the microphone down to his level.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                            (to audience)
                        What makes a leader?
                            (beat for effect)
                        Is it the totality of their words?  
                        The totality of their actions?
           His index cards suddenly SLIP through a crack in the wood, 
           disappearing inside the podium.  He stifles panic, wings it.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Ummm... the answer?  The answer is --
                        neither!  Because a true leader is
                        born, not made.  A true leader rises
                        from the ashes of injustice to give
                        voice to the disenfranchised!

           The crowd is at a loss, students and teachers alike managing 
           lion-sized yawns.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Fear not, for a leader is among you! 
                        One who will not build walls but
                        bridges -- between student and
                        teacher, boy and girl, freshman and
                        senior.  One who will scream to the
                        heavens until the world knows our
                        name!  Blue and white, fight fight!
                            (big finish)
                        We are the Trojans, mighty-mighty 
                        Trojans!

           A standing ovation from a single member of the audience: 
           Morgan.  A smattering of weak applause from the rest.  Red 
           scans the house, finds Patsy and her friends whispering -- 
           they're clapping, compulsory claps, but clapping nonetheless.

           He reclaims his seat with a sigh of relief.

                                 MR. IRVING
                            (into microphone)
                        Now.  Sam Jackson.

           No suit, no index cards, Sam wipes his damp palms on his 
           slacks, reluctantly steps up to the podium and adjusts the 
           microphone up to his height.

                                 SAM
                            (to audience, a beat)
                        Th-th-th-th-the...

           Kids choke down giggles.  Sam's a deer in headlights, the 
           audience seemingly extends forever, their eyes GLOWING A 
           DEMONIC YELLOW.

           He clocks an EXIT SIGN stage right, salvation -- no, he fights 
           the urge, deep breath.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Th-th-the Negro is still not free.

           Raised brows -- that certainly got their attention.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        The l-life of the Negro is still s-
                        sadly crippled by th-the chains of 
                        discrimination.

           People sit up in their chairs, Red flusters.

                                 RED
                            (to himself)
                        Confounded, he stole that from Martin 
                        Luther King, Jr.

                                 SAM
                        So too is th-the life of the Negro 
                        student.  I promise to g-give you 
                        your freedom back.  Freedom to l-
                        leave campus during lunch.

           Students nod in agreement.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        F-freedom for seniors to park their 
                        cars in the teacher's lot.

           Seniors CHEER.  Mr. Irving folds his arms, incredulous -- 
           "over my dead body, negro."

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (a dramatic beat)
                        F-f-free potato chips in the 
                        cafeteria.

           The crowd loses its FUCKING MIND as Sam simply takes a seat.  
           Red can barely contain his disbelief, but the audience is 
           eating up the empty promises.

           Sam sends Red a cocky wink.  As Mr. Irving makes his way to 
           the podium, Red suddenly rips off his tie and blazer then 
           beats Irving to the mic.

                                 RED
                            (to audience)
                        My brothas.  My sistas.

           Red bows his head and raises a fist in the air.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        I forgot to mention, if you vote for 
                        me... I will work tirelessly to make 
                        sure James Brown performs at prom.
                            (lying)
                        I have an in.

           Students go wild, the tide turning in his favor.  So caught 
           up in the battle, Red fails to notice a disappointed Patsy 
           shaking her head.
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                            (catching the holy 
                             ghost)
                        Free at last, free at last!

           Irving rolls his eyes as Red steps away from the podium, 
           shooting Sam a proud smirk.

           But before Irving can conclude the assembly, Sam jumps back 
           onto the mic.

                                 SAM
                            (to audience)
                        Vote for me and I'll m-m-march in 
                        Washington until they paint at least 
                        half the White House black!

           Roars for Sam.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (looking at Red)
                        That's black.  Not high yellow.

           Enraged, Red hip checks Sam and steals the mic.

                                 RED
                        Vote for me and I'll put a black 
                        president inside the White House!

           The audience balks at that -- an idea too bold for 1965.

                                 MR. IRVING
                        Okay, let's pump the brakes on this 
                        magical fantasy land.

           Mr. Irving shoves Red away from the mic.

                                 MR. IRVING (CONT'D)
                            (to audience)
                        That concludes our assembly, back to 
                        classes.

           The charged mob files out as a seething Sam and Red stare 
           daggers at one another.

                                 RED
                        You're full of it -- how are you 
                        going to pay for free chips?!

                                 SAM
                        The s-s-same way you're gonna pay 
                        for James Brown.

           Red groans, mad he stooped to using such gutter tactics.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        N-n-not used to playing in the mud, 
                        are you, Bourgeois Bob?
                            (leaning in)
                        Your sh-shiny suits and fancy grammar
                        m-might impress the teachers, but
                        when it c-comes to dazzling our peers? 
                        Well, you're just a couple shades
                        short--

           Red clenches his fist.

                                 RED
                        I'm just as black as you!

           Sam juts out his chin with a grin, bating his rival to swing.

                                 SAM
                            ("no you're not")
                        The face of the s-students should 
                        have the face of the students.  Don't 
                        you th-think?

           But Red simply deflates, loosens his hands as Mr. Irving re-
           enters.

                                 MR. IRVING
                        Gentlemen?  Class.

           With confidence, Sam struts off leaving a stewing Red in his 
           wake.  Mr. Irving flips a light switch as we--

                                                          SMASH TO BLACK.

                              2 DAYS UNTIL ELECTION...

           We hear the POP of gun shots.

           INT. DORSEY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           It's like the set of Bewitched threw up in here -- clean, 
           warm, inviting, yet reeking of the autumn color scheme popular 
           at the time.

           The GUN SHOTS come from the bulbous TV, where cowboys protect 
           the Ponderosa from encroaching villains.  A seething Red 
           sits in the middle of the couch, focused on the boob tube.

           The good guy gets shot and Red's eye suddenly twitches, then 
           he abruptly screams into a couch pillow and rises.

                                 RED
                        I can't even enjoy Bonanza!
           In a chair, his wise and patient mother, FAY (40s), calmly 
           continues her knitting.

                                 FAY
                            (without looking up)
                        Then turn it off.

                                 RED
                        Confounded, I'd rather watch and not 
                        enjoy it than not watch it at all!

           She barely looks up from her half-cooked sweater -- it's 
           enough.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Sorry.

           He looks down to find his precocious sister, DEWANA (12), 
           lying on the rug, making easy work of a crossword puzzle.  
           She peeks up at her brother.

                                 DEWANA
                        Kitty Kelly is odd and queer, but 
                        not peculiar.
                            (then)
                        She likes swimming pools, but not 
                        water.
                            (then)
                        Isn't that interesting?

           Red grimaces -- fuck your games.

                                 RED
                        Not interested.

           She rolls her eyes, carries on with the puzzle.  He paces, 
           thinking.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Mom, can I get an advance on my
                        allowance?  I'm going to need ten,
                        no, twenty posters.  And fifty fliers. 
                        Ooh, I can dust off the ol' button
                        maker and really whet their whistle!

                                 FAY
                            (still knitting)
                        Ask your father.

           Red kneels down to Dewana's level, brightens up.

                                 RED
                        Hey, Waney!  Wanna help me make some 
                        hip campaign swag--

                                 DEWANA
                        Not interested.
           An offended Red backs off just as James Brown's hit Night 
           Train amplifies...

           We're tight on spinning vinyl that plays just outside of the

           BATHROOM

           Where a dapper man, years removed from his sailor gruff, 
           marvels at his trimmed mustache in the mirror.  This is Red's 
           father, BILLY (40s) -- Clark Gable's light-skinned 
           doppelgänger.

           Red grooves to the music in the doorway as Billy meticulously 
           straightens his hair with an electric hot, metal comb.  His 
           eyes never leave his reflection.

                                 RED
                        JB is so boss--

                                 BILLY
                        You're not going to settle your beef 
                        with a button, son.

                                 RED
                        It's an election, not a backyard 
                        brawl.

                                 BILLY
                        He challenged your blackness, didn't 
                        he?

                                 RED
                        Yeah--

                                 BILLY
                        Then that's a fight.
                            (then)
                        See, son, it's about respect.  You 
                        let 'em take the "rest" all you're 
                        left with is a "pec".

           Red rolls his eyes.

                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                        He eye your girl -- that's a fight.  
                        He scuff your Sunday loafers -- that's 
                        a fight.  He have the gall to not 
                        bless your sneeze?
                            (then)
                        Damn.

           Billy accidentally burns his finger, sucks it.

                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                            (back to Red)
                        You better believe that's a fight.
                                 RED
                        I want to win the right way, through 
                        diplomacy.  Not because my opponent 
                        is unconscious.

                                 BILLY
                        Well at least be bold, son.

                                 RED
                        Bold?

           His father pauses, finally looks his son in the eye.  Billy 
           studies the hot comb.

                                 BILLY
                        You know who invented this?

                                 RED
                            (playing dumb)
                        Madam CJ Walker?

           Billy damn near faints.  Red chuckles.

                                 BILLY
                        Confound it, boy!  Get serious!
                            (then)
                        Your great grandfather invented this.  
                        John G Higgins...

           Red hangs on his father's story as we INTERCUT with a DREAM 
           SEQUENCE:

           INT. TENNESSEE BARBER SHOP (1907) - DAY (DREAM)

           The sharp glint of a straight razor being held by JOHN G 
           HIGGINS (50s), a stern-faced gentleman with the same light 
           skin and coiffed mustache as Billy.  He wears a black bow 
           tie and white coat -- a total fucking professional.

                                 BILLY (V.O.)
                        Or as his friends knew him: Captain 
                        Jack.

           The razor glides down to the frothy cheeks of a black patron, 
           and gives him a close shave.

                                 BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        A purveyor of style.  A man of action.  
                        Bold.

           Captain Jack puffs his cigar as the patron beams.

                                 BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But flipping barbershops wasn't enough 
                        for the Captain.  The only way to 
                        win at life?  Was to make a lasting 
                        contribution to negro-kind...
           INT. SHED (1907) - NIGHT (DREAM)

           Captain Jack, sleeves rolled up, works tirelessly at a wooden 
           workbench cluttered with metal scraps and old books on hair.

           He puffs his cigar then slowly raises the hot comb prototype 
           up to the light.

                                 BILLY (V.O.)
                        Painstakingly fashioned from a 
                        combination of metals with the highest 
                        degree of heat conductivity, the 
                        Eureka Comb was born.

           We witness a MONTAGE of black men and women using the hot 
           comb to straighten their kinky hair, allowing them to style 
           it intricately -- they do this with ecstatic, frozen smiles.

                                 BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Revolutionizing what it meant to be 
                        hip.

           EXT. TENNESSEE FACTORY (1917) - DAY (DREAM)

           A quaint residential factory built behind a simple two-story 
           house.

           Captain Jack (60s), rocking a three-piece suit, derby, and 
           cane, puffs his cigar as he stands on the sidewalk, staring 
           proudly at the half-dozen black employees assembling combs 
           in each of the big shop-windows of the factory.

                                 BILLY (V.O.)
                        Global sales hit like a tsunami, but 
                        so too came the War to End All Wars.

           The sunny tableau suddenly TIME LAPSES into a picture of 
           gloom and doom -- the last remaining employee pulls a shade 
           down over the only open factory window.

                                 BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The army appropriated all the brass 
                        and copper to fight those damned 
                        Germans.  The same materials needed 
                        to make the comb.

           We hear a cacophony of GUN SHOTS and TANK BLASTS from WW1.

                                 BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        No materials.  No sales.

           Captain Jack tightens his jaw, puffs his cigar then drops it 
           to the cement, killing it with the tip of his shoe.
           INT. BEDROOM (1919) - DAY (DREAM)

           As sunshine pours in, Captain Jack sits on the floor, leaning 
           against the bed.  He loosens his tie, takes off his derby 
           hat.  He smirks defiantly.

                                 BILLY (V.O.)
                        The government wanted to take away 
                        his victories, everything he worked 
                        so hard to achieve.

           The sharp glint of a straight razor being held by the Captain.

                                 BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        So he took it first.

           He suddenly puts the razor to his throat as his eyes bulge.

           INT. DORSEY RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The DREAM SEQUENCE ENDS, we're back with Billy and a horrified 
           Red.

           Billy holds his wet hand at his throat, flicking his fingers 
           so that the water sprays his son.

                                 BILLY
                        Now that's bold.

                                 RED
                        Jesus Christ, dad!

                                 BILLY
                        You want to leave a mark?  Be bold.  
                        Got tons of these boxed up in the 
                        garage, you should hand them out as 
                        campaign swag--

                                 RED
                        My great grandfather's death muse?!

                                 BILLY
                        You missed the point -- just take 
                        the confound thing and be inspired.

           Billy holds out the hot comb, but Red recoils.

                                 RED
                        I don't want that!

                                 BILLY
                        Boy, it's your heritage.

                                 RED
                        Heck no.

           Red pats his afro, does a spin.
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        This is my heritage.  Ya dig?

           Frustrated, Billy shakes his head as Red scoots passed his 
           entering mom.

                                 FAY
                        You get your materials?

                                 RED
                        Don't need them.  I think I'll do 
                        something bolder.

           And Red is gone.  Fay helps her husband slick his hair back 
           with water, stares at their reflection in the mirror.

                                 BILLY
                        If he asks me if 'I dig' one more 
                        time.

                                 FAY
                        If you tell that hot comb story one 
                        more time.

           He chuckles, gives his wife a smooch...

           EXT. BLACK RESIDENCE - DAY

           Just as Sam kisses his joint, inhales.  He watches as Darius 
           attempts a granny-style free throw on a ramshackle basketball 
           court attached to a house that could use some sprucing.

                                 DARIUS
                            (lining up shot)
                        How are you gonna pay for free chips 
                        in the cafeteria?

                                 SAM
                        It doesn't matter, dummy.  I just 
                        gotta t-t-tell 'em what th-they wanna 
                        hear until th-they elect me.

           Darius holds the basketball between his knees, hesitant to 
           shoot.

                                 DARIUS
                        But couldn't Dorsey do the same?

                                 SAM
                            (scoff)
                        Th-that flake doesn't have the guts--

                                 DEACON BLACK (O.S.)
                        Boy, have some got damn respect for 
                        yourself!
           Sam quickly hides the joint behind his back as Darius's 
           excessive father, DEACON BLACK (40s), bursts out the back 
           door smoking a square and eating a slice of cantaloupe -- a 
           personality so big it needs its own area code.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                            (tabling fruit)
                        Ain't no son of mine gonna shoot 
                        like a bitch.

           Deacon slaps the ball outta Darius's hands, pinches his 
           cigarette between his lips as he dribbles terribly then shoots 
           a brick that CLANGS off the rim and disappears in shrubbery.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                        The motherfucker's flat.

                                 SAM
                            (beaming)
                        Th-that was solid form th-though, 
                        Mr. Black.

           Eyeing Sam, Deacon takes a long drag of his cigarette.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        The fuck's wrong with you?

                                 SAM
                            (shy)
                        It's a t-T day.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Nigga, what in the hell is a T day--

                                 DARIUS
                            (embarrassed)
                        I told you Sam has a stutter, pop.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Man, that ain't shit.  Have you tried 
                        choppin' your throat?

                                 SAM
                            (chuckling)
                        No.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        How 'bout barking?  Whistlin'?  
                        Yellin'?
                            (then)
                        There was this retard in the army,
                        yammered all over the goddamn place. 
                        So I told 'em, next time you feel a
                        yammerin' comin'?  Just shout out
                        motherfucker.  Cleared him right up.
                                 SAM
                        My mother raised me t-t-to be a good 
                        Christian.  I don't cuss.

           Disappointed, Deacon scratches his brow.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                            (sotto)
                        Pussies of a feather.
                            (then)
                        Well what's this 'bout an election?

           Darius ventures into tall grass to find the basketball.

                                 SAM
                        I'm running against Dorsey--

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Ah yes, I know them uppity niggas.  
                        Could a negro falute any higher?

           Sam can't help but laugh.  There's something about Deacon's 
           charisma and unfiltered swag that inspires him.

           Deacon grabs a seat, takes a sloppy bite of juicy cantaloupe.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                            (dragging cigarette)
                        And why, pray tell, do you want to 
                        win?

                                 SAM
                        I'm gonna go to Morehouse--

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Nah, young buck.  Why do you really 
                        wanna win?

           Sam squirms slightly, uncomfortable.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Ain't got nothing to do with proving 
                        to everyone you ain't a deadbeat 
                        like your daddy?

           Wow, that was pointed.  Deacon's lips curl into a mischievous 
           grin.  Testing the kid's mettle, but Sam holds his ground.

                                 SAM
                            (shaking head)
                        I want t-to follow in Dr. King's 
                        footsteps.

           Deacon nods as he smokes.
                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Good, good.  The motivation dictates 
                        the advice--

                                 SAM
                        Oh, I'm fine -- we're just gonna h-
                        hand out some fliers--

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        No!

           He catches himself -- masking his personal investment.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                            (smiling)
                        No, nigga.  From what I hear you 
                        ain't got time for that.  See, 
                        whatchew gotta do is make a splash.
                            (then)
                        When you go to the pen, know what
                        the first thing you gotta do is? 
                        Find the toughest, most renowned
                        criminal in the joint and get 'em on
                        your side.  Get him?  The rest will
                        follow.

           Sam absorbs this as--

                                 DARIUS
                        Found it!

           Darius stumbles out of the bushes with the basketball.  Deacon 
           rolls his eyes, rises.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        This nigga.

           Deacon slaps the ball out of Darius's hands, misses a layup, 
           heads back inside.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Y'all mow this motherfuckin' lawn.
                            (then)
                        Oh, and Sam?  Even good Christians 
                        smoke a little Mary Jane.  Ain't 
                        that right?

           And with a wink, Deacon disappears.  Sam smirks, brings the 
           joint he's been hiding this whole time back to his lips.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Patsy Palm grabs a raggedy calculus textbook from her locker -- 
           the pages abruptly detach from the spine and smack the floor.  
           She sighs, scrambles to put her math lesson back in order.

           Her attention is stolen by COMMOTION down the hall...
           A huddled group of black students jeering and laughing at 
           SOMETHING.

           Patsy pushes through the crowd to find the kids mocking Red's 
           campaign poster, which someone has defaced to read: "FEEL 
           BLUE NO MORE, VOTE RED YELLOW FOR PRESIDENT!"  They've even 
           colored Red's black & white photo with yellow marker.

           Sympathy kicks in, Patsy shrinks amidst the laughter.

                                 BLACK STUDENT
                        What a square!

           The student rushes to the poster with a pen adding "HIGH" 
           above the "YELLOW", crossing out "PRESIDENT" and replacing 
           it with "SQUARE".  More cackling.

           Realizing, Patsy's eyes suddenly balloon.

                                 PATSY
                            (to herself)
                        He's gonna lose.

                                 VI (O.S.)
                        I know that's right.

           She finds her friend Vi standing to her right, amused by the 
           mob.  Vi clocks Patsy's alarm, shrugs.

           Patsy focuses on the marred photo of Red, gears turning.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER

           RIVERSIDE HIGH STATE CHAMPION BASKETBALL banners hang from 
           the rafters.  BLACK CHEERLEADERS practice basic routines in 
           the middle of the dusty, warped basketball court below.

           We find Sam Jackson in the corner, collecting dirty towels 
           from the floor.  He gathers another soggy towel, rises to 
           find Patsy standing before him, all smiles.

                                 PATSY
                        Mr. Jackson.  Or should I say Mr. 
                        President?

           Unbeknownst to them, ACROSS THE GYM, from the locker room 
           tunnel, Red watches their conversation with distress.

                                 DOUGLAS (O.S.)
                        Ain't got all day.

           Red whips around to address the captain of the basketball 
           team towering before him, and fights to stay focused.

                                 RED
                        Right.  You may recall we had a bit 
                        of a scuffle the other day.
           Douglas dabs his sweaty forehead with a towel, tries to 
           remember.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Oh yeah.  Cause I scored with your 
                        old lady, right?

                                 RED
                            (wtf?)
                        Um, no.

           Douglas shrugs -- must've been someone else's mom he fucked.

           ON SAM AND PATSY

           Sam ain't buying what she's selling, fills his arms with 
           another towel.

                                 PATSY
                        So, I'm sure when you win, you'll be 
                        fighting to upgrade band uniforms.

           Never crossed his mind.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                            (giddy)
                        Now, imagine if we allocated just a 
                        fraction of those funds to get brand 
                        spanking new books to--

                                 SAM
                        Man, n-nobody cares about no dang 
                        books!

           Appalled, Patsy covers her heart, gasps.

           ON RED AND DOUGLAS

           Red panics when, out the corner of his eye, he spots Patsy 
           striding away from Sam.

                                 RED
                        Listen, I'll just cut to the chase.
                            (then)
                        If the basketball team endorses me 
                        for school president, I'll... wash 
                        your jockstraps for the whole year.

           Douglas smirks knowingly, folds his arms.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        We don't wear jockstraps.

                                 RED
                        I'll wax your cars, anything!
                                 DOUGLAS
                        Here's the thing, Yellow.  Somebody 
                        beat ya to the punch.

                                 RED
                        What?

           Sam suddenly cuts in, struggling to carry all of those sweaty 
           towels.  Douglas adds his dirty towel to the pile.

                                 SAM
                            (to Douglas)
                        I'll start p-polishing your shoes as 
                        soon as I'm done washin' these.

           He winks at Red, whose jaw tightens.

                                 RED
                            (desperate)
                        Whatever he's offering, I'll double
                        it!  I'll shine your shoes next year
                        too -- heck, I'll be there on your
                        wedding day just to make sure your
                        wingtips sparkle--

                                 SAM
                        Have some respect for yourself.
                            (then)
                        N-nobody can shine as good as me--

                                 RED
                        Confounded, I can shine!  

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Boys, boys.  Let's not fight.  Clearly 
                        you both have passion for the office 
                        of the presidency.
                            (then)
                        The way I sees it, there's only one 
                        way to jar this pickle.
                            (dastardly)
                        Last time we played Chattanooga High,
                        those bastards stole our most prized
                        possession.  If someone were to,
                        say, retrieve it?  I think that'd
                        warrant an endorsement.

           Sam drops the towels, determined.

                                 SAM
                        Done.

                                 RED
                            (scared)
                        You said Chattanooga High School?
                                 DOUGLAS
                        You yella for real?

           Red's wrinkled brow and saucer eyes hip us to the gravity of 
           this task.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           Red and Morgan march down the hallway -- Red's wrapped in 
           thought, while Morgan is beside himself.

                                 MORGAN
                        It's certainly a bold move, but Lord 
                        Jesus.
                            (then)
                        You're gonna actually go inside 
                        Chattanooga High?

                                 RED
                        I have to.

                                 MORGAN
                        Negro, have you ever been inside a 
                        segregated white school?  Cause I 
                        sure as hell have not.

                                 RED
                        It's probably no different than 
                        Riverside.  The student body is 
                        just... a little melanin deprived.

           Morgan stops on a dime, startling Red.  Morgan grabs his 
           friend by the lapels, nostrils flaring.

                                 MORGAN
                        You have no idea what goes on in 
                        there.
                            (ominous)
                        But my cousin?  He told me everything.

           Red slaps Morgan's hands away, readjusts his shirt.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        It's a right-good hell on earth, 
                        where nothing remotely colored exists.
                            (beat)
                        And all the teacher's are white she-
                        devils--

                                 RED
                        Your cousin's an idiot--

                                 MORGAN
                        And that's not even the worst part!
                                 (MORE)
                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                            (then)
                        Those schools are patrolled by evil 
                        incarnate -- they call him the KKK 
                        Cop.  And if he catches you?

           Morgan mimics a noose tightening around his neck and choking 
           him.  Red just turns and walks away.  Morgan catches up.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Don't believe me?
                            (then)
                        Ask Tommy Taylor what happened to 
                        his older brother--

                                 RED
                            (scoff)
                        Man, he went to Vietnam--

                                 MORGAN
                        Wrong!
                            (spooky)
                        He stepped inside a white school... 
                        and nobody's seen him since.

           Nerves getting to him, Red exhales.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        What happened to diplomacy?  Your 
                        gift of gab?  Winning the right way?
                            (then)
                        Don't you think this is kinda 
                        desperate--

           He has lead his friend to the defaced poster, references it.

                                 RED
                        You feel it, I feel it -- if there 
                        was a poll, I'd be losing.
                            (unhinged)
                        I need this.

           Morgan softens.

                                 MORGAN
                        You are pretty passable.  You could 
                        probably just waltz right in.

           Red shoots Morgan an evil eye.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Well it's true -- and it's a good 
                        thing too, otherwise this would be a 
                        definite suicide mission.
                            (shaking head)
                        Instead of a probable one.
           He's right.

                                 RED
                        Confounded.
                            (then)
                        Well, if I'm going to do this, it's 
                        got to be the real McCoy.

           And with that, Red RIPS the poster off the wall.

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. DORSEY RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - LATER

           A shirtless Red stares at his big hair in the mirror.  Sigh.  
           He looks down at the sink, reluctantly grabs his father's 
           Eureka HOT COMB, and starts straightening out his afro.

           As he occasionally burns his fingers we INTERCUT with...

           INT. BLACK RESIDENCE - DARIUS'S ROOM - INTERCUT

           From his backpack, Sam empties makeup, wigs, and costumes 
           onto Darius's bed.  Darius winces.

                                 SAM
                        I borrowed some st-stuff from my 
                        auntie's drama supplies.

                                 DARIUS
                        I'm not sure there's enough makeup 
                        in the world--

                                 SAM
                        Shut up, dummy, and apply.

           Looking like a burnt mop, Red struggles to push his flattened 
           hair strands from his face as he finishes.

           Sam's seated, great posture, as Darius applies thick white 
           makeup to his friend's face.

           Red wets his hair and slicks it back.  Not bad.  He digs his 
           fingers into a can of pomade and rubs it through his new do.

           Exposed skin fully covered in white, Darius places a blonde 
           male wig atop Sam's head, completing the "look".

           The INTERCUT ENDS as Darius steps away revealing Sam in full 
           on WHITEFACE.  Darius cringes as Sam looks in a mirror.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            ("well shit")
                        I mean...
                                 DEACON BLACK (O.S.)
                        What in the holy hell is y'all 
                        nigglets doin'?!

           Sam and Darius whip to find Deacon Black standing in the 
           doorway horrified, lit cigarette dangling from his lip.

           Eyes bulging, Darius just stares at the floor.

                                 SAM
                        We were j-just... s-see, I got to 
                        infiltrate th-th-this white school, 
                        cause I n-need an endorsement--

           Deacon holds up his hand -- please stop.  He takes a drag of 
           his square.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        How 'bout, I call some cats that 
                        work the janitorial services at these 
                        schools and get you a gig for the 
                        day?

           Sam and Darius share a look, then nod.

                                 SAM
                        Yes--

                                 DARIUS
                        That's a remarkably better plan--

                                 SAM
                        P-please, thank you.

           Okay then.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                            (to Darius)
                        Now.  Get yo' cracka-ass-honkey friend 
                        the hell up outta my house.

           Whiteface Sam glowers--

                                                          SMASH TO BLACK.

                              1 DAY UNTIL ELECTION...

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - DAY

           A gorgeous stone building with pillars and an immaculate 
           lawn covered with awesome topiary.

           Red stands across the street with his slicked-back hair and 
           buttoned-up shirt -- he looks like a white teen with a good 
           tan.  He trembles, staring up at the imposing school.
           Mustering the courage, Red starts across the road when--

           HONK!  That same rusty BLUE '56 CHEVY PICKUP screeches to a 
           halt, nearly clipping Red AGAIN.  He jumps back.

           The same dusty, glowering WHITE LADY from earlier snarls at 
           Red as she peels off.  It sends a shiver down his spine, but 
           he quickly shakes it off and ascends the stairs to enter the 
           segregated white facility.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - LATER

           The spotless halls are eerily empty, save for a timid Red 
           padding across marble floors, absorbing every nook and cranny.  
           Everything -- the skylights, lockers, walls -- is pristine.  
           A far cry from the black high school.

           Dumbfounded, Red caresses a wall.

                                 RED
                            (to himself)
                        Not a scratch--

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL (O.S.)
                        You don't belong here.

           Oh fuck.

           Red whips around to find a WHITE PRINCIPAL (60s, crotchety) 
           sizing him up.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                            (suspicious)
                        Classes are in session.

                                 RED
                        Right.  Sorry.

           Red turns to leave.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        Wait a minute.  You're not a student 
                        at Chattanooga High.

           Sweat beads building.  Red halts, addresses the principal.

                                 RED
                        I... am... prospecting.  Sir.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        Prospecting?

                                 RED
                        Yes, sir.  My father... was recently 
                        stationed at Arnold AFB.
                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                            (perking up)
                        Military?

                                 RED
                        Yes, sir.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        But Arnold is nearly two hours away?

           Jesus help me.

                                 RED
                        I... pride myself on learning from 
                        the best, sir.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        So you've already looked into 
                        Tullahoma schools?

                                 RED
                            ("I wasn't impressed")
                        Like I said, prospecting.

           The principal likes the cut of his jib, chuckles.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                            (leaning in)
                        Tullahoma is horrendous at basketball.

           Red smiles.

                                 RED
                        I had a feeling.  In fact, I think 
                        I'll check out your gymnasium first--

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        No, no.  Let's see if we can't find 
                        you a proper tour guide.

           The principal gestures for Red to follow, Red's smile fades.

           LATER

           Red follows the principal down the hallway, rapt by the 
           sparkling display cases, state-of-the-art P.A. system, and 
           most notably...

           The large, uncrowded classrooms where every student is 
           afforded his very own desk.  Red can't believe his eyes.

                                 RED
                        Are your bus classrooms as spacious 
                        as these?

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        Bus classrooms?
                                 RED
                        You know, for the overflow.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                            ("silly kid")
                        We have more than enough space within
                        our walls.  And more than enough
                        teachers, substitutes, and volunteers
                        to make sure every student gets the
                        attention they need to thrive.

           Red furrows his brow, disillusioned.

                                 RED
                        Everything's so... top-notch.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                            (scoff)
                        Well what did you expect?

           Suddenly a swelling ANGELIC VOICE invades Red's soul, catching 
           him off guard -- what is this magical utopia?

                                 RED
                        Is this... is this heaven?

           As the voice grows closer, the principal smirks, guiding his 
           enchanted guest towards the doorway of a

           MUSIC ROOM

           Where MRS. AMSTERDAM (white, 50s, nun-like) sings Ave Maria 
           from the heart.  Pious sun rays cut through the room.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        Choir's in session.

           A group of a dozen WHITE STUDENTS gracefully join, harmonizing
           with the siren.  Astonished, Red looks to the principal,
           who's nearly brought to tears -- he locks eyes with Mrs.
           Amsterdam, who smiles and head-bows as the song comes to an
           end.

           The principal carries on, dabbing his eyes.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        Gets me every time.

           They stroll past a door labeled "JANITOR'S OFFICE".  The 
           principal suddenly stops, listens closely for the faint SOUL 
           MUSIC emanating from inside.

           He grumbles, POUNDS the door twice, then continues on with a 
           smile.  A stupefied Red follows, but we stay on the door.
           JANITOR'S OFFICE

           A large closet more so than an office.  A weathered janitor, 
           in navy blue coveralls, dutifully jumps from his seat and 
           quickly turns off his portable radio, killing the SOUL MUSIC.

           This is LARRY (black, 60s).  He rubs his aching back.

                                 LARRY
                        See, you can stray from the line oh 
                        so much, but most of the time it's 
                        best to just stay right on that line.

           He turns to size up Sam Jackson standing in the corner, 
           wearing matching coveralls.

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        Now, Deacon says you know how to 
                        mind your environment.

                                 SAM
                            (reluctant)
                        Th-that's right.

           Larry hands him a bucket and a mop.

                                 LARRY
                        Good.  Just focus on the work, nothin' 
                        else matters.  And I mean nothin'.
                            (then)
                        If you ain't moppin', you're dustin'.  
                        If you ain't dustin', you're fixin'.  
                        If you ain't fixin', you best figure 
                        somethin' out.
                            (then)
                        The name of the game is lookin' too 
                        busy to matter.  Understand?

           Sam nods despite himself.

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        Get started before the rush.
                            (then)
                        And whatever you do, stay away from 
                        classroom 401.

           Curiously, Sam waits for a reason -- Larry decides to leave 
           it at that.

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        Just.  Stay away.

           Ignoring the indignation, Sam refocuses on the mission at 
           hand.  He exits the office into the
           HALLWAY

           Checks the coast, then strides with purpose when the 
           classrooms suddenly flood into the hall.

           Sam quickly drops his bucket, "mops".  He does his best to 
           keep his eyes glued to the floor as chatty and oblivious 
           white students pass by.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER

           As if it's the Holy Grail, Red opens a box and pulls out a 
           brand new textbook, fresh from the printer.  He sniffs it, 
           listens to the crackle of its spine, opening for the first 
           time.  The pages?  Smooth as baby ass.

           The office and desk are cluttered with weird keepsakes -- 
           arbitrary school banners, broken trophies, a taxidermy bulldog 
           rocking a crown and a cape.  Creepy.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        I guess the new editions came in.

           The principal takes the book from Red, studies it.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        We probably won't need these until 
                        next year.

           He puts the textbook back in the box.  Red's jaw hangs open -- 
           everything he thought he knew dispelled in a matter of 
           minutes.  He blinks through the shock.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL (CONT'D)
                        Oh, there he is.
                            (then)
                        Taylor, I'd like you to meet ol' 
                        Skippy here.

           Red turns to find TAYLOR entering with a cocksure grin -- 
           he's the same white boy that punked Sam by the river, but of 
           course Red wouldn't know that.

           Taylor extends a hand.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Hey there, Skippy.

           Red reluctantly shakes Taylor's hand.

                                 RED
                        Just Skip is fine.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Right on.
                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                            (to Red)
                        He'll be showing you around.
                            (to Taylor)
                        Give 'em the... platinum experience.

           Taylor and the principal chuckle with corny vigor.  Red 
           grimaces -- what the fuck has he gotten himself into?

                                 TAYLOR
                        No sweat, sir.
                            (to Red)
                        Let's jet.

           Red forces a clenched smile, follows Taylor out of the office.

           HALLWAY - LATER

           Eyes darting from one oblivious white student to the next, 
           an anxious Red follows Taylor -- like Luke Skywalker 
           infiltrating the Death Star in a storm trooper suit.

                                 TAYLOR
                        I'm gonna be honest with ya, Skippy --
                        the key to a bitchin' high school
                        experience ain't the academics. 
                        Believe it or not, it ain't the girls
                        either.  It's the buds.
                            (then)
                        Whatever you do, do not surround 
                        yourself with squares.

           This grabs Red's attention.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        You seem like a pretty hip dude.

           Really?  Red can't help but smile, flattered.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        So I'm gonna do you a solid and 
                        introduce you to the coolest buds at 
                        Chatty High.

           They approach a crew of three WHITE JOCKS loitering by the 
           lockers.  Taylor smacks Red on the back.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Just don't embarrass me, yeah?
                            (to jocks)
                        Boys.  Meet a future Red Hawk, by 
                        way of... where did you say you're 
                        from?

                                 RED
                        San Diego.
           The boys nod, impressed.

                                 WHITE JOCK #1
                        Nice tan.

                                 TAYLOR
                            (to Red)
                        You're looking at three fifths of 
                        the fighting Red Hawks' starting 
                        five.

                                 RED
                            ("you don't say")
                        The basketball team?

                                 WHITE JOCK #2
                            (to Red)
                        I'd ask if you play, but...

           He bends down to Red's height and delicately pokes the tip 
           of Red's nose.

                                 WHITE JOCK #2 (CONT'D)
                        Boop.

           They all chuckle.  Red forces a hearty laugh to overcompensate 
           for his rage.

                                 RED
                            (sotto)
                        Don't touch me.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - GYMNASIUM - LATER

           A cautious Sam enters to find a Phys Ed class in full swing -- 
           unathletic kids failing to climb ropes suspended from the 
           ceiling.

           He keeps his head down, strategically mops past them without 
           notice.  He makes his way to the adjacent

           BOYS LOCKER ROOM

           Where a couple stragglers leave behind musty towels for Sam 
           to pick up.  But once they empty out, Sam gets to work quickly 
           sifting through locker after locker looking for that stolen 
           PRIZED POSSESSION.

           He checks everywhere -- the showers, the coach's office, 
           under benches, in bathroom stalls -- nothing.

           Sam takes a seat on one of the wooden benches, thinks.

           Suddenly, students pour in, so Sam hops to his feet and 
           "mops", head down.  One by one, the students absentmindedly 
           drop sweaty towels at Sam's feet.  One towel even lands on 
           his shoulder.  Oh, the disrespect.
           Jaw tightening, he squeezes the shit out of the mop stick -- 
           the clueless, disrobing kids completely unaware of what's 
           about to explode.  But then Sam simply... deflates, gathers 
           the towels and discards them in a nearby laundry bin.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - CAFETERIA - LATER

           Bustling with hundreds of gossiping white students at dozens 
           of dining tables.

           We find Red seated, staring at the bountiful food line -- 
           like everything else in the school, it's damn impressive.

           Red turns to address Taylor and the jocks, eating lunch at 
           the same table.

                                 RED
                        Are the chips free?

           Chuckles.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Of course.  We ain't animals.

           Red frowns, then bites into a tuna sandwich and rolls his 
           eyes -- he hates that it's delicious.

                                 RED
                        So, fellas.  I heard you lost to 
                        Riverside not too long ago.

           The boys nearly choke on their meals.

                                 TAYLOR
                            (annoyed)
                        Who told you that?

           All eyes on Red.  Shit.

                                 RED
                            (covering)
                        You know those Tullahoma boys talk 
                        more than a sewing circle.

                                 WHITE JOCK #3
                        Well those Riverside bastards are 
                        cheaters!  Every last one of 'em!

           He's losing his audience, Red pivots.

                                 RED
                        Don't I know the type.
                            (then)
                        Boy, if I had to face such injustice?  
                        I would've done just about anything 
                        to get those bastards back.
                                 TAYLOR
                            (excited)
                        Oh yeah?

                                 RED
                        Yeah.  Like, I don't know, take 
                        something from them?

           The jocks share looks.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        And I suppose the smart thing to do 
                        would be to hide it at school -- you 
                        know, to manage accountability.
                            (coy)
                        But where would I hide it, I wonder.

           Taylor leans in, mischievous.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Let's just say, great minds think 
                        alike.

           Red masks his disappointment -- he was hoping to get a 
           location.

                                 WHITE JOCK #1
                        You're alright, Skippy.

                                 WHITE JOCK #2
                        Yeah, most kids at this school ain't 
                        sharp like that.
                            (then)
                        Just the other day, some buffoon had 
                        the nerve to tell me moss grows on 
                        trees in Chattanooga.

           Red lights up despite himself.

                        RED
                But we're too far north!
                                                     TAYLOR
                                             But we're too far north!

           More laughter, but this time Red joins without pretense.  It 
           catches him off guard -- he's actually enjoying himself.  A 
           respect and acknowledgement he doesn't receive at the black 
           school.

           As the fun dies down...

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Hey, man.  I think I know just about 
                        everything I need to know about ya.
                            (then)
                        Just one last thing.

           Taylor leans on Red's shoulder, lighthearted -- it's an easy 
           question.
                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        You an Elvis fan or a James Brown 
                        fan?

           Red blinks and grins, as if his brain can't compute.  The 
           table stares, urging him to just say it -- I mean, what white 
           kid in the 60s isn't an Elvis fan?

                                 WHITE JOCK #1
                        Did you hear 'em?  Elvis or JB?

           But the longer Red goes mute, the more concerned his new 
           friends grow.

                                 TAYLOR
                        C'mon, Skippy.  Thought I was givin' 
                        you a layup.

           Then suddenly, out of nowhere, with tears building in his 
           eyes...

                                 RED
                            (forced)
                        Who's James Brown?

           The table goes FUCKING WILD, cheering, slapping Red on the 
           back.  One by one, Taylor and the jocks join in singing a 
           heartfelt rendition of Can't Help Falling in Love.

           Before he knows it, the entire cafeteria is singing along, 
           closing in on Red.  They sway to the beat -- strange white 
           boys giving Red fives, strange white girls giving him hugs.

           The jocks put Red on their shoulders, the zenith of this 
           tightening flesh circle.  He can't help himself, Red eats it 
           up, basking in the lone ray of sunshine warming his face.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - HALLWAY - LATER

           Lightly peppered with students making their way to class.

           Sam "dusts" the glass of a trophy case.  His eyes lock on 
           the reflection of the room number behind him: 401.  Clearly 
           he's been casing the forbidden classroom.

           Once the coast clears, he slowly turns and makes his way 
           towards the door.  Anxiety building, but he's seemingly 
           searched everywhere else.  One last coast check, then he 
           slithers inside

           CLASSROOM 401

           Nothing out of the ordinary, but devoid of human life.

           Hopeful, Sam darts for the large fish tank by the window.  
           He peers inside -- nothing but coral, tropical fish, and 
           some funky thing sucking the glass.  Fuck.
           Not quite what he's looking for, Sam searches for SOMETHING 
           else when suddenly the door knob rattles!

           Shit almighty.  Head on a swivel, Sam weighs his hiding 
           options.  He dives beneath the large teacher's desk at the 
           front of the class just as--

           MRS. AMSTERDAM, the angelic singer from earlier, enters with 
           a large brown lunch bag.  She locks the door behind her.

           With a warm smile, she feeds the fish, then makes her way to 
           an extension cord plugged into the wall.  She unravels it, 
           brings power closer to HER DESK.

           BENEATH THE DESK

           Sam winces, panics.  But he's curled up so deep in its shadowy 
           cavern she can't see him.

           ON MRS. AMSTERDAM

           As she methodically opens the brown paper bag and pulls out 
           not a lunch, but a 1950s "Spot Reducer" -- a brass handheld 
           device with a green, rubber suction cup on the bottom.

           She places it on the desk, suction side down, plugging it 
           into the extension cord.

           Next, she pulls from the brown bag a worn-the-fuck-out book: 
           Lady Chatterley's Lover by D.H. Lawrence.

           To Sam's absolute chagrin, an unaware (or shameless) Mrs. 
           Amsterdam takes a seat, exposing her knees.

           The teacher finds her place in the book, reads -- with each 
           word, her breaths hasten, chest heaving.  She can't take it 
           anymore, and reaches for the Spot Reducer, but it's stuck to 
           the desk.

           She gives it a good yank, de-suctioning with a wet POP.  She 
           giggles to herself before flicking the switch on its brass 
           cover -- the device hums to life VIBRATING.

           Oh hell -- Sam's horrified with no where to go.  Mrs. 
           Amsterdam's hand suddenly falls below the desk as she places 
           the "massager" under her dress.

           She returns to her book, but now with eye rolling intensity.  
           Incessant HUMMING.  One hand stays below while the other 
           grips the desk, the vein in her neck throbbing.  Sweet mama!

           She's almost there, almost there, ALMOST THERE--

           Then she abruptly deflates, closes the book, and turns off 
           the device.  She plants it back on her desk.  A beat.
                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        Enough foreplay.

           ON SAM

           Wondering who the hell she's talking to -- her head suddenly 
           pokes under the desk.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                            (to Sam)
                        You should be rock hard by now.

           Petrified, Sam crawls past her legs for dear life.  He rises, 
           she takes in his length and youth -- likes what she sees.

           She rises, stalking her prey.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM (CONT'D)
                        You had the best seat in the house.
                            (then)
                        Did you pay for those seats?

                                 SAM
                            (wtf?)
                        Excuse m-me?

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        Larry doesn't like to watch.  I have 
                        to make him.  But you -- you got 
                        right in there, didn't you?

           Sam can't stop shaking his head.

                                 SAM
                        I w-wasn't t-trying--

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                            (angry)
                        You're such a tease!

           She corners him, dives into his chest.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM (CONT'D)
                        And I love it.

           He's frozen as her well-manicured nails crawl down his shirt.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM (CONT'D)
                        The help is usually so... mature.
                            (then)
                        Yet you're just so strapping and 
                        delicious--

                                 SAM
                        I'm just here to c-clean--
                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        Damn straight, Hot Shot.

                                 SAM
                        No.  I mean, I could get in s-s-
                        serious trouble--

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        Nonsense--

                                 SAM
                        T-tell that to Emmett Till!

           Sam slides away, but she blocks him from going for the door.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        I'll let you go, if you tell me where 
                        you'd like to stick that duster.

           He looks down at the duster tucked in his pocket, then back 
           up to her.  Already panicking when--

           The door knob rattles!

                                 IMPATIENT STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Amsterdam?

           Loving the tension, she grins from ear to ear.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        Tell me.  Or we'll all burn.

           POUNDING at the door.

                                 IMPATIENT STUDENT (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Amsterdam!  I thought we were 
                        gonna go over my paper!

           She shrugs -- what's it gonna be?

                                 SAM
                            (closing his eyes)
                        I'd like to st-stick it in... your... 
                        fanny.

           Mrs. Amsterdam SQUEALS with delight as Sam chastens, stripped 
           of his dignity.  With precision, she wraps up the Spot 
           Reducer, returning it and her erotic book back to the brown 
           paper bag.

           She smoothes out her dress, then unlocks and opens the door, 
           resuming her meek facade.

                                 IMPATIENT STUDENT
                        I don't have much time before my 
                        next class, Mrs. Amsterdam.
                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        Then we should hop to it.

                                 IMPATIENT STUDENT
                            (clocking Sam)
                        What's he doing here?

           Sam exits with his eyes down.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                        Being a nuisance.

           As the teacher and student disappear inside, Sam stands in 
           the hallway just beyond the door, grating his last nerve.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - CLASSROOM - LATER

           A white chemistry teacher DRONES on at the front of the class.  
           White students busy themselves taking notes.  In the back 
           corner, newfound besties Red and Taylor sit at adjacent desks, 
           giggling and whispering.

           Red marvels at his very own clean desk.

                                 RED
                            (whispering)
                        How did I even get my own desk?  I'm 
                        just visiting!

           Taylor smirks and shrugs, seems to be jotting in his worn 
           chemistry textbook.  Red tries to stifle his delight and 
           focus on finding that PRIZED POSSESSION.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                            (whispering)
                        So tell me, if it's not in the 
                        gymnasium or the library or the dark 
                        room, it's got to be hidden in a 
                        classroom, right?

           He keeps writing, but Taylor's having a hard time playing 
           coy with his bud.  A beat, fuck it.

                                 TAYLOR
                            (whispering)
                        You've already been where it is.
                            (then)
                        And he's an even bigger fan of the 
                        game than we are.

           Red absorbs the clue, tucks it in the back of his mind.

                                 RED
                            (whispering)
                        Do you usually take notes right on 
                        the page?
                                 TAYLOR
                            (whispering)
                        Oh, I'm not taking notes.
                            (doodling)
                        This book has just about kicked the 
                        bucket, so we'll secondhand it to 
                        some Negro school.
                            (finishing)
                        I like to make sure they get a proper 
                        salutation.

           Taylor snickers as he hands his textbook to Red.  What color 
           he has escapes Red's face as he reads the doodle: "SLAVES 
           CAN'T READ".

           A wave of anger, shame, and nausea washes over Red as Taylor 
           proudly nods.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                            (whispering)
                        Pretty boss, huh?  See the trick is 
                        to write on an important lesson page 
                        so they have to either keep it or 
                        ruin the lesson.

           Red SLAMS the book shut, startling Taylor and the entire 
           class.  Red quickly finds his composure.

                                 RED
                            (to teacher)
                        Sorry.

           The teacher carries on with his droning.

                                 TAYLOR
                        What gives?

                                 RED
                            (clenched)
                        Nothing.  Must've been the tuna.

           Red rises and calmly walks out of the class.  Taylor furrows 
           his brow, suspicious.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - BATHROOM - LATER

           Water runs from the sink.  Red splashes his face, looks at 
           himself in the mirror.  He scowls, mutters to himself.

                                 RED
                        Confound racist with his confound 
                        clues...
                            (mocking)
                        You've already been where it is.
                            (gasp)
                        Principal's office!
           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - JANITOR'S OFFICE - LATER

           A miserable Sam enters and is immediately grabbed by a 
           desperate Larry.

                                 LARRY
                        Why'd you go into classroom 401, 
                        boy?  Why!

                                 SAM
                        G-get off of me.

           Sam brushes away.

                                 LARRY
                        You gave her a taste and now that 
                        goddamned she-devil is ravenous.

           But Sam doesn't care.  He slams his bucket and mop into the 
           corner.

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        The hell's gotten into you?!

                                 SAM
                        The world!
                            (then)
                        Look at this -- you break your back 
                        for th-these p-people and they st-
                        stick you in an overgrown c-closet!

                                 LARRY
                        Now, wait a--

                                 SAM
                        You sh-should stand up for yourself, 
                        d-d-demand their respect!

           Larry shrinks.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (deflating)
                        I don't w-want to be a garbageman.  
                        Or an alcoholic.  Or a d-deadbeat.

                                 LARRY
                            (but...)
                        I'm not an alcoholic--

                                 SAM
                        I just want... that st-stupid 
                        Riverside bowl.

                                 LARRY
                        The Riverside fishbowl?

           Sam perks up.
                                 SAM
                        The one that was stolen.

                                 LARRY
                            (shaking head)
                        Those boys -- worst basketball players 
                        I ever seen.
                            (then)
                        You know, everytime they lose, they 
                        be stealin' from the other team.  
                        Accumulated quite a bit of booty.
                            (finally)
                        And the principal be the ring leader.

           Energized, Sam darts out the "office".  Larry grabs the mop 
           and bucket, slowly follows.

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                            (sigh)
                        Mrs. Amsterdam's gonna eat me alive.

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER

           Red enters with stealth, making sure nobody's around to bust 
           him.

           For the first time he's noticing the odd keepsakes decorating 
           the room -- basketball banners from multiple neighboring 
           high schools, broken basketball trophies awarded to everyone 
           EXCEPT Chattanooga High.

           Even the cape on the taxidermy bulldog reads: "FIGHTING 
           BULLDOGS".

                                 RED
                        Confound thieves.

           He notices a plastic sandwich bag filled with an egg salad 
           sandwich resting on the desk.  Blech.  He quickly searches 
           the booty, and finally finds...

           SOMETHING on a bookcase, covered with a silky blue & white 
           flag.

           Like Indiana Jones, Red slowly uncovers it, revealing a 
           FISHBOWL with a Riverside High sticker at the top.  And 
           floating about inside it?  A classic, if dumb-as-shit, 1960s 
           pet:

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                            ("gotcha")
                        Sea monkeys--

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Finally showing your tr-true colors, 
                        huh?
           Red replaces the silky flag over the bowl and turns to come 
           face to face with a disgusted Sam.

                                 RED
                        We have to get out of here.
                            ("trust me")
                        It's a right-good hell on earth--

                                 SAM
                        N-not without that bowl.

           Sam pushes past Red, but Red grabs Sam's sleeve.

                                 RED
                        If I wasn't black, I wouldn't feel 
                        like somebody just punched me in the 
                        gut.

           Sam considers this, but rips his sleeve away.  A beat as 
           they size each other up -- Red suddenly lunges for the bowl, 
           but Sam pulls him back.

           They're in the midst of a shoving match when--

           Taylor, the jocks, and the principal enter, shocked.

                                 TAYLOR
                        I knew it!

           Sam quickly looks to the floor, downtrodden.  Red panics, a 
           deer in headlights.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        He's trying to steal our spoils.

           Red hyperventilates, but Taylor points his finger at...

           SAM!  The white men close in.  Taylor smacks Red on the back.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        And I bet 'ol Skippy here was tryin' 
                        to stop 'em.  Way to go, Skippy.

           Not sure how to play this, Red'd eyes just dart around.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                            (re: Sam)
                        I knew I recognized this twit roaming 
                        our halls.
                            (then)
                        How's it shakin', Shiny?  Had a 
                        feelin' you'd make a fantastic garbage 
                        man one day.

           Taunting laughter from the jocks.  Red's jaw tightens, hating 
           this, but also feeling utterly helpless.
                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                            (rubbing forehead)
                        I wonder if it'll always be this 
                        hard to find respectable help.
                            (then)
                        Well, boy.  What do you have to say 
                        for yourself?

           Still looking at the ground, Sam blinks away the frustration, 
           his nostrils flaring, fists tightening.

                                 SAM
                        I... was j-j-just--

                                 TAYLOR
                        J-j-just what, Shiny?

           More laughter, more heckling -- poking fun at his stutter.  
           Sam's eyes bulge, then suddenly narrow and twitch.

           Just outside the office, Larry stands with his mop and bucket, 
           watching in awe.  Everything slows to a crawl, then out of 
           nowhere--

                                 SAM
                        Sh-sh-shut... MOTHERFUCKER, SHUT UP!

           Everyone flinches.  HARD.

                                 WHITE PRINCIPAL
                        How dare you--

                                 SAM
                        Motherfucker, I said shut the fuck 
                        up!

           Frightened, the principal backs off.

           The cocktail of bullshit has finally pushed him over the 
           edge -- he stalks the room with a familiar swagger, a bold 
           confidence, a stealy gaze -- the foul-mouthed anti-hero we've 
           come to know and love, born in this moment.

                                 WHITE JOCK #1
                        We c-called the police--

           Sam POUNDS the shit out of the desk, everyone jumps.

                                 SAM
                            (nostrils flaring)
                        Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I break your 
                        concentration?!  Please, continue.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Listen, we don't want any trouble--
                                 SAM
                        Sit your ass down.

           The white men quickly take seats.  Red remains standing, but 
           on edge, fading back towards the bookcase.

           Sam continues to pace with conviction.  He spots the egg 
           salad sandwich, leaves the empty SANDWICH BAG behind -- Red 
           eyes it.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (to principal)
                        I'm famished.  May I?

           The principal nods, and Sam downs it in three bites.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Goddamn, motherfucker!  That was 
                        delicious, thank you.
                            (then)
                        Now, I've been trying real hard to 
                        be a good Christian -- a righteous 
                        brotha.  But y'all haven't exactly 
                        made things a walk in the park.

           The school bell RINGS, one of the jocks rises for class, but 
           Sam calmly gestures for him to remain seated.  He abides.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        What's fucked up is, I've been coal
                        my entire life.  And motherfuckers
                        like yourselves were nice enough to
                        remind me of that fact every chance
                        you got.
                            (then)
                        But the thing with coal?  His long
                        lost love is pressure.  And when
                        coal and pressure get to fuckin'? 
                        Well shit, negro.  You start makin'
                        diamond babies!
                            (then)
                        It took me a while to figure it out,
                        but I get it now.  You need me, and
                        I need you.  You need me to make
                        yourselves feel superior and powerful. 
                        And I need you to draw out the best 
                        in me, to make me a diamond.
                            (leaning in)
                        You need me, and I need you.
                            (leaning back)
                        And as a sign of my gratitude, I'm 
                        gonna give you a gift.

           Sam takes a dramatic beat.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to let you call me a nigga.  
                        Free and clear.

           The white men share concerned looks.  Even Red and Larry's 
           eyes widen.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (pleasant)
                        Go ahead, I know you want to.  It's 
                        how you see us, isn't it?

           Sam stares a terrified Taylor in the eyes.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (not pleasant)
                        Isn't it, motherfucker?!

           Taylor can't stop shaking his head, mouth agape.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (to the room)
                        Nobody?

           They're all frozen, shitting themselves.  So Sam struts over 
           to the bookcase and calmly takes the Riverside fishbowl, 
           keeping it covered with the silky flag.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Then I guess you'll be showing this 
                        level of respect and deference to 
                        everyone, won't you?

           They all nod vigorously.  Sam strides out. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Solid.

           Leaving the white men in a haze.  Sam passes a stunned Larry.

                                 LARRY
                        You didn't sutter once.

                                 SAM
                        Keep them in check.

                                 LARRY
                            (smiling, grateful)
                        I will now.

                                 SAM
                        Good, cause I gotta get the hell up 
                        out this motherfucka.

           Sam takes off running with the covered fish bowl, doing his 
           best to prevent it from splashing.
           PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

           Back inside, Red slowly steps past the still dazed white 
           men.

                                 TAYLOR
                            (to Red)
                        Can you believe that?

                                 RED
                        Believe it?!  Confounded, I endorse 
                        it!  And you know why?
                            (big reveal)
                        Because I'm black!

           Crickets.

                                 TAYLOR
                            (scoff)
                        No you're not, Skippy.

           Offended, Red scowls as everyone rises to leave.

                                 RED
                        It's Skip... damnit.  And nobody's 
                        better than JAMES BROWN!

           GASP.

                                 TAYLOR
                        You are black!

           James Brown's iconic GROWL kicks off his hit I Got You as 
           Red races out of the room, with the students giving chase!

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - CONTINUOUS

           Red darts down the immaculate hallways, checking his six.

           The commotion draws WHITE STUDENTS and TEACHERS to the doors 
           of their respective classrooms, in time to see Red zoom by, 
           followed by Taylor and the jocks, hot on his heels.

           Slipping and sliding as he takes a corner at top speed, Red 
           catches up to Sam, who's slowed down by his fishbowl balancing 
           act.  They share a look -- at times like these, beef goes on 
           the back burner.

                                 RED
                            (to Sam)
                        This way!

           Red takes another hot corner, Sam follows.

           Their eyes light up at the sight of the main entrance up 
           ahead.  Salvation.
           They look back to see Taylor and the jocks fading at the 
           opposite end of the hall, out of range.  Red smirks, but 
           when he turns back around terror wipes his face...

           Sam puts on the breaks and Red skids to halt, falling on his 
           ass.  Eyes bulging at the sight of a white, stone-cold badass 
           rocking shiny aviators, dressed in uniform blues.  He strolls 
           through the door.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        KKK Cop!

           FUCK -- he does exist!  Red scrambles to his feet, yanks Sam 
           by the elbow, and they run back the way they came.

           The KKK Cop grits his teeth, instictively gives chase.

           Caught between a rock and a hard place, Red and Sam slow 
           down in the middle of the hall.  Up ahead, Taylor and the 
           jocks close in fast.  Back behind, the KKK Cop approaches 
           hard.  They're cooked until--

           The girl's bathroom door suddenly swings open.

                                 LARRY
                        Through here!

           You don't have to tell them twice -- Sam and Red dive inside, 
           following Larry past occupied stalls...

                                 WHITE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Get out!

           The SCREAMING girls fade as Larry leads the boys out the 
           bathroom's second entrance.

           ON KKK COP

           Who freezes when he realizes the bathroom door is marked 
           with the female symbol.  But Taylor and the jocks don't 
           hesitate for a second, power through.  More screaming girls.

           ON RED AND SAM

           As they follow Larry through the halls towards a back exit.  
           Red gets out first.  Before Sam steps out the door...

                                 SAM
                            (to Larry)
                        I wouldn't mind being a garbage man--

                                 LARRY
                        Shoot, I'd mind!  You destined for 
                        so much more -- don't let nobody 
                        tell ya different.
           Larry winks, holds open the door.  But a hand grabs Sam's 
           sleeve.  A white hand.

           Sam and Larry recoil at the sight of Mrs. Amsterdam!

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                            (to Sam)
                        We're not done.  Not by a long shot.

           Larry grips his mop stick and duster, creating a makeshift 
           cross.

                                 LARRY
                            (to Mrs. Amsterdam)
                        Get back, she-devil -- back I say!
                            (to Sam)
                        Go!

           Sam slips out the door.  Mrs. Amsterdam pouts as she backs 
           away from Larry.

                                 MRS. AMSTERDAM
                            (sensual)
                        You're gonna pay for that.

                                 LARRY
                        Not if I hip your husband, Principal 
                        Amsterdam, to your deplorable 
                        behavior.

           She considers, scoffs, and storms off.

           Taylor and the jocks barrel around the corner and immediately 
           slip, CRASHING to the floor and sliding into a wall.

           Larry coyly foot-nudges a slippery-when-wet sign into view 
           as he continues "mopping."

                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        Watch out now.

           They struggle to their feet, look around.  No interlopers, 
           damn.  The boys continue down the hall as Larry carries on, 
           whistling with a smile.

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - BACK LAWN - LATER

           Red holds up a low branch so Sam can duck through the hedge 
           lining the school's perimeter.

                                 SAM
                        This don't change nothin'.

           And Sam takes off with the covered fishbowl.  Red bites his 
           tongue then ducks through the hedge.
           Yards away, at the edge of the parking lot, the KKK Cop 
           watches -- on his mirrored sunglasses we see the boys 
           disappear in the treeline.

           He drags a cigarrette, drops it to the cement.  Then kills 
           it with his boot heel.  The KKK Cop fumes.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           A basketball game in full swing.  Douglas leads the Riverside 
           High Trojans, in blue & white jerseys, against another all 
           black team, donning green away colors.

           The stands are filled to the brim with raucous black high 
           school students and teachers, as well as a few proud parents.  
           Black cheerleaders inject energy from the sidelines.

           In the front row sits Trish and Vi, mesmerized by the players' 
           leans bodies and flexed muscles.  They CHEER a Riverside 
           basket.

           Vi locks eyes with TEAMMATE #2, who's riding the pine.  He 
           smiles, she twinkles her fingers.

                                 VI
                        What a hunk.

                                 PATSY (O.S.)
                        We're losing.

           Reveal a bitter and uninterested Patsy seated next to her 
           friends.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        And he's contributed absolutely 
                        nothing.

           Vi scoffs.

                                 TRISH
                            ("momma likes")
                        He sure looks good doing absolutely 
                        nothing.

           Vi's on the cusp of dropping her signature catchphrase, but 
           Patsy beats her to the punch--

                                 PATSY
                            (mocking)
                        I know that's right!

           Patsy rolls her eyes as her friends give her the side eye -- 
           what crawled up her ass?

           The HORN sounds, ending the half, with Riverside down.  
           Douglas and his discouraged teammates mope towards the locker 
           room.
           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           A feeble BLACK COACH (50s), with child-bearing hips, pulls 
           at what remains of his hair.  He's damn near in tears.

                                 BLACK COACH
                        You're state champions for Pete's 
                        sake!
                            (then)
                        Now, I don't know why y'all playin' 
                        like you're Chatty High, but you've 
                        got a half to fix it.
                            (sniffling)
                        I need a tissue.

           He storms off as Douglas and his team hang their heads.  
           Silence, then suddenly...

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        I'll cure what ail's ya.

           Eyes rise to find a proud Sam standing before them, still 
           wearing his coveralls, holding the covered fishbowl.

           Douglas beams.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Don't be joshin' now.

                                 TEAMMATE #1
                        Is that what I think it is?

           Sam slow-nods as the team closes in.

           Douglas grips the blue & white flag atop the bowl and oh-so-
           carefully pulls it away.

           Douglas's broad, anticipatory smile falls off the earth -- 
           that twinkle in his eye?  Dead.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Nigga, what is this?!

           Shocked, Sam looks down to find the fishbowl filled with 
           scummy water, but NO SEA MONKEYS.  Sam holds it up to the 
           light.  Nada.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck.

                                 RED (O.S.)
                        What's a soup without the beef?

           Heads turn to find Red strolling in, hands in pockets.  Sam 
           sets the bowl on a table, grumbles and stews knowingly.
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Gentlemen, I give you the prestige.

           Red pulls from his pocket the white principal's SANDWICH 
           BAG, now filled with SEA MONKEYS and just enough scummy water 
           to keep them alive.

           The basketball team loses their shit -- not in a masculine 
           manner, mind you, but with the tears, hugs, and praises-to-
           Jesus typically reserved for mothers when their children 
           come home from war.

           Red pours the sea monkeys back into their original home, 
           they swim around.

           Douglas and his teammates press their faces to the fishbowl 
           glass.

                                 DOUGLAS
                            (to sea monkeys)
                        Hiya, guys -- you've gotten so big.

                                 TEAMMATE #1
                        Look, there's Leroy -- and Eleanor -- 
                        and Charlie -- hey, Charlie.

                                 TEAMMATE #2
                            (breaking down)
                        I missed them so much...

           Red and Sam stare curiously at these men they thought were 
           adonises.  Douglas puts a comforting hand on Teammate #2's 
           shoulder before rising and addressing Sam and Red.

                                 DOUGLAS
                            (wiping eyes)
                        Sam.  Well, you brought the hog...
                            (to Red)
                        But you brought the bacon -- 
                        congratualtions, Yellow, you just 
                        earned yourself a state champion 
                        sized endorsement!

           The team ROARS, their pride and confidence restored.  They 
           take it with them as they hoot and holler back towards the 
           court.  Red tries to mask his fist pump, looks around but 
           Sam is nowhere to be found.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER

           Douglas and the Trojans are really kicking ass now -- hitting 
           graceful fadeaways and jamming nasty alley-oops.

           The crowd cries out, loving the comeback.

           Red snakes his way through the congested stands, annoying 
           those whose feet he has to climb over.
                                 RED
                        Excuse me.  Sorry.

           He finds the seat he was targeting, sits.  Unable to contain 
           his glee, he leans in and taps the shoulder of Patsy, seated 
           right in front of him, holding a small bag of popcorn.  She 
           peers over her shoulder.

                                 PATSY
                            (unenthused)
                        Oh.  Hi.

           She turns back around.  Red thinks, then leans in again, 
           taps her shoulder.

                                 RED
                        I got the team's endorsement.

           She doesn't even bother looking back this time.

                                 PATSY
                        Fantastic.

           What the fuck.

                                 RED
                        I'm going to win--

           She whips around, startling him.

                                 PATSY
                        Is that what you care about?  Winning?
                            ("fuck your response")
                        What ever happened to people running
                        because they respect the position? 
                        Because they want to reweave the
                        fabric of our lives?  Because they
                        actually believe in something?!

           Red's tongue tied, so she turns back around.

                                 PATSY (CONT'D)
                        Forget it.

           Unfortunately, Red knows exactly where she's coming from 
           now, after witnessing what Taylor did to his textbook.  He 
           sighs, speaks to the back of her head.

                                 RED
                            (heartfelt)
                        I believe... that the stains of racism
                        are still deeply embedded in our
                        society.  And I want to do everything
                        in my power to build a healthy space
                        for our students, free from the
                        tarnish of ignorance.
           Red takes a breath -- at least he got it off his chest.  
           Suddenly, Patsy blindly reaches back with her bag of popcorn, 
           offering Red a bite.  He smiles, grabs a handful.

           Beaming as they watch the Trojans dominate.  Patsy digs into 
           her popcorn just as...

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER

           Darius digs into his, but Deacon Black snatches it away.  
           Darius hangs his head as they walk away from the student-run 
           concession stand.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Look at this motherfucker here -- 
                        you want some popcorn?  Then win!

           They huddle up with an irritated Sam, hanging just outside 
           the gym entrance.  Sam keeps an eye on his idol's treatment 
           of Darius.  We overhear the cheers and shoe squeaks from the 
           game.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                            (to Sam and Darius)
                        I can't believe you two idiots let 
                        that high-and-yella humiliate you 
                        like that.

           Deacon flicks Darius in the shoulder.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Stand up straight, nigga.

           Fuming, Deacon gnaws at the popcorn like a horse.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Just like his high-yella daddy. 
                        Think he better than a nigga cause
                        he on the good side'a town now --
                        you know I saved that motherfucka
                        from a whoopin' in the third grade? 
                        Shit negro, and taught him everything
                        he know 'bout pussy in the sixth!
                            (then)
                        Nah, they gone get theirs.  Well, at 
                        least we got our back up plan -- 
                        always gotta have a back up plan.

           He flicks Darius in the shoulder again.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                        I said stand up straight--

                                 SAM
                            ("enough")
                        Stop, damn.
           Amused, Deacon narrows an eye at Sam.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Whatchew say, my nigga?

           Darius's eyes go wide -- they've never spoken to his father 
           like that before.  Sam doesn't blink.

                                 SAM
                        I said stop.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                            (tickled)
                        So tough.  You even said it without 
                        stammerin'.
                            (wicked)
                        I'm impressed.

           Sam's jaw tightens.

                                 DEACON BLACK (CONT'D)
                        Now unbunch them breeches.  Hard 
                        love's the only love--

                                 SAM
                        No.  There's no we -- you're just 
                        using us to get back at your childhood 
                        friend.  And I don't have nothin' to 
                        do with that.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        I see the nigglet think he's become 
                        the nig-man.
                            (then)
                        Well listen here, jack.  I will do 
                        and say whatever the fucks I please, 
                        cause--

                                 SAM
                        No, you listen, motherfucker!

           Deacon recoils, covering his heart -- impressed as much as 
           scared.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (nostrils flaring)
                        I am the captain of this ship.  I am 
                        the keeper of my brotha.  And come 
                        hell or high water, I will be the 
                        champion of my future.  Nobody else.
                            (then)
                        Do you understand me, my nigga?

           Deacon can't seem to wrap his head around this changing of 
           the guard.
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Do you understand me?!

           Sizing Sam up, Deacon smirks, relinquishing the badass throne.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                        Okay, nigga.
                            (then)
                        Okay.

           Sam's gaze cuts through him as he strides away.  Sam stops, 
           looks back.

                                 SAM
                            (to Darius)
                        Let's go, nigga!

           Sam keeps on walking.  Darius' eyes light up.  He SNATCHES 
           the popcorn out of his father's hands, and hustles to catch 
           up with his true friend.

           The loud HORN ending the game sounds.

                                 DEACON BLACK
                            (pleasantly surprised)
                        I created a motherfuckin' monster.

           He pockets his hands, turns to head back inside the

           GYMNASIUM

           Where Douglas and the Trojans celebrate on the court with 
           high-fives and skin slaps.  We make our way to the rickety 
           scoreboard: HOME - 89 vs. VISITORS - 56...

                                                          SMASH TO BLACK.

                                   ELECTION DAY

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           There's a thick buzz and excitement in the air -- from the 
           hallways, to the bus "classrooms", to the gym, to the cafteria -- 
           students whisper, giggle, and gossip about the day's election.

           We see STUDENTS erecting dozens of VOTING BOOTHS throughout 
           the school, equipped with wooden ballot boxes and privacy 
           curtains.

           The MAINTENANCE MAN teeters atop a wobbly ladder, securing a 
           net, filled with blue & white BALLOONS, to the gymnasium 
           ceiling.

           Below him, members of the SCHOOL ELECTION BOARD (40s) hang a
           banner that reads: "CONGRATULATIONS PRESIDENT!".  
           They cover it with a velvet cloth rigged to fall.

           A black hand adjusts the microphone, dusts the podium clean 
           as a finishing touch.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER

           Not nearly as fancy as the Chattanooga High School dining 
           space, but serviceable.  It's bustling at the moment, making 
           Red all the more anxious.

           He's seated at a worn table, knee bouncing.  He musses his 
           hair, restoring its curl.  Time seems to slow as he scans 
           the room, as if trying to sense his chances.

           He clocks Douglas and his teammates wearing letterman jackets 
           in one corner, looking suave as fuck.  Douglas shoots Red 
           with a finger gun, nods.

           Red continues to scan, clocking Patsy as she walks by.  She 
           makes eye contact, hides a bashful smile.  He's got this.

           But just as his confidence builds, we land on Sam and Darius 
           in another corner, surrounded by members of the marching 
           band.  Sam appears uncomfortable and agitated.

           Red just stares at his oblivious opponent, studying him, 
           students passing back and forth through his sightline -- 
           then suddenly, Sam's looking right at Red with a stink eye--

           Shit.  Red quickly looks away, scrapes at a nonexistent stain 
           on his shirt.  Someone takes a seat across from him, but 
           it's just--

                                 MORGAN
                        Big day, negro.

           Deep breath.

                                 RED
                        Yeah.

                                 MORGAN
                        Relax.

           Sam, Darius, and the marching band stroll by, paying Red no 
           mind.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                            (re: Sam)
                        Look, obviously you probably aren't 
                        gonna get the marching band.  But we 
                        knew that going in.
                            (then)
                        Otherwise?  You're sitting pretty -- 
                        you're in the driver's seat!
                                 (MORE)
                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                            (then)
                        Can you feel it?  Feels good, huh?

           Good pep talk.  Red smirks, slaps Morgan some skin.

                                 RED
                        I'm confident.  You just never know 
                        until the final tally.

                                 MORGAN
                        Well, I'm just glad you didn't go 
                        full demagogue, ya dig.

                                 RED
                        What?

                                 MORGAN
                        You know, losing your integrity -- 
                        letting the ends justify the means.
                            (dramatic)
                        Doing whatever it takes.  

           Red frowns -- the last thing he wants is to lose his 
           integrity, especially now.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        My cousin says cats that waste honor?  
                        Never had it to begin with.

           Huh?  Morgan rises, excited.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        Time to vote!

           Red takes a moment to gather himself, then rises.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           Students rush to get in one of a dozen lines building all 
           over the school -- one by one, they file into the private 
           voting booths to cast their ballots.

           We INTERCUT with kids pouring into the GYMNASIUM, eager to 
           grab their seats -- the student body is noticeably more 
           engrossed than they were three days ago.

           Trish, Vi, Douglas, Darius, Morgan, Patsy, and Sam all cast 
           their ballots as...

           MISS RIVERSIDE sings (MOS, thank God) the National Anthem on 
           stage -- students and teachers cover their ears, cringe.

           A CHANT swells from the audience.
                                 BLACK STUDENTS
                        Blue and white, fight fight!  Blue 
                        and white, fight fight!  Blue and 
                        white, fight fight!

           It carries into the closing moments of the MONTAGE, where 
           Red stands in a booth.  Deep breath, he folds up his paper 
           scrap, kisses it, then jams it into the ballot box.

                                 BLACK STUDENTS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Blue and white, fight fight!

           He turns, faces the closed curtain.  Then quickly rips the 
           curtain open--

           And the CHANT STOPS.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - LATER

           You could hear a sea monkey drop.  Everyone's on the edge of 
           their seat, glued to the stage, where a BLACK TEACHER hands 
           Miss Riverside an envelope -- she opens it, pulls out an 
           index card, and studies the results.

           Red's sitting towards the front of the crowd, next to Morgan.  
           Sam's seated in the nose bleeds, next to Darius.

           Miss Riverside peaks up with an impish grin.  Mr. Irving, 
           sitting on the side of the stage, rolls his eyes -- just 
           announce the goddamn winner.

                                 MISS RIVERSIDE
                        It's a landslide!  Your new council 
                        president is Skip.  Red.  Dorsey!

           The crowd ROARS to its feet.  Everyone except Red, who buries 
           his face in his hands, and Sam, who shrinks in his seat, 
           folding his arms.

                                 MORGAN
                            (to Red)
                        Get up, negro!

           Morgan yanks Red to his feet.  The applause is overwhelming.

           Fighting joy-tears, Red makes his way across the row and 
           towards the stage.  He takes a moment, stands at the front 
           of the dais, waving to his constituents, absorbing the respect 
           and acknowledgement and acceptance he coveted.

           On the count of three, Mr. Irving and the maintenance man
           tug on their respective ropes, causing balloons to shower
           Red just as the velvet cloth falls away from the wall behind
           him, exposing the congratulatory banner.  The ROARS get
           louder.
           Mr. Irving gestures for the kids to bring it down a notch, 
           they abide.  Red heads for the microphone, but Miss Riverside 
           gives him a quick introduction first.

                                 MISS RIVERSIDE
                            (re: index card)
                        With a vote of 1036 to 41, please 
                        welcome Mr. President!

           As Red reluctantly takes the podium, Mr. Irving furrows his 
           brow, does math in his head.

                                 RED
                        First of all--

                                 MR. IRVING
                        Stop!

           That's odd.  Red turns to find Mr. Irving taking the index 
           card from Miss Riverside.  He looks at it, then looks to the 
           black teacher -- is this right?  The teacher shrugs -- yeah.

                                 RED
                        As I was saying, I would first like 
                        to thank--

                                 MR. IRVING
                        I said stop, Mr. Dorsey.
                            (regrettably into mic)
                        Would Sam Jackson please come to the 
                        stage.

           GASPS from the audience.  Confused, Sam reluctantly rises 
           and makes the long, awkward walk down the aisle.  All eyes 
           on him.  Red panicking.

                                 RED
                            (to Mr. Irving)
                        What's happening?

           Students once again on the edge of their seats -- this is 
           better than As the World Turns!

           As a clueless Sam steps on stage, Mr. Irving sighs.

                                 MR. IRVING
                            (into mic)
                        There are only 983 students at our 
                        school.

           Murmurs from the crowd -- "Dorsey stuffed the ballots..."

                                 MR. IRVING (CONT'D)
                            (to Red)
                        Would you care to explain?  Was 
                        winning so important?
           But Red's thoroughly stunned, too frozen to speak.  Shaking 
           his head, Mr. Irving has no choice.

                                 MR. IRVING (CONT'D)
                            (into mic)
                        Pursuant to voting code 7 dash B, if 
                        a candidate forges ballots in an 
                        effort to win, they are deemed 
                        disqualified.

           Another collective GASP.

                                 MR. IRVING (CONT'D)
                        Which means, by default...

           Red's mouth hangs open, agony in his eyes.

                                 MR. IRVING (CONT'D)
                        Mr. Jackson is your new council 
                        president.

           The maintenance man looks at the empty net on the ceiling.  
           Well shit.  He flips balloons from the floor in a half-assed 
           attempt to shower Sam.

           Darius rises, applauds, though everyone else is unsure how 
           to respond.

           Sam unfurrows his brow, exhales, reluctantly accepting the 
           news.  Red simply turns and abruptly races out of the 
           auditorium.

           INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - BATHROOM - LATER

           No tears, just shock as Red stares at himself in the mirror.

           HALLWAY

           Red exits the bathroom to find students whispering and 
           staring.  He does his best to ignore it, chin up as he walks.

           He passes Douglas and the basketball team, who shake their 
           heads with disgust.

           He passes Morgan, who can't find the words, and simply frowns.

           Red's making his way for the exit, but just before he gets 
           there, he passes...

           Trish, Vi, and Patsy.  Trish and Vi are quick to turn their 
           backs on Red.  Patsy sighs, pleads with her eyes, practically 
           begging him to say something, anything!  But Red refuses to 
           dignify the accusations and marches right out the door.
           EXT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Where his excited, and clearly uninformed, family is waiting.  
           His father holds a congratulatory cake, his mother a 
           congratulatory balloon.  His sister stands between them.

                                 BILLY
                        Way to go--

                                 RED
                        I didn't win.

                        I didn't win.

           Billy hands the cake to his wife, grips Red's shoulder.

                                 BILLY
                        Now son.  If we're talkin' 
                        improprieties...

           He balls up a fist as if to say "you know what that means."  
           Red shakes his head.

                                 RED
                        I just need a second.  Please.

                            (concerned)
                        Okay.  Well, we'll just wait over 
                        here by the car.

           His parents walk away with the cake and embarrassing balloon.  
           Red looks to the heavens and takes a giant breath of fresh 
           air.  He looks down to find...

           His sister, Dewana, still standing there, staring up at him, 
           right in the eyes.  As if appraising his soul.  It creeps 
           him out.

                                 DEWANA
                        Kitty Kelly is odd and queer, but 
                        not peculiar.
                            (then)
                        She likes battles, but not wars.
                            (then)
                        Isn't that interesting?

           He grimaces.

                                 RED
                        Can you not speak in riddles right 
                        now.
           She beckons for him to come close.

                                 DEWANA
                        Losers win battles.  Winners win 
                        wars.
                            (intense)
                        Kitty Kelly likes winning.

           With a pat on his cheek, she smiles.  He straightens, frowns.

           ON FAY AND BILLY

           Waiting by the car.  They turn to find Dewana skipping towards 
           them.  Alone.

                                 FAY
                        Where's Skip?

                            ("oh nothing, just...")
                        Finishing something.

           Her parents share a curious look.

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

           As night falls, Sam and Darius parade through the streets, a 
           small crowd of students following with a plain-clothes 
           marching band accompaniment.  Darius flicks a LIGHTER, holds 
           the flame up high.

           It's a lively victory lap, akin to a New Orleans procession -- 
           black adults seated on their porches wave and applaud as the 
           new president passes by.

           We RISE above the revelry to the steep...

           ROOFTOP

           Of a one-story HOUSE, where an inconspicuous Red scans the 
           festivities.  Eyes narrowing, when he suddenly hears a 
           RUSTLING behind him.  Sartled, he looks back to find--

           Morgan climbing the ladder.  Red ignores him, continues 
           spying.  Morgan lies prone next to his friend, peaking out 
           over the gutter.  A beat.

                                 MORGAN
                        If I knew you were gonna stuff the 
                        ballots, I coulda helped ya be a 
                        little less obvious.  Ya dig?

                                 RED
                        What happened to honor?
                                 MORGAN
                            ("pfft")
                        I don't listen to everything my cousin 
                        says.

           Incredulous, Red shoots Morgan a side eye.

                                 MORGAN (CONT'D)
                        So what we gonna do?

                                 RED
                        I don't know yet.
                            (then)
                        But it's a war I have to win alone.

           And with that, Red slaps his bud some skin, then scoots away 
           from the edge, leaving an oddly impressed Morgan in his wake.

                                 MORGAN
                            (saluting)
                        God speed.
                            (then)
                        Mr. President.

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           The parade has halted at a street corner.  The entourage 
           huddles around as Sam sparks a joint and smokes it with shut 
           eyes and a wide smile -- his therapeutic treat after a hard-
           fought campaign.

           The chatter is abruptly interrupted by--

                                 RED (O.S.)
                        Samuel L Jackson!

           The crowd parts.  Sam slowly turns to find Red approaching.  
           Alone.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        You know, I always wondered what the 
                        L stood for.

           Sam drags his joint, exhales through his nose.

                                 SAM
                            (with a grin)
                        Stands for lucky.

           The crowd chuckles.  Red holds his ground.

                                 RED
                        I was hoping it stood for lawful.
                            (then)
                        Because a lawful man would have the 
                        guts to admit when he cheated.
           Murmurs.  Sam takes another hit, hands the pot to Darius.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        But I guess the L stands for liar.

           Amused, Sam shakes his head.

                                 SAM
                        Motherfucker, do you have a point?  
                        Or are you just gonna dazzle us with 
                        your command of the letter L?

           Red laughs maniacally, holds up his hand as if begging the 
           jokes to stop.

                                 RED
                        I'm sure I could go on for hours 
                        dazzling the likes of you with fancy 
                        words.  But I had something else in 
                        mind.

                                 SAM
                        Like what?

           Red's laughter screeches to a halt.

                                 RED
                        Like kicking your confounded ass!

           Red CHARGES his towering rival, catching him off guard.  Red 
           spears Sam, taking him to the ground.  Shocked, the crowd 
           spreads out, cheers -- never one to pass up a good brawl.

           Sam FLIPS Red over his head, gets back to his feet.  Red 
           pops up, they circle one another.  Sam relies on his 
           appreciation of Kung Fu films to get into a battle stance.

                                 SAM
                        It's on, motherfucka!

           Red puts up his dukes like a 1920's boxer -- overcoming his 
           reluctance to settle things "like a man."

                                 RED
                        It's about time!

           What happens next is far from an impressive display of martial 
           arts or trained combat.  But what it lacks in technique, it 
           makes up for in sheer determination, grit, and pride.

           Sam has a massive size advantage, which he uses to toss and 
           SWING his opponent around.  But Red uses his quickness and 
           heart to keep things even -- dodging kicks, CHOPPING the 
           backs of knees, even biting ankles to tire Sam out. 

           The melee makes its away through the street and across yards.  
           The crowd follows, cringing and hooting after every blow.
           Sam finally sneaks in a clean PUNCH to the jaw, laying Red 
           out cold on the sidewalk.  It surprises him.

           Spent, Sam pants, hands on knees.  He straightens and we 
           realize he's standing right in front of a familiar GIANT 
           WOODEN SCULPTURE on the lawn of the mysterious White Lady 
           from the blue pickup.

           Darius scurries over.

                                 DARIUS
                        You okay?

                                 SAM
                            (re: joint)
                        Gimme that.

           Sam snatches the weed from his friend, takes a healthy drag.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Sonofabitch just kept comin'.

           Unbeknownst to Sam, Red's eyes suddenly SHOOT open.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        But he was no match for this Tiger 
                        Style.

           As the joint hangs from his lip, Sam demonstrates Kung Fu, 
           tiger claw form, to an unimpressed Darius, when suddenly--

           Out of nowhere, Red SPEARS Sam in the gut, driving them both 
           CRASHING into one of the hideous wood sculptures.

           As Sam and Red roll around in the grass, the wooden sculpture 
           teeters, pieces falling away from its supportive frame, until 
           nothing is left but a giant wooden CROSS.

           At the base of the cross, we find Sam's still burning joint, 
           which ignites the lacquer -- flames quickly ride up the wood, 
           just in time for...
           INT. WHITE LADY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The White Lady to recoil at the sight of a GIANT BURNING 
           CROSS outside her kitchen window!  Scared to death, she drops 
           the shotgun and darts back into the heart of her home.

           EXT. CHATTANOOGA NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Red and Sam continue to roll around, unaware of the 
           unfortunate symbol they created.

           However, the crowd is fully aware, jaws dropped.  And the 
           approaching COP SIRENS don't help -- they quickly disperse.

           A swarm of SQUAD CARS close in, CHERRIES FLASHING.  It finally 
           grabs Red and Sam's attention.  Oh Fuck.  From the grass, 
           still gripping each others' collars, they share a look -- 
           let's book!

           The cars screech to a halt, uniformed cops spilling out, as 
           Sam and Red take off down the street.

           ON RED AND SAM

           Racing for dear life, hopping over parked cars, scaling 
           fences.  Half a dozen white policemen nip at their heels.  
           This is not good.

           Red damn near trips, stumbles.  He looks around to find Sam 
           has abandoned him, panics.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        This way!

           Red finds Sam straining through the rip of a tall fence.  
           After Sam makes it, Red slides right through, just barely 
           escaping the reach of an officer.

           Sam helps Red to his feet.  They take off, smashing through 
           white bed sheets hanging from a clothesline, bursting free 
           only to ram past a tire swing.

           They stumble in the dirt, heading into the night when--

           WHAM!  The headlights of a squad car flash on, cutting through 
           the darkness, stopping them in their tracks.

           Time seems to slow, fear curling up their spines -- breaths 
           accelerating, eyes swelling, as the door to the squad car 
           flings open, and out steps...

           The KKK COP, rocking his aviators at night.  Evil incarnate.

           Red's frozen with fear.  And as the weed kicks in, Sam's 
           eyes dart around for a salvation that doesn't exist -- behind 
           the KKK Cop, from the depths of night, dozens of officers 
           emerge, their eyes GLOWING YELLOW.
           Sam spins around in time to see more cops squeezing through 
           the rip in the fence, determined strides through the hanging 
           bed sheets which fluidly fall off the clotheslines and form, 
           cloaking the cops in KLAN ROBES.

           Panicking, Sam turns back around to find KKK Cop standing in 
           front of them, backlit by the hellish red and white lights 
           of his car.  KKK Cop spits in the dirt, grits his teeth.

                                 KKK COP
                        It's time we put an end to this.

           Red falls to his knees, nearly in tears.  Sam stands his 
           ground, but here's the thing, he's not dealing with some 
           punk kid -- this is the fucking police, in the 1960s South!

           Sam can see his trembling reflection in the aviators, caves.  
           He drops to his knees, but keeps his chin high -- do with me 
           what you will.

           KKK Cop points behind the boys.

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                            (to officer)
                        String up that rope.

           Oh Lord.  Red clasps his hands in prayer.

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                        Y'all thought you could get away 
                        with terrorizin' my dominion?

           Sam blinks through the horror.

           An OFFICER slings a long rope high, trying to get it over a 
           thick tree branch.  He's struggling.  His PARTNER takes a 
           crack at it, fails. 

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                            (to boys)
                        I'm the only terror 'round here.
                            (distracted)
                        I said string up that rope!

                                 OFFICER
                        We're tryin' -- the blasted thing's 
                        heavier 'en it looks--

                                 KKK COP
                        Well put your damn hip into it, Todd!

           The Officer fails again -- disgusted, KKK Cop walks behind 
           the boys to do it himself.  Red and Sam are too scared to 
           look.
                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                            (tossing rope)
                        Ain't got time for this.

           KKK Cop gets the rope over the branch, hands it back to the 
           Officer.

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                            (to boys)
                        Get the dirt off your knees.  I said 
                        stand!

           Red and Sam slowly rise to their feet, backs to the rope, 
           shaking.

                                 RED
                        I know it's in your nature, KKK Cop, 
                        but you do have the power to change.

           Incensed, the KKK Cop cocks his head.

                                 KKK COP
                        Whatchew say?

                                 RED
                        I'm sure you're familiar with The 
                        Scarlet Letter?  Sometimes a life of 
                        shame is far worse than death.

           The cops share a look -- what the fuck is this kid talking 
           about?

                                 KKK COP
                        Death?!
                            (shaking head)
                        You boys high?  Turn around.

           Red and Sam slowly turn to find the cops struggling to 
           resecure the tire swing that was knocked off the tree branch.  
           Oh.  Sam shoots Red a guilty side-eye.

                                 SAM
                            (sotto)
                        I'm high as fuck.

                                 KKK COP
                            (to Officer)
                        Get this rope secure.  Don't want 
                        Mrs. Annabelle's children breaking a 
                        neck.
                            (to boys)
                        Let's go for a ride.

           Cops lead Red and Sam to the back of the squad car.
           INT. SQUAD CAR - LATER (MOVING)

           They drive past the still smoldering cross in the White Lady's 
           lawn, as she tosses water to put it out.  From the backseat, 
           shame paints Sam and Red's faces as they look out the window.

           Red peeks up to catch the KKK Cop's aviators in the rearview 
           mirror, clearly watching them.

           INT. POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE - LATER

           The KKK Cop sits at his cluttered desk, smoking a square.  
           He's still wearing those goddamn sunglasses.

           Red and Sam sit in chairs facing him, at an utter loss.

           A pregnant beat.

                                 KKK COP
                        The KKK Cop.
                            (then)
                        It's what y'all call me, huh?

           They just stare, swallow hard.

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                        You questioning my decency?  That 
                        what y'all gettin' at?

           Silence.  He drags on his cigarette.

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                        Get one thing straight.  I'm what 
                        stands in the way of chaos.
                            (then)
                        And as you might've guessed, a 
                        goddamned burning cross in a 
                        neighbor's yard is chaotic!
                            (then)
                        I don't care if you're negro, engine, 
                        oriental, or a good 'ol fashion 
                        cracka.  That dog don't hunt 'round 
                        here.  Am I clear?

           Red nods quickly.  But Sam just stares, trying to match the 
           steely gaze of this so called authority figure.

           KKK Cop leans back in his chair, amused.  Sam's moxie inspires 
           Red.

                                 RED
                        It was my fault!  Throw the book at 
                        me.

           Sam and Red share a look -- a bond?  Nope.
                                 SAM
                            (to KKK Cop)
                        I'm okay with that.

           Appalled, Red stink-eyes Sam.

                                 RED
                        It was an accident, sir.  We didn't 
                        mean to burn--

           The KKK Cop stomps his foot to shut them up, rubs his 
           forehead.

                                 KKK COP
                        Of course it was a goddamned accident.
                            (then)
                        I ain't never heard of no black folks 
                        torching a cross on a white lawn!
                            (then)
                        Plus.  She refuses to press charges.

           Red and Sam absorb the White Lady's gesure, until the cop 
           suddenly SLAPS the desk with both hands and leans in close.

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                        But I still want an apology!

                                 RED
                        We couldn't be more sorry--

                                 KKK COP
                        Not about that!

           Without looking away, he grabs something from the corner of 
           his desk and plants it in front of them: it's a name plate 
           that reads "SHERIFF KYLE KENNETH KLOSS".

           They look down at it.  Red furrows his brow -- the sheriff's 
           initials are literally KKK.

                                 KKK COP (CONT'D)
                        My name is Sheriff Kloss.  Sheriff 
                        Kyle Kenneth Kloss.
                            (then)
                        And that's it.  Understand?

                                 RED
                        Yes, sir.

           The sheriff puts his sunglasses back on.  A beat.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        So.  No punishment?

           Kloss plants his boots on the desk, signals for them to scram.
                                 KKK COP
                        I'll leave that to your guardians.

           Sam's eyes balloon -- oh fuck.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER

           Sam and Red sheepishly exit to find Sam's mother and auntie 
           waiting, as well as Red's father.

           The boys split, advancing to their respective guardians.

           ON SAM

           As he walks behind Aunt Mavis and Sarah, head down.

                                 AUNT MAVIS
                            (shaking her head)
                        I give the boy an opportunity to 
                        emote and express like the acting 
                        greats of a bygone era, and what do 
                        I get?
                            (then)
                        A thief, stealin' my good wigs and 
                        best makeup!

           Mavis gives him the once over with disgust.

                                 AUNT MAVIS (CONT'D)
                        Now look atcha.  Clothes tattered, 
                        Sunday shoes scuffed to high heaven.
                            (to Sarah)
                        He look like a no good bum!  There, 
                        I said it.

                                 SARAH
                        He sure looks like somethin'.

           Sam peeks up at his mother, but she can barely look at him.  
           It's maddening.

                                 SAM
                        That high-yella nigga started it!  
                        Hell, I was just finishing that 
                        motherfu--

           He finds the women have stopped walking.  They're staring at 
           him, hands on hips -- no nonsense.

                                 SARAH
                        No, you will not.  Not on my watch.

           The only authority figures that matter.

                                 SAM
                        Yes, ma'am.
           They carry on to their car.

           INT. BILLY'S CAR - LATER

           Red sits in the passenger seat.  His father on the driver 
           side.  Silence -- Billy feeling a tad guilty for encouraging 
           his son to fight.  He's about to start the engine, but then 
           pauses, searches for words.

                                 BILLY
                        You know why your great grandfather 
                        was so obsessed with winning at life?

           As Red listens curiously, we FLASH to the DREAM SEQUENCE 
           from earlier:

           Where Captain Jack sits on the floor, smirking defiantly at 
           us.

                                 BILLY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It's because winning breeds respect.

           Back on Red and his father.  Red absorbs this, until Billy 
           surprises him...

                                 BILLY (CONT'D)
                        But he was wrong.
                            (then)
                        He wasn't respected because of what 
                        he invented, or what money he made.
                            (then)
                        He was respected because he believed
                        in something, and was willing to
                        stand up for it.  You believed in
                        yourself, son, and that's something
                        nobody can take away.

           Getting it, Red nods.  Billy nods.  He starts the car and 
           they drive off.

           EXT. WHITE LADY'S HOUSE - DAY

           Though the rest of her ugly art remains intact, there's a 
           torched mound of ash and char where the cross stood.

           A gloved hand jams a shovel into the mound and dumps debris 
           into a wheelbarrow.  The hands belong to...

           Red, sweating beneath the hot midday sun.  He wipes his 
           forehead, peers through the bright light to see Sam 
           approaching.  Red keeps on shoveling.

                                 RED
                            (cold)
                        What are you doing here?
                                 SAM
                        I don't usually apologize to white 
                        people, but--

                                 RED
                        I'm not white!

                                 SAM
                        Not you, nigga!

           Red follows Sam's gaze to a window, where the watchful White 
           Lady quickly ducks out of sight.

           Sam rolls up his sleeve, guides the wheelbarrow to a nearby 
           dumpster, empties it.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        She tell you why she ain't press 
                        charges?

           Red shakes his head.

                                 RED
                        Haven't even spoken with her.  I 
                        just showed up and got to shoveling.

           Interesting.  Suddenly her front door unlocks and creaks 
           open.  The boys share a look -- spooky.

                                 SAM
                        Don't be rude, go on--

                                 RED
                        You go!

           They muster the courage together, dropping the shovel and 
           wheelbarrow.  They cautiously step inside.

           INT. WHITE LADY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Dim lighting casts somewhat chilling shadows, but otherwise 
           homey and inviting.

                                 RED
                        Ma'am?

           Sam's busy looking at her pictures on the wall -- classic 
           wedding photos and awkward family portraits.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Hello--

           He jumps when the White Lady steps out of the kitchen.  She 
           sizes them up, eyes landing on their shoes.  A beat.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Oh, sorry.
           Red takes off his shoes.

                                 WHITE LADY
                        I'd offer y'all water or lemonade.  
                        But the faucet don't work, and I 
                        didn't make none.
                            (then)
                        I figured a little shade might help 
                        speed this along.

           She grumbles at Sam, who still hasn't taken off his loafers -- 
           he's too busy being mesmerized by a particular picture.

                                 SAM
                        You know Martin Luther King, Jr.?

           She swats the air.

                                 WHITE LADY
                        Know is a strong word.
                            (then)
                        Marched with 'em though.  Down in 
                        Albany.  He was nice enough to take 
                        a photo.

           Red takes a look and sure enough, hanging right there on the 
           wall is a picture of Dr. King with a smiling White Lady.  
           Sam's stunned, can hardly contain his excitement.

                                 SAM
                        Well, what is he like?

           She takes a moment to think.  The memory makes her smile.

                                 WHITE LADY
                        Pure.
                            (then)
                        Like everything he said, and 
                        everything he did, was... for the 
                        right reasons.

           The sentiment lands on Red and Sam as they share a look -- 
           their behavior not exactly admirable the past couple of days.

           She points to another picture of Dr. King standing next to 
           light-skinned Thurgood Marshall, with slicked back hair and 
           a mustache.

                                 WHITE LADY (CONT'D)
                        And that light fella is Mr. Thurgood 
                        Marshall.  While Dr. King fights in 
                        the streets, he fights in the 
                        courtrooms.
                            (then)
                        They don't always see eye to eye, 
                        but I reckon we need 'em both.
           Red and Sam size each other up.

                                 WHITE LADY (CONT'D)
                        Now, y'all finish up.
                            (then)
                        And tell them other hooligans this 
                        is my home too, and I ain't leavin'.

                                 SAM
                            (quick)
                        Yes, ma'am.

           Red takes in Sam's newfound respect for this woman, smiles.

                                 RED
                        Yes, ma'am.

                                 WHITE LADY
                        Oh, and between you and me?  I ain't 
                        got no shotgun shells.  But the rest 
                        of 'em don't need to know that.

           She cackles, disappearing into the heart of her home as Red 
           puts on his shoes and heads out.

           EXT. WHITE LADY'S HOUSE - LATER

           Together, Red and Sam dump the last of the char into the 
           garbage.  An awkward pause as they look around.

           Red breaks it by wiping his hand on his pants and extending 
           it.  Unlike before, Sam accepts the handshake.  Good eye 
           contact, respect in its purest form.

                                 RED
                        Well.  I guess the honorable thing 
                        to do, is for us to both forfeit the 
                        presidency and give it to someone 
                        more deserving.

           Sam smirks, nods.

                                 SAM
                        Nah, nigga -- I'm going to Morehouse.

           Sam walks off.

                                 RED
                        But you cheated!

                                 SAM
                        I didn't cheat.

                                 RED
                        At least admit it, there's no one
                        around!
                                 SAM
                        I didn't cheat!

           Red scowls, but can't help but chuckle as he shakes his head.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A swarm of students enter the main entrance.

           Patsy Palm is stopped on the stairs by a tap on the shoulder. 
           She turns to find Red approaching.

                                 PATSY
                        Well if it isn't the corrupt
                        candidate.

                                 RED
                        I didn't cheat!

                                 PATSY
                        Prove it.

           Red stammers, at a loss.  She begs with her eyes for him to
           win back her respect.

                                 RED
                        I can't. 

           She frowns, turns to go.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        But I don't care.

           She pauses.

                                 RED (CONT'D)
                        Sam can have the presidency -- we
                        probably need a bold voice to help
                        expedite change anyway.

                                 PATSY
                            (skeptical)
                        You really think things will ever
                        change around here?

                                 RED
                        The first step is realizing a change
                        is needed -- check.  The next step?
                        We stand up for what's right--

                                 PATSY
                        We?

                                 RED
                        Guess what?  You don't have to be a
                        president to be a leader.
                                 (MORE)
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                            (then)
                        Clearly you don't have to be a man
                        either.

           Patsy smirks, grabs Red by the arm.

                                 PATSY
                        You're full of shit, but keep talking.

                                 RED
                        Besides, Sam's bound to do something
                        stupid like hold the Board of
                        Education hostage, so we need
                        oppositional leadership for checks
                        and balances--

                                 PATSY
                            (laughing)
                        He's not that militant--

           A whistle SHRIEKING across the front lawn.  It's nestled
           between the lips of Sam Jackson, donning his entire marching
           band uniform -- a sharp blue & white costume with his band
           leader hat on top, giant blue feather and all.

           Sam stomps the grass, twirls his baton.  He looks back to
           see his lethargic BAND MEMBERS, also in full uniform, and
           scratches his brow in frustration.

                                 SAM
                        C'mon, people.  Give me some spirit.
                            (then)
                        Blue and white, fight fight!

           They pout, exhausted.

                                 BAND MEMBER #1
                        Why are we practicing in full uniform?

                                 BAND MEMBER #2
                        Yeah!  We helped you win, the least
                        you can do is get off our backs.

                                 BAND MEMBER #1
                        Now that's the damn truth--

                                 SAM
                        I said gimme some goddamn spirit,
                        motherfucker!

           That jolts them awake -- scared shitless, the band straightens
           up and PLAYS like they've never played before -- the TRUMPET
           blares, igniting a soulful rendition of James Brown's It's a
           Man's Man's Man's World (but it wouldn't mean nothing without
           a woman or a girl).
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        One foot, two foot, nigga!

           Sam wiggles his hips and juts the baton up and down as he
           leads the now disciplined band across the lawn.  And just in
           case the back of the formation attempts to slack off...

           Darius charges like a rottweiler.

                                 DARIUS
                            (ferocious)
                        March, motherfucker!  March!

           The band snakes its way towards the stairs, where...

           Red stares incredulously.

                                 RED
                        Not militant?  He's literally leading
                        a goose step--

           Patsy steals a kiss off Red's cheek to shut him up.

           For a split second, Sam winks Red's way.  Red and Patsy
           disappear inside.

           And as those trumpets ring, Sam marches straight for us --
           the steely gaze of those beady eyes, his mouth curling into
           a venomous smile, his posture exuding a unique combination
           of confidence, humility, and give-no-shits charisma -- he is
           the motherfucking "King of Cool".

                                                          SMASH TO BLACK.

                             343 DAYS POST ELECTION...

           INT. CHATTANOOGA HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Someone defaces a history textbook with a noose cartoon and
           "GO BACK TO AFRICA" doodle.  It's Taylor, proud of his best
           work.  He's suddenly startled by his teacher standing in
           front of his desk.

           Taylor looks up smugly and we realize the teacher is Mr.
           Irving!  Yes, the black history teacher from Riverside High!

                                 MR. IRVING
                        Come with me please.

           Irving grabs the tainted textbook as Taylor rises with a
           smirk.  We realize the rest of the class is still mainly
           white but with a couple of black students peppered in.
                                 TAYLOR
                        What, you gonna send me to the
                        principal's office?
                            (then)
                        You do realize you ain't my daddy?

           Stifled laughter from White Jock #1 as Taylor struts towards
           the door.

                                 MR. IRVING
                        No, I'm not your daddy.  I'm your
                        teacher.
                            (then)
                        And no, you're not going to the
                        principal's office.  I'd like for
                        you to read to the class what you
                        wrote in here.

           Mr. Irving hands the textbook back to Taylor, now standing
           in front of his peers.  Nervous chuckles from Taylor,
           judgemental eyes on him -- both black and white.  Taylor
           sweats, stutters, a deer in headlights.

           EXT./INT. RIVERSIDE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           We glide past a row of parked school buses in the parking
           lot that are all EMPTY.  We make our way through a window,
           and down the hallway to the

           CAFETERIA

           Where a student council meeting is in session around a table.

                                 NERDY TREASURER
                        Which will balance our budget and
                        give us enough funds for a prom to
                        remember.

           The treasurer slides a document across the table to Sam,
           sitting at the head.  Sam nods enthusiastically as he peruses
           the paper, then suddenly balls it up and tosses it.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck a prom to remember -- we hold
                        that motherfucka in Petey's backyard,
                        and finance a mandatory field trip
                        to the Slave Mart Museum.
                            (then)
                        Meeting adjourned, niggas.

           Darius POUNDS a gavel as we glide down another hallway and
           enter a

           CLASSROOM

           Where a black teacher POPS open a box and hands fresh books
           down the rows of students.  Each student has their own desk.
           Douglas passes a book behind him to Red.  In turn, Red hands
           the new book behind him to an impressed Morgan.

                                 MORGAN
                        Still ain't gonna read it, but damn
                        it smells good.

           Red laughs, turns to his side where a doting Patsy sits one
           desk over.

                                 PATSY
                            (re: fresh books)
                        The crispest.

                                 RED
                            (smiling)
                        Crisp is good.

           Delighted, Patsy cracks open her book.  We close in on the
           clean, untainted pages as she flips through them.

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

           SHAMELESS LAUGHTER.

                                                            SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW - DAY

           We're back where we started.  A thoroughly entertained CROWD --
           a snapshot of America, WHITE and BLACK locals seated next to
           BLACK and WHITE tourists.  Too busy cackling, knee-slapping,
           and ogling a late night legend to realize the social relevance
           of this integration.

           They watch with bated breath as JAY LENO interviews SAMUEL L
           JACKSON on stage.

           TITLE OVER: Los Angeles, California, 2004

                                 SAMUEL L JACKSON
                        No I'm serious.  It wasn't on the
                        big stage or anything, but it was
                        kinda intense.  In high school, there
                        was this cat... he was like this
                        teacher's pet kinda dude.
                            (then)
                        I ran for school president against
                        him.

           Having curbed their doubt, the audience collectively GASPS,
           leans in -- they're eating up the suspense, imagining a
           teenage King of Cool clashing with a teacher's pet.

                                 JAY LENO
                        Well?  Did you win?
           Jackson's eyes narrow as he considers, almost offended Jay
           had to ask.

                                 SAMUEL L JACKSON
                        Of course, man!

           The audience ROARS.

                                 SAMUEL L JACKSON (CONT'D)
                        I mean, I cheated, but...

           The audience doubles over with laughter.  Jackson just shrugs,
           puts up his hands as if to say "it is what it is."

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.

                               THE motherfucking END
