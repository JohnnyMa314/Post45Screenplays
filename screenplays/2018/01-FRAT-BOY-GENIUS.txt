                                  FRAT BOY GENIUS

                    a story of riches to, like, way more riches

                 The following story is based on true events, but certain 
           names have been changed out of respect for every individual’s 
                             unassailable right to privacy.

           SUPER HIGH-RES NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC CLOSE-ON ON A HUMAN BODY 
           PART.

           Too close to know what or whose. Hairs. Pores. Black heads.  
           A droplet of sweat collects in a narrow groove - it's kind of 
           primordial. Definitely gross. Someone's HEART BEAT. Fast. 
           Either anxiety or very high cholesterol. 

           ZOOM OUT on the face of 26-year-old billionaire and CEO of 
           Snapchat, EVAN SPIEGEL — a surprisingly not-totally-
           unattractive combination of thin-lips, hooked nose, and butt 
           chin. 

           ZOOM OUT further to reveal Evan is on a raised dais above the 
           floor of the New York Stock Exchange, having traded his 
           normal uniform of James Perse tee and black skinnies for a 
           designer suit. 

           Smiling but tense, he and Snapchat co-founder and CTO, BOBBY 
           MURPHY (28, Eurasian descent), pose for photos — many of 
           which are taken through the SNAPCHAT CAMERA on multiple cell 
           phones in the crowd. 

           ONSCREEN TEXT APPEARS IN THE STYLE OF SNAPCHAT GEO-FILTERS 
           (as if we're swiping between them):

           March 2nd, 2017

           SWIPE!

           Snap Inc. Public Valuation: $33 billion USD 

           SWIPE!

           Evan Spiegel Net Value: $3.3 billion USD

           Evan and Bobby are dwarfed by the gigantic screen behind 
           them, reading “Snap Inc.” against a sea of neon yellow. 

           The Snap logo, “Ghostface Chillah,” lights up screens across 
           the floor. I'm not being cute. That's the official name of 
           the cartoon ghost. 

           THOMAS FARLEY, president of the NYSE, looks on as the two 
           guys ring the iconic opening bell. 
                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        I think my favorite part of any 
                        story is the beginning. The 
                        promise, the expectation, the 
                        thrill of the unknown. The part 
                        before the part where everyone's 
                        like, "ahh, how did we get here and 
                        where did it all go wrong??"

           The mix of press, Snap investors, high-level employees, and 
           Wall Streeters erupt in cheers — many of them stand to cash 
           out by the millions in the next few minutes. Celebratory 
           chaos now in slow-mo like a rave set to money instead of 
           music...

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Although, it looks like it all went 
                        right for the hero of our story. 
                        Where is our hero?

           A SKINNY BLONDE with a crisp blow-out takes a selfie as 
           yellow confetti rains down from above. She backs into SAM 
           BIDDLE (23), a hobgoblin with a reporter's badge, tufts of 
           brown curls, and a deep scowl. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No, not her, or that guy. 

           A pod of MIDDLE-AGED WHITE GUYS shaking hands. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Too old and crusty. 

           The camera lingers...

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I said not them! 
                            (grossed out)
                        Ugh.  

           A SUPERMODEL bounces a BABY on her hip and points towards the 
           dais. The baby wears those special noise-cancelling 
           headphones designed for the offspring of famous people.

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                            (quick)
                        Too beautiful, too young. 

           Time resumes its normal pace as we pan to Snapchat employee, 
           LILY KWOK (27), painfully cool in couture street wear and 
           focused, on the job. She takes a panoramic video of the 
           commotion and expertly edits within the app. She slaps a 
           filter, types a caption, and adds the footage to a curated 
           Snap Story called “IPO" with lightning speed.
                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Definitely not. That would be me. 
                        Snapchat employee #32. Female, 
                        Korean-American. Not exactly lead-
                        material. 

           Lily  re-opens the camera function and ZOOMS IN on Evan’s 
           face. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        There we go. 

           She hits the capture button and we stay on her phone screen 
           as she starts to draw red devil horns on her boss with the 
           paint tool.

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Look at him up there. How does he 
                        manage to look smug and strung-out 
                        at the same time? Sometimes I 
                        wonder if he even realizes that I 
                        made his company profitable, that 
                        I'm the reason he's made any money 
                        at all...

           Her drawing becomes more fervent.

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        No, he knows what he did. He has 
                        to, right? I mean, there's a reason 
                        you know his name and not mine. 

           She draws a tiny dick over his crotch area. Perfects the 
           proportionally tiny balls...

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        I'd like to say it was all dumb 
                        luck, but it's actually more 
                        complicated than that. This is a 
                        biopic after all. 

           Her tasteful acrylic nail hovers over the blue send arrow -

                                 LILY  (V.O). (CONT’D)
                        Is it pronounced bio-pic or bi-ah-
                        pic? Shit. Whatever.

           - finally - TAP! - as we CUT TO:

           EXT. STANFORD SCHOOL OF DESIGN (THE D.SCHOOL) - PALO ALTO - 
           DAY

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: Stanford University, 2011
           INT. STANFORD D.SCHOOL CLASSROOM - PALO ALTO - DAY

           We are in a small space designed for ultimate collaborative 
           synergy - orange leather couches face mobile, collapsing 
           white boards covered in diagrams and neon Post-it notes. 

           Sitting among his students is Professor RICHARD KENT (60s), a 
           Pixar character come to life with walrus mustache, bald 
           crown, and black-rimmed glasses. He is also responsible for 
           designing the first Apple mouse and several other icons of 
           the digital generation. 

           The class includes a 20-year-old EVAN, in need of a haircut 
           and a shave.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        I'm sure this will come as a shock 
                        to no one, as it was stated clearly 
                        in the syllabus which I so 
                        generously printed out for all of 
                        you at great risk to the planet and 
                        my pride, but you will be 
                        presenting your product concepts in 
                        class next Friday. 

           CLOSE ON one such SYLLABUS in a pristine binder with multiple 
           tabs - you know the type. The header - "DESIGNING WITH 
           EMPATHY," and a highlighted presentation date that gets RE-
           highlighted now. Pan up to reveal a younger LILY sporting 
           flip flops and a lanyard keychain in place of kicks and 
           choker. 

           Most of the other kids are distracted by phones and laptops. 
           A quick tour of the SCREENS in the room reveal the 2011 
           interfaces of Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, but 
           noticeably, not Snapchat. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT (CONT’D)
                        Feel free to stop by office hours 
                        and go through your bill of 
                        materials and profit-loss 
                        statements with me. 

           He realizes that he's lost them. Especially Evan, who is 
           currently texting under the table. We notice manic leg-
           tapping as he sends the “speak-no-evil” MONKEY EMOJI to 
           someone named “Hot Pi Phi." (Kid’s got game). 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT (CONT’D)
                        Or ask Mr. Spiegel for advice, 
                        since he's successfully sold so 
                        many companies that he doesn't need 
                        to listen to me drone on here. 
           The class laughs, Evan smirks.

                                 EVAN
                            (unbothered)
                        It was worth it, I promise. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Taking detailed notes on tollgates 
                        to reduce your development risk, no 
                        doubt. 
                            (to the class)
                        Ok - leave, all of you. Go do young 
                        people things. 

           EXT. STANFORD D.SCHOOL - PALO ALTO - DAY 

           The class disperses. Evan walks past Lily  unlocking her bike 
           outside the building. He looks up from his phone - 

                                 EVAN
                        How's your project going? 

                                 LILY 
                        Fine. I'm a little worried about 
                        injection molded bottle components 
                        driving up capital costs during the 
                        launch period, but I've got all 
                        week to work out the kinks. 

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I'm not worried about you. 
                        That thing you said in class the 
                        other day about barrier to entry, 
                        what was it..."the process of R&D 
                        itself is begging for a 
                        redesign..." kind of genius. 

           We clock her surprise, followed by a charmed flush that 
           creeps into her cheeks. 

                                 LILY
                        Thanks, I, uh, always thought you 
                        weren't listening during section -

                                 EVAN
                        Hold on one sec. 
                            (he finishes sending a 
                             text, finally makes eye 
                             contact)
                        So, how would you feel about 
                        partnering up on the final project?

           A beat, as Lily looks at him confused. Then, realizing -
                                 LILY 
                        Oh, you haven't started. 

                                 EVAN
                        I'm in ultra stealth mode.

                                 LILY 
                        Do you even have an idea? 

                                 EVAN
                        Not yet. But I've got incredible 
                        stage presence. 

                                 LILY 
                        Sorry dude, you're going to have to 
                        find someone else to leech off. 

           She hops on her bike and starts to leave.

                                 EVAN
                            (jocular)
                        Big mistake! 

                                 LILY 
                            (sotto)
                        Dickbag.

           TEXT NOISE. Evan checks his phone and laughs. We assume Hot 
           Pi Phi. 

           Are you getting the point I'm making? That he's a poster-boy 
           for Gen Y? Is it too much? Let's just assume from this point 
           forward that he is distracted by his phone in any given 
           interaction.

           EXT. KAPPA SIGMA FRATERNITY - STANFORD CAMPUS - DAY - 
           ESTABLISHING

           Neither the red brick of east-coast-ivy-classicism nor the 
           stately columns of the pre-Civil War South. 

           The Stanford version of a frat-house is not imposing, but 
           kind of...cute? An understated, single-story with a 
           wraparound outdoor corridor, nice lawn, and deck in back. 

           A couple of shirtless guys toss a frisbee on the grass. Not a 
           bad place for an upper-middle-class couple to retire...

           INT. KAPPA SIG - DAY

           ...Until you walk inside. 
           Evan makes his way through the trash-strewn common area of 
           the house.     

           Guys lounge on stained couches and shovel food at long, 
           sticky tables. They all do that silent chin-nod thing in 
           Evan's direction when he walks in, either a sign of love or 
           fear or both. 

           One of the new pledges, PETER COGGESHALL (19, floppy hair) 
           has surrounded himself in a phalanx of JELLO SHOTS. 

                                 COGGESHALL
                        Evan! Hey! I saw your email. 100 
                        jello shots, just like you said. 
                        The Pi Phis are gonna get so fucked 
                        up.

                                 EVAN 
                            (distracted, on autopilot)
                        Nice. 

           He keeps moving, eyes glued to phone. CLOSE ON his screen, 
           where he checks his bank account. It reads $5,294.32

           CLOSE ON TWO IDENTICAL TEXT MESSAGES sent in quick succession 
           to contacts MOM and JOHN: 

           Balance getting low. Please refill ASAP. 

           INT. KAPPA SIG - BACKYARD DECK - CONTINUOUS 

           Evan joins an informal conclave of the Kappa Sig leadership. 
           House president, SHANE SODHI, treasurer, SAM GREITZER, and 
           recruitment chair, CASEY KAHN, play a chill game of beer 
           pong. 73 and sunny with a fat blunt to go around.

                        We can't cancel Foam Party.

                        House council voted. Too risky. One 
                        more strike and we're off campus.

                                 CASEY
                        Sad but true. We can't control what 
                        happens in the foam. 

                                 SAM
                        Biddies love foam.

                        This is what the University wants! 
                        If we don't do our annual party no 
                        one is gonna rush Kappa Sig and if 
                        we can't meet the occupancy quota 
                        we lose our housing anyway! Send a 
                        retraction. Foam Party is on. 

                                 SHANE
                        Sorry Spiegs, we already voted.

                                 EVAN
                        Well, as social chair I'm calling a 
                        re-vote. Casey, Sam - who pays for 
                        all your liquor and cocaine?

           Off Casey and Sam, reconsidering their options...

           INT. KAPPA SIG - HALLWAY - LATER

           On the move again, Evan checks his TEXTS -

           MOM: Will do. Good luck with finals! 
           JOHN: Done

           He sends a TEXT to contact, BOBBY:

           Where are you?

           The text fails to send. 

           He pauses to think.

           INT. STANFORD COMPUTER LAIR - LATER

           The bowels of Stanford - a 24-hour dungeon underneath the 
           cement eyesore of Meyer Library - rows of computer screens  
           despairingly referred to as "The Lair."

           A younger, greasy-haired Bobby Murphy sits in front of a 
           massive desktop screen of code, headphones in. He is one of 
           many hunched, pathetic lifeforms here at 9pm on a weekday.

           Evan shakes his chair from behind, startling him. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Dude, what - how did you -

                                 EVAN
                        No cell service. Jesus this place 
                        is depressing. 
                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah...have you never been here 
                        before? 

                                 EVAN
                        I need a progress report on Future 
                        Freshman. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I can't do this right now, Evan. I 
                        have a huge p-set due tomorrow. 

                                 EVAN
                        Have you figured out the UI design 
                        I sent you? 

                                 BOBBY
                        I know you've never written a 
                        single line of code in your life - 

                                 EVAN
                        I took CS105. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You got a C in an intro to HTML 
                        class.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, I passed, which is an amazing 
                        return on investment if you think 
                        about it. 

           Bobby remembers his point -

                                 BOBBY
                        It's not like Product Design, dude. 
                        Macaroni art and origami cranes, or 
                        whatever. I have to create an 
                        entire nervous system from scratch.  

           A kid at the computer next to Bobby scratches at a patch of 
           psoriasis on his elbow. Evan looks at him with disgust and 
           shifts away - who are these people? His crisp white tee, 
           designer jeans, and overall healthy complexion don't belong 
           down here. 

                                 EVAN
                        I need it by Friday. 
                                 BOBBY
                        What? Why? 
                            (with the tone of someone 
                             who has practiced in the 
                             mirror)
                        No, sorry. I can't do it.

                                 EVAN
                        You're a spring quarter senior. You 
                        should be taking Wine Tasting and 
                        Yoga. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        I applied to Wine Tasting. Didn't 
                        get in. 

                                 EVAN
                        Look, I know a guy who knows a PM 
                        at Facebook and I told him we'd 
                        send him a prototype by Friday.   

                                 BOBBY
                            (groans)
                        Fuck, Evan...you can't just...our 
                        analytics are terrible. It's 
                        performing even worse than our last 
                        one...

           Something snaps in Evan, in the first of many abrupt 
           transitions between good natured conversation and blistering 
           intensity. 

                                 EVAN
                        I don't give a fuck. If it looks 
                        good I can pitch us on that alone. 
                        Just...get it done.

           A beat. Bobby, quieter -

                                 BOBBY
                        Ok, fine. 

           Rapid mouse movements and typing on Bobby's end. Evan picks 
           at a hangnail. 

                                 EVAN
                        It smells like a Chi O's asshole 
                        down here. 
           INT./EXT. VARIOUS - STANFORD CAMPUS - PALO ALTO - NIGHT 

           The following scenes SMASH CUT between Evan, Bobby, and 
           Lily's college lives. It is disorienting. But intentionally, 
           like in an artistic way. 

           If the viewer is paying attention, they'll notice that Evan's 
           scenes are shot in that Snapchat filter that makes everything 
           super saturated like a music video (also my filter of choice 
           for obscuring acne and dark circles). 

           PARTY ROCK ANTHEM by LMFAO blasting... 

           -Evan, Kappa Sig bros, and Pi Phis throw back jello shots on 
           the deck. Hot popular people drinking, grinding, and ponging 
           as palm trees sway in the background. Like the coed, So-Cal 
           version of a Baz Luhrmann party, with Evan as unmistakable 
           King of the Frat. 

           -CLOSE ON a stream of coffee into a styrofoam cup. Lily takes 
           the cup back to her cubicle in Green Library. She settles in 
           for a night of work on a COMPLICATED PERFORMANCE MODEL. 

           -Evan SCORES in beer pong and lifts Hot Pi Phi aka MAGGIE the 
           human biology major off the ground. A heavyset blonde with a 
           flushed babyface fishes out Evan's ball and chugs. This is 
           REGGIE BROWN (22). More on him later. 

           -Lily nods off, surrounded by papers, laptop, books.  

           -Bobby works on the SOURCE CODE for Future Freshman in his 
           room,  trying to drown out the NOISE of Foam Party raging 
           outside. Evan comes in, trashed, and brings him a beer. He 
           gives him a "thumbs up" before stumbling out.  

           -CLOSE ON two lines of cocaine on Evan's desk. Maggie does a 
           line, only to turn around and find Evan passed out on the 
           bed. She watches as a POOL OF URINE slowly spreads beneath 
           him... 

           INT. EVAN'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           A cleaned-up Evan checks himself out in the mirror and pops a 
           piece of gum in his mouth before flopping down on his bed, 
           now stripped of sheets. 

           CLOSE ON his phone, where he goes to Maggie's Instagram page. 
           Each post is more curated and picture-perfect than the next — 
           BLOWING OUT CANDLES, doing a HANDSTAND AT THE BEACH, a SUN-
           DRENCHED SELFIE. 
                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        Ah, the Instagram newsfeed. The 
                        piece de resistance of all social 
                        media facades. Carefully plucked, 
                        tanned, FaceTuned, filtered, 
                        gleaming little squares that start 
                        to feel like morbid cries for help 
                        the longer you stare at them. Not 
                        that I've wasted hours of my life 
                        staring at Instagram. 
                            (beat)
                        Did you forget that this story has 
                        a narrator? Because it does.

           INT. NOLA - DOWNTOWN PALO ALTO - NIGHT

           A kitschy, New Orleans themed bar - a three floor space more 
           reminiscent of the French Quarter at Disneyland than the real 
           thing, and probably one of the only bars in America where 
           college kids party with middle-aged VCs.

           Evan walks in. He spots a group of now familiar Kappa Sig 
           faces, including Reggie's, ordering shots.

           He joins the bros right as they raise their glasses -- 

                                 KAPPA SIG 1 
                        To Frank Reginald Brown IV - 
                        beloved brother of the Kappa Sigma 
                        order, the Prince of Chattanooga, 
                        reigning flip cup champion, and as 
                        of today, an innocent man! 

           Fuck yeahs all around.

                        May they shout the Disciplinary 
                        Board's verdict from Hoover Tower 
                        to MemChu - Reggie Brown did not 
                        have sexual relations with that 
                        Tri-Delt!  

           More laughs and cheers. 

                                 REGGIE 
                            (peacocking)
                        Oh, I had them. They were just 
                        super consensual. 

                                 KAPPA SIG 2
                        "Your honor, the plaintiff is a

                            (grabbing Reggie's ass)
                        Of course she wanted it - look at 
                        these fucking glutes. How does a 
                        poetry major get an ass like that? 

                                 KAPPA SIG 1 
                        See, even Collins wants to fuck 
                        you, Reg.

           They all laugh extra hard. The repressed sexuality here is 
           overwhelming and completely ignored.

                                 KAPPA SIG 1 (CONT’D)
                        Speech!! Speeech!

           The others chime in. 

                                 REGGIE
                        I don't know what to say. I love 
                        you guys.

                                 KAPPA SIG 2
                        Gayyyy.

           And now, the monologue that will probably win this script an 
           Oscar: 

                                 REGGIE
                        Seriously though, it was just like, 
                        really scary - people were calling 
                        me these terrible things - like 
                        life-ruining shit - and I was like 
                        - that's not me. That's not who I 
                        am. So the fact that everyone in 
                        the house believed me and had my 
                        back...I mean, it was huge...I 
                        feel..um..

           He starts to get emotional. 

                                 EVAN
                        I think what Reginald is trying to 
                        say is,
                            (raising his glass)
                        Fuck bitches, get laid. 

           Maggie approaches the group from behind. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What are we celebrating? 
           INT. NOLA'S, DANCE FLOOR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Evan and Maggie dance - fast and then slower. They kiss. 

                                 EVAN
                        Should we relocate? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Depends, are you gonna wet the bed 
                        this time? 

                                 EVAN
                        Why, did you like it? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don't be weird. 

           He whispers something in her ear. She rolls her eyes but 
           smiles -

                                 MAGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Meet you outside.

           Maggie heads toward the restrooms and Evan moves to the bar 
           to close-out. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        I don't have words for this 
                        interaction. It's like you don't 
                        even have to be attractive to be a 
                        fuccboi anymore. 

           INT. NOLA'S - CONTINUOUS 

           Evan waits for his credit card and overhears some of the gang

                        You worried she's gonna blast that 
                        shit? 

                                 KAPPA SIG 1
                        No, I don't know, it's just a 
                        little weird. Like, my junk will be 
                        out there. Forever.

                                 KAPPA SIG 2
                        No offense dude, but I don't think 
                        there's a ton of global interest in 
                        your junk. I would send it.

                        Wait Sam, did you not tell them 
                        what happened to you? 

                                 SAM
                        Dude, no...not here.

                        Fine. So, similar situation - this 
                        girl Molly from my IHUM section 
                        texts me a picture of her boobs, 
                        which is like, an internationally 
                        recognized request for a dick pic.

           All the guys nod as if to say, "Amen."

                        Brb, vomiting quietly in my mouth. 

                                 SAM
                        So I drink a beer and 
                        start...prepping.

                        Prepping?

                            (miming)
                        Stroking it out...just enough to be 
                        big, but not hard.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah. Anyway, I'm a little buzzed 
                        and I have boner brain and long 
                        story short - I texted the wrong 
                        person.

                                 KAPPA SIG 2
                        What? Who?

                                 KAPPA SIG 3
                        His MOM.

                        Noooo / Fuckkkk / Your dick? / How?

                                 SAM
                        Her name was Molly - the contact 
                        names are practically the same. 
                                 KAPPA SIG 3
                        Yeah when your mom is saved in your 
                        phone as "Mommy."

                                 KAPPA SIG 1
                        Holy fuck. 

                                 KAPPA SIG 2 
                        I would literally kill myself. 

                                 SAM
                        I told her my phone was stolen. 

                                 KAPPA SIG 2
                        Uh dude, I think she knows. 

           The guys are in stitches.

                                 KAPPA SIG 3
                        It's ok man, we all have photos we 
                        wish would disappear.

           CLOSE ON EVAN, taking in every word. 

                                 KAPPA SIG 1 
                        Mommy? Really? 

           Off Evan, still thinking, as he pays his tab. 

           INT. STANFORD CAMPUS, LECTURE HALL - PALO ALTO - DAY

           In the sober light of day, Evan can’t stop thinking about the 
           bros’ conversation. He sits in the back of a lecture hall and 
           stalks Maggie on Instagram again. 

           Evan hesitates over the Like button on a selfie - something 
           clicks for him.

           He begins to maniacally scribble in a moleskin notebook with 
           a Pilot G-2 .05 pen (his preferred writing instrument). 

           CLOSE ON the scribblings — “CONTINUUM” —> “ACCUMULATION → 
           INSTANT EXPRESSION” — it looks like Beautiful Mind-esque 
           gibberish to us.

           INT. KAPPA SIG - BOBBY'S ROOM - LATER

           Evan bursts into Bobby's room -

                                 EVAN
                        Bobby -
                                 BOBBY
                        Dude I was just about to call you - 
                        I finally cracked it.

                                 EVAN
                        Cracked what?

           Bobby laughs, a little manic from sleep-deprivation.

                                 BOBBY
                        Future Freshman! I got it to look 
                        exactly the way you want so you can 
                        show it to that guy at Facebook -

                                 EVAN
                        What guy at Facebook? Forget about 
                        Future Freshman dude, it’s a piece 
                        of shit. Can you code a 
                        communication-based camera platform 
                        where all the pics have a shelf-
                        life of a few seconds?

           Bobby looks truly broken.

                                 BOBBY
                        What? 

                                 EVAN
                        Can you do it?

                                 BOBBY
                        I haven't slept in two days -

                                 EVAN
                        Bobby! Listen to me! A camera-
                        centric application where all the 
                        pics disappear...can you do it?

                                 BOBBY
                            (like a zombie)
                        I guess, but what’s the point of a 
                        camera app if all the pics 
                        disappear?

           Evan grins and hits Bobby in the shoulder like men sometimes 
           do when they experience joy.  

                                 EVAN
                        Exactly. That's exactly it. 

           Off Bobby - confused and feeling somewhat dead inside. 
           INT. STANFORD D.SCHOOL CLASSROOM - PALO ALTO - DAY

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: One week later. 

           Final presentation day in Evan and Lily 's Product Design 
           class. Lily  concludes with her last and most impressive 
           slide.

                                 LILY 
                        MindHive has real interest from a 
                        Principal VC at a local fund, so I 
                        will be developing the app with 
                        their help this summer. I just hope 
                        I can do that and intern at Google 
                        at the same time! 

           She chuckles as if this is a relatable predicament. 

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        Ok, so, I was kind of narc in 
                        college. There are worse things. 

           PROFESSOR KENT claps proudly and leads the class in tepid 
           applause. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Congratulations, Miss Kwok! I love 
                        that your passion for this product 
                        is manifesting in such a tangible 
                        way. I can't wait to see how it all 
                        unfolds, truly. Are there any 
                        questions for Miss Bai?

           Silence from the class. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT (CONT’D)
                        Don't take it personally, Lily. 
                        They're just intimidated. Ok Mr. 
                        Spiegel - you're up. 

           Lily  smirks at Evan before heading back to her seat. Evan 
           stands up in his seat -

                                 EVAN
                        It’s an app, you take a photo, it 
                        disappears. That’s it.

           He sits down. Awkward laughs from the class. Off Kent, 
           massaging his forehead in frustration -
           INT. PROFESSOR KENT'S OFFICE - LATER

           Evan plays with a doohickey on Kent's shelves. Kent looks at 
           him with more amusement than anger. There is a real fondness 
           here, on both sides.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        So, that was quite a stunt. Any 
                        last words before I fail you?

                                 EVAN
                        I'm not comfortable sharing any 
                        details at this time. 

           Kent laughs.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Ok then. You can go. 

           Evan, quickly - 

                                 EVAN
                        I'm not gonna just spew my 
                        intellectual property to a whole 
                        room of unoriginal sheep who will 
                        try and sell it to Google tomorrow. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT 
                        That's a lot of moral outrage for 
                        someone who was too lazy to do the 
                        assignment. 

                                 EVAN
                        The element of surprise is a 
                        weapon, Jobs knew that. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Evan, we have complete privacy 
                        here. There are no cameras, no 
                        bugs. 

                                 EVAN
                        There's no such thing as privacy in 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                            (bartering, despite 
                             himself)
                        I'll raise your grade to a B.

                                 EVAN
                        I want an A- in the class and a 
                        meeting with one of your old 
                        colleagues at Apple. 
                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Don't push it. 

           This seems like an easy call to us, but we watch as Evan 
           hesitantly mulls it over. 

                                 EVAN
                            (excitedly, despite 
                             himself)
                        Ok, so I'm sitting in class, not 
                        yours, stalking this girl online 
                        and it just hit me - we are so 
                        fucking obsessed with our online 
                        footprint. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Who?

                                 EVAN
                        My generation! It's like an 
                        undiagnosed pathology of curation. 
                        Facebook, Instagram, and all the 
                        early photo aggregates, MySpace 
                        etc. — it’s all about being perfect 
                        AKA fake because everything is 
                        permanent and therefore wrapped up 
                        with your identity. But what if 
                        there was an app that freed you 
                        from all that hyper-curation 
                        bullshit? What if instead of living 
                        and THEN documenting, we could 
                        document while living, without 
                        thinking so fucking hard about it? 

           Kent starts to smile.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Interesting..

                                 EVAN
                        Natural, expressive communication. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        No need to perfect an image that 
                        will eventually disappear.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes, exactly. Anyway, I'm taking a 
                        break from app development. It's 
                        all work, no reward. Thinking more 
                        about graphic design, which is why 
                        I need you to hook it up at Apple.

           Kent thinks.
                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        You could do that. Or, you could 
                        take a couple friends, go home, and 
                        invest time in this idea. Build it. 
                        Hone it. Work a lot for absolutely 
                        nothing. This is a good idea at the 
                        right time. Do you know how rare 
                        that is? Too rare for someone as 
                        young and smart as you to farm 
                        themselves out to the nearest tech 
                        company. Trust me, there's more 
                        than enough time for that.

           SAYS: SOUND OFF

           The rest of Evan and Kent's conversation is muted.

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        Nothing more inspiring than the 
                        bond between cis, white males, am I 
                        right? Maybe this is petty, but why 
                        am I not sitting in that office? I 
                        mean, my presentation was really 
                        good. I almost sold that idea! 
                        Meanwhile, Evan does zero work and 
                        he's the one who gets coddled and 
                        mentored straight into the history 
                        books? 
                            (beat)
                        No, you're right, that does sound 
                        petty. 

           EXT. KAPPA SIG HOUSE - DAY

           We're outside Kappa Sig. Evan, Bobby, and Reggie pack their 
           things into an Escalade with a vanity plate that just reads: 
           "SPIEGS." They load cases of Red Bull, hefty bags of dirty 
           laundry, a pair of dumbbells...

           Evan hops into the drivers seat and plugs "Los Angeles" into 
           his Google Maps app. 

           Through the window he sees Lily  biking uphill. 

                                 EVAN
                        One sec, guys. 
                            (to Lily )
                        Yo! Lil-money!

           He runs across the street.
                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        How's the app going?

                                 LILY 
                        Great. How is your, uh, idea?

                                 EVAN
                        Still the best idea to come out of 
                        this place in 10 years. Taking a 
                        couple buddies to LA to build it 
                        this summer.

                                 LILY 
                        Wow, congrats. 

                                 EVAN
                        But we could use some estrogen. You 
                        want to get in on the ground floor?

                                 LILY 
                        I'm good thanks, but good luck with 
                        everything.

           She starts to bike away but he stops her.

                                 EVAN
                        One day you're going to work for 
                        me, and you'll look back on this 
                        moment as one of the biggest 
                        mistakes of your life. 

                                 LILY 
                        No, one day you're going to work 
                        for me, and when that happens, I 
                        promise not to tell anyone that 
                        this happened. Have a good summer, 
                        Evan. 

           As she leaves, we CLOSE IN on her face, resolute, hungry, and 
           totally convinced of her version of the future...

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        You know what's worse than being a 
                        narc with helmet hair? 
                            (beat)
                        Being wrong. 

           INT./EXT. EVAN'S ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS (DRIVING)

           As they pull away from the frat and turn onto the Campus 
           Drive loop...
                                 BOBBY
                        So what’s your dad’s stance on 
                        smoking in the house?

                                 REGGIE
                        Papa Spiegel is super chill. He 
                        practically hazed us when we went 
                        down for the 'SC game last year.

                                 EVAN
                        Cool story, bro. 
                            (to Bobby)
                        Don't worry bud, nobody's gonna 
                        take away your weed. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It's for anxiety.

                                 EVAN
                            (to Reggie)
                        And while I have you here, sober - 
                        John may be liable for underage 
                        drinking and whatever, but this 
                        summer is about launching a 
                        company, not raging. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Then why are there two handles of 
                        Jaeger in the trunk?

           Evan smirks.

                                 EVAN
                        Ok, there might be a little room 
                        for raging. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Yes! My fucking man! 

                                 BOBBY
                        Why is he here again? 

                                 REGGIE
                        Chief Marketing Officer, bitch.

           Bobby scoffs. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You can't be CMO of a company I 
                        haven't finished coding yet. 
                                 REGGIE
                        No, you can’t be a company without 
                        someone to sell the product, right 
                        Ev?

                                 EVAN
                        You're both right. If we act legit, 
                        then we are legit.

           Reggie nods, moved - this is possibly the most profound thing 
           he's ever heard - while Bobby rolls his eyes in the back 
           seat. He notices something in Reggie's lap - a drawing in a 
           notebook - 

                                 BOBBY
                            (to Reggie)
                        What is that? 

                                 REGGIE
                        Nothing, it's not done yet...

           Evan notices too and grabs it from Reggie's lap. CLOSE ON a 
           rough drawing of the now-famous Snapchat logo of a cartoon 
           ghost with his tongue sticking out. Underneath Reggie has 
           written GHOSTFACE CHILLA. 

                                 REGGIE (CONT’D)
                        It's a ghost, because the pics 
                        disappear...so I thought...I don't 
                        know... 

                                 BOBBY
                        Dude, that is so stupid-

                                 EVAN
                        I love it. That is fucking sick. 

           Reggie lights up, and even Bobby wonders if he's missing 
           something. We begin to get the sense that people trust Evan's 
           taste more than their own. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Dude I have so many more awesome 
                        ideas...
                            (he starts flipping 
                             through the notebook)
                        Like I was thinking, what if there 
                        was a whole family of ghosts -

           Evan cuts him off.

                                 EVAN
                        Picaboo. 
                                 BOBBY
                        What?

                                 REGGIE
                        Like Peak-a-boo, but -

                                 EVAN
                        Picaboo. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That's kind of good. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Fuck yeah, Picaboo! 

           The mood could not be more pumped. Evan turns up the music...

           EXT. EVAN'S ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS (DRIVING)

           PITBULL'S "Give Me Everything" blasting as we get an overhead 
           shot of the Escalade driving down the iconic, palm tree lined 
           University Avenue.

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        Just three bros from an elite 
                        institution developing an app over 
                        the summer. Sound familiar? That's 
                        the whole point! But as they say in 
                        beer pong, we're heatin' up. 

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - PACIFIC PALISADES - DUSK 

           We are treated to the last few seconds of a glorious and 
           average LA sunset. The neon sherbet sky fades to dusk as the 
           Escalade makes a right off PCH into the Pacific Palisades - a 
           ritzy but laid-back neighborhood overlooking the Pacific 
           ocean. LA's version of a beach town.

           The car turns onto a wide suburban street lined with elegant 
           houses verging on estates. We notice the sameness of 
           manicured lawns and artfully placed palm trees in this place 
           where Evan grew up and Stanford's campus.

           The car stops in front of a homey, Spanish-style mansion. 

           INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS 

           Evan looks up at his childhood home through the tinted window 
           as Reggie and Bobby continue to sleep soundly next to him.

           We stay on the house -

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: April, 2007 

           INT. SPIEGEL LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Evan's parents scream in hoarse whispers at each other while 
           their teenage son listens from the top of the stairs, out of 
           sight and supposedly asleep. 

                                 JOHN
                        It's a $75,000 car, Melissa - it's 
                        just too much for a 17-year-old!

                                 MELISSA
                        Oh but building an in-home movie 
                        theater is educational? Give me a 
                        fucking break. You're just mad that 
                        I'm competing at your level now. 

                                 JOHN
                        Do you not get it? He's playing us! 

                                 MELISSA
                        Yeah, and who made him that way? If 
                        you told him no at any point in his 
                        life maybe he wouldn't be 
                        negotiating for crap in the middle 
                        of our divorce.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, so I spoiled him alone? Maybe 
                        if you had spent less time at the 
                        office he wouldn't be so 
                        maladjusted. 
                                 MELISSA
                        You know what - it doesn't matter 
                        whose fault it is. Thank you for 
                        your input, but I will buy our 
                        piece-of-shit son whatever I want, 
                        and we'll see which parent he ends 
                        up living with. 

                                 JOHN
                        Great! I hope he picks you. I don't 
                        need the extra expenses. This 
                        nightmare is costing enough on its 
                        own. 

           Off high-school Evan, his parents' words sinking in, as we 
           begin to swipe through filters and time again -

           INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON present-day Evan, snapping out of it. He looks at 
           Reggie's open, spittle-caked mouth, mid snore. 

                                 EVAN
                        Hey, fuck faces, we're here.

           Off Bobby startled awake, taking in his surroundings like a 
           newborn kitten -

           EXT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - PACIFIC PALISADES - MOMENTS LATER

           The guys, laden with various bags and shit, are greeted by 
           Evan's dad JOHN SPIEGEL (50s), a securities lawyer who looks 
           like every Republican congressman ever.

                                 JOHN
                        Kappa Sig in the hauuus! 

           We catch a slight wince from Evan as John embraces Reggie and 
           Bobby. He gives his son an extra long squeeze. 
                                 EVAN
                        Hi Dad. 

                                 JOHN
                        You guys must be wiped. Come on, 
                        throw that stuff anywhere, Maria 
                        can take it to your rooms later. 

           Reggie doesn't skip a beat. Bobby holds on to his bag. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Thank you so much for letting us 
                        stay here, Mr. Spiegel. 
                            (bashful)
                        My parents told me to thank you as 
                        well. 

                                 JOHN
                        Are you kidding? It is so great to 
                        finally meet the famous Bobby 
                        Murphy! Evan just raves about you. 

                                 EVAN
                        Dad, chill. 

                                 JOHN
                            (squeezing Reggie's arm)
                        What are they feeding you up there? 
                        Bison?

           Reggie glows. 

                                 REGGIE
                        You're looking pretty good yourself 
                        - single life treating you well?

           John laughs too hard at this. We clock the spaces on cabinets 
           and walls where pictures that used to hang have not been 
           replaced. 

                                 JOHN
                        How about some vino. I don't know 
                        if I mentioned, Ev, I installed a 
                        fire pit in the yard. I'll uncork a 
                        '96 Barolo and you guys can tell me 
                        all about this app -

                                 EVAN
                        Actually Dad, I think we're all 
                        pretty tired. Probably just gonna 
                        unpack and pass out.
                                 JOHN 
                            (hiding disappointment)
                        Oh yeah, whatever works. You guys 
                        do your thing, we'll catch up in 
                        the morning. Reg, Bobby - you know 
                        where you're sleeping?

                                 EVAN
                        I'll show 'em. 

                                 JOHN
                        Cool, well, just let me know if you 
                        need anything. This is your house 
                        for the summer. And your office!

                                 REGGIE
                        Office with a pool? Not too shabby. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, thanks again, Mr. Spiegel.

                                 JOHN
                        John, please.

                                 EVAN 
                            (with purpose)
                        Goodnight, John. 

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - PACIFIC PALISADES - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Reggie unpacks in what is obviously a teenage girl's room - 
           pastel pink walls, floral duvet, a framed photo of Evan's 
           little sister CLARA and her friends in soccer uniforms. 

           Evan pokes his head in. 

                                 EVAN
                        Hey man, you good?

                                 REGGIE
                        Oh yeah, this is great, man. 
                        Thanks. 

                                 EVAN
                        I'm sorry about the...pink. Had to 
                        give Bobby the room with a desktop 
                        monitor. Coders..

                                 REGGIE
                        Oh dude, don't even worry. Keep 
                        your engineers happy - Startup 101. 
                        Where's your sister, by the way?
                                 EVAN
                        Mom's for the summer. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Nice, boy's club.

           Evan starts to fidget.  

                                 EVAN
                        Besides, this situation is 
                        temporary. You know, until this 
                        thing takes off...anyway, I'm beat 
                        dude. Probably gonna crash.

                                 REGGIE
                        Yeah for sure. Same. 

           Evan starts to leave...

                                 REGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey Ev...

                                 EVAN
                        What's up?

                                 REGGIE
                        I can’t wait to fucking do this 
                        thing. Picaboo’s gonna be huge. I 
                        can feel it.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah man, me too. 

           He shuts the door on his way out and Reggie falls back on to 
           the shabby chic duvet. His POV of the ceiling reveals a 
           poster of a HALF NAKED JUSTIN BIEBER, plastered directly over 
           the bed, his finger pointing outward towards Reggie. The 
           effect is almost Sistine-esque - 

                                 REGGIE
                        Aw, come on!

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS 

           We move from room to room with ROSA (52), John's live-in 
           maid. The muted sound of a Vitamix blender and Top 40 as she 
           tosses someone's boxer shorts in the laundry room, picks up 
           some empty beer bottles in the living room, and a flask from 
           a ficus in the entryway. Wait, is that...? 

           Rosa pushes the leaves of the ficus back to find a pile of 
           VOMIT behind the plant. She gasps and mutters -

                                 ROSA
                        Mierda! Chicos repugnantes, no 
                        merezco esto... 

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Evan stands in a familiar, accidentally-intimate position 
           behind Bobby, who sits at his laptop. He shuffles between 
           sketches - the earliest iterations of Snapchat - while 
           Bobby's fingers fly on the keyboard, conjuring Evan's vision 
           in 1s and 0s. 

           A quick glimpse of the sketches reveals a mock-up of a user 
           inbox - little red boxes signify an unopened picture-message, 
           a ghost bursting through the box signifies an opened picture-
           message that can no longer be accessed. 

           There is an ease between these two, a real creative 
           partnership. 

                                 EVAN
                        I want the red less saturated, and 
                        more like, faded. Not cherry but 
                        not pink, you know? Like that soft 
                        construction paper from pre-school. 
                        Rich but muted. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Got it. I think. Have you thought 
                        anymore about server space? If this 
                        thing takes off we're not gonna be 
                        equipped for the data influx...

                                 EVAN
                        Cross that bridge when we come to 
                        it. Let's just focus on uploading 
                        to the App Store by end of August -
           He is cut off by a sudden surge in the background noise. The 
           bass shakes the walls. Bobby winces. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Has he sent you any copy for the 
                        uploading process? 

           Evan is silent.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        App description? Privacy policy?

                                 EVAN
                        Not yet.

                                 BOBBY
                        What about a website? 

                                 EVAN
                        What about it?

                                 BOBBY
                        Do we have one?!

                                 EVAN
                        He'll get it done, Bobby. 

           The music surges again. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        For fuck's sake. 

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           CLOSE ON a pair of tiny swim trunks and a lily white 
           plumber's crack. 

           ZOOM OUT on Reggie crouched in front of an expensive 
           entertainment system. He hurriedly turns a knob to fix his 
           mistake.

                                 REGGIE
                            (tipsy)
                        Shittle on my nipple.  

           He retraces a trail of wet footprints from the living room to 
           the backyard...
           EXT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINOUS

           ...And makes a clumsy sprint towards the jacuzzi where John 
           puffs a cigar, droplets clinging to chest hair that has 
           started to go white. Two blended margaritas sit just out of 
           reach of the jets. 

                                 REGGIE
                            (re-entering)
                        You think it'd be too hot for a 
                        jacuzz,' but it's actually perfect. 

           John groans in agreement and sinks deeper into the water.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey, what is this you're playing? 

                                 REGGIE
                        Oh, this is David Guetta. French 
                        DJ. 

                                 JOHN
                        I like it. Very fun. 

                                 REGGIE
                        I'll download it to your iPod 
                        later. You should really get on 
                        Spotify though. 

           John passes the cigar to Reggie who inhales with some pain. 

                                 JOHN
                        I can't keep up with this stuff.

                                 REGGIE
                        You kept up pretty good on Friday 
                        night. 

                                 JOHN
                        Now that was a party.

                                 REGGIE
                        I think I'm still hung over. 

                                 JOHN
                        Ha! Wait 'til you hit 40. 

           Uncomfortable silence. Reggie reaches for his blended and we 
           see a SMALL BAGGIE of white powder propped up against his 
           drink.

                                 REGGIE
                        Speaking of hangovers, you don't 
                        mind if I...
           He gestures towards the baggie. John is taken aback. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh um...no, of course not. Totally 
                        cool by me, just...is it good? I 
                        mean, is it safe?

                                 REGGIE
                        Oh yeah, it's really high quality 
                        stuff. My friend supplies like all 
                        of USC.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh right, excelente. 

           Reggie dries the limestone with his towel and starts to 
           prepare a line. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Hey, you want to do a bump? 

           John looks at the line...

           John, Bobby, Reggie, and Evan are on the outdoor patio at 
           Shutters on the Beach, a swanky hotel that sits directly on 
           the bike path, overlooking the Pacific.

           John lifts a glass of wine and toasts the guys.
                                 JOHN
                        Congratulations, team. I'm really

           The guys raise their glasses. It's slightly half-assed on 
           Bobby and Evan's end. Less so for Reggie who bellows,

                        I hope you don't mind...I had a 
                        little something made to celebrate 
                        the occasion. 

           Evan gives him a look.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What! It's not every day you launch 
                        a company! 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Should I sing? Or..?

                                 EVAN
                        You can just leave it. Thanks. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh come on! Fine, but we're taking 
                        a picture. Behind the cake - like 
                        you actually like each other! A 
                        real smile, Ev! Thank you, Reggie.

           He stands and points his phone. A surprisingly staged photo 
           to commemorate the birth of an app specifically designed to 
           disrupt this kind of posing. Off their deceptive smiles, a 
           misleading and permanent piece of evidence of this moment in 
           time. 
           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           John blasting Springsteen and eating cereal. Is he high? Evan 
           walks in on him.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey, bud. Midnight snack attack?

                                 EVAN
                        No, mind turning that down? Some of 
                        us have work to do in the morning. 

                                 JOHN 
                        Oh, sorry about that. Absolutely 
                        can do. 

           He walks to the fridge and talks into it while he looks for a 
           beer. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You know, Reggie showed me how to 
                        play music in different zones of 
                        the house. I didn't even know we 
                        had zones. He's a real whiz with 
                        that stuff. 

                                 EVAN 
                            (teenage sarcasm)
                        Wow! I bet he could get a job with 
                        the Geek Squad! 

                                 JOHN
                        Hey - what is going on with you? 
                        Thought you'd be happy after the 
                        launch...Is everything alright with 
                        Pikachu? Did you and Bobby have a 
                        fight or something? 

                                 EVAN
                        It's Picaboo...like Peak-a-boo...
                            (giving up)
                        What's going on with me? What's 
                        going on with you? Spending all 
                        your time with a 21-year-old, who 
                        is supposed to be working for me by 
                        the way, and getting loaded at our 
                        parties like some sort of creepy 
                        uncle no one invited. It's 
                        embarrassing. 

                                 JOHN
                        Woah, woah - where is this coming 
                        from? Did someone tell you I made 
                        them uncomfortable? 
                                 EVAN
                        Nobody had to. But just so there's 
                        no confusion - you're making me 
                        uncomfortable. 

                                 JOHN
                        I see, so I'm just supposed to 
                        supply the roof over your head, the 
                        booze, the WiFi, and stay out of 
                        the way. 

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, exactly - like a normal 
                        parent. 

           John laughs. 

                                 JOHN
                        Normal, that's good.

           No turning back now. These next words drip with the kind of 
           insightful malice that plays in your head on repeat while 
           you're trying to fall asleep at night. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Be honest, John. You love having us 
                        here. What good is all your money 
                        with no one to spend it on? You 
                        needed a distraction from your sad, 
                        middle-aged life and we gave you 
                        one. So don't act like you're doing 
                        me some big favor. 

           A beat.

                                 JOHN
                        How much do you think I've invested 
                        in this half-baked joke of a 
                        company? 10K? 20k? I may be a 
                        failed parent but here's a little 
                        business advice from the man who 
                        paid for the shirt on your back and 
                        your shiny new MacBook - if you 
                        really want this app to succeed, 
                        don't alienate your first and only 
                        investor. 

           He turns to walk out of the kitchen but remembers something -

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Also, your mother and I discussed 
                        it - you graduate or you're cut 
                        off. 
           EXT. OAK CREEK APARTMENTS - OFF STANFORD CAMPUS - DAY 

           Evan's Escalade pulls into the parking lot of a brown, boring 
           apartment complex directly off of campus proper - home to PhD 
           students, families, and a few unlucky undergrads.

                                 REGGIE (O.C.)
                        So yeah, anyway, like I was saying,  
                        sex sells. It's kind of the whole 
                        point of Mad Men.

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: Palo Alto

           SWIPE! 

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: September 20th, 2011 

                                 REGGIE (V.O.)
                        Shit, I gotta piss. 

           Reggie exits the car and stretches. 

           INT. OAK CREEK APARTMENTS  - CONTINUOUS 

           Evan enters a two room apartment with a small kitchen, pre-
           furnished with an ugly green couch. Reggie follows closely 
           behind. 

                                 REGGIE
                        More like shit's creek. At least 
                        most of the guys are on the same 
                        floor. Hey, how long do you think 
                        the university can keep us off 
                        campus? I mean, we have rights too, 
                        right? 

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        Oh I forgot to mention because I 
                        really don't care - Kappa Sig lost 
                        their housing for violating the 
                        University's Controlled Substances 
                        and Alcohol Policy. 

           Evan doesn't answer and moves into his bedroom. A depressing 
           stained carpet and one of those sliding mirror door closets.

           CLOSE ON his text conversation with Bobby. He sends - 

           This doesn't change anything. As soon as our numbers pick up 
           I'm out of here. 
           He gets a NOTIFICATION - Bobby has sent him a Picaboo, or 
           what we would call a "Snap" today (the two have been 
           communicating through the app as a means of de-bugging and 
           beta-testing. Also it's more fun than texting). 

           He opens the app and a SELFIE of Bobby appears, captioned: 

           Only a matter of time, bro. 

           Evan smiles.

           INT. OAK CREEK APARTMENTS  - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           STAMPEDE RUMBLINGS as SHIRTLESS KAPPA SIGS tear through the 
           hallway of the building. They bang on doors and loose 
           inspiring battle cries such as "NIPS OUT OR CLITS OUT." A 
           concerned Indian woman pokes her head out of her door.

           INT. OAK CREEK APARTMENTS - EVAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Reggie, now also shirtless, hangs off of Evan's door frame - 

                                 REGGIE
                        Spiegs - Theta's hosting a Slip n' 
                        Slide in the Cowell Cluster. 
                            (when Evan doesn't react)
                        Move dude! 

           He nods weakly.

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah man. Meet you there. 

           Reggie joins the herd and Evan shuts his door. He runs a hand 
           through his hair and sighs heavily. He's not going anywhere. 
           He's already elsewhere.

           BEGIN MINI MONTAGE - BEGIN MUSIC - A STRING QUARTET VERSION 
           OF ASHER ROTHER'S "I LOVE COLLEGE"

           Evan goes to his desk and opens his laptop. 

           CLOSE ON a blank draft of an email addressed to 
           BRANDON.WERNER@BROBIBLE, subject RIDICULOUS IPHONE APP. 

           We stay with the blinking cursor before - a torrent of words 
           that we track across the screen. The following message forms:
           I've been reading this site for a while (certified bro - our 
           fraternity got kicked off last quarter) and I thought you 
           might want to check out the iPhone app I built this summer.

           SWIPE! 

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: THE FAST-FORWARD RABBIT X 2 

           Evan's fall quarter goes by in hyper-speed, interspersed with 
           a series of emails that he's writing.

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        Brace yourselves for the douchiest, 
                        frattiest attempted app launch in 
                        modern history. Perhaps the birth 
                        of brogramming as we know it. 

           -Reggie installs a stripper pole in the middle of their 
           apartment.

           -Evan types an email: They have until the timer is up to view 
           it - then it disappears forever. Fun shit. 

           -Fast forward through debauched vignettes in Reggie and 
           Evan's living room. Cocaine, girls hanging off of the 
           stripper pole, selfie-ing via Snapchat, etc. Bobby pops in 
           every once and a while. Someone has written "STARTUPHAU5" on 
           the wall. The chaos happens around Evan, who remains glued to 
           his laptop. 

           -Evan writes a new email addressed to NJAMES@MTV.COM, subject 
           YO GURL, HERE'S AN IPHONE APP I THINK YOU'D LOVE...

           -Evan types: Gotta try it to love it. You can share anything 
           if it isn't saved forever...inside jokes w/ ur girlfriends, 
           "does my ass look fat in this dress," etc. 

           -Evan sits on his bed and drinks a Redbull. 

           -He opens a JPG file on his desktop - one of the pictures of 
           Ashleigh in the yellow bikini from Reggie's photo shoot. 

           -Evan types: The girl who modeled in our iTunes screenshots 
           is a USC Kappa. AKA super hot. Itunes.com/apps/picaboo. 

           -CLOSE ON the analytics app - a flat line that shows no user 
           growth in October. 
           -Evan paces back and forth in his room. 

           -CLOSE ON his phone - 5 missed calls from Bobby. 

           -Evan writes a new email addressed to GPARK@REDBULLNET.COM. 

           He types: If you want any more info - hit me up. We're trying 
           to get the word out. Hope you're good bro. 

           He deletes that last sentence. Instead writes:

           Proof attached. 

           Evan attaches the picture to the email. 

           The cursor blinks. 

           -CLOSE ON a new PICABOO from Bobby, holding his hand up to 
           his head like a gun: 

           Down 100 users as of Nov 20. 

           -With a slight tremor in his hand, maybe from anxiety or 
           energy drinks or both, Evan hits send. Hard. 

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        Aw poor bb, it's not that fun 
                        building an app, is it? Don't worry 
                        Evan, it gets better.
                            (beat)
                        Or maybe this is the fun part. 

           END MUSIC - END MONTAGE

           EXT. MEMORIAL CHURCH - STANFORD CAMPUS - NIGHT

           Evan and Bobby sit on the steps outside the church.

                                 BOBBY
                        It's been a month. 

                                 EVAN
                        I know how long it's been. We built 
                        it. They will come. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I read today that there is some 
                        precedent for a laggy portal 
                        through Apple. I think we should 
                        spring for an external analytics 
                        program.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        How are we going to lay out a 
                        roadmap for marketing spend and 
                        product prioritization to potential 
                        investors if our data isn't good? 

                                 EVAN
                        You're spiraling, man. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah dude! I fucking am spiraling! 
                        I graduated last year and I'm still 
                        hanging around here waiting for 
                        something to happen. If this 
                        doesn't get traction soon...not all 
                        of us have rich parents to bail us 
                        out, Evan. I need a real job. 

                                 EVAN
                        This is real. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, so are my student loans. 

                                 EVAN
                        I hear you, I do. But it hasn't 
                        been enough time to jump ship. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah? How do you figure? Because 
                        I've done the research and the 
                        three most successful apps of the 
                        past five years all boasted 2,000 
                        or more users by the end of the 
                        first month online. That's a pretty 
                        simple scatter plot, even for a 
                        product design major. 

                                 EVAN
                        No, fuck that. This isn't Angry 
                        Birds or another Ride Share Fluff 
                        n' Fold whatever the fuck...it's 
                        not even on the same graph. 
                            (a beat)
                        Give it one more month and if 
                        nothing changes, you have my 
                        blessing to take a job anywhere you 
                        want. 

           Bobby chews the inside of his mouth and thinks. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I don't need your blessing.
                                 EVAN
                        You're right. But if you quit now 
                        you will regret it.

                                 BOBBY
                        If I quit now you will regret it. 
                        You can't keep the app running 
                        without me. 

                                 EVAN 
                        That too. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Fine. One more month. Then I'm 
                        selling out to Palantir. 

                                 EVAN
                        Yes! Yes. Thank you.  

           He checks the time on his phone. 11:59 turns to 12:00 AM. He 
           howls into the night and after a few seconds, other howls 
           across campus join him. The eerie finals week tradition known 
           as "primal scream." Bobby shakes his head but eventually 
           joins in the catharsis.

           EXT. CALIFORNIA CRAFTSMAN HOUSE - STANFORD FACULTY GHETTO - 
           NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           A wooded, residential neighborhood on campus where Stanford's 
           more esteemed faculty members live with their families. 

           EXT. CALIFORNIA CRAFTSMAN - CONTINUOUS 

           CLOSE ON an open hand banging on the front door. 

                                 EVAN
                        Professor Kent! I need to talk to 
                        you! Richard! I know you're in 
                        there!

           Continued banging until a startled PROFESSOR KENT opens the 
           door. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT 
                        Evan? Is everything alright?

           He joins him on the porch, shutting the door behind him. 

                                 EVAN
                        I need to talk to you. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT 
                        What happened? Is it an emergency?
                                 EVAN
                        Yes! Nobody is using Picaboo! 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        What?

                                 EVAN
                        My app! My app is failing and I 
                        don't know why. I've done 
                        everything-

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Evan, you can't just show up at my 
                        house...how did you get my address? 
                        Did someone from the university 
                        give you my home address? 

                                 EVAN
                        No, I bribed a volunteer at the 
                        alumni center, but that doesn't 
                        matter now...Please, PROFESSOR 
                        KENT. You're my mentor. I need 
                        mentoring. 

           Off Kent beginning to relent. Something about Evan's deeply-
           felt desperation moves and worries him...

           INT. LIVING ROOM, KENT HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Evan and PROFESSOR KENT sit in the living room. Someone has 
           made Evan a cup of tea that he won't touch. 

                                 EVAN
                        It's not fair. I'm busting my ass - 
                        working harder than I've ever 
                        worked on anything before. 
                        Literally! I literally don't do 
                        anything else.

           Kent chuckles.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        This isn't funny, Richard. This is 
                        my life. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Nobody's life is defined by one 
                        failure. Or one success for that 
                        matter.  

                                 EVAN
                        Bullshit. 
           Kent raises a cautionary eyebrow.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Lack of user engagement is still 
                        user input.

                                 EVAN
                        Maybe it's like the iPad. Nobody 
                        wanted the iPad before it was 
                        released. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Nobody knew they wanted the iPad. 
                        Apple told us what we wanted. A 
                        product so intuitive that it didn't 
                        just fill a hole in the market, it 
                        created one. 

                                 EVAN
                        Ok, so why can't Picaboo do that? 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT 
                            (shrugging)
                        If it were easy, we'd all be 
                        billionaires. 

                                 EVAN
                        Fuck.

           He looks like he might cry. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT 
                            (softer)
                        I'm curious..you've given up on 
                        projects before..why are you so 
                        convinced that this one is 
                        different? Do you really believe in 
                        the app or is it that you, Evan, 
                        need a win? 

                                 EVAN
                        Nobody from where I'm from needs a 
                        win. I'm frustrated because I have 
                        the next Facebook and Twitter 
                        combined sitting on my phone and so 
                        far I'm the only person who's using 
                        it!

           Something occurs to Kent. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        The McDonald's Arch Deluxe. 
                                 EVAN
                        Hm?

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Do you remember the McDonald's Arch 
                        Deluxe? 
                            (sotto)
                        No, of course not, you were six at 
                        the time. 

           He gets up.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT (CONT’D)
                        I made a lesson plan years ago, 
                        bear with me...

           Kent wanders into another room. Evan sighs and follows.

           INT. KENT'S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Indecipherable grumbling as Kent rifles through old-fashioned 
           filing cabinets and desk drawers stuffed to the brim with 
           papers. 

                                 EVAN
                        I should probably head home. I 
                        think I have a midterm tomorrow...

           Kent unearths a yellowed piece of paper with type-written 
           print like it's Excalibur. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        A-ha! 
                            (reading)
                        "The McDonald's Arch Deluxe was 
                        intended to appeal to 'urban 
                        sophisticates' — a group outside of 
                        its target demographic." It's still 
                        one of most expensive product flops 
                        in history. 

                                 EVAN
                        So? What does fast food have to do 
                        with Picaboo?  

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        In 1996, an urban sophisticate was 
                        in their late 20s to early 40s.  
                        Mickey D's learned the hard way 
                        that the average consumer in this 
                        age bracket was too old to 
                        deconstruct one of the strongest 
                        brand identities in the world.

                        100 million dollars in billboards 
                        and commercials didn't stop product 
                        from flopping because they were 
                        targeting the wrong demo. You're 
                        trying to sell the Arch Deluxe to 
                        people who are already addicted to 
                        fast food, when you should really 
                        be looking for the population 
                        members who have yet to taste 
                        McDonalds!

           A beat as Evan stares blankly at the professor, helplessly 
           confused... 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT (CONT’D)

           SWIPE!

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: Los Angeles

           We watch the telecast of the MACY'S THANKSGIVING DAY PARADE  
           on a small flat screen over the shoulder of a maid washing 
           dishes.

           INT. EVAN'S MOM'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The clamor of extended family around a Martha Stewarty 
           Thanksgiving spread. This includes Evan's mom, Melissa, her 
           second husband, AVERY AARONSON (60s), Evan's younger sister, 
           CLARA SPIEGEL (13), and a smattering of aunts, uncles, 
           grandparents, and cousins tearing into the spoil of trans 
           fats. 

           The only person you have to know is Evan and Clara's first 
           cousin, LESLIE BRIAN (12) - skinny, freckled, and snub-nosed. 
           Clara and Leslie sit next to each other at one end of the 
           table, totally absorbed in their iPhone 4s's, giggling to 
           themselves and comparing screens. 

                                 AVERY
                        I'm just saying, they can "occupy" 
                        all they want, but let's not 
                        pretend they're accomplishing 
                        anything. 

                                 CLARA
                            (re: someone on phone)
                        Oh my god, she is so annoying.

                                 LESLIE
                        Why does she always wear those 
                        shoes? Does she have any other 
                        shoes?

                                 CLARA
                        Oh my god, comment that. I dare 
                        you. 

           Clara goes to take her phone...

                                 LESLIE
                        Stop! I'll get expelled for cyber-
                        bullying like Megha Kalani!

           Fits of giggles. Evan looks at them, eavesdropping. 

                                 AUNT NANCY
                        Leslie, I said no screens at the

                        the worst global recession in

                        Nancy. Phones away. Now. 

           Leslie screams. 

                                 LESLIE
                        Oh my god, she deleted her post!
                                 MELISSA 
                        Girls, please, it's Thanksgiving. 

                                 CLARA 
                            (to Leslie)
                        Go to Dylan's page - do you think 
                        he knows? Should we text him?

                                 AVERY
                            (to Evan)
                        So, Ev - I-banking sound more 
                        appealing now that graduation is 
                        approaching? 

           Melissa rolls her eyes theatrically. 

                                 MELISSA
                        Nothing with any amount of 
                        financial security is interesting 
                        to my son.  

                                 AVERY
                        You still working on that start up 
                        - Fresh Future? What was the name 
                        of that thing?

                                 EVAN
                        No, actually, uh, we decided to 
                        refocus...

                                 MELISSA 
                        It failed. I told you prospective 
                        college students wouldn't have time 
                        for an app, but what do I know?

                                 EVAN
                        I just launched a new app, 
                        actually. Anyone can download it 
                        directly from the iTunes store on 
                        and we're in the process of growing 
                        it into a full-fledged company.

                                 AVERY
                        I see. Do you have investors yet?

                                 EVAN 
                            (convincingly bluffing)
                        There's a lot of interest, we're 
                        just trying to find the right 
                        partners.

                                 MELISSA

                             the table, mockingly)

                        He thinks he's going to be the next 
                        Steve Jobs. 

                                 AUNT NANCY
                        I was just reading about his 
                        cancer. I'm sorry, but what kind of 
                        genius doesn't believe in 
                        chemotherapy?
                            (she shakes her head)
                        Leslie, that's it. Put it away or 
                        give it to me. 

                                 LESLIE
                        Not fair! Why doesn't Clara have 
                        to?

                                 GRANDPARENT
                        Law and Medicine. Everything else 
                        is rolling the dice.

                                 MELISSA
                        Clara, last chance. Phone away or I 
                        swear to God you're not leaving the 
                        house this weekend.
                            (to Nancy)
                        How old was he? 

                                 CLARA
                            (to Leslie, under her 
                             breath)
                        Bitch. 

                                 EVAN
                        56. He was 56. That's your age, 
                        right mom? Mind passing the yams, 
                        Grandpa?

           Awkward silence.

           INT. CLARA'S ROOM - LATER

           Clara and Leslie take selfies on Clara's bed. Evan enters.

                                 CLARA
                        Um, get out! 

                                 EVAN
                        I need a favor. 

                                 CLARA
                        Nope. 
                                 EVAN
                        I need you to download my app. 
                        It'll be cool. You guys can be like 
                        my official beta-testers. 

                                 LESLIE
                        What is it?

                                 EVAN
                        Search "Picaboo."

                                 CLARA
                        Dumb name. 

           Evan walks over to her dresser, and picks up an old photo of 
           Clara and her friends wearing an array of animal ears and 
           whiskers. 

                                 EVAN
                        So, earlier, when you guys were 
                        stalking that girl on Instagram - 
                        what if you could say anything you 
                        want to each other, or that 
                        guy...Dylan? Except unlike all your 
                        other apps, there's absolutely no 
                        record of it.

           They're listening.

                                 CLARA
                        How is that even possible? 

                                 EVAN
                        Because you can caption or draw on 
                        the photos...and then all of the 
                        photos disappear after you send 
                        them. 

                                 LESLIE
                        So like, my mom couldn't go through 
                        my phone and see anything I've 
                        posted?

                                 EVAN
                        There is no posting. Just click and 
                        send. Totally untraceable. You 
                        could probably even get away with 
                        it in class.

           Clara and Leslie look at each other. 

                                 CLARA
                        How do we get it?
           Leslie is way ahead of her. Looking down at her phone -

                                 LESLIE
                        Done. 

           CLOSE ON Leslie's home phone screen - the Picaboo icon pops 
           is in the process of downloading from the app store. 

                                 LILY  (V.O)
                        Ok, I know it's scientifically 
                        proven that women are better 
                        empathizers than men, but that took 
                        him forever to figure out. Teenage 
                        girl might as well be a synonym for 
                        first-adopter.

           The app finishes downloading with a "DING" noise.

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        But to his credit, he got there 
                        eventually. 

           Leslie opens it and we...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BEGIN MONTAGE - BEGIN MUSIC - FOSTER THE PEOPLE'S "PUMPED UP 
           KICKS"

           MONTAGE of Picaboo spreading like wildfire throughout the 
           middle school circuit of Southern California. We follow a 
           rapid volley of tween snaps (mostly funny faces with silly 
           neon drawings), while faceless teachers drone on in the 
           background of classrooms, powerless to stop the onslaught of 
           images that have already disappeared by the time they demand 
           to see proof.

           -We're in the hallways of a RITZY MIDDLE SCHOOL in Laguna 
           Beach where Leslie is a student. She stands in a huddle of 
           6th graders in their hoodies and plaid skirts, showing them 
           the earliest version of Picaboo on her phone. 

           -The kids send Picaboos to each other in class. Leslie 
           decorates a selfie with the paint tool, scratching out her 
           eyes and writing "so bored" and sends it to user "Clara B..."

           -Who opens the picture message on a well-manicured lawn at 
           her RITZY LA PRIVATE SCHOOL (think Harvard-Westlake). She 
           laughs and shows a friend... 

           -Who later takes a picture of her heavy-set teacher, 
           scribbling "diet much?" and sends it to a boy a few seats 
           away from her.
           -He opens it, stifles laughter. Takes a selfie and sends it 
           to...

           -A girl at another LA school. Who sends a Picaboo to someone 
           else. And so on and so on.  

           This e-flurry continues until we land in the Picaboo app on 
           an UNKNOWN GIRL'S phone. We stay with her, camera on her 
           phone screen, out of the front doors to the school and down 
           to the carpool line of luxury vehicles.

           She climbs in to a Mercedes SUV and the music stops abruptly. 
           Her mom, JAMIE ALTER LYNTON (early 50s), relaxed but 
           expensive style, short hair with subtle highlights - not your 
           typical LA yoga-mom - finishes a phone call on her bluetooth 
           earpiece.

                                 JAMIE
                        Sammy just got in the car. Yeah ok, 
                        call you later.
                            (she hangs up, to Sammy)
                        Hey baby! How was your day? 

           INT. STANFORD CLASSROOM - DAY 

           Evan's attention drifts in class and he opens the ANALYTICS 
           APP on his laptop. 

                                 EVAN
                        Holy fuck.

           The class comes to standstill, Professor and students 
           staring. His phone starts ringing - it's BOBBY CELL. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. I uh, I have to take this.

           EXT. STANFORD CAMPUS - DAY - ON FOOT

           As he exits the building...

                                 EVAN
                        I saw. Catching the next flight to 
                        LA. 

           He laughs.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, you're about to love me a lot 
                        more. 
           They hang up and Evan breathes heavily in front of The Claw, 
           an aptly named, sinister fountain in Stanford's White Plaza 
           at odds with the sun-baked sandstone and swaying palms.

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        Stanford. I was in total awe the 
                        first time I visited campus. It 
                        looked like a luxury resort 
                        dedicated to the pursuit of 
                        knowledge. Now I think it looks 
                        like a gigantic Mexican Restaurant. 

           Evan takes in the students reading on the grass, people 
           heading to and from class, and visitors on campus tours, as 
           if he knows he's saying goodbye for a long time, before 
           screaming...

                                 EVAN
                        YES! YES YES YES. I AM AMAZING!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. HOLMBY HILLS MANSION - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           A rambling estate in the lush neighborhood between Westwood 
           and Beverly Hills that makes Evan's childhood home look like 
           an RV.

           INT. HOLMBY HILLS MANSION - BATHROOM/BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jamie gets ready for bed at her bathroom sink (white marble, 
           La Mer products, etc. - you've seen this in a movie before). 

           Her husband, MICHAEL LYNTON (50s) - naturally tan, silver-
           haired, slight but toned.

           He reads a professionally-bound screenplay in bed. We catch 
           the COLUMBIA PICTURES logo on the spine of the script.

                                 JAMIE
                        So, you know how we've been talking 
                        about investing in tech...  

                                 MICHAEL
                            (still reading)
                        Mhm.

                                 JAMIE
                        Well, I think I found our in. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Look at you, venture capitalist.
           Jamie walks into the bedroom and joins him under the covers. 

                                 JAMIE
                        You joke, but after years of 
                        stalking our children online, I am 
                        an expert.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What a good mom. 

                                 JAMIE
                        So anyway, we're at pick-up today 
                        and I ask Sammy about her day and 
                        all she can talk about is this app. 
                        Everyone's doing it, so cool, blah 
                        blah - not a word about her history 
                        project or swim team or any of the 
                        other crap we pay for. Just 
                        Picaboo. 

                                 MICHAEL
                            (not really listening)
                        Uh huh.

                                 JAMIE
                        So I look it up online - no 
                        website, no parent company, no 
                        nothing. Weird, right? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, sounds like a company that we 
                        shouldn't be investing in.  

           She hits him. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Ok, go forth and conquer, just 
                        promise you'll talk to me before 
                        cutting any big checks. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Good, because I already sent them 
                        an email.

           This gets his attention.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What did you say?

                                 JAMIE
                        I said me and my husband, the 
                        chairman and chief executive of 
                        Sony Pictures, are interested in 
                        investing in your company. 
           She kisses him on the cheek and settles in for sleep. 

           EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB - MALIBU - ESTABLISHING BEL AIR BAY 
           CLUB

           The Los Angeles version of a country club - a private, 
           historic estate on PCH with an annual membership fee of 
           $80,000. $85,000 if you want your own cabana. 

           EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB - SEASIDE PADDLE TENNIS COURTS 

           Evan and Reggie, barefoot in the sand on opposite sides of a 
           net. They play a half-assed game of a fake sport, Reggie with 
           Margarita in hand. He stares at the ocean -- 

                                 REGGIE
                        Man, this view never gets old. 

           Evan serves. Reggie realizes too late and his swing misses 
           the ball entirely. It lands with a satisfying thud in the 
           sand. 

                                 REGGIE (CONT’D)
                        Such a bummer that Bobbo had to 
                        stay cooped up at Casa Spiegs. I 
                        know it's a good thing that our 
                        traffic is insane, but I don't know 
                        man, I think he's gonna crack. 

           He serves. Evan returns into the net.

                                 EVAN
                        He'll survive. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Have you noticed his hair? It's 
                        like wet...from not showering. Have 
                        you thought at all about expanding 
                        the team?

                                 EVAN
                        No Reg, the thought hasn't even 
                        crossed my mind.

           Reggie straightens from his serve-receive stance.

                                 REGGIE
                        Wait...are you like, pissed at me 
                        or something? 
                                 EVAN
                        No, I'm just - stressed about this 
                        next step. I need to be on top of 
                        my game.

           He angrily serves another ball into the net. 

                                 REGGIE
                        What does that mean, "next step?"

                                 EVAN
                        Look, I didn't want to say anything 
                        until it's official, but my dad set 
                        up some meetings for us at VC 
                        firms. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Are you serious? Where? Does this 
                        mean we're finally getting rich?! 

                                 EVAN 
                            (pumping the brakes)
                        I don't know how much we'll get, 
                        but first thing we have to do is 
                        buy more servers so our shit stops 
                        crashing. And then we have to hire 
                        some engineers so Bobby can shower. 

                                 REGGIE
                        But then we'll get paid?

           A beat. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Yeah, then we'll get paid. 

           Reggie starts air humping his tiny racket. 

                                 REGGIE
                        I can't believe it, man. It's all 
                        happening. Do you think we'll get 
                        written up in Techcrunch? This girl 
                        I've been trying to fuck since 
                        Freshman year only dates successful 
                        tech founders.

           Evan registers this with some surprise. He takes a moment to 
           recover.

                                 EVAN
                        I don't know. Maybe. Hey, what 
                        happened with that thing I asked 
                        you to do last week? 
                                 REGGIE
                        Smoke outside?

                                 EVAN
                        No dude, the analysis of our user 
                        feedback. 

                                 REGGIE
                        Oh, yeah, should have that for you 
                        sometime tomorrow. I'm just 
                        formatting, et cetera. 

           He serves the ball back on to Evan's side of the net, who 
           doesn't move to return it. 

                                 EVAN
                        I needed that last week, Reggie.  

                                 REGGIE
                        No, yeah, I know, I'm sorry, man, I 
                        just had to take Incompletes in all 
                        my classes last quarter so I was 
                        doing all that stuff, but I'm gonna 
                        be totally focused on Picaboo from 
                        now on. Besides, it's mostly spam 
                        and a bunch of teenagers 
                        complaining that its laggy and 
                        crashes all the time, which'll get 
                        fixed with our new servers, right? 

           Reggie's phone makes a sound. A beat while he checks it. 

                                 EVAN
                        What is it? Are we getting a lot of 
                        emails? 

                                 REGGIE
                        Just another weirdo asking us to 
                        co-finance a diamond mine in 
                        Uganda.  Delete.

                                 EVAN
                        You answer all of our emails, 
                        right? The real ones?

                                 REGGIE
                        Yes dude, of course. 
                            (re: paddle tennis)
                        Are we keeping score? I forget 
                        who's winning. 
           Reggie takes a sip of his Margarita and starts bouncing the 
           ball up and down on his racket, looking a little like a seal 
           performing for a treat. Off of Evan, a disquieting thought 
           bubbling...

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Quick beat of Reggie watching Dancing with the Stars in the 
           living room with John. 

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - EVAN'S ROOM - CONT.

           We click through un-read customer service EMAILS with him 
           from the account Reggie supposedly manages. Bobby enters.

                                 BOBBY
                        You still working?

                                 EVAN
                        Not really. Trying to find this 
                        email...

                                 BOBBY
                        What email? 

                                 EVAN
                        I don't know, probably spam, I 
                        think Reggie deleted it. Fuck man, 
                        his trash is full of hundreds of 
                        un-read messages. 

           They scroll through. It's tedious and boring.

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        I could make you sit here and watch 
                        them do this, but I'll spare you.

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: THE FAST-FORWARD RABBIT X 1

           We fast forward through the guys scrolling while Lily  
           explains -

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        How long can you really stare at a 
                        screen, right? Long story short, 
                        the guys who started a disappearing 
                        messaging service almost went under 
                        because of a deleted email. Sort of 
                        ironic, actually.

           Time resumes its normal speed. Evan and Bobby are now 
           standing. 
           Evan gestures toward Jamie's email -

                                 EVAN
                        Do you know what this means? 

                                 BOBBY
                            (confused)
                        We're gonna be movie stars?

                                 EVAN
                        He fucked us. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Michael Lynton?

                                 EVAN
                        Reggie! He deleted this...he...I'm 
                        going to shit a brick.

                                 BOBBY
                        I know, dude. We gotta talk to him.

           Evan bites his lip. 

                                 EVAN
                        Not yet. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I know you two are close, but this 
                        is bigger than Kappa Sig now...

                                 EVAN
                        It's not that...I just can't have 
                        any distractions while I prep for 
                        these meetings. Maybe from here on 
                        out, we just don't mention anything 
                        to him. Keep him at arm's length 
                        until we come up with a plan. 

                                 BOBBY 
                        Yeah, ok. I can do that. It's not 
                        like he'll notice if we go to 
                        meetings without him. But at some 
                        point -

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah. I know. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Ok, I'm gonna go try to get us back 
                        online in Sweden. No idea why, but 
                        the Svedes love us. 
                                 EVAN
                        Hey Bobbo - don't mention this to 
                        my Dad, either. I want to be the 
                        one to tell him.

           Bobby plays it cool. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, sure dude. Of course. 

           Off Evan, deep in thought...

           INT. SPIEGEL HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Evan checks his reflection in the entryway mirror on his way 
           out of the house. John finds him. 

                                 JOHN
                        There you are. Thought we could do 
                        some prep for Icon Ventures on 
                        Thursday - their portfolio is heavy 
                        on communication platforms so we 
                        should lean heavy on the chat 
                        function - 

                                 EVAN
                        Can't. Going out. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yeah? Got a hot date? 

                                 EVAN
                        Meeting. 

                                 JOHN
                        What meeting? Regarding Picaboo? 

                                 EVAN
                        I'll loop you in when appropriate.

                                 JOHN
                        What the hell does that mean? 

                                 EVAN
                        It means you are not the only one 
                        who can book meetings. 

                                 JOHN
                        Evan, you can't meet investors 
                        without me. You have no fucking 
                        clue...Do Bobby and Reggie know 
                        where you're going? 
                                 EVAN
                        Bobby needs to focus on keeping us 
                        online - our servers are totally 
                        overwhelmed because you can't 
                        finance new ones. And 
                        Reggie...well, Reggie's busy being 
                        your favorite son. 

                                 JOHN 
                            (wounded)
                        Maybe I don't always get it right, 
                        but I am really trying here.  It's 
                        not easy to toe the line between 
                        dad and investor, you know, but the 
                        bottom line is I want to help you, 
                        and not just with the money. I 
                        would buy you all the servers in 
                        the world if I could...it just, it 
                        wouldn't be smart. Nobody has that 
                        kind of money, Ev. 

                                 EVAN
                        Some people do. I'm going to be 
                        late. 

           Evan exits.   

           EXT. LYNTON'S DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 

           Evan rolls down his window to ring the call-button outside of 
           a wrought-iron gate. He sees a camera swivel towards his car. 
           A beat and the gate swings opens.

           He drives up the winding driveway, clocking the size of the 
           estate as he goes. Is that a vineyard? Hard to tell in the 
           dark, but probably. 

           INT. LYNTON FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           A maid lets Evan into a Goopy foyer. He is bum-rushed by two 
           untrained and overweight golden retrievers.

           Jamie enters - 

                                 JAMIE
                        Gouda! Brie! Down! Heel! Heel!
                            (to Evan)
                        I'm sorry - thousands of dollars to 
                        a Tibetan monk and they still lose 
                        it when the doorbell rings. Hi hi 
                        hi, come on in. 
           INT. LYNTON DINING ROOM - LATER

           Jamie, Michael, and Evan mid-meal. 

                                 JAMIE
                        I love how it opens as a camera. No 
                        login, no homepage - just, bam, 
                        camera, ready to...

           Jamie searches for the right word.

                                 JAMIE (CONT’D)
                        ...Snap! It's genius.

                                 EVAN
                            (finally, somebody gets 
                             it)
                        Exactly! Thank you. I wanted it to 
                        feel like you're not using an app 
                        anymore or even your phone - just 
                        pure creative impulse. 

                                 JAMIE
                        Right, let kids be kids, you know? 
                        Remind me, you went to...

                                 EVAN
                        Crossroads.

                                 JAMIE
                        Ah, we thought about Crossroads, 
                        but wound up at Brentwood in the 
                        end. Right hun?

           She kicks Michael under the table.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, we decided that we'd rather 
                        our kids have anxiety issues than 
                        drug problems. 

           Tense laughter. 

                                 EVAN
                        So yeah, I like to describe Picaboo 
                        as the anti-social media social 
                        media -

                                 MICHAEL
                        Honestly, I don't care about that 
                        crap. The philosophy, the buzzwords 
                        - that's Jamie's thing. I want to 
                        hear about the numbers. 
                                 EVAN
                        Absolutely. Sure. 

           Evan pulls out his phone and starts to fumble with it. He's 
           tweaking. Michael starts to notice and gives Jamie a look.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, can I use your restroom? 

                                 JAMIE
                        Of course. Second door on your 
                        right. 

           He leaves the dining room. 

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Evan paces. Splashes water on his flushed face. He sits down 
           on the toilet seat and takes a breath. With shaking hands he 
           inexpertly navigates his own email on his phone to find the 
           analytics he was looking for. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        It is so deeply satisfying to see 
                        this guy sweat. At least for me. 
                        Like, why is this taking so long? 
                        Did he really not prepare for this? 
                        It's the whole point of the meeting 
                        -

           Another deep breath. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I think he's hyperventilating...

           Evan stands. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh, look at that, the phoenix has 
                        risen. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Evan re-enters and remains standing -

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where were we -

                                 EVAN
                        The numbers. 
           He hands Michael his phone. Michael studies. Brow furrowed, 
           silent. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        If you swipe right, you'll see a 
                        comparison to our major 
                        competitors. 

           He studies these for just long enough. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                            (eyes bugging and gears 
                             turning)
                        Wait...this is over what period of 
                        time?

           Off Jamie's self-satisfied, smug expression. 

                                                          HARD CUT TO:

           INT. COOL OFFICE 1 - DAY

           Evan, Bobby, and Michael meet with 3 suits from a VC firm, 
           Crosslink Capital. 

                                 SUIT 1 
                        You guys might be too young to 
                        remember this, but Amazon started 
                        as an online bookstore. And now 
                        it's the fourth most valuable 
                        public company in the world.  

                                 SUIT 2
                        Right, it's all about establishing 
                        a user base - eyeballs on the 
                        product. And you guys have the 
                        eyeballs. 

                                 SUIT 3
                        We just want to help you diversify.

                                 SUIT 1
                        Re-direct the eyeballs over time in 
                        whatever direction you want to 
                        point them.

           INT. COOL OFFICE 2 

           The guys sit down with another firm.
                                 EVAN
                        As I'm sure you know, Amazon 
                        started as an online bookstore. But 
                        their user base was so big it 
                        opened up all these doors. Snapchat 
                        is a simple messaging concept now, 
                        but it will be so much more.

           Michael smiles, Bobby is confused...

                                 SUIT  
                        We completely agree. Have you guys 
                        ever thought about content 
                        creation?

           INT. COOL OFFICE 3

           Yet more suits.

                                 SUIT
                        What would you say your biggest 
                        goal for the company is?

                                 EVAN
                        Content creation, no question.

           Bobby looks on, incredulous. 

                                 SUIT
                        Awesome. And just out of curiosity, 
                        how do you feel about mobile 
                        payment services?

           INT. COOL OFFICE 4 

                                 SUIT
                        Any last questions for us, guys?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, how do you feel about mobile 
                        payment services?

           EXT. SONY PICTURES STUDIOS - CULVER CITY - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           The gated exterior of the Madison Street entrance to the Sony 
           lot, the last vestige of Culver City's Hollywood heyday. 
           100,000 pounds of steel welded in the shape of a garish 
           rainbow looms over the Moderne-style buildings, sound stages, 
           and a Pinkberry (for the peckish exec between meetings). 
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - COLUMBIA PICTURES, THALBERG BUILDING, 
           SONY LOT - DAY 

           Evan and Bobby sit alone in an elegant conference room with 
           signed posters of famous Columbia movies on the wall. Evan 
           re-reads an article on his phone, a picture of TWO DUDES and 
           the name LIGHTSPEED VENTURES. Bobby takes in his surroundings 
           -

                                 BOBBY 
                        I still don't understand why we're 
                        meeting here. Isn't that weird? 

                                 EVAN
                        It's not weird. It's private. And 
                        professional.

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah if you're pitching a movie or 
                        something. 

           Michael enters the conference room. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        My boys! 

           Handshakes etc. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Thank you again, Mr. Lynton. For 
                        the servers, and um, setting all 
                        this up -

                                 MICHAEL
                            (it's nothing)
                        Sit, sit. I don't want to speak too 
                        soon, but I have a feeling this is 
                        our last meeting. Barry is an old 
                        friend, and Lightspeed is so 
                        excited to get involved that this 
                        is basically a formality. A get-to-
                        know-you before signing on the 
                        dotted line. 

           An ASSISTANT pokes her head in -

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Barry and Jeremy just arrived. 

                                 BOBBY
                        But we can still say no, right? 
                                 MICHAEL
                        Of course! Ball's totally in your 
                        court. 

           The conference room door opens for BARRY EGGERS (50s, ginger, 
           freckles) and JEREMY LIEW (40s, Asian, bald except for some 
           stylish side-swept hair on top), both wearing versions of the 
           Silicon Valley VC uniform: blazers, cashmere V-Neck, and 
           Khaki pants. 

           Hugs and handshakes etc. 

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: THE FAST-FORWARD RABBIT X 1

           SWIPE! 

           THE FAST-FORWARD RABBIT X 2 

           The men sit. They talk. Gesticulations. Glossy print-outs of 
           portfolios shared both ways. 

           We resume the scene in normal time. 

                                 BARRY
                        Well, gentlemen, I think that's it 
                        on our end. 

                                 JEREMY
                        Again, we could not be more 
                        thrilled that Picaboo is 
                        considering us as a first-round.

                                 BARRY
                        Do you guys have a timeline yet for 
                        moving back to the bay? 

                                 JEREMY
                        We'd be happy to help you scout 
                        locations. Of course the city is 
                        more popular with founders your 
                        age, but the South Bay has a 
                        certain boujie charm. Well, you 
                        guys know. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That's so cool of you guys, but 
                        Evan and I still have some things 
                        to discuss-

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, we're not moving back to the 
                        bay. 

           Bobby does a double take. Starts to speak but holds back -
                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        We're an LA based company. 

                                 BARRY/JEREMY
                        That's awesome!/ Love it! Silicon 
                        Beach, baby! 

           Off of Bobby's unsuccessful attempt at hiding surprise... 

           INT. SOHO HOUSE - WEST HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT 

           The Garden of Sodom and Gomorrah in full swing. Bulbous paper 
           lanterns emit a soft glow over the lush, overgrown rooftop - 
           a members-only club for industry types. 

           A walking ad for Invisalign delivers three shots of Casamigos 
           and three whiskey neats to the guys' table. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                            (raising his glass)
                        To my first Investees and our fat 
                        Series One. May you be infinitely 
                        easier to work with than these 
                        fucks,
                            (gesturing to the 
                             Hollywood crowd around 
                             them)
                        And 100 times more successful.

                                 EVAN
                        To success! 

           They throw back the shots. Bobby winces. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Excuse me, I'll be right back. 

           He leaves in the direction of the restrooms. Michael, 
           watching him go -

                                 MICHAEL
                        Is he ok? 

                                 EVAN
                        Bobby? Oh yeah, he's just kind of 
                        tightly wound. He's used to sitting 
                        behind a computer and writing code. 
                        Pitching VCs and rubbing shoulders 
                        at the SoHo House? Not so much. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hey, I get it. You guys are under 
                        immense pressure. 
                                 EVAN
                        Nah, I'm not worried. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Well you should be. This is not an 
                        easy position to be in at your age. 
                        As of today, it's a whole different 
                        ballgame. A lot of money's at stake 
                        now.  A lot of my money too. 

                                 EVAN
                        Of course, I didn't mean -

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know you didn't. You know, I 
                        didn't get successful, like really 
                        successful, until my 50s. Which was 
                        never the plan. And I spent a lot 
                        of time beating myself up for being 
                        behind some arbitrary timeline I 
                        set for myself when I was a moron 
                        like you. 

           Evan does a double take. He wasn't expecting that.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                            (pointing his drink at 
                             him)
                        Let's get this straight right now - 
                        you are a moron. You're smart for a 
                        moron, but you are below the age of 
                        40, which means you are a moron. 
                        It's not personal, it's just a fact 
                        of life. I told my kids the same 
                        thing. You don't know shit until 
                        you know shit. And you only know 
                        shit after you've seen shit. That's 
                        the problem with Tech - it's ageist  
                        in the wrong direction. All of 
                        these pubescent chickens running 
                        around suing each other for 
                        ownership - we don't even let 20-
                        somethings run their own TV shows - 
                        and that's fucking TV! I'm not just 
                        saying this - I consider myself 
                        lucky to have been forced to wait 
                        for wealth and power. I didn't know 
                        what the fuck I was doing when I 
                        was - how old are you, again? 

                                 EVAN
                                 MICHAEL
                        Jesus. I would have completely 
                        fucked this up. No doubt in my 
                        mind. 

                                 EVAN
                        Wait, sorry, are you saying I'm 
                        fucked? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not necessarily. Do you trust your 
                        team? 
                            (he tilts his head in the 
                             direction Bobby left)
                        If there is any dead weight you're 
                        hanging on to, now is the time to 
                        cut it off. And by now I mean now. 
                        Like tonight. 

           Bobby comes back to the table. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        How you doing, buddy? Let's get 
                        this man a steak, shall we?

           INT. EVAN'S ESCALADE - LATER 

           Evan and Bobby sit in silence as Evan winds his way down an 
           empty Sunset boulevard back towards the westside. Bobby 
           stares out of the window. 

                                 EVAN
                        You alright?

                                 BOBBY
                        Fine. 

           More silence. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Did Michael know that Picaboo would 
                        be based in LA? 

                                 EVAN
                        I think I mentioned it to him in 
                        passing.

                                 BOBBY
                        Ok, cool, cool, anything else 
                        Michael knows that I should know? 
                        Besides where I'm living next year.
                                 EVAN
                        You want to pout? Fine, pout. But 
                        while you're sulking like a teenage 
                        girl on her period I'm the one 
                        making all of your hours in front 
                        of a screen actually mean 
                        something. What do you want to know 
                        about Michael? His horoscope? 
                        Here's what you need to know - the 
                        guy invested $600,000 in our 
                        company, and today he introduced us 
                        to people who are going to make us 
                        millionaires. Millionaires, Bobby. 
                        What are you not getting about 
                        that? This is why we've been 
                        working so hard. 

           A beat. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Millionaires?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah. I mean, I think so. I'm not 
                        totally sure how it all works, but 
                        I'm pretty sure. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Fuck.

                                 EVAN
                        And it's just the beginning. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I'm sorry for being weird tonight. 
                        This whole Michael thing came out 
                        of nowhere for me and all of a 
                        sudden I feel like I'm on the 
                        outside of our company. I know I've 
                        never been super opinionated about 
                        all the business shit, but going 
                        forward, I need to have a say on 
                        the big stuff. I'm your partner, 
                        Ev, not your employee.

                                 EVAN
                        You're right. You're totally right. 
                        I should've checked in - it's just 
                        my mind is in so many places, 
                        skipping so many steps -

                                 BOBBY
                        I'm happy to be in LA, dude. But 
                        why?
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Isn't it better for the company to 
                        be in the Valley if we want to be 
                        taken seriously?

                                 EVAN
                        No, that's exactly it - Silicon 
                        Valley will kill us. The company 
                        I'm building -

           Bobby gives him a look. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        We're, we're building, sorry - it's 
                        a different breed. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I mean yeah, that's the whole 
                        point.

                                 EVAN
                        No, not different like unique, like 
                        oh another billion dollar unicorn. 
                            (he mimes jacking off)
                        After our user base eclipses 
                        Facebook and Instagram, it's up to 
                        us how we choose to harness it. I 
                        don't want to be another tech 
                        company - a communications-based 
                        platform with targeted advertising 
                        - that's the past...it's a dried up 
                        rotting carcass and I don't want 
                        anything to do with it. I want to 
                        be the first tech company to become 
                        a film studio, news company, and 
                        music streaming service. Content 
                        generation, across all media. And I 
                        want to do it without in-app 
                        advertising. That's why we need to 
                        be in LA. 

           Another beat. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, that would have been helpful 
                        to share with the person building 
                        your product.

                                 EVAN
                        Well, now you know. 
                                 BOBBY
                        Investors will want us to monetize. 
                        We all but promised Lightspeed ad-
                        driven profits in the first 
                        quarter.

                                 EVAN
                        We'll cross that bridge when we 
                        come to it.

           Bobby sighs. Already anxious about the uphill battles ahead.

                                 BOBBY
                        How many millions do you think 
                        they're putting up? Will the three 
                        of us get the same amount?

           Evan's mouth hardens. 

                                 EVAN
                        Two of us. When we get home, I want 
                        you to change all the passwords. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What? Why?

                                 EVAN
                        You've been saying it from day one. 
                        He's dead weight. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Wait, so, you're just going to push 
                        him out? Without even talking to 
                        him first?

                                 EVAN
                        It's easier that way. 

           A beat while Bobby stares out the window, processing. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Also, I've been thinking about our 
                        name. Picaboo.

                                 BOBBY
                        Why?

                                 EVAN
                        It sucks dick. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. COLBERT REPORT SET - NEW YORK - NIGHT

           Camera A on STEPHEN COLBERT shooting his talkshow in front of 
           a live audience six months before his show would go off the 
           air forever. 

                                 STEPHEN COLBERT
                        Welcome back everyone, thank you so 
                        much! My guests tonight invented an 
                        app called Snapchat, that lets you 
                        share photos, but only for 10 
                        seconds. Just in time for Anthony 
                        Weiner's comeback! 

           Pause for mild laughter from the crowd. President Trump is 
           just the stuff of delusional nightmares. 

                                 COLBERT
                        Please welcome Evan Spiegel and 
                        Bobby Murphy!

           And apparently, so is Reggie Brown. 

           As the besuited comedian runs from the main desk to the 
           interviewing desk, stopping to rile the crowd on the way -

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: April 30th, 2013

           SWIPE!

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: New York City

           He joins Evan and Bobby at the neighboring set and they stand 
           to shake hands. Seats are taken and the guys can't help but 
           smile through the nerves and sweat - this is their first real 
           taste of fame - but Evan is noticeably more relaxed than 
           Bobby. 

                                 COLBERT (CONT’D)
                            (pointing to them in turn)
                        Evan? Bobby? Did I get it right? 

           Evan and Bobby giggle like schoolboys. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You did. 

                                 COLBERT
                        Boom! Alright! Ok guys, you created 
                        something called "Snapchat." Tell 
                        the folks what's unique about 
                        Snapchat.

           Evan looks at Bobby expectantly (the hours of prep showing). 
                                 BOBBY 
                            (like a nervous actor 
                             reciting his lines)
                        Well uh, Snapchat is a uh, photo 
                        and video messaging application for 
                        iPhone and Android, and the kicker 
                        is that the photos disappear, in an 
                        effort to kind of keep the 
                        communication very natural and 
                        human.

                                 COLBERT
                        Alright, I understand the term 
                        kicker, that's internet lingo, and 
                        I am down with all the social 
                        networking buzzword.biz, ok.

           Audience laughter.

                                 COLBERT (CONT’D)
                        Ok so, this allows - the photos 
                        disappear after 10 seconds, right? 
                        Ok -

           Evan interrupts -

                                 EVAN
                        You can always take a screenshot.

           Colbert doesn't respond, as he is in the middle of a 
           punchline set-up.

                                 COLBERT
                        Ok, why do you want them to 
                        disappear? What are the users of 
                        Snapchat ashamed of?

           Audience laughs.

                                 COLBERT (CONT’D)
                            (gesturing to his face)
                        Why would you want this to 
                        disappear?

                                 EVAN
                        I think you may be the exception.

           He laughs at his own joke and manages to get the audience to 
           laugh with him and eventually applaud.

                                 COLBERT
                        But, but, that's embracing shame. 
                        You're embracing shame with this 
                        product. 
                                 BOBBY
                        I think the idea is to change the 
                        notion of what a photograph is and 
                        use it as a means of expression, 
                        and just recognizing that photos 
                        and videos are extremely 
                        expressive, and you have a camera 
                        on your smartphone, always with 
                        you, so why not use that as a way 
                        to communicate with friends and 
                        family? So the disappearing aspect 
                        is an effort to kind of bring the 
                        service back to normal human 
                        communication, which is ephemeral 
                        and transient, and kind of fluid 
                        because of that. 

                                 COLBERT
                        Uh huh, right, like what we're 
                        doing right now. 

           Audience laughs.

                                 BOBBY
                        Exactly, except -

                                 COLBERT
                            (riffing)
                        We’re just talking to each other, 
                        and relating, we’re having 
                        emotional experiences, you know, I 
                        can smell you, or whatever. You 
                        smell great, by the way.
                            (to Evan)
                        You're not what I think of when I 
                        think of a tech founder. Look at 
                        this guy. Something tells me you 
                        have plenty of friends.

           Evan and Bobby laugh. The audience is eating it up too. 

                                 COLBERT (CONT’D)
                        Bobby...you I believe.

           More laughter.

                                 COLBERT (CONT’D)
                        So we could lose these cameras and 
                        that would be human experience.

                                 BOBBY
                        Totally.
                                 COLBERT
                        And Snapchat is more like this?

                                 BOBBY
                        Yes, but it allows you to do that 
                        with people who are outside the 
                        room, or across the world, you 
                        know, miles away.

                                 COLBERT
                        Ok...is this a sexting app?

           The audience loses it, cheering the loudest so far. 

           Evan pipes up for the first time in awhile - unamused, almost 
           condescending - as if to say, "I'll play along with your 
           childish games, but only because I'm forced to."

                                 EVAN
                        You can always take a screenshot, 
                        you can always take a picture with 
                        another camera, so it's not the 
                        best way to send inappropriate 
                        photos.

                                 COLBERT
                        Ok, is there a better way to send 
                        inappropriate photos? Because I 
                        can't think of one.

                        If you're wondering, this is the 
                        part where Evan and Bobby get 
                        disgustingly rich.

           June, 2013

           An airy, modern beach house with 30 or so workstations - huge 
           Mac desktops and wireless keyboards. Ergonomic chairs subbed 
           for exercise balls. One of the walls features street art by a 
           local artist, another doubles as a giant white board, covered 
           in doodles and code. The kitchen area gleams, overflowing 
           with high-priced snacks. 

           From a couch in the entryway, Lily observes a typical day at 
           Snap, as it is affectionately called by its newly-minted 
           employees. Hip 20-somethings (many of them Stanford grads) 
           Gchat, text, and Snap each other. Two dudes play ping pong, a 
           girl in a beanie takes a drag on an e-cig at her desk. 

           We can see on her face how this whole thing stings. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        I know, not a great look for me. 
                        But to all my haters out there - 
                        no, I didn't beg Evan for a job.

                        I just...applied. I needed the work 
                        and this paid well. I don't have 
                        too much to pride to admit it - I 
                        was wrong about Snapchat. We all 
                        were. When life gives you lemons, 
                        or something like that. So here I 
                        am, wondering if he even knows I 
                        work at his company. 
                            (beat)
                        God I hate lemonade. 

           Head of HR and incorrigible gossip, CHLOE, not much older 
           than Lily, comes to collect the company's latest hire. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Lily? Chloe, hi. Nice to meet you 
                        in person. 
                            (hand shaking)
                        Sorry we're running so behind 
                        schedule - I think I've processed 
                        like 10 new employees today. 

           Lily  follows her through the office on a small tour.

                                 CHLOE  (CONT’D)
                        Well, congrats again. I'm not sure 
                        if anyone told you yet, but you are  
                        actually employee number 32!

                                 LILY 
                        I estimated something like that. 

                                 CHLOE 
                            (waving vaguely)
                        Engineers are over there, design 
                        team on the left, and as you know, 
                        we're in the process of forming 
                        your team and a couple others. I 
                        know it's a little cramped, but 
                        between you and me, they're 
                        renovating new offices on Rose. 
                        It's still a secret, internally. 
                        Evan keeps us on a need to know 
                        basis.

                                 LILY 
                        Ah. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Just a head's up, there are already 
                        two Lily's, also Asian, by some 
                        weird coincidence, but good news is 
                        you're all on different teams!

                        and ID badge next. Security is 
                        ramping up, per Evan.

                        Ok...do you know if he's free to 
                        chat? I'd love to drop in, say 
                        hi...

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        Love is a strong word there.

                                 CHLOE
                        Who?

                                 LILY 
                        Evan. We were friends in college.

                        Friends is a really strong word 
                        there.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh, right, well, Evan hasn't been 
                        in the office for a couple weeks, 
                        CEO duties. Maybe shoot him an 
                        email, he's pretty reliable on 
                        email. Kind of. Want to see the 
                        roof? We just got new hammocks, 
                        which I don't get if we're moving 
                        anyway, but again, please don't 
                        repeat that.

           INT. SOCIAL 25, THE HUNTLEY HOTEL - SANTA MONICA - NIGHT

           The dashing mayoral DILF himself, ERIC GARCETTI, addresses 
           the glitzy crowd at the launch event of LA's Social Media 
           Week. 

                                 GARCETTI
                        And thank you to our guests of 
                        honor, Evan Spiegel and Bobby 
                        Murphy! In just two short years, 
                        Snapchat has managed to breathe new 
                        life into the local tech industry 
                        out of their headquarters in 
                        Venice, and I am excited to 
                        formally announce that they will be 
                        adding 300 new jobs by 2014! 
                            (looking directly at Evan 
                             and Bobby)
                        May I just say again - we love 
                        having you in Los Angeles!
           Applause all around as Evan and Bobby clap from their seats. 

           INT. HUNTLEY HOTEL - LATER

           Evan and Bobby sit in a secluded area of the rooftop patio 
           with NIC TRAN (35), head of social media for Taco Bell. 

                                 NIC
                        Thank you guys for agreeing to chat 
                        with me. 

                                 BOBBY
                        No prob, we're big fans of the 
                        voice you've created for the Taco 
                        Bell brand.

                                 EVAN
                        And the Cheesy Gordita Crunch. 

                                 NIC
                        Ah thanks man, just trying to keep 
                        things real in the ad space. Which 
                        is why I've been wanting to sit 
                        down with you guys. I know the 
                        party line is Snapchat doesn't do 
                        ads, but I had a thought -

                                 EVAN
                        It's not a party line. It's a 
                        company policy.

                                 NIC
                        Right, and I totally respect that, 
                        and clearly your users do too, but 
                        let's say two friends are using the 
                        new messaging feature, and bam! A 
                        Gordita Crunch just appears in 
                        their convo. Quick, painless, no 
                        cheesy ad campaign. No pun 
                        intended. Might make the experience 
                        more exciting, and then, you know, 
                        your guys send the data on who 
                        responds, tracking keywords and 
                        engagement, etc. 

                                 EVAN
                        Huh. So basically, your pitch is to 
                        obliterate the sanctity of privacy 
                        that we have worked so hard to make 
                        possible for the first time in the 
                        history of social media 
                        communication...to sell Crunchwrap 
                        Supremes.
                                 BOBBY
                            (mediating)
                        I think what Evan is trying to say 
                        is - it feels a little invasive, 
                        and similar to the outdated 
                        Facebook model we are trying to 
                        avoid. 

                                 EVAN
                        It goes against everything our app 
                        stands for. 

                                 NIC
                            (lowering his voice)
                        Come on man, we all know you're not 
                        doing this to protect the little 
                        guy. At the end of the day there 
                        has to be a monetization strategy. 
                        I just want to be your first call 
                        when you figure that out. 

                                 EVAN
                        When we monetize, it will not by 
                        harvesting data on our users. 
                            (tongue in cheek)
                        Then what would separate us from 
                        the evil corporations ruining 
                        society? What's Taco Bell's parent 
                        company again?

           Bobby, trying to curtail the downward turn -

                                 BOBBY
                        Great talking to you, man. We'll be 
                        in touch. 

           Nic, knowing he's been dismissed, gets up and leaves. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        He's not wrong. 

                                 EVAN
                        You want to put a fucking dancing 
                        taco in the middle of our users' 
                        private conversations?

                                 BOBBY
                        No, of course not. But, the clock 
                        is ticking, Evan. How much longer 
                        can we tell the board that we're 
                        working on it? We have to start 
                        making money or...you know your big 
                        plan that you have? It doesn't 
                        happen without advertising. 
           Evan stares at the ground, resolute. 

                                 EVAN
                        Not yet. Trust me. 
                            (he makes eye contact with 
                             a blonde at the bar)
                        Want a drink?

           He gets up.

                                 BOBBY
                        What am I supposed to tell the 
                        board?

                                 EVAN
                        We're working on it.

                                 BOBBY
                        We're not working on it.

           Evan taps his head a couple times, as if to say, "I got 
           this." He looks a little manic. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        You ok, dude?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, why?

                        than that. 

           INT. SNAPCHAT OFFICES - VENICE BEACH - DAY

           Lily  reviews something on a CO-WORKER'S computer. Suddenly 
           the office fills with hungry chatter and a symphony of 
           electronic alerts. A female employee stands up from her desk 
           in disgust and storms out of the office. Lily  looks around, 
           confused...

           Someone Gchats her co-worker the link. They read:

           CLOSE ON Valleywag article, "'Fuck Bitches Get Leid,' the 
           Sleazy Frat Emails of Snapchat's CEO"

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Oh shit. 

           He scrolls. We catch a couple lines "Have some girl put your 
           large kappa sigma dick down her throat" and "ACTION NEEDED... 
           TO GET PI PHIS FUCKED UP"

           CLOSE ON Lily, fighting a smile. 

                                 LILY (V.O.)
                        Can you blame me? It feels good 
                        when everyone finally sees what 
                        you've known all along. A small 
                        sliver of justice -

           An unexplained CRASH from an upstairs office silences the 
           room.

                                 EVAN (O.C.)
                        FUCK.

                                 LILY (V.O.)

           EXT. SOMEWHERE ON VENICE BOULEVARD BETWEEN VENICE AND CULVER 
           CITY - SIDEWALK - DAY 

           Michael and Evan drink matcha lattes on a walk from Venice to 
           Culver City down one of LA's busiest boulevards. Busy meaning 
           with cars. Nobody walks here. The sounds of midday TRAFFIC. 

                                 LILY  (V.O.)
                        See that 1998 Honda? It just honked 
                        at a combined worth of 1.3 billion 
                        dollars. No joke, these two used to 
                        walk the length of Venice 
                        Boulevard. I think it was some sort 
                        of bonding exercise, a chance to 
                        talk business and sports cars. 
                            (beat)
                        Ok I don't really know if they 
                        talked about cars but, come on. 

                                 EVAN
                        They were just bad jokes. The worst 
                        part is, I was never really that 
                        guy. I had to be that way for house 
                        morale - like, method acting or 
                        something - a performance! I was 
                        performing masculinity. Does that 
                        make sense? 

           Michael cuts him off.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don't give a shit, and neither 
                        does the board. We can weather a 
                        small PR scandal, but no new 
                        company can survive without turning 
                        a profit. 

                                 EVAN 
                        But it's my reputation -

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, Snapchat is your reputation. 
                        Stop giving us the run-around on 
                        ads and monetize your company. The 
                        way I see it, I'm here to give you 
                        the big picture, and the big 
                        picture is going public one day - 
                        cementing Snapchat's status as one 
                        of the great American companies of 
                        the 21st century. Do you get that?

                                 EVAN
                        Yes, it's not like I don't - I want 
                        that too...I'm just stuck, ok?

                        Ads defeat the purpose of the whole 
                        fucking app. How do I do that and 
                        not alienate my users?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Get creative. Delegate. That's why 
                        you have employees. 

           A beat. Michael looks at Evan, notices dark circles, 
           twitchiness, a pale sheen. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Are you sleeping?

                                 EVAN
                        The most successful people in the 
                        world only sleep 3 to 5 hours a 
                        night. 

           Michael laughs.

                        Who told you that? Oprah? Go home 
                        and get some sleep. You look like 
                        shit. 

           INT. EVAN'S OFFICE - DAY 

           Bobby enters Evan's large, modern office. Tuberoses, art 
           books, a framed, black and white photo of Steve Jobs on the 
           wall. Life of Pablo blasts while Evan displaces everything on 
           his desk in search of something -

                                 BOBBY
                        Hey, the board has another PR 
                        person they want us to sit down 
                        with -

                                 EVAN
                        I can't find my pen. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Want me to ask your assistant -

                                 EVAN
                        I can only work with one brand of 
                        pen, and of course it's backordered 
                        right now so if I don't find this 
                        specific pen, I'll lose the whole 
                        day. 
                            (looking up)
                        Shut the door!
                                 BOBBY
                        Uh, sorry..

           He shuts it. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        About this PR woman. She's good - 
                        worked in Finance, JP Morgan I 
                        think -

                                 EVAN
                        You know what - from now on, we 
                        have all conversations outside. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What?

                                 EVAN
                            (voice raising)
                        When you want to talk to me, ask me 
                        if I would like to take a walk, and 
                        I will say yes or no, and if I say 
                        yes, we will have a conversation 
                        out there on the boardwalk, where 
                        we can't be overheard. Or watched. 

           Evan gestures with his eyes towards the employees beyond his 
           office. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Don't you think that kind of 
                        defeats the purpose of having an 
                        office? 

                                 EVAN
                        No, I think we need to be more 
                        careful. 

                                 BOBBY
                        The emails weren't released by 
                        someone at the company, Ev. In all 
                        likelihood, it was Reggie...you 
                        know, the guy who wants to take us 
                        to court? 

                                 EVAN
                        We don't know that. Almost 50% of 
                        our employees are Stanford alumni - 
                        it could have been forwarded to 
                        anyone. This, this is exactly why 
                        Snapchat exists, why our work is so 
                        important - to prevent this kind of 
                        extortionist shit. 
                                 BOBBY
                        I thought it was to give people a 
                        more natural, human form of 
                        expression and outlet for their 
                        creativity.

           A hard silence.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Try not to take the Reggie thing 
                        personally. Think of it as an 
                        expense. 

           Evan spots his pen under his Moleskin notebook. Stares at it.

                                 EVAN
                        From now on, outside. 

           EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - DAY 

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: Santa Monica Airport

           SWIPE!

           November, 2013

           Evan boards a private plane at the small air field. His eyes 
           are glued to his phone even as he climbs the stairs to the 
           plane...

           CLOSE ON SCREEN:

           A calendar alert pops up - "Zuck"

           He dismisses it. 

           INT. PRIVATE PLANE - CONTINUED

           Evan swipes through gossip articles about him and Taylor 
           Swift while waiting to take off. "Did T Swizzle and Snapchat 
           CEO Totally Make Out?" "Taylor Swift & Evan Spiegel's Love 
           Affair: How She Blew It" 

           Coincidentally, he receives a text - CLOSE ON - 

           Taylor: "Hamptons? ;)"

           Evan responds: "Can't. Work stuff."

           He thinks, writes a follow-up text: "Want to be straight with 
           you, I don't have time for a relationship rn :("
           Thinks again, makes himself laugh: "Feel free to write a song 
           ;)"

           A flight attendant, KAITLYN (20s), crouches by his seat. 

                                 KAITLYN
                        Hey there. We're taking off in a 
                        few.

                                 EVAN
                        Thanks. 
                            (noticing her name tag)
                        I like the spelling of your name. 

           He misses Taylor's next text - CLOSE ON -

           Taylor: "Fuck you, Evan"

                                                          HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. EVVIA - PALO ALTO - DAY

           Evan and Professor Kent sit outside at an upscale Greek 
           restaurant in downtown Palo Alto. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT 
                        So I assume you're not here to pick 
                        up your diploma. 

                                 EVAN
                        That would require graduating. 

           He looks over his shoulder. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Just here for a meeting. Should be 
                        pretty quick. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        No entourage?

                                 EVAN
                        No, I'm handling this one solo. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Wow, well, you were always quite 
                        the maverick.

                                 EVAN
                        I wish I could tell you where...or 
                        rather who, but, I really 
                        shouldn't. It's not that I don't 
                        trust you - 
                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Oh please, I don't care about that 
                        - tell me about you. 

                                 EVAN
                        Um well, I assume you know most of 
                        it. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Hardly! I've just been swamped. We 
                        have 10 graduate students this year 
                        and I've been overseeing the 
                        largest grant program in the 
                        history of the D.School, sincerest 
                        apologies if I missed an email here 
                        and there. 

                                 EVAN
                        Did you? I'm a little busy myself. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        I can't imagine. How are you 
                        handling everything? Do you have 
                        good people around you? 

                                 EVAN
                        Well, my dad is on the board, but, 
                        I try to keep him at arm's length, 
                        actually. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Oh, I thought he was supportive of 
                        your efforts.

                                 EVAN
                        In the way a leech is supportive of 
                        its blood supply. Did you know 
                        we're destroying Facebook in NDU's 
                        by a 300,000 margin? 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT 
                            (caught slightly off 
                             guard)
                        No, I didn't. That's fabulous. How 
                        is Bobby doing? Are you two still 
                        close?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, he's good. He's filthy rich 
                        and still obsessed with coding. 
                        Hey, what do you know about 
                        Zuckerberg. Do you think he's on 
                        the spectrum? I can't tell. 
                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        I've never met him personally, 
                        but...

                                 EVAN
                        Don't tell anyone that I asked 
                        about Zuckerberg, ok? What I'm 
                        about to do really can't get out.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Of course. And good luck, it must 
                        be a nightmare to get the board and 
                        founders on the same page around 
                        any major decision. 

                                 EVAN
                        Not if you don't tell them. 

           A flash of concern on Kent's face.

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Be careful, Evan. I don't have to 
                        remind you of all the cautionary 
                        tales of founders pushed out of 
                        their own companies because they 
                        didn't play politics.

                                 EVAN
                        They'll get over it. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        Is this about your dad? Because if 
                        you need a referral, I have a 
                        wonderful colleague who does family 
                        work, lots of experience and 
                        extremely discreet...   

                                 EVAN
                        What? No, it's about my company, 
                        which you seem weirdly uninterested 
                        in. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                        I just didn't want to pry, that's 
                        all. I know how much you value your 
                        privacy. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Right, right. Well...thanks. Sorry. 

                                 PROFESSOR KENT
                            (changing the subject)
                        Did you know they're building an 
                        entirely new design lab on campus?
                                 (MORE)
                                 PROFESSOR KENT (CONT’D)
                        I had a thought - maybe you could 
                        come speak to the students 
                        sometime, or join us for the 
                        unveiling?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah, of course, um, just email my 
                        assistant. That would be great. 

           EXT. FACEBOOK CAMPUS - PALO ALTO - LATER

           Evan wears shades and a baseball cap as he leaves the campus. 
           He passes two Facebook employees on the lawn taking SELFIES 
           together in the Snapchat app, toggling through face-modifying 
           FILTERS and laughing. 

           Off Evan's darkened, almost devious smile -

           INT. STANFORD D.SCHOOL CLASSROOM - PALO ALTO - DAY 

           Kent stands in front of a scattered crowd in a lecture hall. 
           Phones ALERTS start going off and attention drifts.

                                 KENT
                        Ok, anybody want to fill me in?

           A CO-ED gets up from her seat and hands him her phone. As he 
           takes a sip from his coffee mug and reads -

           Kent does a demure spit take, wiping coffee dribble off his 
           chin.

                                 CO-ED
                        Didn't you teach that guy?

           INT. THERAPIST OFFICE - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Bobby and his girlfriend, KATIE MCHANLIN (22), sit on a couch 
           across from silver-haired couple's therapist, CARLA BECKETT 
           (50s) - a soothing, maternal presence in a moss-green poncho. 

                                 KATIE
                        I just feel like I'm in a three-way 
                        relationship with you and Evan, and  
                        I did not sign up for that. I don't 
                        even like him. 

                                 CARLA
                        Mm, thank you for your honesty, 
                        Katie. Bobby? How does that land on 
                        you.
                                 BOBBY
                        Uh, I -

           His phone starts buzzing.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry...

           He checks...

                                 KATIE 
                        See? This is exactly what I'm 
                        talking about.

                                 CARLA
                        Bobby, whatever it is, I'm sure -

                                 BOBBY
                            (freaking)
                        Fuck me. Fuck me fuck me.

                                 KATIE
                        You know what, maybe you and Evan 
                        should fuck, that way we can cut me 
                        out of the equation altogether. 

                                 BOBBY 
                            (sotto)
                        3 billion...

           An overwhelmed Bobby starts weeping, to the confusion of his 
           girlfriend and therapist. 

           INT. LYNTON ESTATE - GYM - CONTINUOUS  

           Michael sprints on a treadmill in his home gym. A Google 
           alert pops up on his iPad. Without breaking speed he uses a 
           sweaty finger to click - "Snapchat rejects 3Bn Facebook 
           buyout..." 

           CLOSE ON his heart-beat monitor, which starts to rise,

           He realizes he is running for his life and hastily clicks the

           recognize the signs of cardiac arrest...as he HITS THE FLOOR.

                        Everyone was. But as it turns out,

           INT. SNAPCHAT OFFICES - VENICE BEACH - DAY 

           The beach bungalow vibes of the original Snapchat offices 
           have morphed into the sleek, modern efficiency of this 
           unmarked building off the boardwalk.

           Nobody gets in here without going through the massive 
           security guy, HECTOR, stationed in the small, chair-less 
           lobby. He wears thin black glasses inside, comically small 
           for his Easter Island sized head.

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: September, 2013

           INT. SNAPCHAT OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUED

           Sitting around the table are Evan, EMMA WHITE (COO, formerly 
           of Instagram), AKSHAY GOPALAN (chief strategy officer), TIM 
           SACKS (VP of Engineering), MIKE RANDALL, (Monetization VP, 
           formerly of Facebook), and a handful of lower-level designers 
           and engineers, including Lily. 

           Everyone in this room works for Evan, even the people twice 
           his age, and telling from their body language, it’s not an 
           easy position to be in. Evan is fidgety, with large dark 
           circles under his eyes. His normally immaculate clothing is 
           slightly rumpled - his version of Howard Hughes' bathrobe 
           moment. 

           The team toggles through a slideshow of geo-filters on a 
           "smart-wall"...

                                 EVAN
                        These look fine. Not that one. Re-
                        do that third one or get rid of it.

                                 EMMA
                        Actually, if I may interject, I 
                        wanted to share an update with all 
                        of you. I just got word back from 
                        our analytics team, and as of this 
                        month, we are averaging over 30 
                        million daily users.

           Woots and applause. On Lily, clapping softly. She looks 
           nervous.

                                 TIM SACKS
                        Hell yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        That is excellent news. 
                        Congratulations all. 

                                 EVAN
                        Well, I'm not sure what that 
                        matters if we can't protect their 
                        information. 

                                 AKSHAY 
                        Uh, yes, the last user breach was 
                        very disappointing for all of us, 
                        but we are very confident this time 
                        that it won't happen again.  

                                 EVAN
                        This time. 

           He laughs bitterly. 

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        You know, none of you look like 
                        assholes when we fuck up. It's my 
                        name next to the company. 

                                 TIM
                        Evan, we all take great pride and 
                        responsibility in Snapchat. Which 
                        is why I think we should stay 
                        focused on the original goal of 
                        this meeting -- monetization 
                        strategy. 

           Evan groans but seems to get a second wind. 
                                 EVAN
                        Great. Do you have a new hardware 
                        pitch yet? Just to get everyone up 
                        to speed, the board is currently 
                        reviewing a purchase proposal for 
                        that QR scanning startup...what's 
                        the name I'm forgetting?

                                 EMMA
                        "Scan.Me." And we we're also 
                        looking at Vergence labs. 

                                 EVAN 
                        I really think these are it. Just 
                        have to come up with a dope name.  

                                 MIKE
                        It's certainly a longterm 
                        investment worth pursuing, but my 
                        team has been working around the 
                        clock on this, and our product 
                        manager, Lily , had a significant 
                        breakthrough that I think you 
                        should hear.

           Evan smiles.

                                 EVAN
                        Class of oh-twelve, represent. Me 
                        and Lil go way back.

                                 LILY 
                        Yep, when our biggest problem was 
                        the ME core. 

                                 EMMA
                        That's so funny, I had no idea. 

                                 EVAN
                        So, what's the breakthrough?

           Lily shifts in her seat, as if she might stand - reconsiders. 
           Leaning forward --

                                 LILY 
                        Ok, so, up to this point, we've 
                        been focusing on beating Google, 
                        Fb, Amazon, whatever, to a pair of 
                        wearable lenses -- but ours would 
                        look like cool sunglasses, and 
                        function like the app -- recording 
                        without having to try. Which is 
                        awesome.

                        But it's still an accessory, at a 
                        high buy-in for a user-base that is 
                        still growing. The way I see it, 
                        that's not the best first step in 
                        the monetization process. 

                                 EVAN 
                            (not liking this)
                        What do you mean?

                                 LILY 
                        We need a strategy that starts from 
                        within the app, which we've avoided 
                        for the good reason of not wanting 
                        to take advantage of our users' 
                        loyalty. But that's when it clicked 
                        for me -- what if we treat brands 
                        like they're average users. No 
                        special treatment. The test-run of 
                        the McDonalds paid geo-filter was a 
                        huge success, right? So what if we 
                        gave them a Snap account? 

           She notices that Evan has checked out, and is staring at his 
           cuticle beds. It throws her for a second. 

                                 LILY (CONT’D)
                        Obviously, we can't force-push a 
                        brand account into friend lists, or 
                        allow McDonalds to spam users with 
                        targeted Snaps. But if everyone, 
                        including brands, had a "Story," 
                        maybe it lasts 24 hours and people 
                        can view within the 24-hour window, 
                        then it's an opt-in, opt-out 
                        system. It pushes both our users 
                        and the brands to get creative 
                        without interfering with the spirit 
                        of the app. Also, it's a natural 
                        building block towards content 
                        generation. 

                                 EMMA
                        I love that. What did you call it?

                        our source code accommodate?

                        Uh, excuse me, does anyone care 
                        what I think? Last time I checked I 
                        was the fucking CEO.

                        Evan, I think this at least 
                        deserves a closer look...we haven't 
                        even seen a mock-up. We should give 
                        Mike and Lily, and their team a 
                        chance to dig deeper, really hone 
                        it, before we make any rash 
                        decisions...

                                 EVAN
                        What about hearing me out? Letting 
                        me hone in on my vision for this 
                        company?

                                 MIKE
                        I think what Emma was saying was -

                                 EVAN
                        This tangent is going to set us 
                        back on the glasses by weeks. 
                        Snapchat is about ephemerality, I 
                        don't want profiles on my app.

                                 LILY 
                        Well they're not profiles, they're 
                        more like, landing hubs, a 
                        collection of Snaps. And the 
                        possibilities are endless - Mike 
                        and I were kicking it around - you 
                        could even do public Stories from 
                        sponsored events. 

                                 EVAN
                        Hard pass. 
                                 EMMA
                        No wait, that would be amazing - 
                        what about location based? Showcase 
                        the global community of the app. 

                                 EVAN
                        Emma, would you mind giving us a 
                        moment?

                                 EMMA
                        Excuse me?

                                 EVAN
                        You're not hearing me, and I didn't 
                        match your ludicrous, inflated 
                        salary from Instagram so you could 
                        lecture me in front of my 
                        employees. 

           Stunned silence. Everyone avoids eye contact. 

                                 MIKE
                        Evan, let's remain civil -

                                 EMMA
                        No, that's ok.

           She begins to gather her things. Standing -

                                 EMMA  (CONT’D)
                            (Calm and cold as ice)
                        Just to be clear before I formally 
                        resign - your app is not nearly 
                        good enough to withstand the total 
                        mental breakdown of its leadership. 

           She leaves, the glass door whooshing noiselessly behind her. 
           Somebody say something, please. 

                                 AKSHAY
                        Ok well, I think that's enough for 
                        today. 

           Off Lily, looking like she just had the wind knocked out of 
           her.

           EXT. SHUTTERS ON THE BEACH - SANTA MONICA - NIGHT

           John and Evan get dinner after hours of giving depositions  
           for Reggie's lawsuit against Snapchat. We recognize the same 
           beachside patio from before - string lights, shrimp cocktails 
           everywhere. 
                                 JOHN
                        The board received Emma's 
                        resignation.

                                 EVAN
                        High turnover is perfectly normal 
                        for a company our age. 

                                 JOHN
                        Completely normal. It wasn't a good 
                        fit. 

           An awkward silence. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Long day, huh? You almost feel bad 
                        for the kid. 

                                 EVAN
                        Do you?

                                 JOHN
                        Hey, you know that I know that we 
                        all know Snapchat was your idea, 
                        100 percent. But Reggie's not a bad 
                        guy. He's just struggling right 
                        now. 

                                 EVAN
                        Maybe you should join the 
                        prosecution.

                                 JOHN
                        I get it, everything I say is 
                        wrong. 

                                 EVAN
                        No Dad, I'm just not in a super 
                        forgiving mood to the person suing 
                        me for a third of my company. 

           Another awkward pause.

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        Did I forget to mention a lawsuit? 
                        There are always lawsuits. I just 
                        don't find that stuff terribly 
                        interesting, myself. Lawsuits are 
                        epically boring. In real life, at 
                        least.

                                 JOHN
                        He'll settle. Probably won't get 
                        upwards of 100 mill. 
                                 EVAN
                        Michael thinks 150. 

                                 JOHN
                        Right, the all-knowing Michael 
                        Lynton who doesn't even have a law 
                        degree let alone a background in 
                        tech. I know you hate when I say 
                        this, but... careful, Ev. You have 
                        a lot resources at your disposal -

                                 EVAN
                        I'll get off Michael's dick when 
                        you get off Reggie's. 

                                 JOHN
                        Wow, ok. I know things haven't been 
                        easy, bud. It's a lot of pressure, 
                        and now you've got the suit on top 
                        of it. But this isn't my first 
                        rodeo...

                                 EVAN
                        It's not mine either, remember? The 
                        depo today was shorter than my 
                        court-mandated interviews during 
                        the divorce. So save the fake 
                        concern. Things have literally 
                        never been better for me.

           A beat.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Or you, for that matter. 

           He's not being sarcastic, and it worries John, but he keeps 
           his mouth shut. His son has made him a much bigger 
           millionaire than he was before, and the dynamic is forever 
           shifted.

           Evan stares at the empty table at the other side of the 
           patio, where he, Bobby, and Reggie celebrated Picaboo’s 
           release only two short years ago. 

           INT. SNAPCHAT OFFICES - VENICE BEACH - DAY

           A normal day at the office. Lily  works at her desk, Beats 
           headphones on. She's in the zone on something, and doesn't 
           notice that the rest of her co-workers have stopped what 
           they're doing to watch a breaking news story on their 
           computers and two flat-screens in the office. 

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON: November 24, 2014
           CLOSE ON CNN COVERAGE:

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        Sorry to interrupt, Andrea - we're 
                        getting breaking news that Sony 
                        Pictures has been hacked by a group 
                        calling themselves the Guardians of 
                        Peace. 

           Lily  notices and removes her headphones. She watches the 
           coverage unfold -

                                 NEWS ANCHOR 2
                        We're hearing that the group has 
                        released confidential data from the 
                        film studio, including personal 
                        information about employees, and e-
                        mails between employees at all 
                        levels. As of now, all Sony 
                        Pictures is totally offline.

                        The fall-out from this could be 
                        enormous for several reasons. In 
                        the meantime, they might have to 
                        fire up the fax machines over on 
                        the Sony lot.

           INT. BOBBY'S OFFICE, SNAPCHAT OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby, Akshay, and ANNIE RICE, VP of Communications, are on 
           speaker with a couple of voices - presumably lawyers.

                        We don't have all the information 
                        yet, but it seems like several 
                        confidential Snapchat dealings have 
                        been made public via Mr. Lynton's 
                        emails. 

           Bobby runs his hands through his hair, highly stressed. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What does that mean for us?

                        It's too early to tell. Our team is 
                        working on collecting a full list 
                        of the released materials and we 
                        can assess the damages then.

                        This is also unconfirmed, but you 
                        should know that people are saying 
                        North Korea is behind the hack.

                        Well does Evan know yet?

           The room looks to Bobby.

                                 BOBBY
                        I don't know, probably not. 

                                 ANNIE 
                            (looking at her phone)
                        Uh, I think he knows. 

           CLOSE ON: The official Snapchat Twitter page, where Evan has 
           posted a personal memo in response to the leak. They 
           read...and we catch excerpts, INTERCUT with Evan writing the 
           memo on his laptop at home, moments earlier:

           “It’s not fair that the people who try to build us up and 
           break us down get a glimpse of who we really are..."

           ”That people steal our secrets and make public that which we 
           desire to remain private.”

           Evan paces, holding a stack of paper in one hand and his cell 
           to his ear in the other. We hear it RING and go to voicemail. 
           He hangs up and tries again. Twice. 

                                 EVAN
                        Pick up you useless fuck!

           More RINGING and pacing until the phone picks up:

                        I can't talk now, Evan. 

           Evan shuffles papers and reads Michael's emails about him.

                                 EVAN
                        "I agree with you that Evan doesn't

                        Here's what I don't get - if I'm 
                        such a naive tool and Snapchat's 
                        ambitions aren't feasible, why 
                        haven't you pulled out your shares, 
                        you backstabbing piece of shit?
                                 MICHAEL 
                            (voice raised)
                        Shut up. Just shut up. Nobody gives 
                        a fuck about your feelings right 
                        now. I am the CEO of a publicly-
                        traded company worth 10 times the 
                        amount of Snapchat, which is 
                        currently under cyber-attack by a 
                        foreign nation as part of a geo-
                        political power play, so grow the 
                        fuck up and handle it or call your 
                        real parents, ok?

           He hangs up.

           Evan throws the rest of the emails. He has truly lost it - a 
           real fucking mess, whatever you imagine that looks like. 

           Bobby rushes in, winded from running up the stairs, and sees 
           Evan sitting on the floor.

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh my God, Evan. 

           He sits next to him, nervously touches his back. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        It's ok, man. We're gonna be fine. 

                                 EVAN
                        They know everything, we have to 
                        start over. It's all for nothing.

                                 BOBBY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 EVAN
                        They all know. The record label, 
                        the music platform, Spectacles. 
                            (between sobs)
                        Trashed. Ground zero. Everything. 

           A beat.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Everyone lets you down. 

           Bobby pats his back awkwardly, in uncommon territory.

                                 BOBBY
                        Ok man, it's ok. Try to calm down. 
                        I'm uh, I'll get some tissues. 

           He exits the room and sends a TEXT to JOHN SPIEGEL:
           Evan in bad shape. Thought you should know.

                        How are you feeling today, Evan?

                        The sooner you start talking, the

                        want to say to me?

                        I'm very proud of the progress 
                        you've made. 

           -After one final salutation, he pours a glass of spa water 
           and sits at his desk, where his notebook is open to a sketch 
           of what they audience may or may not recognize is the Stories 
           page of Snapchat.

                        with you on your journey.

           INT. SNAPCHAT OFFICES - VENICE BEACH - DAY

           Evan leads a large group of employees including Lily in the 
           chant -

                                 EVAN/LILY/BOBBY ET. AL.
                        ...is change. 

           Evan applauds and his employees follow suit, many of them 
           eating it up.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you all for joining me in 
                        that, and for your patience as we 
                        re-calibrate. I want to turn a new 
                        leaf at Snap - make sure all your 
                        voices are heard and make some 
                        really dope changes to our product. 
                        Now let's get to fucking work! 
                        Re/Code is right around the corner. 

           CLOSE ON LILY - what the fuck does that mean? 

                                 LILY (V.O.)
                        Are you buying this? If you are, 
                        you're even stupider than that

           EXT. SNAPCHAT OFFICE ROOFTOP - SUNSET 

           Evan and Bobby mingle among their employees at a company 
           chill-sesh on a Friday - people drink wine and beer as a 
           semi-famous teen musician plays a live acoustic set. Part of 
           the "new leaf" he was talking about. Evan notices Lily 
           looking out over the boardwalk on her own and joins her. 

                                 EVAN
                            (re: sunset)
                        Nice, right?

                                 LILY
                        It's no University Ave., but it'll 
                        do.
                                 EVAN
                        I wanted to check in with you...see 
                        how you're liking the company. You 
                        can be totally honest.

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        What the fuck? 

                                 LILY
                        I love it here. 

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        Please don't fire me. 

                                 EVAN
                        Good. Putting old college rivalries 
                        aside, we're really lucky to have 
                        you.

                                 LILY  (V.O).
                        I hate you, I hate you, I hate -

                                 EVAN
                        I also wanted to give you a heads 
                        up about something. Based on your 
                        input, I've decided to create a 
                        Stories team. So it's more of a 
                        congratulations, I guess.

                                 LILY
                        What? I thought...you said it was 
                        antithetical to the spirit of the 
                        app. 

                                 EVAN
                        I had some time to think it over, 
                        and I think there's enough value 
                        there to build it out. Depending on 
                        how it goes, we might even plan our 
                        Re/Code launch around the feature.

           Lily is stunned.

                                 LILY
                        Wow, Evan, that's amazing. I can't 
                        tell you how long I've been waiting 
                        to do this. How many people will I 
                        get? I would love 10 but could make 
                        do with 6, depending on who they 
                        are. 
                                 EVAN
                        The thing is, this is a real sea- 
                        change, and I need someone with 
                        experience at the helm.

           She doesn't follow...

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm bringing in someone external. 
                        Take it as a compliment. It's such 
                        a good idea, I don't want to fuck 
                        it up. 

                                 LILY
                        But, it was my idea...

                                 EVAN
                        Technically, anything you develop 
                        at Snapchat belongs to the company. 
                        But trust me, getting credit for 
                        something like this, it doesn't 
                        really matter. At the end of the 
                        day, it's not about Lily or Evan. 
                        It's about the app, and making a 
                        cultural impact. That's the reward. 
                        Do you get what I'm saying? It's 
                        kind of hard to understand before 
                        you actually create anything.

           Bobby calls him over. Evan touches her shoulder -

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Keep up the good work. You're 
                        killin' it. 

           Off Lily, shock brewing into rage...

           INT. RE/CODE TECH CONFERENCE - MAINSTAGE - DAY

           The annual Re/Code tech conference. Evan is the guest of 
           honor, sitting with Re/code bosses KARA SWISHER and WALT 
           MOSSBERG in the middle a long interview in front of a live 
           audience.

                                 KARA
                        How do you see yourself as a 
                        manager? Are you a sole proprietor, 
                        are you someone that likes a team? 
                        Are you a Jobsian or a Gatesian?

                                 EVAN
                        I'm just some guy. 
                                 WALT
                        Some guy?

                                 EVAN
                        Yeah...I'm some-guysian. 

                                 KARA
                        I don’t mean are you as famous or 
                        rich as them. I mean 
                        philosophically, in the way that 
                        you go about your job.

                                 EVAN
                        The real answer is that I’m 
                        neither. You used the word 
                        ‘manager.’ I’m not a great manager, 
                        but I try to be a great leader. And 
                        for me that’s going through the 
                        process of, not how to be a great 
                        CEO but how to be a great Evan.

                                 WALT
                        A great Evan, I like that. On that 
                        note, I think you have some 
                        exciting news to share with the 
                        audience, is that correct?

                                 EVAN
                        That's right.

                                 KARA
                            (to audience)
                        And just so you guys know, you are 
                        the first people to hear about 
                        this. 
                            (to in-house tech)
                        Can we get the big reveal on the 
                        screen please?

           The crowd cheers as A GIANT IMAGE OF SNAPCHAT STORIES IS 
           UNVEILED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON A PROJECTOR SCREEN.

                                 EVAN
                        I'm thrilled to announce that for 
                        the first time ever, Snapchat users 
                        will be able to add consecutive 
                        Snaps to a Story that lasts for 24-
                        hours. 

           Oos, ahs, chatter. 
                                 KARA
                        I have to say, this is a brilliant, 
                        elegant next step in Snapchat's 
                        evolution, and I've been a big 
                        naysayer in the past, as you know. 

           Laughter.

                                 EVAN
                        Happy to have finally won you over. 

                                 WALT
                        What was the inspiration here?

           Evan thinks...

                                 EVAN
                        Well, it started as a workaround to 
                        the conventional ad-model that we 
                        see at companies like Facebook and 
                        Twitter, where the advertisers are 
                        prioritized before users. But then 
                        it became so much more. While the 
                        idea of longer-lasting format 
                        bristled for some of my team, I 
                        pushed them to consider how it 
                        would inspire both our users and 
                        brands to get creative without 
                        interfering with the spirit of the 
                        app. 
                            (to audience)
                        So yeah, I hope you guys love it. 

           Loud applause.

           REVEAL LILY in the audience, the only person not clapping.

           building.

                        What books did Obama read in high 
                        school? What does the oldest person 
                        in the world eat for breakfast? The 
                        truth is, trying to find the logic 
                        in success is a dead-end. There is 
                        none, apart from deeply entrenched 
                        racial and gender biases. I could 
                        go into how Evan hired a man to 
                        head the Stories team, effectively 
                        demoting me for saving his 
                        company's ass and revolutionizing 
                        social media as we know it, but 
                        nobody has time for that.

                        Don't feel too bad for me, though. 
                        I also had stock in the company. 
                        Not as much as some people, but 
                        enough that I had to wait for the 
                        public offering before formally 
                        quitting.

           INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Evan stands bedside as his wife, supermodel MIRANDA KERR, 
           sweats and grunts in the throes of childbirth. One more push 
           and the baby's out, but not to worry, the uterine slime and 
           blood are mostly covered by -

           Evan kisses Miranda's head, and then the soft tiny crown of 
           his newborn son. Undisturbed bliss, if not for the familiar 
           sound of his manic tapping on the hospital bed frame. 

                                 EVAN
                        Be right back. 
           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As soon as the door shuts Evan pulls out his phone. He flips 
           through BAD PRESS like an addict reunited with his kit:

           He walks to a vending machine, still scrolling on phone. He 
           looks up briefly to check out the contents. 

           TWO YOUNG GIRLS SIT WITHIN EARSHOT, playing on their phones.

           Evan finds a one dollar bill in his wallet and enters it into 
           the machine. It spits it out. He flattens it on his thigh. 

                                 GIRL ONE
                        Are you uploading this to your 
                        story? 

           He smiles. 

                                 GIRL TWO
                        Yeah, InstaStories. It’s so much 
                        better than Snapchat.

                                 GIRL ONE
                        Oh yeah, I already deleted my Snap 
                        last week.

           The machine spits out his dollar again. 

           He shoves it back in. 

           It spits it out again.

                                 EPILOGUE

           SNAP-FILTER CHYRON OVER BLACK:

           Snapchat went public in 2017 at a 29 billion dollar 
           valuation.

           After the public sale, Evan and Bobby became the youngest 
           billionaires in the world.

           Since going public, Snapchat's Parent Company Has Shed $15 
           Billion in Market Cap. 

           In the words of the prophet, Kylie Jenner:

           “Sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it 
           just me... ugh this is so sad.”

           "Still love you tho snap ... my first love"
