           FADE IN:

           INT. ETHIOPIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           VERA (mid-20s, mixed race, tall and slim, aggressively hip) 
           sits at the bar, staring at her iPhone.

           She refreshes her Instagram feed in the hopes of revealing a 
           new “like” on her most recent post--one more empty hit of 
           dopamine to pass the time. 

           No dice. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Have you ever been on a blind date?

           The youthful voice that asks this question belongs to a 
           confident, seen-it-all confessor, who’ll serve as our guide 
           throughout the movie. We’ll meet him shortly. 

           GREG (late-20s, white, conservatively dressed, early onset 
           dadbod) enters the bar.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Before you’ve even said “hey” and 
                        leaned in for your first awkward 
                        side-hug, you’ve already made all 
                        kinds of snap judgments. 

           Greg spots Vera at the bar. He’s pleased. 

                                 GREG
                        Vera?

           An ON-SCREEN rundown reveals the instant data points on Vera 
           that have already downloaded inside Greg’s head. 

           SUPER: “Vera: Ultra-cool. Looks like a dancer. Freak in bed. 
           Yes.”

           He approaches her with both arms outstretched. She forces a 
           smile, trying in vain to mask her disappointment. 

                                 VERA
                        Greg. 

           Next, we see the data that’s downloaded inside Vera’s head, 
           as she sizes Greg up. 

           SUPER: “Greg: Conservative. Probably some finance douche. 
           Fucks like a sea urchin. Kill me now.”
           Vera rises from her bar stool, and they exchange an awkward 
           side-hug. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Those initial, surface-level 
                        impressions often turn out to be 
                        accurate. 

                                 GREG
                        Sorry, I’m a little late. 

                                 VERA
                        No, you’re right on time. My dance 
                        class got out early. 

           He smiles, pleased with himself for having guessed that she’s 
           a dancer. Vera, on the other hand, just wants to get this 
           over with. 

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Should we grab a table? 

           He brushes a hand against her shoulder. She arches her back, 
           like she just stepped into a freezing cold shower. 

           Greg pulls a chair out for Vera and motions for her to sit. 
           She rolls her eyes at the old-fashioned gesture. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        But other times, our instincts turn 
                        out to be completely wrong. Think 
                        about it. If love at first sight 
                        were all it took, what would be the 
                        point of dating? Why would anyone 
                        waste precious time on actually 
                        getting to know someone they’ve 
                        already pre-judged? 

           Greg takes a seat across from Vera, who begins scrutinizing 
           the Ethiopian menu. 

                                 VERA
                             (dubiously)
                        Hope you’re OK with Ethiopian food. 

                                 GREG
                        Actually, I was psyched you picked 
                        this place. I did Peace Corps in 
                        Oromia. 

                                 VERA
                        You’ve spent time in Ethiopia? 
                                 GREG
                        Yeah, but I haven’t had decent 
                        cacabsa since I’ve been back. I’m 
                        so hungry. 

           Vera looks pleasantly surprised. Maybe this guy’s not as 
           terrible as she thought. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Gender, age, race, height, weight, 
                        hair color, voice, laugh, body 
                        language, body type, body odor. 
                        These are all quantitative data 
                        points that we immediately pick up 
                        on right away. And whether we admit 
                        it or not, we use them to make snap 
                        judgments about a person. Companies 
                        who want to sell you something and 
                        political campaigns who want your 
                        vote have been doing the same thing 
                        for a long time. Because it tends 
                        to work. But only some of the time. 

           Vera takes a sip of water and leans forward in her chair, 
           ready to give this a shot now. 

                                 VERA
                        How long have you been in London?

                                 GREG
                        About a year. But I’ve lived all 
                        over the place. I get bored staying 
                        in one place pretty easily. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The only way to really get to know 
                        someone is by asking them 
                        questions. Their unique answers to 
                        these questions are the difference 
                        between a 28-year-old, 
                        conservatively dressed white guy 
                        and this particular 28-year-old, 
                        conservatively dressed white guy. 
                        Living, breathing human beings are 
                        more than their demographic groups. 

                                 VERA
                        So what’s the most interesting 
                        country you’ve lived in?

                                 GREG
                        Good question. Probably Bosnia, but 
                        not for the reasons you’d expect. 
                                 VERA
                        Isn’t it still kind of unsafe 
                        there? 

                                 GREG
                        Not unless you’re allergic to folk 
                        music. 

                                 VERA
                             (laughing)
                        My training’s in hip-hop, but I’ve 
                        never broken out into hives at the 
                        sound of a fiddle.  

                                 GREG
                        Hip-hop. Very cool. Who’re your 
                        favorite up-and-coming rappers? 

           She begins to answer, now enjoying the date every bit as much 
           as he is, if not more so. 

           INT. ETHIOPIAN RESTAURANT - LATER

           Vera and Greg are at the bar now, indulging in what appears 
           to be their second or third post-dinner cocktail, and eye-
           fucking each other aggressively. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The questions we ask on a date are 
                        usually pretty basic at first. But 
                        the more time you spend with 
                        someone, the longer you engage with 
                        them, the more personal those 
                        questions become. And the more 
                        revealing the answers are. 

                                 VERA
                        So, what are you most afraid of? 

                                 GREG
                        Snakes, public speaking, and 
                        getting sucked out of a plane in 
                        mid-air. 

                                 VERA
                        In that order? 

                                 GREG
                        Reverse order, actually. 

           She grabs him by the elbow, and leans in closely.
                                 VERA
                        Are you into EDM at all? 

                                 GREG
                        Not really. 

                                 VERA
                        Oh, because there’s this DJ I know 
                        who’s playing a late-night set, 
                        down the street. No snakes. 
                        Promise. 

                                 GREG
                        I’d be down to check it out. 

           She smiles, as they grab their coats. Success. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        You see what just happened there? 
                        Greg is not actually into EDM. He 
                        said so himself! But he is into 
                        Vera. And by asking him lots of 
                        questions, Vera has already learned 
                        enough about Greg to know that he’s 
                        more adventurous than he looks. 

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Thumping beat. Strobe lights. A sea of legs. Beads of sweat 
           rolling off faces and shoulders. 

           Greg is loving it, dancing like a maniac as he has his arms 
           wrapped around Vera’s waist. 

                                 GREG 
                        This is incredible. 

                                 VERA
                        I knew you’d like it. 

           She pulls him in close, and they embark on a drunken, sloppy 
           make out, their legs still pulsing along with the beat. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        In dating, the accumulation and 
                        exploitation of data gleaned from 
                        personality-revealing questions 
                        often leads to mutually-beneficial 
                        outcomes. In other words--

                                 VERA
                        Let’s go back to my place. 
                                 GREG
                        Let’s go back to your place. 

           She grabs his hand and guides him toward the exit. 

           INT. VERA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Vera and Greg are going at it. She’s on top. 

           Vera screams and then covers her own mouth, as if she’s 
           shocked by how much she’s into him. 

                                 VERA
                        Honestly, when I first saw you walk 
                        into that restaurant--

                                 GREG
                        I know! I thought you--

                                                          GREG
                                              --were gonna be great in bed. 
                           VERA
           --probably fucked like a sea 
           urchin. 

           She rolls off of him, as they both break out into hysterical 
           laughter. 

                                 CHRIS (V.O.)
                        But when it comes to the 
                        psychological footprints that we 
                        all leave behind online, believe me 
                        when I tell you that it’s not all 
                        orgasms and giggles. 

           INT. FASHION SHOWROOM - NIGHT

           Under a sexy beat, a spotlight illuminates the catwalk in an 
           otherwise dark showroom. 

           A stone-faced FEMALE MODEL struts down the runway, sporting a 
           convoluted ensemble of scarves, ribbons, and errant pieces of 
           fabric that somehow come together to form an outfit. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        There are some very unscrupulous, 
                        very rich, very powerful people out 
                        there who’ve figured out how to use 
                        that personal data to size you up 
                        and then convince you to do things 
                        that you otherwise wouldn’t. I 
                        should know. I was one of them. 
           TITLE: “ANALYTICA”

           As the model makes her turn on the runway, the spotlight 
           shifts to the back of the room where our narrator, Chris 
           Wylie (29), is observing the fashion show. 

           With his bright-pink hair, horseshoe nose ring, neon-yellow 
           graphic T-shirt, carefully manicured beard, and large-framed 
           glasses, Wylie presents a picture-perfect--if deeply 
           contrived--image of a hacker-chic Millennial troublemaker. 

           Wylie speaks STRAIGHT TO CAMERA. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        My name is Chris Wylie. I’m the gay 
                        Canadian vegan who somehow ended up 
                        creating Steve Bannon’s right-wing 
                        psychological warfare mindfuck 
                        tool. A real-life, high-tech 
                        brainwashing tool that enabled 
                        greedy corporations and deranged 
                        politicians to play off of our 
                        worst instincts and pit us all 
                        against each other. 

           An annoyed FASHION DESIGNER who’s sitting within earshot of 
           Wylie shushes him, as the show continues. 

           Wylie lowers his voice.

                        I didn’t mean to do it. But I take 
                        full responsibility, and I’m really 
                        sorry. I also know that “sorry” 
                        wasn’t much of an excuse for Dr. 
                        Frankenstein either. I’m telling 
                        you all of this because I want you 
                        to know just how bad it really was 
                        and how much worse it might get. 

           A SECURITY GUARD taps Wylie firmly on the shoulder, 
           indicating that it’s time for him to leave. When our narrator 
           hesitates for a mere moment, the guard starts pushing him 
           toward the exit. 

           Wylie continues to speak to us, as he’s being physically 
           removed from the fashion show.  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I always wanted to work in fashion. 
                        And everything could’ve been 
                        different, if I’d just stayed 
                        focused on that.

                        Kind of like what they say about 
                        Fidel Castro and baseball. 

           EXT. CUBAN BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

           An old-timey MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SCOUT looks on, as young 
           FIDEL CASTRO takes a practice swing at the plate. 

           The PITCHER winds up and throws a curve ball. Young Castro 
           makes solid contact with the pitch, but he lines it right to 
           the THIRD BASEMAN. 

           The Major League scout shakes his head, as he makes a note. 
           Castro retreats to the dugout, dejected. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Not that I’m comparing myself to 
                        Castro. That olive-green uniform? 
                        No. Just no. 

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           We’re now in a Canadian classroom filled with six-year-old 
           STUDENTS. Their TEACHER is going over a list of spelling 
           words written on the blackboard. 

                                 TEACHER
                        Ball. Call. Fall. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        When I was six, I was abused by a 
                        mentally unstable person at my 
                        elementary school, which 
                        administrators then tried to cover 
                        up. I’m also dyslexic and suffer 
                        from ADHD, which made for a 
                        particularly potent one-two punch 
                        for bullies in the classroom. 

           Sitting in the back row, SIX-YEAR-OLD CHRIS WYLIE (chubby, 
           long hair, and deeply unsure of himself) struggles to read 
           along with the teacher, mouthing the words to himself aloud. 

                                 TEACHER
                        Can anyone think of another word 
                        that ends in “all”? 

           A bunch of eager little hands shoot up. Young Wylie raises 
           his hand hesitantly. 

                                 TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Chris. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        All-so?

           A smattering of giggles reverberates around the classroom. 
           Wylie clams up and shrinks into his seat. 

                                 TEACHER
                        Good guess, but we’re looking for 
                        words that end in “all.” 

           A YOUNG BOY sitting near Wylie leans into whisper into his 
           friend’s ear. 

                                 YOUNG BOY
                        Bet he’s gonna pee his pants. 

           Young Wylie’s breathing picks up, like he’s about to have a 
           panic attack. 

           INT. GYM - DAY

           Six-year-old Wylie participates in a game of tag with his 
           fellow students. He’s so uncoordinated, he can barely run up 
           and down the court without tripping over his own feet. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The thing about being bullied is 
                        that it takes away your self-worth--
                        that deep-seated human need to feel 
                        valued. And for a kid, that’s 
                        utterly devastating. 

           A YOUNG GIRL tags Wylie, but she pushes him too hard. He 
           falls to the floor in a discombobulated heap of elbows and 
           knees. 

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Oh, sorry, Chris! 

           Wylie winces in pain, as a MEAN BOY towers over him. 

                                 MEAN BOY
                        Chris got beat up by a girl! 

           The mean boy begins to laugh, encouraging his friends to do 
           the same. 

                                 MEAN BOY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe he is a girl. He looks like 
                        one. 

           The GYM TEACHER pulls the mean boy away, as Wylie’s breathing 
           grows heavier. 
                                 GYM TEACHER
                        Are you OK?

           Wylie tries to answer, but he can’t. He starts to 
           hyperventilate. 

           The gym teacher turns to an AIDE. 

                                 GYM TEACHER (CONT’D)
                        Call an ambulance. 

           The aide runs back out of the gym to the nearest phone, as 
           the gym teacher crouches down and tries to help Wylie.

           The helpless little boy continues to wheeze and gasp for air.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Bullying destroys a lot of kids, 
                        especially gay ones. But I was 
                        lucky. With my parents’ help, I 
                        decided that I was going to fight 
                        back. Not by being tougher than the 
                        bullies, but by being smarter than 
                        them. 

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Flanked by his concerned-looking MOM and DAD, FOURTEEN-YEAR-
           OLD CHRIS WYLIE (just starting to come into his own as a 
           gangly teenager) stands before a JUDGE, arguing his own case. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        When I was 14, I sued the British 
                        Columbia Ministry of Education to 
                        force them to change their policies 
                        on bullying and inclusion. 

           Fourteen-year-old Wylie raises a finger in the air. 

                                 FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD CHRIS WYLIE
                        Your honor, bullying is a crime 
                        against our humanity, and it is 
                        time to restore some sanity. 
                        Because this is not just about 
                        vanity. 

           The judge furrows his brow, but he clearly admires the kid’s 
           pluck. He bangs his gavel. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        In spite of my painfully earnest 
                        attempts to mimic Johnnie Cochran, 
                        I won. 
           Wylie embraces his parents. 

           EXT. CANADIAN PARLIAMENT HILL - DAY

           Wearing a well-fitted suit, slim tie, and a bright-pink nose 
           ring, NINETEEN-YEAR-OLD CHRIS WYLIE approaches the imposingly 
           austere towers of Canada’s Parliament Building, perched high 
           above the banks of the Ottawa River. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I’ve always been in a hurry, and 
                        while I don’t recommend it, I 
                        dropped out of high school when I 
                        was 16. I started getting serious 
                        about a career in fashion a couple 
                        years after that. But since I can 
                        never do one thing at a time, I 
                        also taught myself how to code. 

           Wylie walks into the Parliament Building. 

           INT. CANADIAN PARLIAMENT - DAY

           Nineteen-year-old Wylie sits at a computer, showing a group 
           of fellow INTERNS an online fundraising tool that he’s 
           building for the Liberal Democratic Party.  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        It was my experience in court that 
                        led me to give politics a shot, and 
                        I started as an intern for the 
                        Liberal Democratic Party in Ottawa. 
                        I was still very young and very 
                        idealistic. I wanted to use my 
                        coding skills to make life a little 
                        more tolerable for gay kids like 
                        me. Rather noble of me, wasn’t it? 

           INT. OBAMA PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The iconic “Hope” poster, homemade “Obama 2008” campaign 
           signs, and volunteer canvassing lists adorn the walls. 

           The 2008 Obama campaign’s National Targeting Director KEN 
           STRASMA (50s) stands before a blue and red map of the United 
           States. 

                                 KEN STRASMA
                        Senator Obama likes to talk about 
                        the audacity of hope, which is why 
                        we’re all here.

                                 KEN STRASMA (CONT'D)
                        But what I want to do now is talk a 
                        little about the audacity to win. 

           Nineteen-year-old Chris Wylie is among the young Obama 
           campaign volunteers, who’re taking notes on Strasma’s 
           presentation. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Through my connections with the 
                        Liberal Dems, I got a volunteer 
                        job, working under Ken Strasma, 
                        whose revolutionary microtargeting 
                        techniques helped get Barack Obama 
                        elected President in 2008. I 
                        learned a lot from Ken, and it felt 
                        great to be a part of something so 
                        world-changing. But I had a 
                        sneaking suspicion that we were 
                        only scratching the surface of what 
                        was becoming possible in the brave 
                        new world of data mining. 

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE LAB - DAY

           Two Cambridge University PSYCHOLOGISTS (MICHAL KOSINSKI and 
           DAVID STILLWELL) look on as a FEMALE UNDERGRADUATE sits at a 
           computer, answering a series of personality-based questions. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Across the pond, a couple of 
                        Cambridge psychologists were 
                        experimenting with new ways of 
                        studying personality. Their idea 
                        was to quantify it by measuring how 
                        people scored on the “big five” 
                        personality traits: Openness, 
                        Conscientiousness, Extroversion, 
                        Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. 
                        OCEAN, for short. 

           ON THE UNDERGRADUATE’S COMPUTER SCREEN

           The OCEAN personality test includes statements like, “I often 
           feel overwhelmed when many people are around” and “I would 
           rather be called practical than inventive.”

           The student moves her cursor left or right to indicate the 
           extent to which she disagrees or agrees with each assertion 
           “moderately” or “strongly.” 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The OCEAN Test ended up going viral 
                        on Facebook as an app, which the 
                        Cambridge psychologists marketed as 
                        a fun way to pass the time and 
                        learn a bit about yourself. They 
                        called it, “myPersonality.” 

           MONTAGE: Young Facebook users answer questions on the OCEAN 
           test and then forward the app to their friends with messages 
           like, “Hey, this is pretty cool” and “Check out this test. I 
           told you I’m an extrovert!” 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Almost half of the people who 
                        completed the test consented to 
                        give the researchers access to 
                        their Facebook data to “further 
                        build their personality profiles.” 
                        Now, for the first time ever, 
                        psychologists had developed a way 
                        to correlate millions of people’s 
                        personality traits with what they 
                        had “liked” on Facebook. 

           ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

           A graph depicts the results of a study, which correlates 
           Facebook “likes” with specific personality traits.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        They found that Facebook “likes” 
                        could be used to predict everything 
                        from a person’s use of addictive 
                        substance to, yes, their political 
                        views. And some of the results were 
                        rather surprising. For example, 
                        “liking” curly fries was closely 
                        linked to high intelligence. If a 
                        subject had “liked” at least 100 
                        things on Facebook, researchers 
                        found that they could glean as 
                        accurate a depiction of that 
                        individual’s personality traits as 
                        the one that their own spouse could 
                        provide.

                        The U.S. military was among the 
                        first institutions to realize the 
                        potential of this ground-breaking 
                        research.

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           Typing vigorously on his laptop, Wylie is seated in the back 
           row of the lecture, looking like he’s taking notes. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        But I would soon discover myself 
                        that the implications went far 
                        beyond actual warfare. 

           A LAW PROFESSOR (late 60s with a wild, unkempt mane) keeps 
           looking up at Wylie as he drones on.  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I moved to the U.K. when I was 20 
                        to begin studying law at the London 
                        School of Economics. Not bad for a 
                        high school dropout, eh? 

           ON WYLIE’S LAPTOP SCREEN

           We see that he is coding, rather than taking notes on the 
           professor’s lecture. 

                                 LAW PROFESSOR 
                        Mr. Wylie. 

           Wylie stops typing suddenly and looks up. 

                                 LAW PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        What are the objectives that the 
                        court infers, which are not within 
                        the policies and goals of this 
                        particular statute?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                             (without skipping a beat)
                        The court appears to be especially 
                        concerned that freedom of 
                        association is not infringed upon, 
                        determining that the legislative 
                        body has not seen fit to compel a 
                        citizen to control any other 
                        parties who may be engaging in 
                        illegal activity.
                                 LAW PROFESSOR
                        Very good, Mr. Wylie. 

           Wylie returns to his coding, pleased with himself. But then--

                                 LAW PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        What you just said makes absolutely 
                        no sense whatsoever. 

           Uh oh. Wylie looks up from his computer again. Maybe he’s not 
           as smart as he thinks he is. 

                                 LAW PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        But you’ve proven yourself to be an 
                        expert bullshitter. One of the most 
                        important qualities in a lawyer. 

           A couple of Wylie’s fellow students giggle. Others dutifully 
           take notes on what the professor just said. 

                                 LAW PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t write that down. 

           INT. LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS COMPUTER LAB - DAY

           Wylie shows a bunch of his fellow young COMPUTER CODERS a new 
           algorithm-based PLATFORM that he’s begun working on. At the 
           bottom of the platform is a line that says, “By Chris Wylie.” 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I may not have devoted my best 
                        efforts to learning about the law, 
                        but by the time the first major 
                        paper on the OCEAN Test was 
                        published in 2013, I was beginning 
                        to make a name for myself in the 
                        insular little world of coders on 
                        campus. 

           The other coders are deeply impressed with Wylie’s work. One 
           of the nerdier-looking ones in the group puts his hand up for 
           an awkward high-five, and Wylie obliges. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        For the first time in my life, I 
                        was the coolest kid among my peers. 
                        Nerdy peers, no doubt, but still. 
                        It was an intoxicating feeling, and 
                        I wanted more. The Cambridge paper 
                        on the OCEAN test got my attention, 
                        and I started to wonder about other 
                        real-world applications for this 
                        psychographic research. 
           EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

           Still standing outside the fashion show that he’s just been 
           kicked out of, our narrator lights a cigarette and takes a 
           puff.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        As I was finishing law school, I 
                        began working on my PhD in fashion 
                        trend forecasting at the University 
                        of the Arts London because it’s 
                        impossible for me to focus on just 
                        one thing at a time. And also 
                        because I wanted options.

           Wylie is intensely aware of the camera that he’s speaking to. 
           He’s trying his very best to look cool, even as he confesses 
           his deepest insecurities. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to be able to tell you 
                        that I set out to use my political 
                        campaign experience and coding 
                        skills to connect people. To make 
                        the world a better place. You know, 
                        the kind of trite talking points 
                        that every billionaire Silicon 
                        Valley tech bro trots out whenever 
                        he has to explain why his insidious 
                        company should be spared any 
                        meaningful government regulation. 

           He takes another long drag from his cigarette.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m gonna be real with you 
                        here. I wanted to build something 
                        that would make people say, “Wow.” 
                        I wanted to be important. I wanted 
                        the world to love and appreciate 
                        me. When it all comes down to it, 
                        isn’t that what we all want? 

           Wylie shrugs nonchalantly and walks out of frame. 

           INT. LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The adult version of Chris Wylie, sans the pink hair (we’ll 
           see him in this natural blonde color from now until the final 
           act), strolls into the austere, brick headquarters of the 
           U.K.’s third most powerful political party. 

           Super: “2013.” 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I started with the Liberal Dems, 
                        figuring that the U.K.’s most 
                        progressive party would be most 
                        open to my brand new ideas. 

           INT. LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Wylie sits at a conference table with an open binder in front 
           of him labeled, “Liberal Dems Meeting.” 

           He’s wrapping up his sales pitch to two Liberal Democratic 
           Party officials. The first is a SENIOR STRATEGIST (60s, white 
           male, barely paying attention). The second is a Liberal 
           Democratic SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR (black female, early 30s, 
           much more interested in what Wylie has to say). 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                        The recent psychographic research 
                        is conclusive. And I truly believe 
                        that if the Liberal Dems seize this 
                        rare opportunity to be the first 
                        out of the gate to use it, the 
                        party will be well-positioned to 
                        defeat the Tories and Labour going 
                        forward. 

           Wylie closes his binder and waits for a response to his 
           pitch. A long, painful silence hangs in the air. 

                                 SENIOR STRATEGIST
                        Well. I’ll be honest, Mr. Wylie.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’ve always found honesty to be the 
                        best approach. 

                                 SENIOR STRATEGIST
                        I’ve been in British politics for 
                        over three decades. And this is the 
                        first time I’ve ever even heard the 
                        word, “Psychographics.”

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Hence, the opportunity. You don’t 
                        want to be caught fighting the next 
                        war with cavalry while your 
                        opponents are using tanks, do you? 

                                 SENIOR STRATEGIST
                        Mmhm. 
                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR 
                        It’s certainly fascinating. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It is. And I’ve actually been beta 
                        testing a platform in my spare time 
                        that would combine results from the 
                        personality test with an algorithm--

                                 SENIOR STRATEGIST
                        In your spare time? That’s the 
                        spare time you have, while pursuing 
                        your PhD in ...

           He glances at Wylie’s CV.

                                 SENIOR STRATEGIST (CONT’D)
                        Fashion trend forecasting?

           Exasperated, Wylie takes a breath.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        The way I see it, sir, is you have 
                        two options. Option 1: Hire me to 
                        build a platform for the party that 
                        will provide accurate psychological 
                        profiles on the British electorate. 
                        You can then use that platform to 
                        create individually-tailored 
                        messages that will be most 
                        persuasive in targeting voters. Or 
                        Option 2: Wish me a good day, show 
                        me the door, and lose half of your 
                        seats in the next general election. 

           The senior strategist lets out a chortle and then rises to 
           his feet. He extends a hand toward Wylie, who shakes it. 

                                 SENIOR STRATEGIST
                        Thank you very much for coming in, 
                        Mr. Wylie. We’ll be sure to get 
                        back to you. 

           Wylie shoots the young social media coordinator a look and 
           then heads for the door. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        He didn’t get back to me. And the 
                        Liberal Democrats didn’t end up 
                        losing half of their seats in the 
                        next general election. They lost 86 
                        percent of them. 
           EXT. LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Wylie exits the building with a tote bag slung over his 
           shoulder.

           Before he can get more than a couple of steps, the door to 
           the swings open after him, and the party’s young social media 
           coordinator follows behind him. 

                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR 
                        Hold up. 

           Wylie turns.

                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that. The Party 
                        hierarchy’s pretty old-school. We 
                        just got rid of our dial-up 
                        Internet last week. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        No wonder I kept getting a busy 
                        signal.  

                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR
                        Listen, I think there’s someone you 
                        should talk to. Have you heard of a 
                        company called SCL? 

           Wylie shakes his head. 

                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR (CONT’D)
                        We’ve done a couple of projects 
                        with them. They work in campaigns 
                        all around the world, and they’re 
                        very open to new ideas. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What kinds of campaigns?

                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR
                        That’s the thing. I don’t really 
                        know. They’re pretty secretive 
                        about what they do. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Intriguing. 

                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR
                        The CEO is a guy called Alexander 
                        Nix. He’s a bit ... stuffy. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Stuffy and I don’t usually mix. 
                                 SOCIAL MEDIA COORDINATOR
                        I think he’ll really like you. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                             (trying to play it cool)
                        Feel free to pass along my CV. But 
                        I’m not sure the political world is 
                        ready for what I have to offer. 

           He gives her a goodbye nod and continues on his way.

           High-end boutiques line the pedestrian shopping street in the 
           heart of London’s Soho neighborhood. 

           Wylie is being guided by his fashion school PhD ADVISER 
           (40s), a melodramatic man in a black cape, who closely 
           resembles a hairless cat. 

           The adviser scans their surroundings intently, as though he’s 
           trying to identify something that’s vital but elusive.  

                                 PHD ADVISER
                        Of course, fashion forecasters keep 
                        tabs on Instagram trendsetters, 
                        industry-approved bloggers, and the 
                        like. But for the very best in the 
                        business, the process of 
                        identifying an emerging trend boils 
                        down to one thing only: the 
                        unquantifiable art of relentless 
                        street observation in the 
                        neighborhoods that matter. I like 
                        to call it “hunting and gathering.”

           The adviser suddenly points out a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN who’s 
           crossing the street. 

                                 PHD ADVISER (CONT’D)
                        Her. 

           The woman is wearing crocs, department-store jeans, and a 
           baggie sweatshirt. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Her?

                                 PHD ADVISER
                        Normcore. Dressing like a middle-
                        aged mum, who works at the bank in 
                        Coventry. That right there. You’re 
                        looking at the next big thing. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Yeah? I’ve seen a few of my 
                        classmates dressing like that 
                        actually. Crocs, baggy jeans, 
                        comfortable sweatshirts. 

                                 PHD ADVISER
                             (pleased with himself)
                        Ah, you see?  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I thought you said normcore was 
                        going to be the next big thing. 

           The adviser stops in his tracks, annoyed by Wylie’s attitude. 

                                 PHD ADVISER
                        Well, you’re in art school. The 
                        trend hasn’t exactly entered the 
                        mainstream yet, has it? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        But it will, very soon. Right?

                                 PHD ADVISER
                        If you’re hoping to learn what the 
                        future holds way down the line, I’d 
                        suggest you consult a fortune 
                        teller, rather than continuing to 
                        pursue your PhD. The time frames we 
                        work in are fairly limited. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Actually, I’m developing an online 
                        platform that uses people’s basic 
                        personality traits to predict their 
                        future behaviors. When it’s 
                        finished, I’m quite sure it’ll have 
                        applications in figuring out what 
                        styles people will want to wear 
                        months--even years--before they 
                        begin to think about buying new 
                        clothes. 

           The adviser scoffs. 

                                 PHD ADVISER
                        Let me give you some advice, Chris. 
                        I know you’re spending lots of 
                        money on tuition, but here’s the 
                        reality of trend forecasting: It’s 
                        about personal intuition. Having an 
                        eye for what’s next. Either you 
                        have it, or you don’t.

                        Do you think Gianni Versace used 
                        algorithms to figure out what was 
                        going to be the next big thing? 

           Wylie thinks about it for a moment. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Probably not. But he’s been dead 
                        for almost two decades, hasn’t he? 

           The adviser storms off. This kid is helpless. 

           INT. CAMPUS CAFE - DAY

           Fellow ART STUDENTS chat with one another, as Wylie sits 
           alone with earbuds in, a cup of tea in hand, and his laptop 
           open to--what else--the platform that he’s been working on. 

                                 Chris Wylie (V.O.)
                        The Liberal Dems didn’t want me. 
                        The fashion industry was laughing 
                        at me. 

           Wylie’s cell phone buzzes on the table. He looks at it and 
           sees that the incoming call is from an unknown number. He 
           hits “END” and turns his focus back to his coding. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The only thing I could do was to 
                        just keep working. 

           Wylie’s phone buzzes again. Same unknown number. He sighs, 
           annoyed to be taken away from his work, and answers it. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                             Hello.

           INT. ALEXANDER NIX’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The  minimalist, tasteful layout exudes wealth and power. 
           Floor-to-ceiling windows offer a sweeping view of London. 

           Wearing a headset, SCL Group Director ALEXANDER NIX (38) 
           paces in front of his standing desk. With his dirty-blonde 
           hair parted neatly to the side, Nix wears an expensive suit 
           that accentuates his slender frame.

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                             (upper-class English 
                              accent)
                        Mr. Wylie. 
           INTERCUT ALEXANDER NIX AND CHRIS WYLIE

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Ah, so she did give you my CV. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Yes, and I’ve reviewed your 
                        credentials. They are certainly 
                        atypical. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I do appreciate a good backhanded 
                        compliment. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Don’t get me wrong. I’m fascinated 
                        by the work you’ve been doing in 
                        the field of psychographics. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        When do you want me to start? 

           Nix is taken aback. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I’m sorry? I haven’t even made you 
                        an offer. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        But you’re calling. Which means 
                        you’ve done your research, which 
                        means you understand the real-world 
                        applications of the platform I’ve 
                        been developing. Which means you’re 
                        definitely going to make me an 
                        offer, unless you’re an idiot. And 
                        you don’t sound like an idiot. A 
                        bit straight-laced and pompous for 
                        my liking, but definitely not an 
                        idiot. 

           A long silence hangs in the air. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        How’s Monday?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Monday works. And my title? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        “Senior Associate.” 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’d prefer Research Director. 
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        That should be fine. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’ve done some research of my own 
                        by the way. On SCL.

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Well, it is probably a good thing 
                        to know a bit about the company 
                        you’re going to be working for. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        You like to brag to your clients 
                        about how you conduct “information 
                        warfare.” That sounds pretty 
                        violent. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        It’s not actual warfare. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What kind of black-ups are we 
                        talking about here? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Opposition research. It’s a fairly 
                        standard practice in this field. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Do you entrap your opponents? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        No.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Frighten voters? Use their 
                        vulnerabilities against them?

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        If you have moral qualms, you 
                        should know that we don’t lie. We 
                        don’t cheat. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I don’t have moral qualms. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I can’t tell whether or not you’re 
                        being serious. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Maybe that’s the idea. 
           Nix isn’t sure what to make of this guy now, but he knows for 
           certain that he wants him on his side. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        We’ll give you total freedom. 
                        Experiment all you want. Come and 
                        test out all of your crazy ideas 
                        with a nice salary and a big 
                        office, instead of a dorm room. 

           Wylie thinks it over for a beat. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Corner office. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Now you’re pushing it. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’m not the easiest guy to work 
                        with. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Neither am I. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I know that. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        You don’t even know my name.

                        country, even though it’s 
                        supposedly the 21st century. Eton

                        Can’t wait. 

           Just as Nix is about to hang up--

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I butter my own toast. 

           He hangs up. Wylie puts his headphones back in and returns to 
           his coding. 

           INT. SCL GROUP HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           DAPHNE (late-20s, black), SCL’s perceptive and skeptical 
           office manager, guides Wylie into his pristine office, which 
           overlooks the U.K. branches of Google and LinkedIn. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Men’s toilet is down the hall to 
                        the left. I have your computer log-
                        in set up, but let me know if you 
                        need help with any tech stuff. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I think I’m OK on the tech stuff. 

           She’s not impressed.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’ve been onboarding new employees 
                        at SCL for almost three years. 
                        You’re the first one with a nose 
                        ring. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Are they against company policy?
                                 DAPHNE
                        Why did someone like you take a job 
                        like this? Please don’t say, “to 
                        change the world.”

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        To change the world. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        You must know this place is knee-
                        deep in some really shady stuff. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Maybe I’m prepared to go over to 
                        the dark side first, and then I’ll 
                        cleanse my soul with other projects 
                        later. 

           She nods. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Evil pays better than good does. 
                        See ya around. 

           She exits abruptly, leaving Wylie alone in his new office. 

           He throws his bag onto his desk and walks over to the window, 
           taking in the view.  

           There is a quick “knock, knock” on Wylie’s door, and 
           Alexander Nix enters, a manila envelope in hand. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Getting settled in, are we? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I like Daphne. She’s sassy, like 
                        me.  

           Nix places the envelope on Wylie’s desk. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        If you’d care to familiarize 
                        yourself with our most important 
                        clients.

           Wylie returns to his desk and opens the envelope. 

           He sifts through its contents--a mix of campaign literature 
           and photographs of world leaders and potential world leaders. 

           His eyes settle on one particular photo of a smiling African 
           man in traditional dress and a black fedora. 
                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        Goodluck Jonathan. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                             (confused)
                        Is Jonathan my new code name?  

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        No, Goodluck Jonathan happens to be 
                        the President of Nigeria, as well 
                        as an SCL client. He’s up for 
                        reelection a year from now. A good 
                        Christian man in a country that’s 
                        51 percent Christian, 49 percent 
                        Islamic. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        That sounds convenient. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Potentially. We don’t like to rely 
                        on 51/49 splits here, but if that’s 
                        what we end up with, we’re quite 
                        alright with it. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Divide and conquer. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Indeed.

           Wylie lands on a photo of a different African leader--a 
           husky, tough-looking guy in a suit and tie. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’ve been following that race a bit 
                        on the BBC. He’s up for reelection 
                        this year, right? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                             (nodding)
                        We worked on his first campaign, as 
                        well. Your predecessor was quite 
                        effective in segmenting the Kenyan 
                        electorate into key target 
                        audiences for our digital ads. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        My predecessor? I’d love to look 
                        over his work. 
           At that request, Nix suddenly looks cagey, though it’s 
           unclear why. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Yes, well he identified the youth 
                        vote as being particularly key to 
                        Kenyatta’s party, the TNA. We’ve 
                        got a big social media campaign in 
                        the works down there. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        So why doesn’t he still work here?

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Who?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        My predecessor.

           Nix averts his eyes. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I’ll tell you more about it later. 
                        Shall we? I’ll introduce you to the 
                        rest of the team at the 10am 
                        meeting.

           Nix turns to leave, but then remembers one last thing. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and there’s someone coming in 
                        from America tomorrow, whom you 
                        should meet. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Who’s that? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        No one you’d know. He’s called 
                        Steve. Interesting chap. 

           INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT - DAY

           Jet-lagged, transatlantic business-class PASSENGERS pour out 
           of the gate from their arriving flight.

           Among them is Breitbart News executive chairman STEVE BANNON 
           (59), red circles ringing his weary eyes. Dressed in cargo 
           shorts, sandals, and two layers of wrinkled, button-down 
           shirts, which accentuate his protruding gut, Bannon looks 
           like he slept in a trash can instead of a plane. 
           In spite of his haggard appearance, Bannon walks and talks 
           like a man with boundless energy, dragging his carry-on bag 
           with three newspapers tucked under his arm and a cell phone 
           pressed to his ear. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                             (into his phone)
                        What’s with that snooze-fest of an 
                        image we have up on the home page 
                        right now? The one of Mitch 
                        McConnell looking like a deranged 
                        reptilian automation at that 
                        geriatric fundraising jerkoff 
                        session in Georgetown. 

           A beat. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        Well, it’s making me want to cut 
                        your dick off and serve it to you 
                        for breakfast. Swap it out with 
                        some scary-looking shit. We’re 
                        talking about immigration policy 
                        here. I want to see some Mexican 
                        gangbangers covered head to toe in 
                        prison tattoos, pronto. 

           Bannon approaches a coffee stand and puts his hand over his 
           cell phone to place an order. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        Espresso. Quadruple shot. 

           He fishes his wallet out of his cargo shorts pocket, as he 
           waits for his drink. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        And what’s going on with the 
                        “Islamization of America” series? 
                        We need to fast-track that baby 
                        before Sharia Law gets implemented, 
                        and we’re stoned to death for 
                        publishing it. 

           Bannon takes his quadruple espresso and make his way toward 
           baggage claim. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        This is the kind of punch-you-in-
                        the-face shit that’s gonna drive 
                        traffic, as we expand into the U.K. 
                        and--
           The ANGRY CHANTS of a small but angry group of people in 
           baggage claim stop Bannon in his tracks. It’s a bit hard to 
           hear at first, but eventually we can tell that they’re 
           chanting, “Scum! Scum! Scum!”

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        Sounds like my ride’s here. Bye. 

           Bannon puts the phone back in his cargo shorts pocket. 

           INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bannon descends the escalator and is met at the floor below 
           by four ANGRY HECKLERS, who’ve encircled an unassuming middle-
           aged man in a double-breasted suit. The man they’ve 
           surrounded is NIGEL FARAGE (51), the controversial leader of 
           the right-wing, anti-immigrant UK Independence Party (UKIP).

                                 HECKLERS
                        Scum! Scum! Scum! Scum!

           Trying to find the hecklers off is Farange’s reactionary 
           young compatriot and unofficial handler, RAHEEM KASSAM (28, 
           upper-class English, south Asian descent), who wears the 
           tweed jacket of a man five decades his senior.

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        Yes, that’s quite civil of you all. 
                        Very polite. 

           A YOUNG HECKLER shoulders his way past Kassam and shoves a 
           finger in Farage’s face. 

                                 YOUNG HECKLER
                        Your party is full of racists, 
                        fascists, and Holocausts deniers.  

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        I’ve heard that one before.

                                 YOUNG HECKLER
                        Yeah?

           Kassam steps in front of the heckler. 

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        I take it you don’t have the 
                        education to come up with any 
                        references outside of the obvious 
                        tropes from the Second World War? 
                                 YOUNG HECKLER
                        Fuck you. Your family must be 
                        ashamed of you. 

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        Who’s the racist now? 

           A SECOND HECKLER (an older woman in a wheelchair) approaches 
           Farage. 

                                 WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR
                             (Scottish accent)
                        You’re not welcome here. 

           Farage smirks at her condescendingly. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        Oh, I’m quite sorry. I didn’t know 
                        you owned Heathrow Airport.

                                 WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR
                        You’re a bawbag, Nigel. 

           Farage smiles, as she wheels herself away in disgust.

           Bannon approaches Farrage, who exudes pure delight at the 
           sight of his American friend. The two men shake hands.

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        Mr. Bannon. Perfect timing. How was 
                        your flight? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        What the Hell is a “bawbag”?

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        I believe it’s what they call a 
                        scrotum up in Glasgow. 

           They begin to make their way toward the airport exit with 
           Kassam acting as a bodyguard. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                             (to Kassam)
                        And how’s the newly promoted Editor-
                        in-Chief of Breitbart London. We 
                        won any Pulitzers yet? 

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        I wouldn’t hold your breath on 
                        that. 

           Kassam pushes away another protester, who’s gotten too close 
           to Farage. 
                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        As you can see, I’m not exactly the 
                        most popular man in London these 
                        days. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        No shit. Hanging out with you is 
                        like the opposite of Beatle-mania. 

           Farage laughs. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        Won’t you please, please help me? 

           INT. BLACK CAB - DAY

           As the traditional English taxi rolls down the highway, 
           Bannon man-spreads in the back seat next to Farage with 
           Kassam up front beside the DRIVER.

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        Despite that little display back 
                        there, there’s just no doubt that 
                        the mood of the country on the 
                        whole is changing. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        It’s true. Real, working people--
                        the ones who don’t live in 
                        globalist London--they’re angry. 

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        But a lot of them are still afraid 
                        to say what they really believe. We 
                        just have to let them know that 
                        it’s OK to not want England to 
                        become the next Pakistan. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Praise Allah. I love hearing a good 
                        Muslim brother talking dirty like 
                        that. 

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        Actually, I’m an atheist. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Even better. No one to bow down to, 
                        other than the all-powerful spirit 
                        of righteous, populist nationalism.  
                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        I thought you were a good Catholic 
                        boy, Stevie? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Sure, but I’m also a Leninist, by 
                        the way. I don’t just want to beat 
                        the permanent political class at 
                        the polls. I want to take down the 
                        whole international order. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        Speaking of which ...

           Farage takes a Guardian newspaper out of his briefcase and 
           points to the front-page headline: “David Cameron Promises 
           In/Out Referendum on EU.” 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Already read all about it on the 
                        flight over. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        Cameron’s not really one of us, of 
                        course. He doesn’t support Brexit. 
                        He just thinks he can keep his 
                        right-flank under control. He wants 
                        to placate the peasants with the 
                        pitchforks. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        That’s what Von Hindenburg thought, 
                        too. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        So now you’re comparing yourself to 
                        Lenin and Hitler. Who wouldn’t love 
                        us? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Understatement isn’t really my 
                        thing. “Brexit” though. I like 
                        that. Solid branding. 

           The cab exits off of the highway and approaches Central 
           London with Big Ben beckoning in the distance. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                             (to Bannon)
                        Got time for a warm beer at one of 
                        our most traditional English pubs 
                        before your first meeting?
                                 STEVE BANNON
                        It’s 10 a.m., you goober. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        You’re in England. The pubs close 
                        early here. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Wouldn’t know. I don’t drink. 

           Farage looks him up and down. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        Could’ve fooled me. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I don’t drink anymore. And I’ll 
                        take a rain check on that club 
                        soda, too. SCL’s got some new boy 
                        genius on the payroll. They want me 
                        and Raheem to meet him over lunch. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        Ah, the “data analysis” firm. I 
                        thought you were here to help me 
                        win hearts and minds. SCL’s work 
                        seems rather soulless, don’t you 
                        think? 

           Bannon looks him directly in the eye. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Brother, I’m a 21st century 
                        revolutionary. And I don’t know 
                        about you, but I couldn’t care less 
                        about any motherfucker’s heart. I 
                        just want to win, baby. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           A fancy farm-to-table place that exudes all of the warmth of 
           an Apple store. 

           Seated on stools at their industrial-style table, Wylie, Nix, 
           and Kassam watch as Bannon sucks down an oyster like a 
           ravenous sea lion. He gets some of the juice on his shirt, 
           and wipes it off with the back of his hand.   
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                             (to Bannon)
                        Traditional data analytics firms 
                        have engaged in a fairly 
                        straightforward process when it 
                        comes to political work. They use 
                        electoral records, consumer 
                        purchase histories, and other 
                        easily obtainable data to predict 
                        voters’ established proclivities. 
                        And then they focus on engaging 
                        their most reliable, core 
                        supporters with traditional 
                        messaging tactics.

           Bannon paws another oyster and sucks it down, as Kassam works 
           on his beer and Wylie picks at a salad. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        What we want to do, in a way, is to 
                        turn that process on its head. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        And use these new methods to glean 
                        insights about individual voters’ 
                        unique personality traits, in order 
                        to persuade them.

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Precisely. We don’t just want to 
                        get our voters out to the polls. We 
                        want to convince people who aren’t 
                        yet our voters by--

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Using their own psychology against 
                        them. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        You’re a quick study, Mr. Bannon. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I have to say. This all gets my 
                        nipples hard, but it’s unproven. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Actually, the research is very--
                                 STEVE BANNON
                        It’s unproven in the real world. 
                        How do I make the case in simple 
                        terms to my very skeptical, very 
                        rich benefactor that SLC can make a 
                        real difference in promoting the 
                        populist Breitbart agenda? 

           Wylie puts down his salad fork. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Hopes and fears. Those are the two 
                        biggest drivers of how people make 
                        decisions. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        By the way, I like to lean toward 
                        the fears. More reliable. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I agree with that. But most of the 
                        time, people don’t even know what 
                        they fear most until it smacks them 
                        in the face and provokes a 
                        visceral, negative reaction. 

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        Was it like that with you and 
                        vaginas, Chris? 

           Wylie looks taken aback but does his best to ignore the 
           bullying, homophobic remark. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        With the platform I’m building, I 
                        can figure out what people are most 
                        afraid of before they do. And then 
                        we’re off to the races. 

           Bannon slurps down one more oyster and then uses his sleeve 
           to wipe his face. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I like the sound of that. And I 
                        apologize for my young colleague’s 
                        remark back there. He may look like 
                        a fully woke, urban-dwelling person 
                        of color. But they actually had 
                        Raheem’s DNA tested recently, and 
                        it turns out he’s 40 percent 
                        Neanderthal, which also explains 
                        the excess body hair. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Oh, I can take a joke. I’m not a 
                        delicate flower. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        But you are gay, right? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Yes, I am a homosexual. 

           He glares at Kassam. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        “Faggot” is fine, too, if you’d 
                        prefer that one. Really, I don’t 
                        mind. 

           Bannon waves him off. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        You’ve got me all wrong, kid. I 
                        love the gays. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Oh?

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        The gays are always on the cutting 
                        edge of society. Look at anything 
                        in the culture today, and the gays 
                        were there first. Music, food, 
                        design, fashion. Shit, they were 
                        even into being gay before it was 
                        cool. 

           Bannon abruptly checks his watch and then pushes his food 
           away, throws a couple of hundred-pound notes on the table.

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        Shit, we’re late for our meeting 
                        with Farage and the other Brexit 
                        lunatics. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        “Brexit.” I like that. 

           Nix rises to his seat and extends a hand stiffly toward 
           Bannon. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you come by the office 
                        tomorrow to discuss some more--

           Bannon takes his hand reluctantly and releases it quickly. 
                                 STEVE BANNON
                        God, I hate corporate offices. 
                        Corporate offices are intellectual 
                        kryptonite. 

           Before Nix can come up with an alternate option, Bannon turns 
           to Wylie and hands him his business card. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        I want to hear more details about 
                        what you’re working on. You around 
                        tonight?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Sure. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I’ll pick the place. Don’t worry, 
                        Raheem, you don’t have to come. 

           Always in a hurry with so much to accomplish, Bannon pulls 
           out his phone and begins to make another call as he heads for 
           the door. Kassam trails behind him, like an obedient, 
           homophobic puppy dog. 

                                 RAHEEM KASSAM
                        I wasn’t planning on it. 

           INT. GAY CLUB - NIGHT

           Men bump and grind with one another on the dance floor, as 
           scantily-clad waiters sling cocktails. 

           In a quiet corner of the club, Wylie and Bannon chat in a 
           booth. The younger man sips a daiquiri, while Bannon nurses a 
           club soda, enjoying this environment thoroughly. 

                                 STEVE BANNON 
                        Do you know who Andrew Breitbart 
                        was?  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                        I remember him from when he crashed 
                        that Anthony Weiner press 
                        conference. Solid trolling. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Yeah, but Andrew wasn’t just a 
                        provocateur. He was a visionary. 
                        God rest his soul. 
           A young, shirtless TWINK approaches Bannon with a glazed-over 
           look in his eye. The twink puts his hand on Bannon’s 
           shoulder. 

                                 TWINK
                        Hi, daddy. Want to dance?

           Bannon doesn’t flinch. He’s getting a real kick out of this. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        In a little bit, honey. I don’t 
                        know this song. 

           The twink rolls his eyes and continues on his way. Bannon 
           turns back to Wylie. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        Andrew understood something very 
                        fundamental. It’s what I call “the 
                        Breitbart Doctrine.” And it’s that 
                        politics exists downstream from 
                        culture. So in order to change 
                        politics, you first have to change 
                        the culture. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I have a similar idea about fashion 
                        trend forecasting. But no one in 
                        the industry seems to care much 
                        what I think. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I care. 

           Wylie looks Bannon up and down, taking in the rumpled 
           ensemble that passes as his outfit. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, come on. I may not be Ralph 
                        Lauren, but I’m here to learn, 
                        baby. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Well, look at your boy Nigel 
                        Farage. Personally, I think the man 
                        is a drunk, not-so-closeted racist, 
                        who wants to turn the clock back a 
                        hundred years on civilization.

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        That’s why I love him. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        And I’m not the only one who thinks 
                        that. The majority of the British 
                        people do, too. But the majority of 
                        the British people thought Crocs 
                        were ugly as shit a year ago, and 
                        now they’re becoming cool. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        What are Crocs?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Objectively unattractive footwear. 
                        But by the power of social 
                        persuasion, they were made to be at 
                        first acceptable, and then cool. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        You mean, like Birkenstocks?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        The point I’m trying to make is 
                        that Nigel Farage and UKIP right 
                        now are like a pair of Crocs two 
                        years ago. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Uncool. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        So the question for you then 
                        becomes, “How do I get people to go 
                        from thinking, ‘Ugh, disgusting,’ 
                        whenever they see him to ‘Maybe 
                        I’ll give that racist drunk a shot 
                        after all?’”

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        First, you’d take a psychological 
                        approach, and figure out a message 
                        for Farage to repeat again and 
                        again--probably something that 
                        speaks to people’s deepest fears 
                        about “losing” their country. Then 
                        you’d get a few influential people 
                        to demonstrate active support for 
                        him, showing that it’s socially 
                        acceptable to do so. And then 
                        before you know it, supporting the 
                        “reactionary” makes you cool and 
                        forward-thinking, whereas sticking 
                        with the liberal old guard makes 
                        you boring and behind the times.  
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        That’s basically the size of it. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        So how do we get to that inflection 
                        point? How do we go to war? 

           Wylie takes a big sip from his daiquiri. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        One step at a time. Most of what 
                        SCL does is in Third World 
                        countries. I’m aiming to test-drive 
                        my platform in Nigeria.

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Nigeria’s well and good. But we’re 
                        not looking to open Breitbart Lagos 
                        any time soon. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I certainly think that everything 
                        we’re talking about can be applied 
                        here in the U.K. soon enough. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Me, too. But think bigger.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        And eventually America. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Bingo. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It’d take time, a trove of 
                        psychological data that I don’t 
                        have access to, and a whole lot of 
                        cash to make a real impact there.  

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Money ain’t an issue. Daddy’s got 
                        his own sugar daddy, if you know 
                        what I mean.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Can you get us a meeting with him? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Welp, that’s the hard part. 
                        “Reclusive billionaire” doesn’t 
                        even begin to cover it with this 
                        guy, if you know what I’m saying.

                        Robert Mercer is one smart 
                        sonofabitch, but he’s also an 
                        absolute crazy man. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        How so? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        He’s got a $3 million model train 
                        set in his basement. When he’s at 
                        sea, he likes to ride around in a 
                        pirate-themed yacht. And he’s the 
                        proud owner of the world’s largest 
                        private collection of machine guns.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Cool.

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        He’s got a sheep ranch in Oregon 
                        where he runs a lab that’s 
                        researching how to reverse the 
                        aging process. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Very cool. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        He = thinks the Civil Rights Act of 
                        1964 was a huge mistake and that 
                        the fallout from the atomic bombs 
                        we dropped on Hiroshima and 
                        Nagasaki actually made Japanese 
                        civilians healthier. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Not so cool. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Look. I’ll sit you down with him 
                        when the time is right. But what 
                        you’re talking about here is some 
                        heady, groundbreaking stuff. 
                        Serious intellectual work, my man. 
                        That kind of thing doesn’t come out 
                        of some sterile corporate 
                        environment, right? We’re not 
                        talking about making widgets here. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I guess not. 
                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Combining your research with 
                        complicated algorithms and a brand 
                        new online platform--it adds up to 
                        a brand new art form. This shit is 
                        gonna be taught in the world’s most 
                        prestigious academic institutions 
                        for the next hundred years.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I think you may be right. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I usually am. 

           Bannon winks at the twink who approached him earlier. 

           INT. ALEXANDER NIX’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wylie debriefs Nix about his meeting with Bannon. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        A gay club?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It was his choice. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        This isn’t some run-of-the-mill 
                        client we’re trying to entertain 
                        for laughs. This is Steve Bannon. 
                        The man has access to the kind of 
                        cash that could single-handedly 
                        change the face of this company. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What are you worried about? It went 
                        well. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Did it? So he’s ready to introduce 
                        us to Mercer? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Almost, I think. I mean, he 
                        definitely wants to. But he’s 
                        really concerned about ... 
                        atmospherics. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        What does that even mean?
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        He’s got a real intellectual bent, 
                        and he sees himself as this 
                        historically important 
                        revolutionary in the making. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Sounds familiar. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’m nothing like Steve Bannon. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Go on. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It’s just that he’d be even more 
                        excited about our work, if it felt 
                        less, I don’t know, profit-
                        motivated and more ... grandiose. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        How so? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        He’s an ideas guy. He wants to feel 
                        like he’s at the forefront of a big 
                        philosophical movement. He likes 
                        having this image as an 
                        intellectual pioneer. 

           Nix takes this all in. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I’ve got an idea. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What is it?

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Go buy a train ticket to Cambridge.  

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE - DAY

           The soaring, fifteenth-century towers atop King’s College 
           Chapel reach toward the gray clouds that compose a typically 
           dreary English sky. 

           Along a stone walkway spanning the impossibly green campus 
           lawn, students, professors, and tourists stroll among the 
           bronze statues and other ancient adornments that give this 
           place its enduring old-English charm.   
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Nix’s idea was to set up a fake 
                        office at the University of 
                        Cambridge. That’s right, a fake 
                        office. 

           INT. FAKE SCL CAMBRIDGE OFFICE - DAY

           Wylie sits at a makeshift folding table, scrolling through 
           his cell phone aimlessly, bored out of his mind. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        We didn’t yet have the funds for a 
                        real Cambridge office. That’s what 
                        we needed Bannon for. 

           Around him, three other Cambridge Analytica EMPLOYEES 
           languish about aimlessly. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I was allowed to hire a very small, 
                        very cheap, part-time team of 
                        psychologists and data scientists 
                        to help with my research. Some of 
                        them were loosely affiliated with 
                        the university, but we did all of 
                        our real work at SCL’s London 
                        headquarters. 

           There is a sudden knock on the door. Wylie jumps to his feet 
           and claps his hands together, signaling the need for sudden 
           action. The four other employees all scramble to open their 
           laptops and look busy. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        We didn’t even have a working WiFi 
                        connection at Cambridge. But every 
                        time Bannon came into town, we’d 
                        all decamp to this little room that 
                        SCL rented for a thousand pounds a 
                        month, just to show him how 
                        intellectually rousing we were. 

           One of the young employees picks up off of the carpet a 
           college dorm room-style poster, featuring the famous image of 
           Winston Churchill holding a Tommy gun with a cigar hanging 
           out of his mouth, looking like a gangster. 

           He holds the poster up against the wall with his hands, as if 
           he’s in the process of decorating the place. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I’m not kidding. We actually did 
                        this. 

           Wylie opens the door, and Steve Bannon walks in. Noticing the 
           Churchill poster right away, he gives Wylie the thumbs up. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Badass. I love it. 

           The other employees smile and nod at Bannon, as they go about 
           their fake work. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        And the really crazy part is this: 
                        He bought it. 

           EXT. JFK AIRPORT - DAY

           A British Airways 747 makes its final approach and then 
           touches down on the tarmac. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Bannon was sufficiently impressed 
                        with this sham that he invited Nix 
                        and me to New York to make our 
                        pitch to the big guy himself. 

           INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           As the plane slows to a stop, Wylie reads from a Cambridge 
           Analytica-produced biographical dossier about billionaire 
           Robert Mercer. 

           The dossier notes that Mercer earned his PhD in computer 
           science before running a multi-billion dollar hedge fund 
           called Renaissance Technologies. He is known to be reclusive, 
           eccentric, and has a difficult time warming up to people. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Robert Mercer, who funded Breitbart 
                        News, also happened to be one of 
                        the richest human beings on the 
                        planet. The kind of man who made 
                        Ivan the Terrible seem like a 
                        bleeding-heart liberal, Mercer 
                        wanted to be the kingmaker in right-
                        wing American politics. 
           EXT. TRUMP PLACE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           A high-rise luxury building towers over its neighbors on the 
           Upper West Side. “Trump Place” is emblazoned in big, gold 
           letters on the skyscraper’s glass-paneled exterior. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Mercer had a daughter, Rebekah, who 
                        ran her dad’s day-to-day 
                        philanthropic endeavors and also 
                        had a close relationship with 
                        Bannon. We met at her place on the 
                        Upper West Side--a Trump building.

           A yellow cab pulls up to the curb. Wylie and Nix step out of 
           it and then head into the building. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Donald didn’t actually own the 
                        place. He just licensed his name to 
                        it. Alas, there was no golden 
                        toilet. 

           INT. REBEKAH MERCER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Elevator doors open, and Wylie and Nix step out directly into 
           the foyer of a stunning penthouse, complete with 30-foot 
           ceilings, an array of striking modern art adorning the walls, 
           and furniture that looks too expensive to touch. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        But I have to admit: To this day, 
                        it’s by far the nicest apartment 
                        I’ve ever set foot in. 

           A BUTLER (50s), who carries himself like a time-traveler from 
           the nineteenth century, greets Wylie and Nix.

                                 BUTLER
                        Gentlemen, this way, please. 

           The butler escorts them down a long, dark hallway. 

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           With the shimmering Manhattan skyline visible below, Wylie 
           and Nix share a leather sofa with drinks in hand. 

           Facing them are Steve Bannon, ROBERT MERCER (68), cerebral 
           and so painfully awkward that he avoids eye contact when he 
           speaks, and REBEKAH MERCER (39), warm and boisterous with big 
           red hair to match her bright-red lipstick and dress.  
                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                             (to Wylie)
                        I have to say. It’s just so nice to 
                        meet a gay Republican. 

           Wylie smiles but keeps his mouth shut. 

                                 REBEKAH MERCER (CONT’D)
                        We need more of your type on our 
                        side. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        By the way, when he’s not slinging 
                        algorithms over at Cambridge, Wylie 
                        here is working on his PhD. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                             (looking off into space)
                        Is that so? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Tell him what it’s in, Chris. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Um. Well, it’s in fashion trend 
                        forecasting. 

           Rebekah slaps her knee, nearly spilling her red wine on the 
           preposterously expensive rug. 

                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        I love it!

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Actually, Mr. Mercer--

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        Robert. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Well, Robert. I’m actually using in 
                        my own work some of the algorithmic 
                        principles you developed for 
                        Renaissance Technologies. So I 
                        suppose I owe you a debt of 
                        gratitude. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        You certainly know how to flatter 
                        an old man. But I’m not easily 
                        flattered. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Oh, it’s not flattery. I’m working 
                        on a platform that will use data-
                        based personality profiles to 
                        target voters. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        You’re talking about 
                        psychographics. I’ve read quite a 
                        bit on it. There is a lot of debate 
                        about whether it actually works. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        There are some naysayers out there, 
                        who want to maintain the status 
                        quo. Kind of like the traders who 
                        once insisted that you’d never be 
                        able to replace their subjective 
                        judgments with computer programs. 

           Mercer scrutinizes Wylie, trying to determine if this is 
           someone he really wants to work with. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        I’m intrigued. But I want proof. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Of course. 

           Nix pulls an iPad out of his briefcase and hands it to Wylie. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I don’t suppose you have a personal 
                        Facebook account? 

                                 REBEKAH MERCER 
                        He barely uses email. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        I’m not a big communicator. I 
                        prefer the company of cats to human 
                        beings. 

           Wylie isn’t sure whether to laugh. Mercer doesn’t, so neither 
           does he. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER (CONT’D)
                        Plus, the unceasing threat of 
                        frivolous lawsuits is one of the 
                        few disadvantages of being a 
                        billionaire. I try to leave as 
                        limited a paper trail as possible. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                        Smart man. I won’t use you as an 
                        example then, but let me walk you 
                        through the latest research that 
                        I’m applying to my platform. 

           Robert Mercer leans forward in his seat. Wylie begins to 
           scroll through a series of data charts on the iPad, pausing 
           periodically to answer Mercer’s questions about his approach. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The money man is usually the 
                        dumbest person in the room. But 
                        with Robert Mercer, it was the 
                        other way around. He was skeptical 
                        at first, but he really listened to 
                        my pitch. He wanted to understand 
                        the science, and he asked a lot of 
                        questions. 

           Mercer walks over to Wylie so that he can point directly to 
           one particular graph that’s being displayed on the iPad. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER 
                        Does the Y axis on this graph 
                        represent self-other agreement? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Yes, the five-trait average is in 
                        red, and here are the trends for 
                        each individual trait, as it 
                        correlates to the number of 
                        Facebook likes in each instance. 

           Wylie continues his pitch to Mercer. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I was worried that he would find a 
                        fatal flaw in my work--some seed of 
                        doubt that would hold him back from 
                        investing. 

           Mercer takes a moment to think it through. And then--

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                             (to Wylie)
                        Do you smoke cigars?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Of course I don’t. 

           Wylie smiles. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Of course I do. 

           EXT. PENTHOUSE BALCONY - NIGHT

           Robert and Rebekah Mercer, Wylie, Nix, and Bannon stand on 
           the balcony, which overlooks Central Park. They each have a 
           cigar in hand, their drinks resting on the railing. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        It’s safer to talk out here. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                        Safer? 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        They’ve got the apartment bugged. 

                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        Dad. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                             (waves her off)
                        They do. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Who does?

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        That’s what I’m trying to figure 
                        out. Could be the Deep State. Could 
                        be the Clintons. It’s probably 
                        both. 

           He takes a puff from his cigar, as if what he just said is 
           perfectly reasonable. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER (CONT’D)
                        Government is upside down. All it 
                        wants to do is make strong people 
                        weak. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Amen, brother. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        When I was at IBM in the early 90s, 
                        I led a team that pioneered the use 
                        of computers to translate foreign 
                        languages. My bosses were mildly 
                        interested in the project at best. 
                        But I was obsessed. 
                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        He always is. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        My idea was that instead of trying 
                        to teach the computer any concrete 
                        linguistic rules, we would download 
                        as many dual-language documents as 
                        we could get our hands on and then 
                        create code that analyzed the data 
                        and detected patterns from it to 
                        enable translations. At one point, 
                        I took six months off to manually 
                        type into a computer every single 
                        entry in a Spanish to English 
                        dictionary.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Did it work? 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        Have you heard of Google Translate? 
                        Or maybe Siri? They both use the 
                        techniques that we pioneered. 

                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        Why are you telling him this, dad? 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        Because it’s not just about whose 
                        the smartest or which code is the 
                        best. It’s about commitment. Are 
                        you committed to this project? I 
                        mean, deep inside your bones? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Absolutely. One-hundred percent. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        Thank you, Mr. Nix. But I was 
                        asking Mr. Wylie. 

           Wylie considers his answer for a moment. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Since you told me a story about 
                        your work, let me tell you a very 
                        quick one about mine. For certain 
                        outcomes, the profiling algorithm 
                        that I’ve been tinkering with 
                        outperforms even self-rated 
                        personality scores. 
                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        You’re saying that computers can 
                        know more about someone’s 
                        personality than that person knows 
                        about himself?

           Wylie nods. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        And that’s why I’m so committed to 
                        this. We’re on the cusp of 
                        something truly revolutionary here. 
                        And with your help, we can be first 
                        out of the gate. We can be the Siri 
                        of psychographics.  

           Wylie takes a big sip of his drink, waiting for the big guy’s 
           final word. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        What, precisely, do you propose? 

                                 STEVE BANNON 
                        We’ve got the midterms coming up. 
                        We can take this baby for a test 
                        drive. But to do that, we’re gonna 
                        need to start a separate company 
                        that’s under the auspices of SCL. 
                        One that’s technically American. 

                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        A shell company, you mean?

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Your words, not mine. The point is 
                        that American law is very strict 
                        when it comes to foreigners getting 
                        involved in U.S. elections, and 
                        everyone at SCL is a Canuck or Euro 
                        trash. 

           He turns to Robert. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (CONT’D)
                        You’d be the majority owner, and 
                        you’d grant Alexander a license to 
                        use the platform that Chris and his 
                        team have been developing. And then 
                        we’d help as many conservative, 
                        anti-establishment candidates win 
                        as many seats as possible in 2014. 
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        And I want to emphasize, Mr. 
                        Mercer, that we wouldn’t just do 
                        data and targeting. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        What else would you do?

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Well, data is certainly our bread 
                        and butter. But we’ll apply that 
                        data to fundraising, oppo, media 
                        relations, debate prep, you name 
                        it. We’ll be the biggest players in 
                        conservative politics. And we can 
                        completely change the way the game 
                        is played. 

           Mercer’s eyes dart around, as if he’s still concerned that 
           someone might be listening. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        How much do you need?

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Well--

           Nix hesitates, unsure of the right number to throw out. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I’m not sure what got into me. 
                        Probably the two-and-a-half neat 
                        scotches I’d already consumed. 
                        Somehow it just came out. 

           Wylie clears his throat. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I think $15 million would suffice. 
                        Initially, at least. 

           Nix cringes. It’s an absurd number. His young protege has 
           just blown everything. 

           But Robert Mercer maintains a straight face. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        Alright. I’ll have it wired over to 
                        you tomorrow morning. 

           Wylie shakes hands with the billionaire. And just like that, 
           it’s done. 
           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           A high-end suite, complete with a full wet bar and plenty of 
           space for a couple of high-rollers to celebrate a major deal. 

           Nix pours two shots of vodka. He and Wylie clink glasses and 
           then down their shots. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        $15 million? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        $15 million. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I mean where’d you even get that 
                        number? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I don’t know. I was feeling good. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        You were feeling good? 

           Nix shoves the young man in the chest playfully, but the 
           effete Brit strains his own shoulder in the process of doing 
           so.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        You alright? 

           He is. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I’ve got an idea. Champagne. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Yes. 

           Wylie makes his way to the wet bar and grabs a bottle of high-
           end bubbly. He sets to work on twisting off the wire cage 
           that fits over the cork, but Nix puts a hand out to stop him. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Wait a moment. 

           Nix reaches into his luggage and pulls out an ancient 
           Japanese samurai sword, wielding it gleefully like he’s about 
           to mount a drunken attack. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        How the Hell did you get that thing 
                        through customs?
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Just hold the bottle out and away 
                        from your face. 

           Wylie grabs the champagne bottle by the neck and extends his 
           arms out.

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        I’d grab it by the bottom, if I 
                        were you. 

           Wylie shifts his grip to the base of the bottle and closes 
           his eyes, turning his head to the side. 

           Nix positions himself next to Wylie, performs an exaggerated 
           bow, and then raises the sword, executioner-style. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Come on. Just do it!

           Nix takes a test stroke against the side of the bottle, 
           pushing the blade just an inch or so from Wylie’s longest 
           finger. He winds up and then slices the blade forward in a 
           sudden, profoundly unathletic motion. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        AHHHHHHH!

           The bottle EXPLODES, as it splits into two in Wylie’s hands. 

           The good stuff gushes everywhere--all over the carpet, 
           soaking them both. Wylie’s hand is shaking, but he’s unhurt. 

           Wylie opens his eyes and tries and fails to hold the bottle 
           together, as its contents continue to spill all over his 
           pants and shirt. Then he begins to laugh. 

           They exchange an awkward, unlikely, extremely drunken bro-
           hug. This two-man party is just getting started. 

           INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - DAY

           A sliver of sunlight cuts through the cracked-open window 
           curtains, landing on one of Wylie’s closed eyes. He’s lying 
           facedown on the floor next to the bottle of vodka. 

           The hotel phone rings. He groans. It keeps ringing. 

           Wylie swipes his hand in the general direction of the phone. 
           He manages to grab hold of the receiver and knocks the whole 
           thing off of the coffee table. 
           His attempt to silence the phone results in actually 
           answering the call, and a familiar voice comes through on the 
           other end of the line. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.)
                        Dude. 

           Wylie groans again. He pushes himself up onto his knees. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Wylie. You there? 

           Wylie searches around for a glass of water. He finds one on 
           the nightstand and takes a long chug. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Yo. Wylie. 

           Wylie finally takes the phone. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Nice work last night. Gotta say, 
                        I’m impressed. I only convinced him 
                        to throw $10 million into 
                        Breitbart. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Guess you should’ve asked for more. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.)
                        So, I got it. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What?

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.)
                        The name. For our new company. 
                        Listen to this: Cambridge 
                        Analytica. 

           Wylie manages to pull himself up onto his feet. He collapses 
           onto the bed. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It sounds impressive, I guess. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.)
                        And it’s gonna be just as 
                        impressive as it sounds. I’ve 
                        already begun putting out feelers.

                        Cruz’s people are very interested. 

           Wylie rubs his temples. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’m afraid we may have overpromised 
                        just a bit here. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.)
                        What do you mean? The science is 
                        sound. You said so yourself. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Yeah, it is. But in order to build 
                        accurate psychographic profiles on 
                        a national scale--tens of millions 
                        of American voters we’re talking 
                        about here--we’re gonna need a huge 
                        amount of raw data on all of them. 
                        And that doesn’t come easy. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.)
                        Nothing good ever does. What do you 
                        think the 15 million bucks is for? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It’s not just a money issue. The 
                        research that’s been done so far 
                        isn’t on a big enough scale. And 
                        millions of people aren’t just 
                        gonna give up their most sensitive 
                        private data for nothing. 

                                 STEVE BANNON (O.C.)
                        We’re Cambridge Analytica for 
                        Chrissakes, and we’re rich. Come on 
                        now, son. To be the best, you have 
                        to act like the best. Now go get 
                        it. 

           Bannon hangs up, leaving Wylie to deal with his crippling 
           hangover and self-doubt. 

           Wylie rises to his feet and rubs his eyes. He stumbles into 
           the bathroom. And then he screams at the top of his lungs. 

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alexander Nix is lying face down on the bathroom floor, hair 
           looking like a hornet’s nest, and wearing last night’s 
           clothes. Wylie is looking down at him, taken aback. 
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Breakfast?

           Wylie sighs, retreats back into the bedroom, and shuts the 
           bathroom door behind him. 

           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE - DAY

           With the midday sunlight beating down on him, Wylie walks 
           like a man on a mission along the expansive campus lawn with 
           a tote bag slung over his shoulder. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The most straightforward way to get 
                        the data I needed was to try to 
                        acquire it from Michal Kosinski. 
                        The young Cambridge Psychologist 
                        was one of the coauthors of the 
                        original OCEAN Test research that 
                        had gotten me interested in 
                        psychographics in the first place. 

           A brick academic building is engraved with bold letters above 
           its stone archway: “University of Cambridge Psychometrics 
           Centre.”  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        But Kosinski was a respected 
                        professor, not a hard-bitten 
                        capitalist, like Mercer. I knew it 
                        wasn’t going to be easy to convince 
                        him to work with me. 

           Wylie enters the building. 

           INT. PROF. KOSINSKI’S OFFICE - DAY

           Neat stacks of academic books line the shelves. From his 
           desk, Professor MICHAL KOSINSKI (31, boyishly handsome with a 
           carefully trimmed beard) scrutinizes Wylie, who sits on a low-
           slung couch. 

           The confidence that Wylie projected when he pitched Robert 
           Mercer is no longer apparent, as he looks up at Kosinski with 
           an air of desperation. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        A successful conversion rate for an 
                        ad campaign that uses traditional 
                        targeting methods is about one 
                        percent.

                        I’m confident that by taking the 
                        data you’ve already gleaned from 
                        the myPersonality app and 
                        incorporating it into the platform 
                        I’m developing at Cambridge 
                        Analytica, we can achieve a 
                        conversion rate for American voters 
                        of four to five times that. It’s 
                        kind of thrilling, really. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                             (light Polish accent)
                        “Cambridge Analytica”?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        That’s the name of our new company. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        You’re affiliated with the 
                        university? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        No, it’s just a name. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        I see. And Cambridge Analytica 
                        wants to work in American Politics. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Yes, the goal for “Project Ripon” 
                        is to target five to seven million 
                        key voters ahead of the American 
                        midterm elections. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        Project what? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Ripon. We named it after the town 
                        in Wisconsin where the Republican 
                        Party was formed in 1854. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        Ah, the Party of Lincoln. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Indeed. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        Times have changed though.
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Well. I have to admit that I’m not 
                        exactly the most conservative guy 
                        around.

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        No? Then why do you want to do 
                        this?

           Wylie tries to think of the right answer. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Because it’s going to be a test run 
                        for much bigger things to come in 
                        the future. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        What kinds of bigger things?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Things that will benefit all of 
                        mankind.

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        How so?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        By helping people learn more about 
                        who they really are on a 
                        fundamental level, we can better 
                        connect them to things they like. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        You mean connect them to 
                        politicians. Politicians that you 
                        like.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Like I said, I’m not a Republican. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        Again, that’s what confuses me 
                        here. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It’s about applying your research 
                        to a real-world setting. Doesn’t 
                        that interest you?

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        My research interests me, yes. But 
                        that’s just what it is. Research.

                        American political party win more 
                        votes. 

           Kosinski crosses his arms skeptically. Wylie is really 
           flailing now. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’m sure that we can work out a 
                        financial arrangement that will be 
                        quite agreeable. 

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        For over 800 years, this 
                        university’s mission has been to 
                        benefit society through the pursuit 
                        of education and research at the 
                        highest levels. We are not a vendor 
                        for a corporation like SCL...excuse 
                        me, Cambridge Analytica--

           He practically sneers out the words.

                        --a corporation that I understand 
                        has been acting as a neo-colonial 
                        power in elections around the 
                        world, corrupting already fragile 
                        democracies in the process. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I can assure you that --

                                 MICHAL KOSINSKI
                        The research that Professor 
                        Stillwell and I conducted was not 
                        intended to be used for commercial 
                        purposes, and neither of us is for 
                        sale. But I wish you the best of 
                        luck with helping to elect more 
                        right-wing politicians, whose 
                        policies you don’t support. Have a 
                        wonderful day. 

           Kosinski returns to his work, and Wylie gets up slowly to 
           leave, trying to think of something else to say. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Just think about it?

           Kosinski glares at him. Wylie slinks out of the office. 
           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE - DAY

           Wylie walks out of the Psychometrics Centre, his head hung in 
           defeat. 

           A tall, curly-haired man who looks young enough to be an 
           undergraduate student follows behind him out of the building.  

           This is DR. ALEKSANDR KOGAN (28). Showcasing a surface-level 
           charm that’s common among charlatans and a carefully 
           cultivated informality, Kogan is a Senior Research Associate 
           at Cambridge’s Department of Psychology.

           He jogs up from behind Wylie. 

                                 DR. KOGAN 
                             (American accent)
                        Hey, Chris?

           Wylie stops and turns. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                        Yeah?

           Kogan flashes his best attempt at a reassuring smile. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        Hey, man. Sorry to bother you. I’m 
                        Aleksandr Kogan. I’m actually a 
                        research associate here at the 
                        Psychometrics Centre. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Yes, I’ve read some of your work. 

           Kogan extends his hand. Wylie shakes it hesitantly. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        Oh, yeah. Very cool. Well, hey. I 
                        don’t mean to pry, but I heard 
                        about some of the things that you 
                        and your team have been up to here. 
                        And well, it’s just really 
                        exciting, man. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                             (surprised)
                        How’d you hear about us exactly? 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        I’m just a really big fan of your 
                        work. I mean, the idea of applying 
                        psychographic data to elections is 
                        nothing short of brilliant. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I don’t know about “brilliant.” But 
                        thanks. 

                                 DR. KOGAN

                        Hey, I’d love to tell you a little 
                        bit about my own work.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Sure. Should we schedule a lunch?

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        We could do that. But it’s such a 
                        nice day out for once, isn’t it? 

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           Several long, four-person boats crowd the narrow River Cam in 
           two-lane traffic. These are the famous punts of Cambridge, 
           and they’re a lot harder to control than the university’s 
           promotional videos would have you believe. 

           Wylie sits in the front of his punt, steering as best as he 
           can with a single oar, while Dr. Kogan stands on the small 
           platform on the back of the vessel, using a long pole to 
           propel it forward.  

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        Left, left!

           As a second punt approaches from the opposite direction, 
           Wylie digs his oar onto the left side of the boat and begins 
           to paddle frantically. 

                                 DR. KOGAN (CONT’D)
                        No, I mean steer to the left. Oar 
                        on the right side. 

           Wylie shifts the oar to the opposite side, soaking himself in 
           the process. Too late. His and Kogan’s punt collides with the 
           oncoming vessel.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Sorry. I was always more of an arts 
                        and crafts kid.  

                                 DR. KOGAN 
                        Happens all the time. 

           They get their bearings and continue down the middle of the 
           river, taking in the expansive views of Cambridge’s 
           picturesque academic buildings. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        So how did you end up at Cambridge? 
                        I haven’t met many Americans here. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        Actually, I was born in the Soviet 
                        Union, but my dad was an 
                        enterprising guy. He moved us to 
                        the States when I was a kid. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Got it. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        My day job is here at the 
                        university, but I also have a 
                        little side-hustle that’s entirely 
                        separate from my academic work. 
                        It’s kind of what I wanted to talk 
                        to you about actually. 

           Wylie is starting to get the hang of steering the punt. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’m listening. 

                                 DR. KOGAN 
                        I’ve been test-driving an app that 
                        I call, “thisisyourdigitallife.” It 
                        correlates people’s answers to a 
                        personality test with their 
                        facebook likes, giving me a 
                        treasure trove of psychological 
                        data.  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Sounds a lot like your colleagues’ 
                        “MyPersonality” app.

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        But here’s the key difference: My 
                        version is explicitly for private 
                        commercial purposes. People who 
                        agree to take the quiz get paid 
                        three or four bucks each, so 
                        everything’s above board. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Sounds intriguing. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        You haven’t asked me what the best 
                        part is. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What’s the best part?

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        My app doesn’t only harvest the 
                        data of the people who take the 
                        test. It picks up all of their 
                        friends’ data, too. 

           Wylie is simultaneously intrigued and deeply skeptical. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Isn’t that unethical? 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        Nah, not really. I mean, there are 
                        hundreds of other apps that do the 
                        same thing. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Why doesn’t Facebook shut them all 
                        down? 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        Facebook explicitly permits outside 
                        developers to do this. In fact, 
                        they encourage it. Guess they want 
                        a piece of the action. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        That’s insane. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        I know, right? But it’s not like 
                        I’m stealing people’s Social 
                        Security numbers or their credit 
                        card information. When people sign 
                        up for a Facebook account, they’re 
                        pretty much waiving their right to 
                        privacy. It’s just data. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Man. And there’s no regulation at 
                        all? It’s the Wild West out there. 

           Kogan nods. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        And we can be the cowboys. 

           Wylie thinks about it, as their punt passes under the 
           MATHEMATICAL BRIDGE--an iconic 18th-century wooden 
           footbridge.
                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’m not sure how much I’d be able 
                        to pay you up front. All of this is 
                        brand new to us, too, and I’m still 
                        figuring out what kind of overhead 
                        I’m gonna need. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        Don’t worry about that. I’ll get 
                        you the data first to prove I’m the 
                        real deal, and we can figure out 
                        terms from there. I trust you, man. 

           Wylie considers this proposal that seems too good to be true, 
           as he continues to paddle. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Should I trust you? 

           Kogan laughs a little too hard. 

                                 DR. KOGAN
                        I just told you, I’m not gonna 
                        charge you anything up front. You 
                        don’t have to trust me. 

           Kogan shoves the pole hard into the shallow river and propels 
           their punt forward.  

           INT. DR. KOGAN’S COMPANY HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The office has the bare-bones feel of a brand new startup. 
           Dr. Kogan sits at his computer. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Kogan started advertising online, 
                        looking for any Americans who 
                        wanted to be paid to take his 
                        personality quiz, in exchange for 
                        access to their Facebook profile 
                        data. And, more importantly, their 
                        friends’ profile data. 

           ON KOGAN’S COMPUTER SCREEN

           Kogan’s advertisement for the “thisismydigitallife” quiz 
           offers payment to anyone who wants to learn more about their 
           own personality quirks by filling out a questionnaire.  
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        It was the digital equivalent of 
                        handing people a couple of bucks, 
                        in exchange for cutting open the 
                        skulls of everyone they knew and 
                        tooling around inside their brains, 
                        using them as a for-profit 
                        laboratory. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN lies in bed with her laptop on her chest, 
           filling out Kogan’s questionnaire.  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Of course, the people who took the 
                        quiz didn’t think of it that way. 
                        Almost no one cared about giving up 
                        their private data back then. And 
                        why would they? The importance of 
                        safeguarding your digital 
                        footprints wasn’t yet well-
                        understood.

                        320,000 people ended up taking 
                        Kogan’s quiz. On average, each of 
                        those 320,000 people gave us access 
                        to 160 friends’ profiles, none of 
                        whom had any way of knowing that 
                        their data was being harvested 
                        without their permission.

                        Within a couple of months, we had 
                        access to every status update, 
                        every “like,” every photo, every 
                        dick pic, and even supposedly 
                        private messages from 87 million 
                        Americans. The results from the 
                        quiz were combined with this other 
                        Facebook data and then extrapolated 
                        out into a predictive voting model.

                        We didn’t use the dick pics. But 
                        even if we had done so, Facebook 
                        probably wouldn’t have cared.

                        The amount of private data that 
                        Kogan was pulling from Facebook’s 
                        platform was unprecedented in 
                        scope. It was clear that something 
                        unusual was going on. But Kogan 
                        lied to them and told them that it 
                        was for academic use, and Facebook 
                        was like, “OK, fine. Whatever.” 

           The Facebook security officer picks up his desk phone and 
           makes a call. He starts explaining the situation to the 
           person on the other end of the line. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Facebook didn’t even attempt to 
                        verify Kogan’s claim. They were 
                        totally unconcerned about how their 
                        own users’ data was being treated. 
                        What they cared about was growth.

                        Facebook users, after all, have 
                        always been the company’s product. 
                        Their customers are the outside 
                        vendors, like Kogan, who profit 
                        from the users. 

           The security officer nods a couple of times, hangs up the 
           phone, and gets back to work. Business as usual. 

           INT. BREITBART LONDON HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The makeshift newsroom is decorated with traditional British 
           adornments: A red telephone booth, a painting of Queen 
           Elizabeth II, and a wood-burning fireplace.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile, as Kogan’s continued to 
                        pour in, Steve Bannon was setting 
                        into motion his own plans to take 
                        over the world. 

           Above the fireplace hangs a framed photograph of a honey 
           badger in the wild, engraved with the unofficial motto of 
           Breitbart News: “Honey badger don’t give a shit.” 

           Raheem Kassam shows Bannon around the place, which is still 
           in the initially stages of becoming fully operational.

                        three in place before the E.U.

                        Analytica’s doing to inform the

           Something isn’t sitting well with Kassam.

                        Speaking of Cambridge, I did a bit 
                        of background sleuthing on Chris 
                        Wylie. Did you know he worked for 
                        the Obama campaign? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        You mean the campaign that used 
                        cutting-edge data analysis to get a 
                        black guy named Barack Hussein 
                        Obama elected President of the 
                        United States?

                        I take your point. But I’m afraid 
                        he’s going to stab us in the back, 
                        if we’re not careful. I mean, he is 
                        a progressive, globalist ideologue. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I can’t wait to hear about why you

                        When push comes to shove, 
                        fashionista Chris Wylie is not 
                        exactly gonna go to war to promote 
                        our nationalist principles.

                        Let me tell you something, Raheem. 
                        I don’t care if Chris Wylie likes 
                        to engage in occasional butt play 
                        with Kim Jong-un.

                        By the way, I’ve met one or two 
                        guys in my life who’re just like 
                        Chris Wylie, and I can assure you 
                        of this: He may have a nose ring 
                        and something to say about whether 
                        he should be allowed to marry his 
                        boyfriend, but that’s not what 
                        drives him. He’s very smart, and 
                        he’s got a big ego. The ideological 
                        stuff is gonna continue not to 
                        matter to him, so long as he can 
                        get his invention out into the 
                        world and make a name for himself.

                        I hope you’re right. 

           Bannon takes his phone out of his pocket to make another 
           call, as he heads out of the office, leaving Kassam standing 
           there alone.

                        It’s a story old as time, my

           INT. CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA’S LONDON OFFICE - DAY

           Wylie sits at the head of a conference table next to Daphne.  
           A dozen new Cambridge Analytica EMPLOYEES, all of them 
           working away on laptops, fill out the rest of the seats. Most 
           of them are even younger than Wylie is. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Daphne, do you have the updated 
                        design for the “voter engagement” 
                        button? 

           Daphne hands Wylie a printout of his platform’s design, as 
           everyone in the room continues to focus on their work.

                        With the funds from Robert Mercer, 
                        I was finally able to hire a real 
                        team of designers, videographers, 
                        and copyrighters.

                        Just about all of them were in 
                        their 20s and at least as liberal 
                        as I was. But like me, they also 
                        wanted to win, and the work was 
                        exhilarating. With the data from 
                        Dr. Kogan, we set to work on 
                        finalizing my interactive software. 
                        We then marketed it to Republican 
                        political campaigns across America, 
                        most of whom wanted our people on 
                        the ground in America to show them 
                        how the platform actually worked. 

           INT. AIRPORT PASSPORT CONTROL - DAY

           A U.S. IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL looks over the work visa 
           documents of a female Cambridge Analytica STAFFER. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The company’s lawyer warned us to 
                        be very careful about how we worked 
                        inside the United States because, 
                        like Bannon said, American law when 
                        it came to foreign election 
                        interference was quite stringent. 

           The immigration official gives the young Cambridge Analytica 
           staffer another once-over before waving her through.

                        There were rumors internally that 
                        company administrators were filling 
                        out inaccurate immigration 
                        documents to help our employees get 
                        past U.S. immigration. I don’t know 
                        whether that’s true. But I do know 
                        that we never had any problems 
                        getting into the country.

                        that Mercer gave us from April to 
                        July of 2014 alone.

           With a full house looking on, Oregon Congressional Candidate 
           ARTHUR B. ROBINSON (72), wearing a down-home plaid shirt, 
           speaks at a lectern that’s adorned with a banner reading, 
           “Robinson for Oregon’s Fourth District.” 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        This guy, Arthur Robinson, for 
                        example. I called him the Mad 
                        Scientist. He’d run for Congress 
                        four times before and got crushed 
                        each time. Why? Well, he scared the 
                        moderate electorate in his 
                        district, talking a lot about how 
                        global warming was a hoax and even 
                        signing a petition that directly 
                        challenged the theory of evolution. 
                        Cambridge Analytica rehabilitated 
                        his image, emphasizing that he was 
                        a serious family man and got him to 
                        talk about the things that would 
                        resonate in the general election. 

           Robinson continues his boilerplate Republican stump speech. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        So if you’re still not entirely 
                        sure if foreigners influenced 
                        American elections, let me clear 
                        that up for you right now. Yeah, we 
                        did.  

           Robinson pauses his speech to let the crowd applaud. 

           The two Cambridge Analytica employees, who’re now seated in 
           the back row, exchange a surreptitious low-five.

           The row house basement, which functions as the Breitbart 
           newsroom, is a gaudy, incongruous hodgepodge of golden 
           drapes, a chandelier that looks like it belongs in a haunted 
           house, and a cheap rip-off of an ancient Greek mural.

                        was already thinking beyond the 
                        midterms. 

           A half-dozen young Breitbart REPORTERS sit around a table in 
           the middle of the room, littered with coffee mugs. The young 
           reporters work sources on the phones and type their stories 
           into their laptops, all within arm’s length of one another. 

           AT A WHITEBOARD NEAR THE STAIRS

           A young BREITBART REPORTER in an ill-fitting suit stands at 
           the whiteboard with a sharpie in hand. Under a list titled, 
           “Political Slogans For Cambridge Analytica To Test,” are two 
           phrases: “Drain the swamp” and “Build the wall.” 

           Deep in thought, Bannon closes his eyes as he tries to come 
           up with another one.  

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Add one more. “Deep State.” 

           The reporter adds the soon-to-be familiar phrase to the list. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        This was still a year before Donald 
                        Trump announced his candidacy, and 
                        Bannon was already laying the 
                        groundwork for a populist uprising 
                        on the presidential level. Say what 
                        you want about the man, but he was 
                        never lacking in vision or 
                        confidence. 
           INT. CHRIS WYLIE’S LONDON OFFICE - NIGHT

           It’s late, and everyone else has gone home for the night. 

           Wylie is still burning the midnight oil, looking over a 
           series of internal Cambridge Analytica strategy memos. He 
           lands on one particular memo from Steve Bannon that’s 
           headlined, “Strategies For Discouraging Voter Turnout In Key 
           Demographics.” 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Back in London, I was just as 
                        focused on winning at all costs. So 
                        focused, in fact, that I was 
                        genuinely shocked when I discovered 
                        one night that Bannon had crossed a 
                        bright, red line. 

           The memo outlines ways in which Cambridge Analytica is 
           working to suppress African-American turnout in the midterms.

           Wylie appears to be genuinely shocked by what he’s looking 
           at. He picks up the phone and dials. 

           INT. BREITBART NEWS HEADQUARTERS - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

           Bannon steps away from the whiteboard for a moment to answer 
           his phone. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                             (into the phone)
                        Yeah. 

           INTERCUT STEVE BANNON AND CHRIS WYLIE

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What is this racist bullshit? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        You’re gonna have to be more 
                        specific.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        This memo. You want to actively 
                        suppress African-American turnout 
                        in the midterms? 

           Bannon retreats into a quiet hallway to continue the 
           conversation. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        I want to win. Are you after 
                        something different?

                        A social justice crusade maybe? If 
                        so, you’re working at the wrong 
                        place. I hear Amnesty International 
                        is hiring. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I developed my platform to target 
                        individual voters, not to 
                        generalize about entire groups of 
                        people. That’s the old way of doing 
                        things, remember? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        African-Americans vote 95 percent 
                        Democrat. There’s no reason why we 
                        shouldn’t target them as a group, 
                        at the same time we integrate the 
                        individualized approach. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I can think of two reasons 
                        actually. One: It’s possibly 
                        illegal to actively discourage 
                        people from voting. Two: It’s 
                        definitely immoral to do it. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Are you really this naive? Why do 
                        you think 90 percent of campaign 
                        ads are negative? Might it be that 
                        negative campaigning actually 
                        works? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Negative ads are one thing. But I’m 
                        not gonna be involved in a racist 
                        campaign from my cozy office in 
                        London. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Oh, get over yourself, and stop 
                        being a little bitch. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                             (breathing heavily)
                        And I’m also not gonna succumb to 
                        your bullying tactics. 

           Bannon laughs. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Bullying tactics? OK, dude. 
                        Whatever helps you sleep through 
                        the night.

                        Just remember it’s your platform 
                        we’re using here. Your work is the 
                        entire basis of this company.  

           Wylie looks like he might break down, but he manages to keep 
           it together. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        But I’m not like you. I’m not 
                        trying to tear everything down, 
                        just because I can. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Clearly, I mean look at you with 
                        your contrived little cyber-punk 
                        outfit and your situational moral 
                        outrage. Anyone can see what a 
                        special snowflake you are. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Fuck you.

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        You may not see the world like me. 
                        But you sure as shit enabled me.

           Bannon hangs up. 

           Wylie doubles over and clutches his knees, left to ponder the 
           validity of this accusation, as he struggles to catch his 
           breath. 

           INT. CHRIS WYLIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wylie sighs as he scans through his overflowing inbox.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I should’ve quit right then and 
                        there. I knew, deep in my bones, 
                        that Bannon was right. 

           ON WYLIE’S COMPUTER SCREEN

           He opens an email from Alexander Nix, the subject line of 
           which is, “Lukoil Pitch.” 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        But I convinced myself that I could 
                        somehow make it better. That I 
                        hadn’t really sold out completely.

           Wylie begins reading Nix’s email: “Lukoil is a Russian oil 
           and gas company and interested in what we do. 
           They understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of 
           elections, but they’re not making the connection with how we 
           could appeal to their customers. Lets discuss.” 

           INT. CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA OFFICES - MOMENTS LATER

           Wylie emerges from his office and enters the main lobby where 
           an array of young staffers work in cubicles. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I wasn’t brave enough to admit that 
                        I’d completely lost control of the 
                        monster I’d created. And by the 
                        time I began to open my eyes to its 
                        destructive capabilities, it was 
                        already too late. 

           Wylie approaches Daphne at her desk. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Hey. 

                                 DAPHNE 
                        What’s up? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I just got a kind of random email 
                        from Nix about some Russian oil and 
                        gas company. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Lukoil? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        You know them? 

           She hesitates.

                        What? 

                                 DAPHNE 
                        Dan would’ve been the guy to ask. 
                        He was the point person on the 
                        ground for our Russia clients. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Who’s Dan? 

           Daphne rises from her desk and grabs her jacket. 
                                 DAPHNE 
                        Let’s get a cup of coffee across 
                        the street. 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

           Wylie and Daphne walk among the high-end shops along the busy 
           Mayfair street, as a double-decker bus passes by. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Your predecessor. His name was Dan

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Was?

                                 DAPHNE
                        He passed away.

                        Oh. How old was he? 

                                 DAPHNE
                        31? Maybe 32. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What happened?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Well. He was in Kenya last year 
                        working on a campaign.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Uhuru Kenyatta? Nix told me about 
                        him. He said we’re going to be 
                        working on his reelection, too. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        I’m sure we will be.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        How did he die? 

           Daphne takes a deep breath. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        In his hotel room in Nairobi. The 
                        authorities said it was a heart 
                        attack. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        At 32 years old?
                                 DAPHNE
                        I know. It was complete bullshit. 
                        He’d been working on a deal that 
                        went sour. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        What kind of deal?

                                 DAPHNE
                        I don’t know any of the details. 
                        But the word is that he was 
                        poisoned. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Jesus. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Apparently, someone bribed the 
                        Kenyan police not to enter his 
                        hotel for a full day after his 
                        death. And then it was all just 
                        swept under the rug. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Be straight with me, Daphne: What 
                        have I gotten myself into here? 

           They stop in front of a coffee shop. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Whatever you do, just be especially 
                        careful with this Russia deal. I’ve 
                        heard Lukoil’s CEO answers directly 
                        to Putin. 

           Wylie nods, trying to absorb the gravity of all of this. 

           INT. CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           With Wylie looking on, Alexander Nix stands with a clicker in 
           hand, delivering a PowerPoint presentation that’s being 
           projected onto a screen.

           Seated at the table in front of him are three Russian Lukoil 
           executives, including the company’s CEO VAGIT ALEKPEROV (64), 
           a stern, white-haired billionaire who looks like he could 
           have you killed with a snap of his fingers.

                        In Nigeria, SCL was successful in 
                        our efforts to spread the message 
                        in that country’s Islamic community 
                        that the election would be rigged. 
           ON THE SCREEN

           An old SCL Elections FLYER warns Nigerian voters that the 
           upcoming election won’t be free and fair.

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        This had a dramatic effect on 
                        depressing overall Islamic turnout, 
                        to the advantage of our client, 
                        Goodluck Jonathan, who’s up for 
                        reelection next year. 

           CLOSE on Wylie’s blank expression, as Nix continues his 
           presentation to the Lukoil executives. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.0.)
                        It struck me as odd that Nix’s 
                        presentation to these Lukoil 
                        executives, who supposedly wanted 
                        to learn how to boost their 
                        company’s bottom line, actually had 
                        nothing to do with the oil and gas 
                        industry at all. Instead, it was 
                        all about how SCL--and now 
                        Cambridge Analytica--had 
                        established a track record in 
                        disrupting elections abroad. 

           INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - DAY

           A FOCUS GROUP consisting of twenty American men and women of 
           various ages and ethnicities, all sitting in neat rows as the 
           MODERATOR (British, 50s) stands at the front of the room.  

                                 MODERATOR
                        Please raise your hand if you have 
                        a positive opinion of Vladimir 
                        Putin. 

           Only a couple of hands go up. 

                                 MODERATOR (CONT’D)
                        OK. Now, for those of you who do 
                        not have a positive view of Putin, 
                        how many of you have a negative 
                        opinion of recent Russian expansion 
                        activities in Eastern Europe? 

           Most of the hands in the room go up. 

           FROM BEHIND A TWO-WAY MIRROR
           Alexander Nix looks on, as the moderator continues to ask the 
           focus group questions about Putin and Russian aggression. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        As my own team and I continued to 
                        focus on Project Ripon ahead of the 
                        midterms, Cambridge Analytica on 
                        the whole seemed increasingly 
                        preoccupied with Russia--and 
                        specifically, Americans’ opinions 
                        about the Putin regime. 

           EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STATE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

           Street lights illuminate the imposing, 18th century Russian 
           university, founded in the 18th century by Peter the Great.

           A steady snowfall is steadily adding to the thick coat of 
           white that’s already fallen on the university grounds. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        And here’s the kicker: Right when 
                        all of this was going down, my new 
                        friend Dr. Aleksander Kogan--the 
                        man who got us the data that made 
                        our work possible--traveled to 
                        Russia three separate times. 

           Dressed in a heavy overcoat and fur hat, Dr. Kogan greets a 
           fellow professor before entering an ACADEMIC BUILDING. 

           INT. ST. PETERSBURG STATE CLASSROOM - DAY

           Dr. Kogan lectures a group of St. Petersburg State University 
           undergraduate students. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Kogan was ostensibly participating 
                        in an academics’ exchange program, 
                        funded by Russian government 
                        grants. He gave lectures on his 
                        research at St. Petersburg State 
                        University--lectures that he 
                        conducted in fluent Russian.

                                 DR. KOGAN
                             (in Russian; subtitled)
                        The level of what can be predicted 
                        about you based on what you “like” 
                        on Facebook is higher than what 
                        your wife could say about you.

                        Facebook knows more about you than 
                        any other person in your life. 

           The students look impressed, and also a bit disturbed. 

                                 DR. KOGAN (CONT’D)
                             (in Russian; subtitled)
                        We also have access to private 
                        Facebook messages and can use all 
                        of that. We usually load 3,0000 
                        messages per person. You’d be 
                        amazed by the kinds of things 
                        people talk about in private 
                        messages. 

           EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY

           With a heavy snowfall still coming down, Dr. Kogan walks out 
           of the building and heads toward the university’s gates. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Kogan denies that he had any 
                        contact with Russian government 
                        officials during his three trips to 
                        the country. 

           Kogan exits the gates and heads out into the shadows of 
           Vladimir Putin’s hometown. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Whether he did or not, I’m afraid 
                        that our successes, which Kogan 
                        boasted about inside Russia, put 
                        the idea in the Putin regime’s 
                        head: A brand new, cheap, and 
                        effective way to wage cyber warfare 
                        and weaken democratic institutions 
                        by interfering with elections in 
                        Western Europe and the United 
                        States.

           INT. BREITBART NEWS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 

           Steve Bannon and his team of young reporters gather around a 
           TV, as the midterm election results pour in. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        On Election Night 2014, the 
                        Republicans took control of the 
                        Senate for the first time in eight 
                        years and increased their majority 
                        in the House.

                        It was the lowest turnout for a 
                        midterm election since 1942. 
                        African-American voters, in 
                        particular, stayed home.  

           Bannon grins and pumps his fist. 

           INT. FACEBOOK HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Top Facebook executives, including MARK ZUCKRBERG and SHERYL 
           SANDBERG huddle inside Sandberg’s office, as the security 
           officer we met earlier gives a presentation.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Soon thereafter, Facebook realized 
                        that Kogan had passed on the data 
                        he’d acquired to a commercial third 
                        party entity--that would be 
                        Cambridge Analytica--in violation 
                        of their policies. They removed 
                        Kogan’s app from the site, even 
                        though they didn’t dispute that his 
                        methods for acquiring this data 
                        were in keeping with their own 
                        rules. 

           The security officer addresses Sandberg. 

                                 SECURITY OFFICER 
                        But what do we do about the user 
                        data that he’s already obtained? 
                        Most of it comes from people who 
                        didn’t even take the quiz. 

                                 SHERYL SANDBERG
                        Let’s just ask the guy to delete 
                        it. 

                                 SECURITY OFFICER
                        Ask him to delete it?

                                 SHERYL SANDBERG
                        OK, demand that he deletes it. 

           The security officer nods.
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.0.)
                        Fearing the PR disaster that would 
                        result from a disclosure that user 
                        data from the world’s most popular 
                        social media platform had been 
                        harvested and illicitly used to 
                        influence an American election, 
                        Facebook executives declined to say 
                        anything publicly. They didn’t 
                        notify the 87 million people whose 
                        data had been taken without their 
                        knowledge, and they didn’t even 
                        follow up to verify whether Kogan 
                        had actually deleted that data. 
                        They just took his word for it, and 
                        crossed their fingers that it 
                        wouldn’t become public. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wylie lies in bed staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile, I started thinking more 
                        seriously about quitting. The 
                        guilt, the stress, the uncertainty 
                        of it all were getting to be too 
                        much. If this was “success”--if 
                        this was what it felt like to be 
                        somebody--I didn’t want it anymore. 

           Wylie pulls the pillow over his face. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I thought about starting my own 
                        data mining company and took some 
                        steps to feel out how that would 
                        work. But I had no clients of my 
                        own to bring along, and I just 
                        didn’t have the courage to join the 
                        ranks of the unemployed.

           Wylie and Nix sit with two stern-looking prospective American 
           clients.

                        And then one morning, during a 
                        meeting with a couple of 
                        prospective clients, I got just the 
                        push that I needed. 
           Nix sits back in his chair with the confidence of a 
           successful CEO--one who no longer needs to make the hard 
           sell. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        So, gentlemen. What might Cambridge 
                        Analytica do for you? 

           The OLDER PROSPECTIVE AMERICAN CLIENT (late 60s, humorless as 
           an undertaker) folds his hands before answering, as if he’s 
           prepared carefully for what he’s about to say next.  

                                 OLDER PROSPECTIVE AMERICAN CLIENT
                        Well, I don’t think we’d be your 
                        typical client, Mr. Nix. We’re a 
                        Christian group. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        You say that as if it’s something 
                        to be ashamed of. 

           The YOUNGER PROSPECTIVE AMERICAN CLIENT (40s, slightly more 
           affable) waves Nix off. 

                                 YOUNGER PROSPECTIVE AMERICAN CLIENT
                             (Texas drawl)
                        We’re unabashedly proud to be 
                        followers of Christ. It’s just that 
                        we’re also a non-profit 
                        organization in the eyes of the 
                        IRS, and not all of our donors care 
                        to be identified publicly. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        That certainly isn’t an issue for 
                        us. In fact, we thrive under the 
                        cloak of anonymity.

                                 OLDER PROSPECTIVE AMERICAN CLIENT
                        That’s good to hear. Because it’s 
                        very important to us that, if we 
                        were to work together, we keep it 
                        as discreet as possible.

                        Well, that makes two of us. So what 
                        kind of campaign are we talking 
                        about here?

                        There’s gonna be a big Supreme 
                        Court ruling next year that could 
                        legalize homosexual marriage in all 
                        50 states.  

           Wylie fidgets in his seat. 

                                 YOUNGER PROSPECTIVE AMERICAN CLIENT 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        And before the judges hear the 
                        case, we want to put some public 
                        pressure on them. Help instill an 
                        anti-gay message in the population. 

           Nix nods as he considers his response. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        I think that’s definitely something 
                        that we can help--

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’m gay. 

           Nix shoots daggers at Wylie. The two prospective clients are 
           taken aback. Silence hangs in the room for a long beat. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to make that clear to 
                        both of you: I fuck guys. I might 
                        even want to marry one some day. 

           The older man looks like he might be about to have a stroke. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                             (to the younger man)
                        You should try it sometime. Fucking 
                        guys, I mean. You might find you 
                        like it. 

                                 OLDER PROSPECTIVE AMERICAN CLIENT 
                        Son, that is quite enough.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Oh, you already have tried it? Does 
                        your wife know? 

           The older man turns beat red. 

           INT. CHRIS WYLIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wylie stuffs a few documents in his tote bag. 
           Nix enters, looking like he might reach out and strangle him. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Get out. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                        Already on my way. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        You have committed treason. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Oh, I’m just getting started. 

           Nix is apoplectic. Now he looks like he might actually take a 
           swing at Wylie. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        At the time, I had no idea what 
                        that threat even meant. I just 
                        didn’t want him to have the last 
                        word. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        My lawyers will be in touch. 

           Wylie shoulders him out of the way as he makes for the door. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I’ll look forward to that. 

           INT. TED CRUZ CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Alexander Nix delivers another version of his now familiar 
           PowerPoint presentation to Texas Sen. TED CRUZ and a small 
           group of CRUZ CAMPAIGN STRATEGISTS. 

           SUPER: “Houston, Texas”

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Cambridge Analytica didn’t need me 
                        anymore. They already had my 
                        software. A few weeks after I left, 
                        they signed their biggest client 
                        yet: Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who 
                        was launching his 2016 presidential 
                        campaign. 

           Nix flips the PowerPoint presentation to a map of Iowa, which 
           shows the electorate broken down not by county, age, and 
           gender, but by psychological data points. 
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        This will be the first presidential 
                        campaign in history to use the 
                        psychographic voter modeling 
                        techniques that we’ve developed 
                        over the last year. I assure you, 
                        it will not be the last to do so. 

           EXT. IOWA SOYBEAN FARM - DAY

           Cruz stands on a bail of hay, delivering his stump speech to 
           a large and enthusiastic crowd of IOWA CAUCUS-GOERS. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        In short order, Cruz surged from a 
                        no-chance long-shot to a real 
                        contender in the Republican 
                        primaries.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

           A triumphant Ted Cruz delivers his Iowa caucuses victory 
           speech before a cheering crowd. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        And when Cruz won an upset victory 
                        in the Iowa Caucuses over what had 
                        been considered the strongest GOP 
                        field in decades, Cambridge 
                        Analytica claimed its highest-
                        profile triumph yet. 

           INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

           Wylie sits in a barber chair with his hair wrapped in a 
           towel. He’s reading his phone. 

           ON WYLIE’S PHONE SCREEN

           A New York Times report tells the story of Ted Cruz’s 
           surprising Iowa victory. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I wasn’t able to get my own company 
                        off the ground, but I had no 
                        regrets about leaving Cambridge. 

           A female HAIR STYLIST (tattoos, tight black shirt) removes 
           the towel from Wylie’s head, revealing that she has dyed his 
           hair bright-pink. 
           Wylie admires his eye-catching new hairstyle approvingly in 
           the mirror. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Still, for the first time in my 
                        adult life, I was unemployed. And 
                        for someone who has a compulsive 
                        need to stay busy, it wasn’t easy. 

           INT. FASHION DESIGNER’S STUDIO - DAY

           Mannequins and colorful fabrics fill the studio. 

           Wylie hands his resume to a fashion designer’s female 
           ASSISTANT (early 20s, so over it), who gives it a quick 
           glance.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I wanted to get as far away from 
                        politics as possible and set my 
                        sights on the industry I’d always 
                        wanted to work in. 

           The assistant gives Wylie a patronizing, insincere smiles. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I’ll make sure he gets it. 

           Wylie nods half-heartedly. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        But the work I’d done on behalf of 
                        corrupt African leaders, shady 
                        Russian oligarchs, and right-wing 
                        American politicians wasn’t winning 
                        me many friends in fashion. 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY

           Wylie walks the street with his hands in his pockets--alone 
           and aimless--seemingly invisible to everyone in the world.  

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        After winning Iowa, Ted Cruz 
                        faltered in the subsequent 
                        primaries. But with Cruz out of the 
                        race, Cambridge Analytica soon 
                        picked up a brand new client, who’d 
                        recently hired Steve Bannon to run 
                        his campaign. 
           Wylie passes an OLD MAN IN A BOWLER CAP, who’s sitting on a 
           bench and reading a newspaper, which announces that Donald 
           Trump has just won enough delegates to secure the 2016 
           Republican presidential nomination. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The revolutionary platform I 
                        created--the one that I hoped would 
                        change the world forever--had done 
                        just that. It was now being used to 
                        create targeted ads, craft 
                        fundraising appeals, and determine 
                        the most efficient campaign travel 
                        itineraries for Donald Trump. 

           EXT. LONDON EYE - DAY

           The giant, iconic Ferris wheel towers above the River Thames. 

           INT. LONDON EYE - CONTINUOUS

           Standing in one of the glass-paneled capsules are Wylie and 
           Daphne, who still works at Cambridge Analytica. As they rise 
           above the city, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the Tower of 
           London are all visible below. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        I can’t believe he’s our client. 
                        Trump can’t actually win, can he?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        The pundits don’t seem to think so. 

                                 DAPHNE
                             (sarcastically)
                        And they’re always right. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Speaking of things that will never 
                        happen, what’s the latest on 
                        Brexit?

                                 DAPHNE
                        We’ve been officially hired by Vote 
                        Leave. Cambridge Analytica is all 
                        in on Farage’s crazy train. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        How much of Mercer’s money are you 
                        spending on that?
                                 DAPHNE
                        Enough to break every British 
                        campaign finance law, I reckon, but 
                        we’re doing it through another 
                        shell company.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        If you don’t get caught, you can’t 
                        be punished, right? 

                                 DAPHNE
                        I think those Lukoil guys are 
                        involved in it somehow. Big, scary 
                        Russian men keep showing up at the 
                        office for Brexit-related meetings. 
                        Nix says not to worry about it and 
                        that everything is above board. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I wouldn’t believe Alexander Nix, 
                        if his tongue were notarized. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        I thought you were pro-Leave 
                        anyway. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        I am. But I’m also anti-cheating. 
                        And this isn’t some city council 
                        race. We’re talking about the 
                        future of Europe. The future of the 
                        world. What if the Russian 
                        government is behind all of this? 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Honestly, someone should go to the 
                        cops. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Totally. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        Maybe you should. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        And what would I tell them? That I 
                        have reason to suspect Putin is 
                        engaged in an international 
                        conspiracy to use the platform that 
                        I myself created, in order to swing 
                        the Brexit vote?  

           As they reach the top of the Ferris wheel, the River Thames 
           looks like a tiny stream below. 
                                 DAPHNE
                        I don’t know. You could go to the 
                        press? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Nix is already trying to sue me. I 
                        literally can’t afford more PR 
                        trouble right now. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        OK, but is doing nothing really an 
                        option at this point? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Daphne, it’s the only one I have. 

           They stare out the window as the Ferris wheel begins its 
           descent. 

           EXT. LONDON EYE - MOMENTS LATER

           As Wylie and Daphne disembark from the capsule, Wylie’s phone 
           buzzes. 

           ON WYLIE’S PHONE SCREEN is a high-res photo of Wylie entering 
           his London apartment with an accompanying text message that 
           reads, “Nice place, Chris. Nervous?” 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        The fuck? 

                                 DAPHNE
                        What?

           He shows her the photo of himself and accompanying text.

                        Who’s it from?

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It says “unknown number.”

           Daphne looks genuinely afraid for him. 

                                 DAPHNE
                        You can stay at my place tonight. 
                        Stay as long as you need to. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Thanks. Maybe I should. 

           As they continue on their way, Wylie scans his surroundings 
           with a palpable sense of trepidation. 
           INT. TV NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

           A female NEWS ANCHOR speaks straight to camera from ABC News’ 
           London Bureau. 

                                 ABC NEWS ANCHOR
                        The official results are in, and in 
                        a major surprise that will rock the 
                        international system to its core, 
                        the people of Britain have voted 
                        for an exit from the European 
                        Union, dubbed Brexit. 

           The live news footage cuts to an entirely white, largely 
           older CHEERING CROWD of pro-Brexit Britons. 

                                 ABC NEWS ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        Immigration was at the forefront of 
                        the Leave campaign, as voters were 
                        apparently swayed by an effort to 
                        “take back control” of their 
                        country’s borders. 

           The report cuts to archival footage of pro-Leave activists 
           arguing with a diverse group of immigrant rights advocates on 
           a London street. 

                                 ABC NEWS ANCHOR (CONT’D)
                        Make no mistake, this result to 
                        leave is monumental--a political 
                        earthquake with the financial and 
                        societal implications deeply 
                        uncertain. 

           INT. UKIP PARTY HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Delivering his Brexit victory speech, a sweaty, almost 
           maniacal-looking Nigel Farage stands before an exuberant 
           crowd of pro-Leave supporters. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE
                        We have fought against the multi-
                        nationals, we have fought against 
                        the big merchant banks, we fought 
                        against lies and deceit. And today, 
                        honesty, decency, and belief in 
                        nation is going to win. 

           The pro-Brexit crowd explodes into visceral, wild-eyed shouts 
           of unadulterated triumph that are reminiscent of another time 
           and place. 
           INT. MISSISSIPPI COLISEUM - NIGHT

           Spray-tanned and ready to rumble, Republican presidential 
           nominee Donald Trump stands behind a podium on stage, with 
           Nigel Farage just off to his side. 

           Super: “August 24, 2016. Jackson, Mississipi.”

           In front of a revved-up crowd of a few thousand of the most 
           hardcore #maga faithful, on this particular night, Trump is 
           actually playing the role of Farage’s warmup act. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        I am going right now to invite onto 
                        the stage the man behind Brexit and 
                        the man who led brilliantly the 
                        United Kingdom Independence Party 
                        in this fight and won despite all 
                        odds. And he’s a great guy, that I 
                        can tell you. 

           FROM BACKSTAGE

           Steve Bannon watches the festivities with an actual, real-
           live tear in his eye. That Trump and Farage have come 
           together on a big stage like this clearly means a lot to him.

           Bannon turns to Alabama Senator and future U.S. Attorney 
           General JEFF SESSIONS, who is almost equally enraptured by 
           the scene. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        The two great populist leaders on 
                        stage. Together. In the heart of 
                        Mississippi. This is the beginning 
                        of a new era in world history. 

                                 JEFF SESSIONS
                        Amen. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP (O.C.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Nigel Farage!

           The crowd goes nuts. 

                                 STEVE BANNON 
                        Listen to that crowd. 

                                 JEFF SESSIONS
                        We better be careful, Steve. The 
                        folks down here may get inspired to 
                        secede from the union again. 
                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Nah, we’re still a few years away 
                        from that. 

           BACK ON STAGE

           Farage takes the stage and Trump shakes his hand. The 
           Englishman adjusts his microphone. 

                                 NIGEL FARAGE 
                        Well, thank you, and good evening, 
                        Mississippi. I come to you from the 
                        United Kingdom with a message of 
                        hope. It’s a message that says if 
                        the little people, if the real 
                        people, if the ordinary and decent 
                        people are able to fight and stand 
                        up for what we believe in, we can 
                        overcome the big banks, we can 
                        overcome the multinationals. 

           The crowd cheers again. Real people vs. multinationals. This 
           is just the kind of coded language they speak fluently in 
           certain pockets of the Deep South.  

           BACKSTAGE

           Bannon continues to bask in the rapturous reception that 
           Farage is generating. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        He speaks the language, doesn’t he? 

                                 JEFF SESSIONS
                        I’ve been reading these polls, and 
                        I can do basic arithmetic. But it 
                        really doesn’t feel like Hillary is 
                        that far ahead. I just don’t 
                        believe the numbers. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        That’s because they’re not the 
                        correct numbers. We get those from 
                        Cambridge, and we don’t make them 
                        public. 

                                 JEFF SESSIONS
                        This thing really feels like it’s 
                        gonna happen, doesn’t it? 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Just wait. 
           INT. NEW YORK CITY HILTON MIDTOWN - NIGHT

           An almost confused-looking President-Elect DONALD TRUMP 
           stands at an American flag-backed podium where he is 
           addressing his exuberant Election Night victory party. 

           Vice President-elect MIKE PENCE and Trump’s son BARRON cheer 
           him on, as the man who’s just stunned the world adjusts the 
           microphone.

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        Thank you all. The forgotten men 
                        and women of our country will be 
                        forgotten no longer.

           The crowd erupts. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE AT THE HILTON - LATER

           Having wrapped up his speech, Trump is now being surrounded 
           by his family and a coterie of Secret Service agents. 

           Red-faced and giddy despite the early-morning hour, Steve 
           Bannon approaches Robert and Rebekah Mercer with the grin of 
           a kid who somehow just got away with eating dessert for 
           dinner. 

           He hugs Rebekah and then gives Robert an extended bro-hug, 
           complete with multiple, hard pats on the back. 

                                 STEVE BANNON 
                        I always knew you were a savvy 
                        investor. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER 
                        Best money I ever spent. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Brother, we’re just getting 
                        started. 

           INT. HIGH-END LONDON RESTAURANT - MORNING

           At a corner table that’s secluded from the other restaurant 
           patrons, Alexander Nix and two other Cambridge Analytica 
           executives pitch a PROSPECTIVE AFRICAN CLIENT (60s, solemn). 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        As for Cambridge Analytica, they 
                        were just getting started, too. 
           The other Cambridge execs are MARK TURNBULL (mid-50s, doughy 
           and animated) and ALEX TAYLER (late 30s, thin with a 
           prominent forehead).

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Alexander Nix, Cambridge’s new 
                        managing director Mark Turnbull, 
                        and chief content officer Alex 
                        Tayler went on a client shopping 
                        spree. And they weren’t shy when it 
                        came to bragging about all of the 
                        recent success they’d had.

           Tayler leans forward in his seat, as if he’s about to let the 
           prospective client in on the opportunity of a lifetime. 

                                 ALEX TAYLER
                        With the data that we use to 
                        profile voters, we can segment the 
                        population and craft messages and 
                        imagery that they’re most likely to 
                        engage with. 

                                 PERSPECTIVE AFRICAN CLIENT
                        In which countries have you been? 

                                 MARK TURNBULL
                        America, of course, with Trump. 
                        Mexico, Malaysia. We’re going into 
                        Brazil. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Kenya, right now, is one of our 
                        biggest projects. 

                                 PERSPECTIVE AFRICAN CLIENT
                        You’re doing Kenyatta’s reelection, 
                        yes? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Yes, and we did his 2013 campaign, 
                        too. 

           The client nods, impressed. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Remember: That’s the one where my 
                        predecessor died under mysterious 
                        circumstances. 

                                 MARK TURNBULL
                        In Kenya, we’ve rebranded the TNA 
                        Party twice, wrote their manifesto.
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Huge amounts of research, analysis, 
                        messaging work. 

                                 ALEX TAYLER
                        We even write all of Kenyatta’s 
                        speeches. We run just about every 
                        element of his campaign. 

           Nix opens a laptop and places it in front of the prospective 
           client. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Let me show you an ad we put 
                        together targeting swing voters, 
                        based on the psychographic research 
                        we conducted among the Kenyan 
                        electorate. 

           Nix hits play on the video. 

           ON NIX’s LAPTOP SCREEN

           A barrage of ominous, black-and-white images set to a 
           dramatic musical score attack the screen all at once. 

           Superimposed text appears over a desolate, post-apocalyptic 
           landscape: “Raila Odinga’s Kenya: 2020.” 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        We found that Kenyatta hadn’t 
                        previously done enough anti-Odinga 
                        messaging. We aimed to hit on a few 
                        specific fears that were 
                        particularly common among key 
                        Odinga-leaning voters. 

           “Food is scarce,” the ad continues. “People are begging. The 
           Constitution has been revoked. Parliament dismantled. Women 
           are giving birth in the streets.”

           The ad then cuts to a photo of Kenyatta’s opponent, Raila 
           Odinga, with the word, “Liar” branded across his face in big 
           red letters. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX (CONT’D)
                        That one’s gone viral. And the best 
                        part of all is that no one knows 
                        who’s behind it. The mystery only 
                        adds to its impact. 

           The prospective client takes this in. 
                                 PERSPECTIVE AFRICAN CLIENT
                        Was it true?

                                 MARK TURNBULL
                        Was what true?

                                 PROSPECTIVE AFRICAN CLIENT
                        All of those things you said about 
                        Odinga in the ad. Does he really 
                        want to revoke the Constitution? 
                        Dismantle the Kenyan parliament? 

           Turnbull leans forward in his seat. 

                                 MARK TURNBULL
                        What we’ve found is that it’s no 
                        good fighting an election campaign 
                        on the facts. It’s all about 
                        emotion.

           INT. UPSCALE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           The top Cambridge Analytica execs--Nix, Turnbull and Tayler--
           this time sit at a high-top table inside a dimly lit bar with 
           a PROSPECTIVE SOUTH AMERICAN CLIENT (thin mustache, wearing 
           sunglasses inside).

                                 MARK TURNBULL
                        You mentioned your interest in 
                        intelligence gathering. 

                                 PROSPECTIVE SOUTH ASIAN CLIENT
                        Yes, that’s very important to us. 

                                 ALEX TAYLER
                        We have partnerships with certain 
                        specialist organizations that do 
                        that kind of work. People with lots 
                        of experience at MI5, MI6. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        We can pose as tourists. Or we can 
                        pretend we’re researchers attached 
                        to a university. Anything like that 
                        to dig up dirt on your opponent. 

                                 MARK TURNBULL
                        We also can put rumors into the 
                        bloodstream of the Internet, and 
                        then just watch them grow. Maybe 
                        give a little push every now and 
                        again.
                                 PROSPECTIVE SOUTH CLIENT
                        Like a remote control?

                                 MARK TURNBULL
                        Yes. But it has to happen without 
                        anyone thinking, “that’s 
                        propaganda,” because the moment you 
                        think, “that’s propaganda,” the 
                        next question is, “Who’s put that 
                        out there?”

           The prospective client nods. He gets it. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX 
                        Here’s another tool at our 
                        disposal: We work with a company 
                        called Black Cube, which is run by 
                        former Israeli intelligence 
                        officers. They’re quite adept at 
                        honeytraps. 

                                 PROSPECTIVE SOUTH ASIAN CLIENT
                        You mean you’ll send girls to our 
                        opponent? 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        Yes, we’ve found that Ukrainian 
                        girls tend to work quite well. 
                        They’re very beautiful. 

                                 MARK TURNBULL 
                        We’re looking for anything that 
                        will keep your opponent off 
                        balance. 

                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        We want to get inside their heads 
                        any way we can. 

           They continue to chat and sip their drinks, as if this is all 
           a perfectly normal conversation. 

           EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT

           Wylie walks alone in a deserted neighborhood. It’s nearly 
           pitch black and eerily quiet in the wee hours.

           He turns onto a narrow alley and glances over his shoulder.

           A SHADOWY FIGURE trails behind him.

           Wylie quickens his pace. The shadowy figure keeps his 
           distance, but he’s walking in the same direction as Wylie. 
           Suddenly, Wylie stops in his tracks. He collects himself and 
           then reverses direction, marching toward the shadowy figure. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Hey!

           His pursuer begins to backtrack. But Wylie won’t let him get 
           far. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Who’s paying you? 

           The figure retreats as quickly as he can in the other 
           direction. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Answer me. 

           Wylie begins to jog after him but then gives up quickly. He 
           hunches over and catches his breath, winded by the intensity 
           of the moment. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                             (struggling to get the 
                              words out)
                        I’m not afraid of you! 

           EXT. HAMPTONS MANSION DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Two SUVs roll past the imposing gates and into a roundabout 
           driveway in front of the mansion. Two SECRET SERVICE AGENTS 
           jump out of the first SUV and scope out the scene. 

           One of the agents opens the back door of the second SUV. Out 
           walks President-elect Donald Trump, dressed in his usual 
           baggy suit and long, red tie. 

           Trump strolls toward the sprawling, multi-turreted mansion 
           that its owner, Robert Mercer, refers to as “The Owl’s Next.” 

           He waves to a small group of POOL REPORTERS on his way in. 

                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        Don’t you have something better do 
                        to tonight? 

                                 POOL REPORTER
                        Mr. President-elect, what are you 
                        going as tonight? 

           Trump points a finger at himself. 
                                 DONALD TRUMP
                        Me. 

           He heads into the mansion with the agents trailing him. 

           INT. HAMPTONS MANSION - NIGHT

           A ten-piece swing band sets the mood for a lively, “heroes 
           and villains”-themed costume party inside the expansive and 
           opulent Mercer residence. 

           All eyes are on Trump, who works the room, as key members of 
           the incoming administration and other right-wing political 
           players nibble on hors d'oeuvres and drink too much. 

           KELLYANNE CONWAY (49)--wearing a spandex and thigh-high boots 
           Superwoman costume--chats with Steve Bannon, who holds his 
           Darth Vader mask in hand, so that he can eat. Even the 
           security guards are dressed as Hells Angels. 

           Clutching a glass of white wine and greeting well-wishers 
           with the vivacity of a woman in her element, Rebekah Mercer 
           (dressed as a convincing Cruella De Vil), parades her father 
           Robert around the party. 

                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        Thank you all so much for coming. 

           Rebekah gives Bannon and Conway a wave and approaches them 
           with her father, who’s dressed in a blue velvet, early-19th 
           century military uniform, his white hair brushed back. 

                                 KELLYANNE CONWAY
                             (to Robert Mercer)
                        Napoleon? I love it. 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        Do I look like a diminutive 
                        Frenchman? I’m Andrew Jackson. 

           Kellyanne laughs too hard. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Well, Old Hickory, you’re the hero 
                        of the Battle of New Orleans, you 
                        routed the Seminoles, and now 
                        you’ve taken over the White House. 
                        What are you gonna conquer next? 

                                 ROBERT MERCER
                        I’d say it’s about time to focus on 
                        policy.

                        government small, ineffective, and 
                        out of the way. 

                                 KELLYANNE CONWAY
                        Did you say “algorithmic policing”? 
                        What is that?  

                                 REBEKAH MERCER
                        Don’t ask, unless you have all 
                        night. Now, come on. Can’t we all 
                        just enjoy ourselves? 

           Bannon’s phone rings. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Excuse me. 

           He brushes past one of the Hells Angels and heads outside to 
           take the call. 

           EXT. HAMPTONS MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           Bannon stands alone beside the covered swimming pool, his 
           breath visible in the cold, late-December air. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                             (into his phone)
                        Sorry, buddy. But I’m afraid all of 
                        the key administration positions 
                        have already been filled. We might 
                        have something for you in custodial 
                        services. Are you as good with a 
                        toilet brush as you are with an 
                        algorithm?

           EXT. LONDON STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Wylie stands alone in the alley where we left him. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                             (into the phone)
                        I just want you, Alexander Nix, 
                        Raheem Kassam, and all of your 
                        goons to know that you deserve 
                        every bit of what’s coming to you. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        What’s coming to us? You mean, the 
                        presidency? The most powerful 
                        office in the world?

                        I have to agree, but that’s nice of 
                        you to say so. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Maybe I was complicit in all this. 
                        But I’m done letting you roll over 
                        me. Don’t forget to pick up a 
                        newspaper in the morning. 

           He hangs up. 

           INT. THE GUARDIAN NEWSROOM - DAY

           Dozens of ink-stained wretches pour over the latest drafts of 
           their stories, as editors jump from desk to desk. 

           Award-winning reporter CAROLE CADWALLADR (48, Welsh) is 
           finishing up a phone call with a source when she notices 
           Chris Wylie standing in front of her desk. 

                                 CAROLE CADWALLADR
                             (into the phone)
                        Let me call you back.

           She hangs up. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Carole? 

                                 CAROLE CADWALLADR
                        Christopher. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        You can call me Chris. 

           She takes out her digital recorder and gives the empty chair 
           beside her a pat. 

                                 CAROLE CADWALLADR
                        Please. Make yourself comfy. 

           Wylie sits down. Carole hits “record.”

                                 CAROLE CADWALLADR (CONT’D)
                        I guess my first question is this: 
                        How did you end up here? 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        Funny, I’ve been asking myself the 
                        same thing. 

           Wylie settles into his seat, as Cadwalladr takes notes. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        When I first approached her, Carole 
                        was concerned about my safety. But 
                        The Guardian was vigilant about 
                        protecting their sources. 

           INT. BREITBART NEWS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Steve Bannon sits with copies of The New York Times, The 
           Guardian, and his morning coffee. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        I spoke to the New York Times, too. 
                        They broke their stories on the 
                        same day in March, 2018. 

           The top story on the front page of The New York Times is 
           headlined, “How Trump Consultants Exploited the Facebook Data 
           of Millions,” while The Guardian has gone with, “Meet The 
           Data War Whistleblower.” 

           Both newspapers feature prominent, posed photographs of a 
           grim-faced Chris Wylie, decked out in his meticulously 
           affected cyber-punk outfit from head to toe. 

                                 STEVE BANNON
                        Shit. 

           INT. ALEXANDER NIX’S OFFICE - DAY

           Alexander Nix reads the Guardian story at his desk, literally 
           pulling his hair as he does so. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        It didn’t take long for the 
                        floodgates to open. The very next 
                        day, Channel 4 in the U.K. ran an 
                        undercover video of Nix and other 
                        Cambridge Analytica execs boasting 
                        about the corrupt tactics that they 
                        employed. Nix later claimed he was 
                        merely embellishing. Right. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           REAL FOOTAGE from the Channel 4 report shows Nix proposing an 
           entrapment scheme to a Sri Lankan man, whom he believes to be 
           a prospective client. 
                                 ALEXANDER NIX
                        We’ll offer a large amount of money 
                        to the candidate--to finance his 
                        campaign in exchange for land, for 
                        instance. We’ll have the whole 
                        thing recorded. We’ll blank out the 
                        face of our guy, and we post it on 
                        the Internet.

           INT. U.K. PARLIAMENT - DAY

           Wylie, wearing a suit for the first time since we’ve met him, 
           testifies before a British Parliamentary committee.

                        Britain launched an investigation 
                        into Cambridge Analytica right 
                        away, and so did Parliament.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        The U.S. Justice Department and FBI 
                        investigations came next, and then 
                        the Senate got involved. I 
                        cooperated fully with each of them 
                        and gave them all of the documents 
                        they requested. I had nothing more 
                        to hide, and I truly wasn’t scared.

                        I’d finally become somebody 
                        important, like I’d always wanted 
                        to be. Just not the way I ever 
                        thought I would. 

           INT. HART SENATE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 

           In REAL ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE, staring straight ahead, as if he’s 
           doing a perp walk, Facebook founder and CEO MARK ZUCKERBERG 
           ignores a crunch of reporters who’re shouting questions about 
           his company’s conduct. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        People were outraged at Facebook, 
                        many of them longtime users who’d 
                        finally realized that the social 
                        media Goliath, which had always 
                        claimed it was “just trying to 
                        connect people,” wasn’t so 
                        altruistic after all. 

                                 FEMALE REPORTER
                        Mark, are you putting profits over 
                        people? 

           Zuckerberg ignores her, as he continues his quasi-perp walk, 
           staring straight ahead. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        At first, Facebook was silent, 
                        hoping the story would pass. But 
                        after the company’s shares fell 
                        more than 24 percent, losing about 
                        $134 billion in market value, Mark 
                        Zuckerberg finally agreed to 
                        testify on the Hill.

           INT. HOUSE ENERGY AND COMMERCE COMMITTEE ROOM - DAY

           REAL FOOTAGE shows Mark Zuckerberg answering questions from 
           California CONGRESSWOMAN ANNA ESHOO

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Though he did his best to come off 
                        as contrite, promising an internal 
                        probe on what happened and a new 
                        focus on safeguarding user data, 
                        Zuckerberg struggled to answer why 
                        Facebook hadn’t done the right 
                        thing when no one was looking. He 
                        deflected most of the blame onto 
                        Dr. Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, 
                        and, well, me. 

                                 CONGRESSWOMAN ANNA ESHOO
                        When did Facebook learn that 
                        Cambridge Analytica’s “research 
                        project” was actually targeted 
                        psychographic political campaign 
                        work? 

                                 MARK ZUCKERBERG
                        Congresswoman, it might be useful 
                        to clarify what actually happened 
                        here. 
                                 CONGRESSWOMAN ANNA ESHOO
                        Well, no. I don’t have time for a 
                        long answer. So in 2015 you learned 
                        about it. And did you speak to 
                        their CEO immediately? 

                                 MARK ZUCKERBERG
                             (hesitates)
                        We ... shut down the app. 

                                 CONGRESSWOMAN ANNA ESHOO
                        Did you speak to their CEO 
                        immediately?

                                 MARK ZUCKERBERG
                             (meekly)
                        We got in touch with them.

           Zuckerberg testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Over on the Senate side, some very 
                        confused, very old men tried their 
                        hardest to get to the bottom of 
                        what had happened. 

           Utah Republican ORRIN HATCH (84) sits on the panel of U.S. 
           Senators who are questioning the beleaguered Facebook CEO.

                                 ORRIN HATCH
                             (genuinely confused)
                        How do you sustain a business 
                        model, if users don’t pay for your 
                        service?

           Zuckerberg stares back at Hatch for a long, painful three 
           seconds. He’s doing everything in his power to come across as 
           non-condescending. But in the end, he can’t help himself. 

                                 MARK ZUCKERBERG
                        Senator, we run ads. 

                                 ORRIN HATCH
                        I see.

                        As it turns out, it’s not easy to 
                        regulate a company you don’t 
                        understand. 
           EXT. FACEBOOK HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           JOSEPH CHANCELLOR, a Facebook employee, (38, wearing a 
           baseball cap and hoodie) parks his Maserati and walks toward 
           the tech giant’s sprawling campus for another day on the job.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        A viral campaign to delete Facebook 
                        lasted about a week. The company’s 
                        stock price recovered completely 
                        and continued to soar after that. 
                        Facebook’s internal probe into what 
                        happened hit a roadblock when the 
                        company realized it couldn’t track 
                        where most of its user data went 
                        after it left its platform, via the 
                        hundreds of apps and developers 
                        that had accessed it legally from 
                        2007 to 2015.

           Joseph Chancellor greets a couple of colleagues as he 
           approaches the building. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Oh, and that guy right there. 
                        That’s Joseph Chancellor. He was 
                        Dr. Kogan’s business partner when 
                        Kogan sold us all that user data.

           Chancellor laughs at a joke that one of his colleagues makes. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        So why is Chancellor heading into 
                        Facebook’s campus? Well, he works 
                        there. That’s right. Facebook was 
                        so angry about his role in 
                        collecting and selling all of that 
                        data that it hired him as an in-
                        house psychologist. 

           Chancellor walks into the building. 

           INT. FACEBOOK HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Chancellor works at his desk, analyzing psychological data on 
           Facebook’s users. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        In 2017, leaked documents revealed 
                        that Facebook boasted to 
                        advertisers that it had gained the 
                        ability to identify when teenage 
                        users were feeling “insecure,” 
                        “worthless,” and “needed a 
                        confidence boost.” Yup. Facebook 
                        itself had decided to invest in 
                        psychographics, directly profiting 
                        off of its own users’ fears.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        With all of its clients abandoning 
                        the company, which had promised 
                        them anonymity but was now facing 
                        relentless public scrutiny, 
                        Cambridge Analytica announced that 
                        it was shutting down. Its parent 
                        company, SCL Group, filed for 
                        bankruptcy soon after.

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Don’t shed too many tears for 
                        Alexander Nix though. He ended up 
                        landing on his feet.

           The sparsely-furnished office is adorned with photographs of

           Great Again.”  

           Four FORMER CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA EMPLOYEES confer with senior 
           Trump campaign officials. 
                                 CHRIS WYLIE (V.O.)
                        Four of Nix’s former underlings at 
                        Cambridge Analytica went on to 
                        start a new voter targeting company 
                        called Data Propria. The new firm 
                        scored its first major client when 
                        it was quietly hired by Donald 
                        Trump’s 2020 reelection campaign.

                        The demise of Cambridge Analytica 
                        didn’t do much to slow down Robert 
                        and Rebekah Mercer either. After 
                        buying the presidency, they 
                        continued to maintain what they 
                        referred to as “a constellation” of 
                        over a dozen data analytics, 
                        machine learning, and

           INT. TATE MODERN ART MUSEUM - NIGHT

           With PAPARAZZI snapping photos, Chris Wylie--wearing a sharp 
           tuxedo--enters the museum, which is lit in a moody shade of 
           purple. Wylie is being trailed by his PUBLICIST. 

           A fashion industry gala is in full swing, complete with 
           prominent designers, beautiful models, and powerful 
           executives.

           Heads begin to turn, as people notice Wylie, who’s become 
           something of a quasi-celebrity for his whistle-blowing. 

           As Wylie takes a champagne glass from a WAITER, one of the 
           guests faces him and begins to applaud. One by one, the other 
           guests join in the applause, many of them clearly not even 
           aware of who Wylie is. Everyone else is doing it, so why not? 

           Wylie waves them off and lowers his head humbly. 

                                 FASHION EXECUTIVE (O.C.)
                        Speech!

                                 CHRIS WYLIE 
                        No, no, no. 
                                 FASHION DESIGNER (O.C.)
                        Come on, Chris. You’re a hero!

           Someone cuts the music. The DJ approaches Wylie and hands him 
           the microphone. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        First of all, I’m definitely not a 
                        hero. 

           Wylie hands his champagne glass to his publicist and looks 
           out at his adoring fans-for-the-day. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll just say this. Companies like 
                        Facebook tell us that we can always 
                        opt out. That no one forces us to 
                        use their services and surrender 
                        our data. And it’s true, in a way. 
                        But how can anyone realistically be 
                        expected to live a modern life 
                        without using Google, or email, or 
                        a map, or a social network? 

                                 FASHION MODEL (O.C.)
                        Sounds awful! 

           Laughter echoes around the room. 

                                 CHRIS WYLIE
                        It does, doesn’t it? So they’ve got 
                        us right where they want us. Online 
                        data is like electricity now, and 
                        just as we expect the government to 
                        make sure we have safe wiring in 
                        our building codes, we should 
                        expect them to keep us safe from 
                        the nefarious forces behind online 
                        influence peddling--the people who 
                        want to further parse and divide us 
                        into warring tribes. The only way 
                        that our democratic institutions 
                        will survive into the next decade 
                        and beyond is if we all finally 
                        wake up to the reality that the 
                        intersection between business, 
                        politics, and technology is not 
                        always a force of good. In fact, 
                        it’s fraught with extreme danger. 
                        And if we don’t demand action, it’s 
                        only gonna get worse. Thank you.  

           Wylie hands the microphone back to the DJ and accepts the 
           crowd’s applause. 
           The music comes back on, and everyone goes back to partying. 

           Chris Wylie is on top of the world. But then he makes a big 
           mistake: He checks his phone. 

           ON WYLIE’S PHONE SCREEN 

           We see Wylie’s Twitter feed, in which he has a new mention 
           sent from none other than @RaheemKassam. 

           @RaheemKassam to @ChrisWylie: Is it true you dyed your hair 
           specifically for your “whistleblow” moment? Also, don’t talk 
           about what’s British. You haven’t a clue.

           Instinctively, Wylie runs his hand through his pink hair. He 
           hunches over, looking like he might be about to have a panic 
           attack--like he’s back in elementary school. 

           As his heavy breathing picks up, Wylie looks down again on 
           his phone screen where a Twitter ally has come to his defense 
           by accusing Kassam of having a “man crush” on Wylie.

           Raheem Kassam types on his computer, responding to the “man 
           crush” accusation with a shit-eating grin on his face.  

           ON KASSAM’S COMPUTER SCREEN

           @RaheemKassam: I mean even if I did, it wouldn’t be a MAN 
           crush, would it? Chris is a girl, isn’t she?

           INT. TATE MODERN ART MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

           Wylie reads Kassam’s latest Twitter reply. His breathing 
           grows heavier. It looks like Wylie might hyperventilate. 

           A sympathetic MALE MODEL, who’s noticed Wylie’s condition, 
           comes over and places a hand on his shoulder. 

                                 MALE MODEL
                        You OK, mate? 

           Wylie looks up at him, unable to answer, as he begins to 
           wheeze and gasp for breath. 

                                 MALE MODEL (CONT’D)
                        Is everything alright? 

           Before he can respond, we FADE TO BLACK.
