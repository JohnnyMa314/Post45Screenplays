                                                                     ii.

          Ninety percent of the ocean is entirely dark. There is no light. 
          There has never been light. For four billion years there has never 
          been light. This ocean makes up most of our planet.

          The world isn't green and blue. It's black.
           EXT. THE DEEP OCEAN - NIGHT

           It says NIGHT, but at the deep ocean floor, there is no DAY 
           or NIGHT. There’s just BLACK WATER in every direction. 

           We’re in that water, moving, pushing forward, struggling to 
           get our bearings, as we see, growing in the distance:

           A SMALL WHITE RECTANGULAR PRISM. And we’re moving towards it.

           As we push closer, the prism grows larger, and we realize -- 

           It’s actually a LARGE, BRILLIANTLY LIT stretch of OCEAN 
           FLOOR, an ARENA the size of a football field.

           POWERFUL STADIUM FLOODLIGHTS shine through the black water, 
           but the water is so dense, that anything not DIRECTLY LIT 
           stays completely BLACK. As a result, the lit portions of the 
           Arena have hard, distinct edges. Here, light. There, dark. 

           The lit water is CRYSTAL CLEAR, no floating bits of algae, 
           etc. It’s the surface of the moon, underwater.

           The grey OOZE of the ocean floor (its actual scientific name) 
           is covered in dead sea animals. Most are gray. Some are blue 
           or red. Fish, cephalopods, eels, thousands of corpses at all 
           levels of decay. Some freshly dead. Some skeletons.

           The JUTTING ARMS of OIL DERRICKS dot the Arena’s uneven 
           surface, perfectly still. They haven’t started pumping. 

           A series of STEEL TUBES stretch across the Arena -- OIL 
           PIPELINES that carry CRUDE OIL from the PUMPS to --

           THE RIG -- a RICKETY COMPOUND at the far end of the Arena. 
           It’s underwater, but it’s recognizably an oil rig. Heavy, 
           ugly, steel construction built for function, not beauty. Home 
           to crew quarters, industrial processing, base control.

           Bubbles RISE from it, an INDUSTRIAL GLASS WINDOW faces out 
           toward the ARENA. We push in on the Rig, as suddenly -- 

           A LOW GROAN sounds from beneath the floor. It grows, until --

           VRRRRRRR! The DERRICKS START TO MOVE, PUMPING for the first 
           time. Up and down, up and down, their motion foreign in the 
           absolute stillness of the OCEAN FLOOR.

           As the LOW RUMBLE continues. Almost hypnotic.

           BANG! A gunshot ROCKS us, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THE RIG - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

           A CORK EXPLODES from a bottle of champagne. See it’s held by  
           DAVID TRAVIS (35), clever, charming. Sort of shut down.

                                 DAVID
                        At the end of a voyage, the captain 
                        usually says a few words.

           See David’s standing on a cheap CAFETERIA TABLE, facing an 
           ANXIOUS CREW of WORKMEN, holding Styrofoam coffee cups.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        When we got here, I thought, what 
                        the fuck did I do. Thinking I could 
                        pull this off. And then I realized, 
                        I couldn’t. But we could. And we 
                        did. “One task, one team.” We said 
                        that then. We say it still, but --

                                 OX
                        Just pour the fucking juice 
                        already.

           David smiles, looks down at OX, 40, squat, snippy. 

                                 DAVID
                        God, I hate you.

                                 OX
                        Mutual, mama. Now let’s get 
                        spitzed.

           Ox holds up his cup. David CAREFULLY POURS champagne into it. 

                                 JEN
                        Too slow, Grandpa.

           JEN (30), Chinese American, holes in her jeans, GRABS the 
           bottle, TIPS it like a bartender, fills CUP after CUP in one 
           perfect movement.

                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        Next bottle please.

                                 DAVID
                        We only have one.

           A LAUGH comes from a WEATHERED GEORGIAN MAN (LEVAN GABRIADZE, 
           50, the adult) in a backward KANGOL HAT.

                                 LEVAN
                        “Levan, the walls will be lined 
                        with champagne,” he told me.
                                 OX
                        He told me I’d have an assistant.

           RAE, lesbian in a tank top. ARMY TATOO on her shoulder.

                                 RAE
                        I was promised mates, not assholes.

                                 DAVID
                        The number on your checks hasn’t 
                        changed. Has it?

                                 CRAIG (O.S.)
                        There’s still time for that.

           CRAIG (30, but kind of still in college) walks out with a 
           HANDLE of JIM BEAM.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Round two, who’s up?

           Ox takes out a lighter -- LIGHTS a fucking cigarette.

                                 DAVID
                        Ox, no -- the fire alarms --

                                 OX
                        Haven’t worked since Frat Boy tried 
                        to play Top Chef.

                                 CRAIG
                             (butt hurt)
                        The thermometer in that oven is 
                        severely miscalibrated.

           David SNATCHES the cigarette out of Ox’s mouth. He SNUFFS it 
           out in the bit of champagne at the bottom of his cup.

           But when he looks up -- Ox is lighting another one.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re a monster.

                                 OX
                        Two hundred eighty six days I’ve 
                        stared into that fucking void. Imma 
                        smoke my reward. You should, too. 
                        “One task, one team,” right?

           Ox puts an arm on David. He points to the derricks.
                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        She’s breathing. She’s pumped -- 
                             (shouted)
                        Craig! What’s the count so far?

           Craig moves over to a DATED CONTROL DECK at the top of the 
           bullpen. BLACK and WHITE cameras of the DERRICKS. PRESSURE 
           LEVELS, ATMOSPHERE, ETC. He checks a GAUGE, numbers rising.

                                 CRAIG
                        Twenty eight!

                                 OX
                             (can’t believe it)
                        Twenty eight thousand barrels in 
                        four minutes. Tide doesn’t turn for 
                        six hours. We have shit to do till 
                        then. Enjoy me. 
                             (to everyone)
                        Cause I’m never seeing any of you 
                        pricks again.

                                 LEVAN
                        Seconded!

                                 JEN
                        Thirded!

                                 CRAIG
                        Fourthed!

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Come on, ya’ll ain’t so bad.

           ANNA, 35, a cowgirl scientist struts in with a handle of --

                                 CRAIG
                        Fireball! Dude! Yes!

                                 ANNA
                        My roots.

           Anna walks up to David, not stopping a moment, and --

           She KISSES David, all out. David’s surprised, but... into it.

                                 OX
                             (re: Anna and David)
                        Someone owes me fifty bucks.

           Ox puts his hand out to Levan: “pay up.”
                                 LEVAN
                        Logic said if it was going to 
                        happen, it would have, already.

                                 ANNA
                        Logic’s never met this Boy Scout.

                                 OX
                        You two should go off. Deepest bang 
                        in the history of man.

           Anna takes a pull of Fireball. 

                                 ANNA
                        What do you say?

           As she jests, we start to absorb the aesthetic of this shit 
           hole. Somewhere between a submarine and a 90s RV. Fake wood 
           paneling. A coffee maker sits by a bottle of Coffee Mate.

           David smiles, then reaches for the whiskey --

                                 OX
                        ‘Atta boy!

           David takes a swig from the bottle. Anna stares back, smiles.

           ACROSS THE WAY

           Levan and Rae talk, each still sipping their champagne.

                                 RAE
                        Seoul, Sydney, Manila, Beijing, 
                        Reykjavik. Then I work my way down 
                        to Morocco, Egypt --

                                 LEVAN
                        What about a personal life?

                                 RAE
                        Covered. I’m doing Switzerland. You 
                        know how many sad lesbians hike the 
                        alps each year? All of them.

                                 LEVAN
                             (raises his glass, shrugs)
                        To loneliness. 

           AT THE CONTROL DECK

           Craig sips Jim Beam, as he runs through a series of final 
           checks on the Rig. Jen comes up -- sits next to him, passes 
           him another shot of Fireball.
                                 JEN
                        How is it you never had to go 
                        outside?

                                 CRAIG
                        Cause. I’m in charge of all these 
                        buttons.

           It’s true. There are a lot of buttons. But Jen senses --

                                 JEN
                        Nope. Bad liar. Try again.

                                 CRAIG
                        It’s a medical issue.

                                 JEN
                        We talking, gout? Polio?

                                 CRAIG
                             (not gonna get out of it)
                        I’m afraid of the dark. Okay?
                             (off her laugh)
                        There’s gnarly shit out there. This 
                        is my fierce inner animal saying, 
                        stay the fuck away.
                             (suddenly)
                        Hey hey hey! Don’t touch that.

           We see -- Jen’s got her hand on a knob on the control panel.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        That controls heat in the oil main. 
                        If it gets too hot...
                             (motions toward the Arena)
                        All that goes -- kaboom!

                                 JEN
                        Huh. Kaboom. Guess that’s why 
                        you’re in charge of the buttons.

           Craig grabs his shot, nods “yeah”. Then throws it back.

           AT THE TABLE 

           David and Anna sit together, bump knees. It’s cute.

                                 DAVID
                        What happened to “this was fun, but 
                        we’re not compatible?”

                                 ANNA
                        I lied. I’m into it.
                                 DAVID
                        This whole time? Then why --

                                 ANNA
                        Didn’t I want to spend six months 
                        sneaking around, fucking the boss?
                             (he kind of gets it)
                        It’s not like you were gonna stop 
                        diggin’ this bod. So, I hit pause.

           David can’t tell if he’s offended or impressed.

                                 DAVID
                        I feel played.

                                 ANNA
                        Checkmate, Boy Scout.

           David brings her hand to his mouth. Kisses it, sweetly. She 
           goes in to kiss him again, when --

           CHUNG! The POWER SHUTS OFF, and -- the entire fucking place 
           goes dark. Totally. Completely. Our screen is just black.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        Not loving this...

                                 JEN (V.O.)
                             (to Craig)
                        Fight that fear, bud!

           A small red light pokes through the darkness. The ember from 
           Ox’s cigarette. It lights his face in an eerie glow.

           We just BARELY start to recognize the shapes of our heroes.

                                 RAE
                        But like. Actually...

           As the darkness persists.

                                 ANNA
                        Any orders for us? Captain? 

                                 DAVID
                        Right, let’s...

           Before he can answer -- KACHUNG! KACHUNG! 

           LIGHTS come back on throughout the Rig. Hallway lights CHUNG! 
           CHUNG! CHUNG! Come on in succession.

           OUTSIDE IN THE ARENA
           KACHUNG! The STADIUM LIGHTS turn on, one by one, illuminating 
           the Arena. The darkness outside receding one light at a time.

           Finally, ALL THE LIGHTS are on inside the Rig. Craig is 
           sweating. This dude is really afraid of the dark.

                                 OX
                        Well, that spoiled the mood.

                                 RAE
                        Fucking nightmare.

                                 ANNA
                        What do you think it was?

                                 DAVID
                        First time we turned on the pumps. 
                        Maybe something shook loose.

                                 LEVAN
                        That far down. What shakes loose?

           As the DERRICKS slowly start to pump again, Craig checks the 
           control deck -- which shows the vital signs of the Rig.

                                 CRAIG
                             (reading)
                        All systems back on. Diagnostics 
                        aren’t showing shit, so... Maybe 
                        it’s all good?

           Anna looks out the bullpen window. See -- zztt! An ARENA 
           STADIUM LIGHT is flickering now.

                                 ANNA
                        Maybe, not.

           INT. THE RIG - PUMP CONTROL ROOM

           David and Rae move into a TIGHT INDUSTRIAL SPACE. A LARGE 
           PIPE shoots straight down. The oil main.

                                 RAE
                        If it’s pinched a power cable, 
                        we’re fucked. It’s two miles deep.

                                 DAVID
                        Two miles. Jesus. Can you scoot 
                        under the engine, check the 
                        converter belt?

                                 RAE
                        Not for what you’re paying me.
                                 DAVID
                        I’m paying you the GDP of Tonga.

                                 RAE
                        Which I can’t collect if I’m dead.

           INT. THE RIG - BULLPEN - SAME

           Craig sits at the control deck, his feet up, sipping his 
           whiskey. He’s talking into a COMM UNIT.

                                 CRAIG
                        Guess they’re not having much luck 
                        downstairs.

                                 JEN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        David wants to waste his time 
                        hunting mechanical issues. His 
                        choice. But the grid is my job.

           INT. THE RIG - AIRLOCK - SAME

           Jen waits nervously in a PRESSURIZED SUIT and GLASS HELMET as 
           water rises at her feet. She’s in a STEEL ROOM, the size of a 
           ONE-CAR GARAGE.

                                 JEN
                        It’s a blown fuse. Simple.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        You know David; he always wants to 
                        swoop in to the rescue.

           The water rises more and more. The two sit in silence.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I told my mom I’d buy her a 
                        swimming pool when I get back.

                                 JEN
                        I’m never touching water again.

           The water rises over Jen’s head. When the airlock’s full --

           The walls start to CLOSE IN, as the room starts to compress.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Outside pressure’s matched and --
           CHNN! The DOOR of the AIRLOCK OPENS -- a RAMP leads down to 
           THE ARENA FLOOR. 

                                 JEN
                        Last fucking time.

           Jen steps down the ramp, to --

           EXT. THE ARENA - INTERCUT

           Jen trudges forward through the layers of dead, rotted fish. 
           Their ooze rises to her knees as she GRIPS a TOOLBOX. 

                                 JEN
                        ‘Member when these critters were 
                        all alive?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Crude oil wasn’t a healthy addition 
                        to their environment. Who knew?

                                 JEN
                        I feel sort of guilty.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I tell myself we saved them from 
                        being savagely eaten.

           She trudges over to TWO SMALL VEHICLES -- like SNOW-MOBILES 
           for the bottom of the ocean. TREADS.

           Jen STRADDLES a Tread.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        You on?

                                 JEN
                        Let her rip.

           INSIDE 

           Craig hits a “START VEHICLE” button, and -- 

           The THE WRONG TREAD TURNS ON -- TAKES off, JETTING along the 
           Arena floor.

                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        Wrong tread, dumbass.

           Craig scrambles -- HITS the button. STOPS the other Tread.
                                 CRAIG
                        Fuck. I’m wasted.

                                 JEN
                        Four shots after a year without 
                        booze. We fucked up that math, huh?

           Craig hits the RIGHT button, and Jen’s Tread starts up.

           INT. THE RIG - OIL CAGE

           David’s lying FLAT underneath a LARGE MACHINE that connects 
           to the oil main. He’s TWISTING a bolt. Then realizes --

                                 DAVID
                        Jen was right. Must have just been 
                        a blown fuse. Here, I’m coming out--

           David GROANS as he tries to pull his wrench out from the 
           UNDERSIDE of the machine. He YANKS it, as --

           WHOOF! A BLAST of OIL SHOOTS from the pipe, SPRAYING David in 
           the face, covering him in goo.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Jesus.

           Rae can’t help but laugh.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (joking. Sort of...)
                        Don’t laugh. I could have drowned.

                                 RAE
                        At the bottom of the sea, man 
                        drowns in oil.

           EXT. THE ARENA - NEAR THE FLICKERING STADIUM LIGHT

           Jen reaches the floodlight, RIGHT at the edge of the Arena. A 
           hard, distinct edge separates the light from the black.

           She drops her toolbox, pulls out a socket wrench -- starts 
           TWISTING a BOLT on a CIRCUIT BOX.

           Jen gets the box OPEN -- sees a PANEL of circuits inside. 

           She grabs a LARGE FLARE from her belt. It looks like a STICK 
           OF DYNAMITE. She RIPS the fuse off, as --

           a SPHERE of RED LIGHT BLOSSOMS around her, three feet in 
           every direction. The GLOW lights up the CIRCUIT BOARD.
                                 JEN
                        Yep. Just a fucking fuse... A bunch 
                        of them, actually.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        You got enough replacements?

           Jen reaches down into her toolbox. She grabs a few FUSES, 
           when -- A ROCK beneath her feet gives way. Jen SLIPS --

                                 JEN
                        Fuck!

           -- and KICKS her toolbox forward, it TUMBLES toward the edge 
           of the light. She reaches for it, but --

           It keeps rolling down the slope, disappearing into the black.

                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        I just kicked my box into the shit.

                                 CRAIG
                        Maybe less wasted people should be 
                        doing this?

           Craig tries to slap himself sober, as he sees on his scanner--

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Jen what are you doing?

           Jen’s walking toward the DARK. She’s gonna leave the Arena.

                                 JEN
                        It’ll take me forty minutes to go 
                        back and grab another one.

                                 CRAIG
                        We’ll send someone else.

                                 JEN
                        The last time Rae tried this she 
                        shorted the whole grid.

                                 CRAIG
                             (actually upset now)
                        Jen!

                                 JEN
                        Hey. Scaredy cat. It’s ten fucking 
                        meters past the boundary.
           He pulls up a rectangular map of the Arena, overlain with a 
           checkered grid. It’s dated software, circa Windows 2000. Jen 
           is a dot flashing at the edge. 

                                 CRAIG
                        I’ll get David. I swear.

                                 JEN
                             (considering, then)
                        Fine. You win.

           With that, Jen takes a breath, clutches her flare, and -- 

           Steps past the wall of light. Wholly entering the black. For 
           all of her bravado -- she shivers at the first step.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        God dammit --

           We’re alone in the black with Jen. Hear Craig run away from 
           the control deck. Once he’s gone, it’s utterly silent. Jen 
           steps forward, further into the unknown.

           INT. PUMP CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           David’s ragging oil off of him, when -- Craig runs up. David 
           sees the mix of panic and anger on Craig’s face.

                                 DAVID
                        What?

           But Craig just shakes his head.

           INT. THE RIG - HALLWAY

           David, still messy, runs with Craig following.

                                 DAVID
                        You told her, you would get me?

                                 CRAIG
                        It was the first thing I said.

           David and Craig TURN the corner into

           THE BULLPEN

           Where David moves to the comm unit --
                                 DAVID
                             (into comm)
                        Jen, come back immediately. That’s 
                        an order.

                                 JEN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I’m almost there.

           IN THE DARK - INTERCUT

           Jen’s approaching the toolbox, which we see now, barely lit.

                                 DAVID
                             (via comm, to Jen)
                        Don’t leave the Arena. That’s the 
                        fucking rule.
                             (to Craig)
                        How much did she have to drink?

                                 CRAIG
                        More than me. And I’m... not great.

                                 DAVID
                             (into comm)
                        There are geothermal vents that can 
                        melt steel. There are rocks sharp 
                        enough to pierce your suit.

           Off no response.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Drones tilled the Arena for five 
                        years to make it safe for us. 
                        You’re in extreme danger.

                                 JEN
                        Watch how dangerous it is.

           Jen stands above the toolbox. She turns back toward the Rig.

           David jumps up -- runs to the window. Sees Jen as a lit red  
           dot in the unknown black.

                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        Here I go.

           Jen reaches down to grab the toolbox. For a second, she 
           stops. Looks behind her. Did she just hear something?

           Nope.

           She grabs the toolbox. Hoists it up.
                                 DAVID
                        I have to write you up, now. You 
                        know that.

                                 JEN
                             (playful, in Chinese)
                        Gan ni nia.

           Jen heads back toward the Arena.

           As David turns to the Crew. He translates.

                                 DAVID
                        “Fuck your mother.”

           Jen nears the edge of the Arena.

                                 JEN
                        Oh look. Made it.

           David throws his hands up, pissed off. But so relieved.

                                 DAVID
                        Just hurry back.

           As Jen’s about to step back into the light.

           VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... 

           A LOW, VIBRATING ROAR emits from the ocean. 

           The vibration PULSES through the water -- BLURRING it, 
           blocking our view of anything.

           IN THE BULLPEN

           A PLATE, Ox’s MAKESHIFT ASHTRAY, RATTLES on the desk -- 

                                 JEN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I can’t see anything.

                                 DAVID
                             (into comm)
                        Rae, something wrong with the 
                        engine?

                                 RAE (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        That ain’t me, boss.
           INT. PUMP CONTROL ROOM

           See Rae with Levan -- standing back from the ENGINE. It’s all 
           working properly, but they’re also vibrating.

                                 RAE
                        That’s coming from out there.

           BACK WITH DAVID

           His face drops. The ashtray RATTLES even harder --

                                 DAVID
                        So then what --

                                 JEN (V.O.)
                        Help!

           David looks to the window, confused, frightened --

                                 DAVID
                        Jen!

           Anna, Ox and David RUN to the WINDOW -- staring into the 
           blurred water. More SCREAMS from Jen. 

                                 JEN (O.V.)
                             (broken, over comm)
                        -- can’t -- you god --

                                 ANNA
                        Jen what’s wrong? 

                                 JEN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        No!

                                 DAVID
                        Jen!

           The ashtray rattles to the edge. Suddenly -- it DROPS -- 

           CRASH! -- SHATTERS on the ground. The crew jumps.

                      DAVID (CONT'D)
                                                           OX
           Shit!
                                              Fuck!

                                 JEN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Help!

                                 DAVID
                        Jen!!!
           And just like that....

           The vibration stops. 

           The water suddenly clears again.

           The entire crew now stands at the VAST INDUSTRIAL WINDOW --

           Their backs to us. Staring into the Arena.

                                 ANNA
                             (seeing)
                        Oh, no...

           Jen’s not there. 

           David looks again. Takes a breath. Then --

                                 OX
                        What the fuck?

           He SNAPS into action -- turns to Craig.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe her suit light failed --
                             (into comm)
                        Jen!

                                 OX
                        I don’t understand.

                                 DAVID
                        Jen! Hello! Jen! Answer me.

           Craig hops into his seat, starts to manipulate the controls.

                                 CRAIG
                        David, she’s not here.

                                 DAVID
                        Her location sensor.
                             (into comm)
                        Jen!

                                 CRAIG
                        She’s not here, she’s --

           And then a DOT blinks on his radar. Far from the Arena.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        That’s a half mile.

           Craig turns to the crew, like --
                                 OX
                        How the fuck?

           As Rae and Levan rush into the bullpen. Off their stares --

           INT. THE RIG - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           David’s RUSHING down the hallway. Craig’s behind him.

                                 DAVID
                        There’s a thousand things that 
                        could block her comm. Steel 
                        deposits, a deep enough rift.

                                 ANNA
                        How would she get so far?

                                 DAVID
                        If she tripped and tumbled down --

                                 OX
                        Nah. This was something else, man. 
                        Something did this!

           The entire crew is running to keep up with them.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 DAVID
                             (ignoring Ox, to Craig)
                        Get me a mobile radar unit. The 
                        rest of you get the return sub 
                        prepped. If she’s hurt, I want to 
                        leave the minute I’m back.

                                 ANNA
                        We’re coming with you.

                                 DAVID
                        No, you’re not. 

                                 ANNA
                        Yes, we are. “One task. One team.”

                                 DAVID
                        It takes three people to man the 
                        return sub. We don’t know what the 
                        fuck happened. I’m not bringing any 
                        of you out, till we do.
                                 ANNA
                        What if she’s stuck and you need 
                        help lifting her?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m not risking your lives. If 
                        something happens to me. The rest 
                        of you get out of here.

                                 OX
                        And what if she’s been attacked?

                                 DAVID
                             (too quick)
                        There’s nothing to suggest that. 

                                 LEVAN
                        The screaming.

                                 DAVID
                             (won’t think about it)
                        Her vitals are normal.

                                 ANNA
                        What if it were me out there?

           This gets awkward looks from the crew. Like they’ve stumbled 
           into the middle of a couple’s fight.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Would you still refuse?

           David’s in a weird spot. He looks at the crew. Anna’s caught 
           him. He shakes his head. Can’t say no. So --

           INT. NEAR THE AIRLOCK - MINUTES LATER

           David stands in his pressurized suit and helmet. REVERSE to 
           see Ox, Anna and Levan suited up with him. They sort through  
           equipment set on LARGE INDUSTRIAL SHELVING UNITS.

                                 OX
                        Thirty four flares.

                                 ANNA
                        We can each take eight.

                                 DAVID
                        Everyone take three.
                             (off their look)
                        We can’t use every flare on the 
                        rig. Three.
           The crew grab THREE FLARES each, lock them into their belts.

                                 LEVAN
                        Perhaps we take spears?
                             (off their unease)
                        Simply for kicks.

           Levan grabs a RETRACTABLE SPEAR, looks like a SHORT HARPOON. 
           He hands one to David, Anna, Ox and keeps one for himself. 

                                 OX
                        Charges, too. For double kicks.

           Levan takes FOUR small HOCKEY PUCK-sized explosives. He FLIPS 
           a switch. They glow green. He TWISTS the puck -- they glow 
           RED, then twists them back, turns them off.

           Finally, David grabs a SMALL METAL BOX: a PRESSURIZED CAMERA.

           INT. AIRLOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Ox, Levan, David, Anna step into the airlock together. Rae 
           stands by at the door.

                                 RAE
                        Everyone set?

           The crew nods, as Rae hits a button and the HEAVY FUCKING 
           STEEL DOOR SLIDES into place -- and -- PFOOOM! Locks.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I’m pressurizing at double speed. 
                        Don’t spook.

           INT. BULLPEN - INTERCUT

           Craig sits at the control deck. Rae walks in, sits down. They 
           check diagrams of the Arena and monitor the crew vitals.

                                 RAE
                        We’re not gonna crush them?

           As Craig pulls a lever, speeding up the pressurization.

                                 CRAIG
                        Not unless my hand slips.

           INSIDE THE AIRLOCK

           The walls SHAKE and RATTLE as water floods in. The crew kind 
           of nods. The water rises past their knees.
                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know this territory any 
                        better than you. But I do know --

           The water rises past their chests.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        If we’re bickering out there, Jen’s 
                        fucked. We need to move fast.

           The cage GROANS, as the water RISES above their heads.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        So if I give an order, you follow 
                        it. And under no circumstances, do 
                        we split up. Understand?

           Pressurization starts, as the walls move inward, SQUEEZING --

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Tell me you understand.

           BANG! A GUNSHOT makes the crew JUMP. We see --

                                 OX
                        -- the fuck --

           CLANG! A PIECE of STEEL on the floor imploding. CLANG! CLANG! 
           The noise rocks the room as the steel collapses in on itself.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What is that?

           Anna reaches down, grabs a mangled piece of steel.

                                 ANNA
                             (realizing)
                        Rae left her walkie. It just got 
                        crushed with the weight of the 
                        Eiffel Tower.

           Levan turns to her. Smiles.

                                 LEVAN
                        A good omen.

           The airlock SHAKES, as the pressurization ends. Motors TURN 
           and the AIRLOCK DOOR opens. They look out on the Arena.
           EXT. THE ARENA - MOMENTS LATER

           David leads the crew, TRUDGING through ooze to the edge of 
           the light. For the first time, we realize the difficulty of 
           moving out here. Like trying to sprint through syrup.

           Anna comes behind David. Sees his face. Manic, determined. 
           She holds up two fingers. They switch to a private channel.

                                 ANNA
                        You’ve got to calm down.

                                 DAVID
                        Not till she’s safe.

                                 ANNA
                             (re: her comment, “what if 
                              it were me out there.”)
                        Sorry if I overstepped back there. 
                        I just... 

                                 DAVID
                        No. It’s fine. You were right.
                             (nothing else to say)
                        Back to one.

           As soon as they FLIP --

                                 OX
                        Tummy doesn’t feel great. Someone 
                        remind me why I drank Fireball.

                                 DAVID
                        If you’re sick, go back.

                                 OX
                        Sick of you in my ear.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE EDGE OF THE ARENA

           The point where light meets dark. Like a literal wall. Our 
           team arrives.

                                 ANNA
                        Let’s light up.

           Anna, David and Ox pull out FLARES. They RIP their fuses and 
           PWOOF! - BURNING SPHERES of BRIGHT RED in the darkness.

                                 OX
                        After you, cap’n.
           David stares into the dark. Faced with the prospect of 
           actually stepping in, he’s less sure of himself. He stalls.

                                 DAVID
                        What’s her 02 at?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Seventy five minutes.

                                 DAVID
                        And vitals?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Same as three minutes ago.

                                 DAVID
                        Just fucking tell me.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        ...normal.

           None of them want to take the first step. Anna approaches the 
           barrier. Cautiously, she sticks her hand into the darkness.

                                 ANNA
                        I’ve been pretending the world 
                        stopped right here.

           Ox joins her at the edge. He sticks his hand across, gets 
           chills as he does.

                                 LEVAN
                        In the beginning... the earth was 
                        without form and void; and darkness 
                        was upon the face of the deep.

                                 OX
                        Who said that? Jesus?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s Genesis. And the scripture 
                        ends, “Let there be light.”

           Levan smiles at David, then -- SPARKS his flare.

                                 LEVAN
                        Agreed.

           He turns, and -- steps into the darkness. 
           We see -- the floor OF FISH GUTS continues outward -- but 
           now, JAGGED ROCKS poke through. It’s treacherous as fuck.

                                 OX
                        Just started believing in God. So 
                        that’s good.

                                 DAVID
                             (into comm)
                        Guys? We on course?

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Craig monitors the grid, showing the crew’s locations in the 
           dark. They’re a bunch of DOTS moving slowly toward JEN’S DOT.

                                 CRAIG
                             (into comm)
                        Just keep going straight.
                             (to Rae)
                        I feel like we’re sending them up 
                        the river.

                                 RAE
                        Ahoy, Colonel Kurtz.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        How far out are we? A number.

           Craig turns to Rae, annoyed at David.

                                 CRAIG
                        I swear to God.

           Craig leans into the comm unit.

           IN THE DARK

           Levan leads the group as they weave through the jagged rocks, 
           trying not to slip. David brings up the rear, on the lookout.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I can’t give you exacts. But 
                        there’s a rock ahead. It’s big. Go 
                        around the left side, there’s a 
                        sort of clearing, it levels out.

           Levan walks slowly, with purpose, then --

                                 LEVAN
                        Shit!
           A FLASH OF BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT shoots from below Levan. He 
           jumps -- frightened.

                                 OX
                        What is it?

           Anna looks at the ground where the light came from.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s phytoplankton.

                                 OX
                        And why’s it flashing us?

                                 ANNA
                        It ingests acids from the water and 
                        as they digest, it emits light.

                                 OX
                        It shits light? What kind of thing 
                        shits light?

                                 ANNA
                        The kind that’s been brewing down 
                        here for three billion years.

           As the rest of the team moves on, Anna SWEEPS her hand 
           through the plankton. It lights up like little stars.

                                 LEVAN (O.S.)
                        There is a problem.

           Anna turns the corner to see --

           A CLEARING

           The size of a bedroom, in the center -- there’s nothing.

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        We are here. She is not.

           The whole crew arrives. Scans the area. He’s right.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re sure this is it?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        She should be right there. 

                                 DAVID
                        Check it again, restart the system.
                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm, annoyed)
                        The system is working. She’s there.

           David does another sweep of the clearing. Then realizes --

                                 DAVID
                        She’s beneath us.

           The team looks down. Hadn’t thought of this. Levan agrees.

                                 LEVAN
                        So, how did she get there?

           Ox does a 360, searching for signs of danger.

                                 OX
                        Something’s out there.

           Rather than worry about this -- David DROPS to his knees -- 
           furiously starts DIGGING into the ground.

                                 DAVID
                        Everyone take a corner.

           Everyone but Ox drops down and digs. They heave and groan. 
           These suits weren’t meant to do work. It’s not easy.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Ox, fucking help.

                                 OX
                        I’m standing watch!

                                 ANNA
                        Drop -- now.

           Ox drops -- but keeps glancing up, as the whole team burrows 
           into the ground.

                                 DAVID
                        Craig, how’s her breathing?

           INSIDE THE RIG

           Craig checks her vitals.

                                 CRAIG
                        Elevated. She’s burning through 02. 
                        But we’ve got a good forty minutes.

           BACK IN THE WATER

           They keep DIGGING and DIGGING, growing more and more nervous.
                                 ANNA
                        I’ve got something.

           Anna wipes some ooze away as we see -- A SUITED HAND JUTTING 
           OUT THE DIRT.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God. It’s her.

                                 DAVID
                        Shit. 

                                 LEVAN
                        Dear.

                                 DAVID
                        Craig, we’ve got her! 

           David starts digging around the hand.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Please be okay. Please be okay.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (via comm)
                        Is she hurt? How’s she look?

                                 DAVID
                        She’s in the dirt. Watch her vitals 
                        if anything spooks.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        Jen, if you can hear me, stay calm, 
                        we’re getting you out.

                                 ANNA
                        Come on...

           David nods to Levan for help. Together, they GRAB Jen’s hand, 
           HEAVE her upward. But her body barely moves.

                                 OX
                        This is bad. Something did this.

                                 DAVID
                             (to Ox and Anna)
                        See if you can dig around her arm, 
                        loosen up the dirt.

           They DROP to their knees, start digging more and more dirt.
                                 OX
                        Is anyone listening to me?

                                 LEVAN
                        For the moment, no.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s try again. On three. One, two-

           On three, they PULL on Jen’s hand -- she moves up a bit more.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        She’s coming, come on, harder. Grab 
                        her arm.

                                 LEVAN
                        We’re going to hurt her.

                                 DAVID
                        We don’t have a choice -- Anna.

           Anna jumps to help them. They grab, HEAVE again, and -- PULL 
           Jen’s body up from the ooze. Jen lands FACE DOWN. 

                                 ANNA
                        Come on, girl. Come on.

           Anna moves to her -- grabs her, TURNS her over to see --

           The MASK of her suit is BLASTED OPEN -- her suit fully 
           breached. As inside we see --

           A SWIRL of GUTS -- a PULVERIZED HUMAN BEING

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my god!

                           DAVID
                                                           OX
           -- fuck --
                                              -- Jesus --

                                 LEVAN
                        Lord.

                                 OX
                        Oh, no --

           Ox SPITS UP in his suit seeing the flesh. A bit of vomit 
           SPLASHES on his mask. He takes a breath. Tries to wipe it 
           clean with his chin.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What is it?
                                 ANNA
                        She’s...

           But Anna can’t even finish. Tears forming in her eyes.

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Rae’s mouth hangs open. Craig is just stunned, sick.

                                 RAE
                        Girl.

           IN THE DARK

           David wipes his hand across his forehead, tearing up.

                                 DAVID
                        I told her to come back!

           Anna sits on the ground, devastated. She holds Jen’s hand.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I don’t understand.

                                 DAVID
                        Something breached her mask. She’s 
                        dead.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        No she’s not.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        No. I mean she’s not dead.

                                 LEVAN
                        We can see her remains.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        It says she’s still alive.

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Craig and Rae look at the board. Sure enough. Jen’s heartbeat 
           is good and pumping.

                                 CRAIG
                        Solid vitals. Nothing’s changed.
           BACK IN THE WATER

           David looks at Jen’s suit. A SMALL PACK on her belt is 
           crushed and blinking erratically.

                                 DAVID
                        Her life-post is smashed. Must 
                        be... an error. Or... Christ.

                                 ANNA
                             (seeing something)
                        Wait.

           There’s a GLINT on the ground, sticking up through the ocean 
           floor. Anna stops. Bends down to it.

           She reaches out, wipes away some ooze --

           IT’S ANOTHER HUMAN HAND IN A SUIT. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Guys...

           Anna moves forward, just to be sure, wipes more ooze away --

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Guys!

           They turn to her. She points down at the hand, backing up.

                                 OX
                        The fuck -- the fuck!

                                 LEVAN
                        What is this.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What’s happening?

           David reaches down -- GRABS the hand --

                                 DAVID
                        Help.

                                 LEVAN
                        Here.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Guys! What is it?

           Levan grabs too, and they -- HEAVE --
           ANOTHER BODY PULLS OUT. 

           Fully suited. 

           The facemask also broken. A SWIRL of guts inside.

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t understand.

                                 OX
                        How is this possible?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Would someone fucking tell me?

                                 LEVAN
                        There’s a second body.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What?

           Levan turns to David.

                                 LEVAN
                        Captain?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know anything about this.

                                 LEVAN
                        Not a single thing?

                                 DAVID
                             (gets the implication)
                        Not a single thing.

                                 OX
                        Bullshit.

           It’s a bit of a standoff. No one knows the next move.

                                 LEVAN
                        Hold on.

           Levan squats by the first body. He pushes away the guts of 
           the ruined face, unfazed --

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        There’s a serial number.

           Levan points at the number. Ox realizes --
                                 OX
                        We can run a search through the 
                        supply stock. Match it to a crew 
                        member.

                                 ANNA
                        Craig, you hear all that?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I’m ready. Hit me.

                                 LEVAN
                             (reading)
                        A-4-1-

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Craig enters the number as Levan reads them.

                                 LEVAN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)

                                 CRAIG
                             (to Rae)
                        Pull up the history of pressure 
                        synchronizations from the airlock.

           Craig hits in the last few letters -- hits SEARCH when --

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Okay, looks like they belong to --

           “HISTORY DELETED” comes up on the page.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Those records were deleted.

           BACK IN THE WATER - INTERCUT

           Anna looks between the bodies. Everyone on fucking edge.

                                 OX
                        You’re fucking me.

                                 CRAIG
                        It says deleted --

                             (crazy nervous, now)
                        Well, check it again.

           Craig pulls it up again. The same error.
                                 CRAIG
                        Deleted.

                                 OX
                        The fuck is going on?

                                 DAVID
                        Close out history -- search all 
                        vital syncs.

                                 CRAIG
                        Pulling it up.

           Craig pulls it up, as --

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Files purged January 14th 2018.

           And THIS fucking floors the entire crew.

                                 ANNA
                        That’s the day after we docked.

                                 OX
                        No shit.

                                 LEVAN
                        Who can delete files?

                                 DAVID
                        No one.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (continuing to read)
                        David, you signed in that day.

           They’re all slipping into the abyss. David jumps in --

                                 DAVID
                        Obviously, I didn’t do it.

                                 LEVAN
                        Little is obvious.

                                 DAVID
                        Everyone calm down. This doesn’t 
                        change anything.

                                 OX
                        Unless you brought me here to 
                        fucking kill me.

                                 DAVID
                        No one killed anyone!
                                 OX
                        They sure as fuck didn’t kill 
                        themselves! If it wasn’t someone. 
                        It was something.

                                 ANNA
                        Stop it!
                             (taking control)
                        After we find Jen. We get this. 
                        Hash it out. After.

                                 OX
                        No.

                                 ANNA
                        After.

                                 OX
                        We cannot ignore this. Has everyone 
                        lost their fucking minds?

           But no one answers him. Everyone’s going to wait to freak 
           out. Ox just waves his hands, takes a breath. David stares at 
           Ox, like... “just shut the fuck up.”

                                 DAVID
                             (to Craig)
                        Can you get her vertical location?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Sonar only works up to ten feet 
                        underground.

                                 DAVID
                        And her comm signal?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Doesn’t give me depth at all. But 
                        you’re standing right on her.

           David looks beneath him. He looks to Anna.

                                 DAVID
                        Should we just keep digging? You 
                        know the terrain best.

                                 ANNA
                        I guess...

                                 LEVAN (O.S.)
                        No.
           See, Levan stands at the edge of the clearing, looking down. 
           Anna and David join him, look down and see --

           They’re actually at the edge of a cliff. The clearing is on a 
           promontory that JUTS OUT over a deep canyon below (think 
           PRIDE ROCK). Of course... we can’t see this canyon yet.

           Levan SPARKS a new flare. Lays it at the edge of the cliff. 
           Places a rock over it to mark this point.

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        This way.

           Levan turns, finds a less steep path that seems to descend 
           into the canyon. Ox, David and Anna follow --

           EXT. DESCENDING INTO THE CANYON - MINUTES LATER

           The crew navigates a sharply sloping path, like they’re 
           climbing down a steep mountain.

           It’s tricky, maneuvering boulders and slippery rock. No one 
           speaks -- just concentrating on the descent.

           EXT. THE CANYON FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

           The arrive at the bottom -- where the terrain levels out. 

           They look back up and see -- the RED FLARE that Levan left. 
           It’s now TEN STORIES UP.

                                 OX
                             (knows the answer)
                        Were we just up there?

           They move toward the flare, aiming to get directly underneath  
           it. Directly underneath where they were digging for Jen.

           And as they arrive, they see --

                                 LEVAN
                        She’s here.

           AN ENORMOUS PIT

           TWENTY FEET wide, almost a perfect circle. It goes straight 
           down, seemingly forever.

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        Down there.

           As they stare into the pit.
                                 DAVID
                             (into comm)
                        Craig, can you confirm we’re on 
                        target?

           But there’s no response.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (into comm)
                        Craig!

           Still nothing.

                                 ANNA
                        We must be out of comm range.

           The crew looks to each other. No one’s happy about this.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s fine. They know we were 
                        descending. They’ll figure it out.

           David walks to the edge of the pit, he looks straight down.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        How far do you think it goes?

                                 OX
                        All the way.

           Anna grabs a flare, 

           LIGHTS it, 

           DROPS it into the pit.

           And it falls.

           Slowly.

           Dropping.

           It illuminates jagged rocks on the sides of the pit.

           But the flare starts growing dimmer as it drops...

           Deeper...
           Deeper...

           Deeper...

           Deeper...
           Until...

           ...it disappears.
           Ox shakes his head -- done with this.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going down there.

                                 LEVAN
                        Nor would the devil.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m going.

           Anna looks to David. She expected this, but still.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got a tether and a hundred 
                        feet of rope. You can lower me.

                                 ANNA
                        You’re not going alone.

                                 DAVID
                             (trying to be nice)
                        Yes, Anna. This time. I am.

                                 ANNA
                             (getting angry)
                        “Under no circumstances do we 
                        separate.” One task, one team.

                                 LEVAN
                        -- David.

                                 DAVID
                             (to Anna, intense)
                        Jen is fucking dying. Every second 
                        we sit here arguing --

                                 ANNA
                        You killing yourself doesn’t help --

                                 DAVID
                        It’s done! Okay? It’s done.

           A beat of silence, then.

                                 LEVAN
                        At least take a spear?

           Levan takes his spear out -- offers it to David.

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        If something is down there --
                                 DAVID
                             (cutting him off)
                        One spear won’t make a difference. 

           Levan accepts. David takes the CARABINEER off his belt. He 
           HOOKS it to his suit, reaches out to Anna and Levan.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got the rope?

           Levan UNWINDS the rope from the back of his suit. They CLIP 
           the end of it to David’s carabineer. Anna’s resigned.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Once I’ve got her, the three of you 
                        should be able to pull us up.

           Ox just shakes his head.

                                 OX
                        Been shit knowin’ ya.

           Anna steps forward, pulls Ox back. David pretends to be 
           annoyed, but really -- he’s just scared.

           Anna THROWS the rope around a jutting rock to secure it.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay.

           David steps off the cliff’s edge and drops into

           THE PIT

           Almost instantly it’s darker, as if the space is smothering 
           him. Anna lets out rope steadily, he sinks downward.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        How’s that feel?

                                 DAVID
                        You can go a bit faster.

           David looks up at the crew. They’re fading rapidly. Even just 
           a few seconds later, they’re growing dim.

           He’s alone.

           Dropping.

           Into black.

           To the bottom of the world.
           David waves his flare, trying to brighten the pit as he looks 
           for Jen. 

           He sees -- TUNNELS break off from the pit, like it’s the hub 
           of a thousand underground pathways.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        There are tunnels everywhere. 

           In the tunnels, all David can see are SHARP ROCKS -- 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Any animal life?

                                 DAVID
                        Nothing.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        There’s gotta be something.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s just rock.

           David sees -- there are SCRATCHES on the rocks.

           As he descends, there are more and more scratches.

           David looks below, as he drops. Still no sign of ocean floor.

           He looks up. 

           He can no longer see Anna at all.

           And then his flare starts to dim.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        My flare’s going out.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Maybe it’s faulty. Spark a new one.

           David SPARKS a new flare. It FLASHES bright at first, then 
           dims to the same level...

                                 DAVID
                        No good.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Shit.
           David looks around him. In the dimmed light of the flare -- 
           the shadows grow large and flickering.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        There must be something choking the 
                        magnesium.

                                 DAVID
                        Can we stop it?

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Can’t answer that from up here.

           David takes a breath. The flare in his hands is little more 
           than a dying candle.

                                 DAVID
                        I can use my flash.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Camera?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s on my belt. Lemme try.

           David RIPS the BLACK BOX of the CAMERA from his belt. He 
           MESSES with the settings. It’s prepped.

           He goes to hit the button. Then hesitates... Does he really 
           want to see what’s lurking down here?

           He has to. For Jen. He hits the button, and --

           FLASH! 

           David’s camera BRILLIANTLY LIGHTS UP the pit -- goes from 
           total darkness to PERFECT BRIGHTNESS. See clearly the jagged, 
           hellish walls around him. Before it drops back to black.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It’s good. Keep going.

           David continues to get lowered down. His helmet the only 
           thing that stays lit through all of this.

           He charges his camera, and --

           FLASH!
           Sees down a tunnel for the first time. Bright specks shine 
           back. They look like EYES. But he can’t see, because seconds 
           later it’s black again.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I think I saw something. I’m moving 
                        closer.

           David charges his flash -- he peers in closer this time. 
           Still worried about what he might see, but --

           FLASH!

           SEE A GIANT FUCKING FISH SKULL INCHES FROM HIS FACE!

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Oh god!

           SUNKEN EYES, ENORMOUS TEETH. Its FLESH mostly ROTTED AWAY. 
           David almost DROPS his camera he’s so scared.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        David!

                                 DAVID
                        I’m fine. It’s just a fish. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Did it attack you?

           He looks at the FISH SKELETON from underneath. 

                                 DAVID
                        It’s dead. Keep going.

           David charges the camera again. What the fuck is he going to 
           meet next. He pushes the button, and --

           FLASH!

           Sees JEN -- BELOW HIM -- to the side of the pit, grabbing 
           onto a rock for dear life.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I see her!

           Hear Anna, Ox and Levan CHEER over the radio.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        You’re sure?
                                 DAVID
                        It’s her! Jen hold on!

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Thank god.

                        OX (V.O.)
                                                      LEVAN (V.O.)
                 (over comm)
                                                (over comm)
           Is she okay?
                                              How does she look?

                                 DAVID
                        Her helmet light’s out.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Is she breathing?

                        OX (V.O.)
                                                          DAVID
                                              Jen, can you hear me?
                 (over comm)
           What can you see?

                                 LEVAN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Is she moving?

                        OX (V.O.)
                                                          DAVID
                 (over comm)
           Tell me what you see!
                                              Wave your hand if you can 
                                              hear me. She’s --

           David JERKS to a halt as the ROPE stops lowering him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Guy’s it’s caught --

                                 LEVAN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- Jen?

                                 DAVID
                        The rope -- ?

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- yeah.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s not moving --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        That’s all we’ve got.

           Uh oh.
                                 DAVID
                        She’s ten meters away --

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- there’s no more fucking rope!

                                 DAVID
                        Tie it to a closer rock --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- we did.

                                 DAVID
                        She’s right there --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- that’s it.

                                 DAVID
                        Ten more meters -- !

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        There’s no fucking ROPE!!!!

           David takes a breath. Fine... he hits the camera --

           FLASH!

           Gets a look at Jen below him. Still can’t see her face.

                                 DAVID
                        -- I’m disconnecting.

                        -- I can’t leave!

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Just hold a second --

                                 DAVID
                        -- no.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        We’ll figure something else --

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- this is fucked.

                                 DAVID
                        She’s gonna die --

                                 OX (V.O.
                             (over comm)
                        -- I don’t like this. 

                                 DAVID
                        I’m going --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- please don’t.

                                 DAVID
                        There’s grooves in the rock --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- you’ll slip.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m fine --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- David!

                                 DAVID
                        I just need quiet --
           David knows better, but he unhooks his tether. Starts 
           CLIMBING down the wall of the pit.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (trying to calm them)
                        It’s solid, okay? It’s safe.

           David carefully climbs down, sweat runs down his neck. He 
           CRANES his head below, sees --

           Jen’s WEDGED between two rocks. Completely stuck.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Jen. I’m right above you. I’m going 
                        to grab your belt okay?

           But David can’t see her belt in the darkness --

           David finds a solid foot hold -- TESTS its hold strength. He 
           charges his camera, leans down. He reaches for her belt. He 
           can’t see precisely, so --

           FLASH!

           CLOSE ON JEN’S GLASS HELMET. See her EYES -- WHITE AND 
           TERRIFYING -- her face covered in BLOOD -- she’s BRUTALLY 
           SCREAMING, but it’s completely silent.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        -- oh fuck!

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve got her she’s -- 

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What?

                                 DAVID

                        -- fuck.
                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What??

                                 DAVID
                        -- she’s hurt. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Shit --

                                 DAVID
                        FUCK -- it’s bad --

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- bad how?

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        She moving -- ?

           She makes eyes with David -- keeps SCREAMING for help.

                                 DAVID
                        Jen --! 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- David.

                                 DAVID
                        She’s saying something --

                        ANNA (V.O.)
                                                        OX (V.O.)

                 (over comm)
           -- just grab her.
                                              What --?

                                 DAVID
                        -- I don’t know. She’s bleeding. 

                        ANNA (V.O.)
                                                     DAVID (CONT'D)
                 (over comm)
                                              What should I do --?
           Shit --

           But now Jen starts talking -- clearly trying to tell him 
           something. David points to his ears, mouths “Can’t hear.”

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        You can’t help her down there --

                                 DAVID
                        -- Jen -- take my arm.
                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Just grab her --

                                 DAVID
                        -- careful.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        She could pull you off --

                                 DAVID
                        -- it’s fine. 

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        It’s not fucking fine --

                                 DAVID
                        Jen -- I’m going to grab you.

           David motions to his arm. He tries to grab her, but -- she 
           PUSHES him back -- shouting something -- 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Try to stay calm.

           David GRABS her belt -- even as she fights him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        She’s fighting me --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- she’s short on 02. 

                                 DAVID
                        I know.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        She could be hallucinating

                                 DAVID
                        I’m trying not to --

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Don’t over think it. Just --

                                 DAVID
                        EVERYONE SHUT THE FUCK UP!!!!

           And they do. David takes a breath. Then.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (gearing himself up)
                        Sorry about this.

           David reaches down -- GRABS Jen -- she’s WRESTLING with him -- 
           trying to break free -- but he HOLDS her close -- firm.

           HOISTS her over his shoulder, fireman’s carry, as he tries to 
           climb back up to the rope.

           He steps onto a rock on the wall of the pit, balancing. He 
           can barely see his feet, as he tries to find a foothold.

           He REACHES up -- grabs a ledge, pulls himself. The rope is 
           now within arms reach.

           David STRETCHES for the rope. But it’s too far. Just barely.

           He takes a careful step forward, feeling out his footing. 
           Once it’s secure, he STEPS forward, but --

           Jen JERKS on his arm, and --

           The rock CRUMBLES beneath him --

           He falls, but --

           SNAGS the rope with his hand. Holding Jen below him with the 
           other. David STRAINS, as --

           He LIFTS Jen up with him -- SNAPS his carabineer onto the 
           rope. Takes a fucking breath.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (to Anna, out of breath)
                        Pull us up.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- you’re attached?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah --

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- the line can buckle.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        He said he’s good --

           David breathes, centering himself as the rope hoists them. 
           But while David’s looking up --
           Jen’s looking down...

           Deep into the pit, staring at something, panicking. 

           She STRUGGLES, trying to get his attention.

                                 DAVID
                        We’re almost there.

           And then we see what Jen’s pointing at. Below David, in the 
           bottom of the pit, a MOVING SHADOW, a DARK ANIMAL SHAPE, the 
           size of a GREAT WHITE swimming up toward us. Its features are 
           unseen. Whatever this thing is, it reflects no light. 

           As the mass moves closer and closer, the light from David’s 
           FLARE grows darker. Like this thing is eating the light...

           Jen’s looking right at it. SCREAMING. DESPERATELY trying to 
           get David’s attention. But his eyes are FIXED above him. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I’ve got you.

           AT THE TOP OF THE PIT

           Anna, Levan and Ox HEAVE on the rope together. They’ve got a 
           rhythm going -- PULL, SLACK, PULL, SLACK.

           IN THE PIT

           JEN stares down at the Unseen creature, devouring David’s 
           light as it grows closer. She finally JERKS him so hard that--

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Ow! 

           He looks down, and sees... 

           That BLACK ANIMAL swimming in the darkness.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (descends into panic)
                        Oh... no, no no no no --

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)

                                              Oh, shit! It’s close --
                 (over comm)
           -- fucking what?

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        -- should we run!?

                        ANNA (V.O.)
                                                      LEVAN (V.O.)

                                              -- is it an animal?
           Fucking shut up and pull --

                                 DAVID
                        I -- can’t see it -- just pull--!

                       LEVAN (V.O.)
                                                     DAVID (CONT'D)
                 (over comm)
                                              -- no no no no!
           We are --

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What can you see --?

                                 DAVID
                        -- get us up!

                       LEVAN (V.O.)
                                                        OX (V.O.)

           You are close.
                                              David!! What do you see?

                                 DAVID
                        I can’t! Just go --!

                        OX (V.O.)
                                                       ANNA (V.O.)

           How will we know --
                                              Ox -- just keep pulling!
                                 LEVAN (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        How far is it behind you?

                                 DAVID
                        I can’t see.

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        WHAT DO YOU MEAN!???

                                 DAVID
                        I mean I can’t fucking see it!!!

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Here!

           AT THE TOP OF THE PIT

           Ox and Levan HEAVE at the ROPE, desperately pulling up, as -- 
           Anna POPS A FLARE and DROPS IT DOWN INTO THE PIT.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh, no...

           The FLARE floats down, we see the silhouette of a creature --

           A BLACK MASS with SPINDLY TENTACLES UNDULATING IN THE WATER. 
           We see its shape, but no other details. 

           It is now and forever UNSEEABLE as anything but a black hole 
           cut out of the frame, swallowing light.

           And just as we’re getting a sense of it’s shape -- the Unseen 
           creature SHOOTS upward -- a TENTACLE WRAPS around Jen’s 
           torso, and -- 

           PULLS her from David’s grasp -- RIPPING her backward.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Shiiiiiiiiiiiit!

           David looks down in time to see --  

           HER LOWER HALF SEVERED from her body in a SINGLE BITE.

           Blood SQUIRTS out of her suit, as water RUSHES in -- crushing 
           the rest of her body, instantly.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Nooooooo!!!!!
           Seconds later -- CHOMP! Her head and torso are SWALLOWED, as 
           if by the darkness itself.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        David!

           And then. Barely skipping a beat --

           WHOOSH! The Unseen ROCKETS upward. It’s TENTACLES SWIRLING -- 
           just black silhouettes in the light of David’s flare.

           David PULLS himself against the wall of the pit -- manages to 
           WEDGE himself in a crack.

                                 OX (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What’s going on!???

           A tentacle WHIPS at him -- SMACKS the rock -- and when it 
           fails to catch him -- 

           It just keeps swimming upward --

                                 DAVID
                        Spears! It’s coming for you!

                                 OX
                             (over comm)
                        God, no.

                                 DAVID
                        Spears!

           AT THE TOP OF THE PIT

           Anna, Ox and Levan watch, as --

           The Unseen JETS out above them. Ox sees Anna DISAPPEAR as the 
           Unseen crosses his view.

                                 OX
                        Holy fuck!

                                 ANNA
                        Stay tight!

           David HEAVES himself out of the pit -- out of breath.

                                 DAVID
                        You can’t see it, except when it 
                        blocks the light. 
           Ox, Levan, and Anna PULL their spears. Hold them in ONE HAND, 
           hold their FLARES in the other.

           They stand BACK to BACK -- READY FOR BATTLE. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It ripped her in half. It grabbed 
                        her or something. It’s fast --

           As their heads spin, suddenly --

           WHAM! The UNSEEN’S TENTACLE GRABS Anna. WRAP around her neck.

                                 ANNA
                        Shit!

           She tries to STAB the thing -- but it SQUEEZES her -- CHOKING 
           her, PREVENTING her from hitting it. As it PULLS her forward--

           Levan SPINS and -- FWOOSH! Shoots his spear toward the 
           Unseen. It STICKS into its DARK BODY.

           It JERKS back IN PAIN -- WRITHING, as --

           VRRRRRR!! The water VIBRATES like we saw before. We realize -- 

                                 DAVID
                        The vibration. It’s screaming! You 
                        hurt it! 

           The Unseen JERKS from SIDE to SIDE -- somehow RIPS the SPEAR 
           out from its body. Maybe with its tentacles, but remember --

           WE CAN’T FUCKING SEE THIS THING.

                                 ANNA
                        Get behind me -- go!

           Levan, now weaponless, moves to Anna -- grabs her flare for 
           her while she fights -- 

                                 OX
                        We’re dead, we’re fucking dead.

                                 DAVID
                        Focus!

           CRASH! The Unseen SMASHES a BOULDER nearby. Fragments SHOOT 
           through the water like SHRAPNEL from a BOMB.

                                 ANNA
                        Get down!

           One SVT!! Hits Anna’s helmet. SCRAPES it -- 
                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           Ox sees the scrape -- losing his shit. He sets his spear -- 

                                 OX
                        FUCK YOU!

           Ox just FIRES into the DARKNESS! The spear SAILS past, 
           doesn’t hit anything.

                                 LEVAN
                        Do not shoot! We have only two 
                        spears left.

           And now they’ve lost track of the thing. Just darkness all 
           around. David’s head spins as he tries to think of what to 
           do. They can’t beat this thing. Not like this --

           Suddenly, their flares start to dim. They grow DIMMER and 
           DIMMER, like dying candles. The Unseen is approaching. It 
           could be two feet in front of them, and they wouldn’t know.

           So David makes a choice --

                                 DAVID
                        Down! In the pit! Go --

                                 OX
                        -- what?

                                 DAVID
                        Get in the tunnel --! 

                                 ANNA
                        -- why?

                                 DAVID
                        The first one at the top! 

                                 ANNA
                        We could fall --

                                 LEVAN
                        -- inside?

                                 DAVID
                        Trust me!

           Anna and Levan process for a second, then --

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        FUCKING GO!
           The two JUMP into the pit -- start CLIMBING down the wall.

                                 OX
                        I’m not --

                                 DAVID
                        -- NOW!

           David grabs Ox -- 

                                 OX
                        Get off me --!

           PULLS him down, as -- WHAM! The Unseen SHATTERS some rocks 
           above. They DROP into the pit.

                                 ANNA
                        -- where’s the tunnel?

                                 LEVAN
                        Which one --?

                                 DAVID
                        -- below to the left. 

                                 ANNA
                        I see it --

                                 DAVID
                        -- Levan.

                                 LEVAN
                        Anna, you -- what?

                                 DAVID
                        -- get a charge ready.

           The TUNNEL’S just below the crew. Levan grabs one of the 
           SMALL EXPLOSIVE CHARGES from his belt; he FLIPS a switch -- 
           it turns green. 

                                 ANNA
                        If you blow that, you’ll block us 
                        in.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s the point!

           The Unseen JETS toward them. The outline of its TENTACLES 
           visible in the light of the flares.

           Levan PULLS himself into the tunnel, then Anna, Ox, David. 

           IN THE TUNNEL
           The team HEAVE their bodies away from the pit, pushing into 
           the darkness, step by step.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           Levan FLIPS the CHARGE -- it turns RED. He SHOVES it inside 
           the rock -- 

                                 LEVAN
                        Get down --

           BOOM!!! The charge FLASHES WHITE. We see the OUTLINE of the 
           SNARLING Unseen, as --

           CRACK! The ROOF of the TUNNEL ENTRANCE SHATTERS into pieces -- 
           then COLLAPSES down -- forming a barricade to the pit.

                                 DAVID
                        Keep going! Run!

           The crew SCRAMBLES deeper into the tunnel, as, on the other 
           side of the barricade, the Unseen -- WHAM! WHAM! slams into 
           the rock barrier. The rocks JOLT with each hit.

                                 OX
                        It’s not gonna hold --

                                 DAVID
                        It’ll hold.

           And then suddenly... The slamming stops. The Unseen gives up.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god.

                                 LEVAN
                        Thank Jesus.

                                 OX
                        Is it gone?

                                 ANNA
                        Shhh...

           They listen. So much so they can hardly stand.

                                 OX
                        I can’t breathe.

                                 ANNA
                        Shhh!!!

           They breathe in silence. 
           Just listening.

           For anything.

           Some sign that they’re finally safe.

           And when all we hear is the moaning of the ocean.

           Their breath returns. And their senses.

           David snaps into boy scout mode. Grabs his location sensor -- 
           we see our position. A blinking dot outside the Arena.

                                 DAVID
                        We’re pointing at the Arena. If the 
                        tunnel keeps its course, we find 
                        the right spot, we bore our way up--

                                 ANNA
                             (not ready to move on)
                        Jen...

           David takes a beat. Swallows a tear. Blames himself. 

                                 DAVID
                             (”we’ll mourn --”)
                        On the rig. Let’s go.

           But Levan isn’t moving. He’s staring at the barricade. Ox 
           besides him.

                                 LEVAN
                        We have awoken something. Deep.

                                 DAVID
                        It doesn’t matter right now.

           But no one has seen... a DARK TENTACLE slithered through the 
           rocks in the barricade. It moves slowly, wraps around Ox’s 
           ankle, and then --

                                 LEVAN
                        It is all that matters.

           It YANKS Ox backward -- PULLING him toward the barricade. 

                                 OX
                        Fuck!!!!!

           He -- WHAM! SLAMS into it.

                                 ANNA
                        Grab him!
           The Unseen’s tentacle thrashes, trying to PULL Ox through the 
           rocks. But David and Anna GRAB each of Ox’s arms, hold him --

                                 OX
                        Ow!!! Fuck!

           Levan RACES over -- RAISES a SPEAR, then -- STABS the 
           TENTACLE. DIRECT HIT. The Unseen SCREAMS, the water BLURS as 
           it releases Ox.

           Ox SCRAMBLES up. Free from the Unseen -- but fully manic now.

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s go.

                                 OX
                             (crazed)
                        Nuh uh! We’ve got to finish it.

           Ox grabs a CHARGE from Levan’s belt -- he FLIPS it GREEN. 
           It’s in ready mode. He’s going to use ANOTHER explosive.

                                 ANNA
                        What are you doing?

                                 OX
                        Ending this.

           Anna tries to grab him, but Ox just PUSHES her back.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you fucking crazy? You could 
                        shatter the ceiling --

           Ox -- FLIPS the CHARGE to RED. It’s about to fucking BLOW! As 
           he goes to THROW it into the barricade --

           WHAM! David TACKLES him -- GRABS the charge away from him -- 
           SWITCHES it to GREEN.

                                 OX
                        Stop!

           Ox FIGHTS him for it, STRUGGLING on the ground. Ox GRABS a 
           ROCK -- SWINGS it and -- 

           WHACK! Hits David in the mask. David REELS -- gets his 
           bearings, fucking INCENSED now.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you fucking insane?
                                 OX
                        This is your fault. You knew about 
                        those bodies.

                                 DAVID
                        No I fucking didn’t!

           Ox goes to HIT David again. But David BLOCKS it.

                                 ANNA
                        Stop! You’ll pierce his suit!

                                 OX
                        What he fucking deserves.

           Ox HOLDS David between his legs. David takes his SPEAR out -- 
           WEDGES it between Ox’s legs, and -- 

           FORCES them apart. But the spear HOOKS on a rock and -- 
           TWISTS Ox’s leg -- CRUNCHING it badly --

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           The two break their hold, as Anna and Levan JUMP between, 
           pushing them apart. They’re both huffing and puffing.

                                 ANNA
                        Call a truce. Let’s go!

                                 DAVID
                             (to Ox)
                        Fuck you!

           But David realizes he just basically said fuck you to Anna.

                                 ANNA
                        Shake. Your fucking. Hands.

           David hates this. But... seeing Anna STARE at him...

           He puts out his hand. 

           Ox hates it, too. But grabs David’s hand. They shake.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Now -- let’s go!

           The team picks up -- starts hurrying through the tunnel, as 
           fast as they can. Every step is a fight. It’s exhausting.

                                 LEVAN
                        It was a trap. He could have killed 
                        Jen any time. He brought us here.
                                 OX
                        So he’s a genius killing monster 
                        fucking thing.

                                 ANNA
                        No.

           Everyone turns to her, “oh yeah?”

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        It’s just an animal.

                                 OX
                        Why couldn’t we see it?

                                 DAVID
                        It wasn’t reflecting light.

                                 OX
                        So it’s magical!

           The team is getting tired, as they RUSH down the tunnel.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s just camouflage!
                             (explaining)
                        There are species, both land and 
                        aquatic that reflect minimal light 
                        using unique epidermal structures. 
                        This is an extreme case, yes, but --

                                 LEVAN
                        It also dimmed our lights.

           Anna nods, almost to herself. Keeps moving.

                                 ANNA
                        Yes... I think it was ingesting it.

                                 OX
                        Eating it?

                                 ANNA
                        Energy is energy.

                                 OX
                        One thing shits light, one eats it. 

                                 LEVAN
                        The circle of life.

                                 DAVID
                        How would that even work?
                                 ANNA
                        I don’t know.

                                 DAVID
                        Why haven’t we seen it, yet? The 
                        Arena is a feast of light. 

                                 LEVAN
                        Our derricks turned on today. 
                        Perhaps we woke it up.

           David, Anna and Ox seem to agree.

                                 DAVID
                        From its year-long nap? It would 
                        have starved.

                                 ANNA
                        Lungfish can go five years without 
                        food.

                                 DAVID
                        It didn’t get that big by eating 
                        once a year.

                                 ANNA
                        Unless it’s very old. Greenland 
                        sharks live 500 years. Some 
                        biologists think it’s a thousand.
                             (explaining)
                        Eight million species live on land. 
                        A hundred million live underwater 
                        and we don’t know a quarter of 
                        them. People don’t get it, down 
                        here, this is our planet. The earth 
                        isn’t blue and green. It’s black. 

           A moment, then --

                                 DAVID
                        Everyone, hold up for a second.

           The crew halts, David PULLS a new flare -- LIGHTS it, shows -- 

           UP AHEAD, the tunnel splits into three different paths.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Let’s split up. One of these must 
                        lead toward the Arena.

           To the side -- see -- Ox is jostling his suit.

                                 ANNA
                        You okay?
                                 OX
                        By boot is fucking bent, it’s 
                        hurting my toes.

                                 ANNA
                        Next time don’t attack your 
                        captain.

                                 OX
                        Shit!

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 OX
                        It really fucking hurts. It’s 
                        pinching a nerve or something, my 
                        foot is freezing cold.

           The three of them look at each other.

                                 DAVID
                        Your foot’s cold?

           Ox looks up at them. Sees how terrified they all look.

                                 OX
                        What? Why are you looking at me 
                        like that?

           David jumps into action -- GRABS Ox’s VITALS BOX, see -- a 
           FLUCTUATION in his suit pressure..

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        What is that?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s... 

                                 ANNA
                        No.

                                 OX
                        What??

                                 DAVID
                        I think it’s a breech.

           The four of them look around each other.

                                 OX
                        This is water?
                             (realizing)
                        Shit! Yeah, it’s at my knee.
           Ox starts to freak out, trying to stay calm.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        So what do we do?

           The four of them think... 

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        Huh?? Somebody answer me?
                             (emotional)
                        David!

                                 DAVID
                        We could try sealing the suit 
                        higher up. You’ll lose your leg. It 
                        might not work.

                                 OX
                        It’s at my junk... Take the leg.

                                 DAVID
                        You could bleed out.

                                 OX
                        Just do it!

                                 DAVID
                        Anna -- on his vitals. You’ll need 
                        to do a bolus of pressure to keep 
                        the water back.

                                 ANNA
                        If it’s too much, I’ll kill him.

                                 DAVID
                        You’ve got the external pressure 
                        numbers -- match them and it should 
                        be fine --

                                 LEVAN
                             (to David)
                        We’re going to twist the leg cusps, 
                        I assume.

                                 OX
                        Please, hurry. It’s spilling into 
                        the other leg. Come on.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ll do on three? You pull the 
                        lock -- I’ll knock it in place?
                                 LEVAN
                        I have my doubts, but I suppose 
                        it’s all we have.

                                 OX
                        You guys have to do this, please.

                                 ANNA
                        We’re going to do it, Ox.

                                 DAVID
                             (checking around)
                        Everyone ready?

                                 ANNA
                        Be strong. This is going to hurt 
                        like nothing you’ve ever felt.

                                 OX
                             (almost laughing)
                        Thanks, that’s encouraging.

                                 DAVID
                        Here we go, 1, 2, 3 --

           Levan PULLS the leg joint back -- Anna BLASTS the air 
           pressure -- the water HOLDS --

                                 LEVAN
                        We’re clear.

           David TWISTS the cusp of the KNEE JOINT -- then SHOVES it 
           forward -- JUTTING it through Ox’s LEG. 

                                 OX
                        Fuuuuckk!!! Oh shit!

           But not all the way. David pushes HARDER... and HARDER.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        Fuckk!!! 

                                 DAVID
                        I need help.

           Levan GRABS David’s hands -- PUSHES, tries to make the seal --

                                 OX
                        Please! Just do it -- please!!!

           They keep pushing, and pushing and pushing. Then David stops.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        Why are you stopping?
                                 DAVID
                             (looking at him)
                        It’s not gonna go.

                                 OX
                        What do you mean?

                                 DAVID
                        The holes, they’re not the same 
                        size. It’s not going to go.

                                 OX
                        What do you mean, it’s not going to 
                        go?
                             (the pain)
                        Fuck!!!!

                                 DAVID
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 OX
                        There has to be something else, 
                        though. Right?

                                 ANNA
                        Ox.

                                 OX
                        There’s must be fucking something. 
                        It’s at my fucking chest --

           Ox starts to cry.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        Guys...
                             (to David)
                        I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean 
                        to fight please just try something.

           Anna comes to Ox. She takes his hand.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                             (to Anna)
                        Please?

                                 ANNA
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 OX
                        It’s at my neck, guys...

           And now -- we start to see -- the actual water at his neck.
                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        What am I supposed to do?

           The other three are crying. Even Levan has tears in his eyes.

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        What do I do?
                             (to David)
                        I didn’t mean it. I’m sorry.

                                 DAVID
                        I know.

           The crew looks him in the eyes.

           The water’s at his chin. It’s slowly rising toward his mouth.

                                 OX
                        Guys... this isn’t fair.

           And now -- the water is at his mouth -- he spits it out --

                                 OX (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           Trying to keep it out. He takes a BIG breath of air.

           And now the water’s covering his mouth. 

           He says something -- bubbles rise out.

           David comes to Ox. Puts his head against Ox’s mask.

           See Ox’s eyes -- just staring into David’s. 

           Tears running down.

           Ox is furiously breathing in and out of his nose.

           And then it rises past his nose.

           Now it’s just his eyes.

           Staring.

           Still.

           David doesn’t look away.

           He can’t.

           He just stares into Ox’s eyes.

           The only thing he can do for him now.
           Just be here with him.

           Ox stares back at David.

           Afraid.

           Helpless.

           Each moment closer to his last.

           And then he starts to feel it.

           His throat starts to spasm. 

           His chest jerking.

           As he fights the urge to breathe in.

           He keeps staring at David.

           His eyes.

           So afraid.

           So broken.

           David nods to him, “it’s okay...”

           And then, not looking away -- 

           OX BREATHES IN

           Water.

           A full breath of it.

           He’s still alive, though.

           A moment -- 

           A look between David and Ox.

           And then...

           Ox’s body spasms -- 

           Jerks this way and that. 

           And then it’s still.

           His legs give out. 

           He tips to the side, leaning against the tunnel wall.
           Then he sits there, still, for what seems like an eternity.

           He’s gone.

                                 LEVAN
                        My lord.

           David takes a breath, then bends down. Grabs Ox’s arm.

                                 DAVID
                        Help me.

           Levan comes next to David, helps lower Ox down.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean to --

                                 ANNA
                        We know.

           The silence hangs between them.

                                 LEVAN
                        Come.

           Levan moves forward, as David rallies himself. He doesn’t get 
           to mourn. Not while his crew’s in danger. Off his face, 
           determined to get back --

           INT. THE RIG - BULLPEN

           Rae sits in front of the control deck -- staring at the 
           screen. ALL FIVE of the crew members’ vitals say, “OFFLINE.”

                                 RAE
                             (to Craig, O.S.)
                        Is that really the most important 
                        thing right now?

           REVERSE to see Craig. He’s got David’s suitcase open on the 
           table. He’s RIPPING clothes out of it, checking pockets, etc.

                                 CRAIG
                        If he knows some other shit that’s 
                        gonna kill us, then yeah.
                             (seeing something)
                        Boom!

           Craig pulls out a HAND GUN. Sets it on the table.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        You were saying?
                                 RAE
                        Bro. Chill. I don’t fucking care 
                        about David, I’m talking about us.

           Craig takes a breath. Calming down. Rae gets a bit serious.

                                 RAE (CONT’D)
                        Their 02 runs out in fifteen. The 
                        return sub takes three people to 
                        operate.

           Craig realizes where she’s going with this. He suddenly 
           sobers. Doesn’t want to talk about it.

                                 CRAIG
                        I don’t want to do this yet.

                                 RAE
                        You just want to plan your victory 
                        speech? If they’re not coming back  
                        -- I want to be out of here.

                                 CRAIG
                        They’re coming back.

                                 RAE
                        What if they don’t. And whatever 
                        happened to them happens to us.

           Craig closes his eyes. She’s not wrong. Now he feels guilty.

                                 CRAIG
                        We can’t just leave them --

                                 RAE
                        It’s going to take time to hack the 
                        sub, so you and I can operate it 
                        alone. I go out there. I check. If 
                        we don’t detect a signal, we leave.

           Craig and Rae stare at each other. Deal.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE ARENA - MINUTES LATER - INTERCUT

           Rae walks down the airlock ramp toward a Tread. And as she 
           does, we notice -- 

           THE RETURN SUB -- A SQUAT VESSEL, the size of a UTILITIES VAN 
           -- docked a dozen meters from the Rig. Suddenly, the SUB’S 
           EXTERNAL LIGHTS turn on.
                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        The sub’s booting. You got the 
                        location sensor ready?

                                 RAE
                             (she’s holding it)
                        Should I hold it, or --?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Strap it to the control bars. As 
                        long as it’s directed downward, we 
                        can check the reading.

           Rae gets to the Tread. Climbs on. Attaches the sensor.

           Craig HITS the button -- VROOM! The Tread STARTS, heads out. 

           As Rae drives, those old familiar fish guts swirl around her. 
           The sensor BEEPS, as it scans for the crew.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (re: the sub)
                        I could pre-rig the ballast tanks. 
                        We’d rise at a crawl, but it’d free 
                        up a set of hands.

           Craig’s looking at a schematic of the SUB.

                                 RAE
                        How long will that take?

                                 CRAIG
                        It’s a complete rewiring. But I bet 
                        I can do it in forty.

           FROM A DISTANCE

           The small white cube of THE ARENA just sitting in that vast 
           expanse of black. Rae is a TINY SPECK.

           BACK IN CLOSE

           Rae reaches the ENDZONE of the Arena. She CHECKS the scanner. 
           Then pulls the Tread around, facing the Rig.

                                 RAE
                        Nothing, C.

           Craig closes his eyes. That can’t be fucking true.
                                 CRAIG
                             (keeping it together)
                        The airlock’s prepped for you. I’ll 
                        start on the sub.
                             (heavy, then)
                        Fuck David. I should’ve sniffed him 
                        out sooner.

                                 RAE
                        “Should’ve” is a dark road. Let’s 
                        just get out of here.

           EXT/INT. VERTICAL SECTION OF UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - SAME

           Levan, Anna and David climb up the rocky sides of this 
           vertical stretch. Anna is in the lead, a flare held out in 
           front of her. Suddenly, she stops.

                                 ANNA
                        This is as far as it goes.

           David and Levan, disappointed, strain their heads, looking 
           up. Trying to see --

                                 DAVID
                        Is there a crack? Something we can 
                        squeeze through?

           Anna stretches and sees -- sure enough. A small crack winds 
           its way up to the surface.

                                 ANNA
                        A few feet. Not enough to pass.

                                 DAVID
                        Could we put a charge up there?

           Anna looks down at him.

                                 ANNA
                        You realize if it doesn’t break 
                        right, we’ll be crushed?

                                 LEVAN
                        We have five minutes of oxygen.

           Anna looks at them.

                                 ANNA
                        We need to turn down our intake.

                                 DAVID
                        We’re already at the minimum.
                                 ANNA
                        The safe minimum.

                                 LEVAN
                             (beat)
                        Better to die slowly, I guess.

           Anna, David and Levan grab their vital controls.

                                 ANNA
                        Thirty percent.

           They all look up. Immediately, breathing more heavily.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Breathe full, slow breaths. Okay?

                                 DAVID
                             (trying to breathe)
                        Do we do this or not?

           They look up at the rock. No decision made. We CUT TO:

           THE ARENA FLOOR

           Rae moves toward the Rig, when -- 

           The ground starts to rumble. Beneath her feet. 

                                 RAE
                             (into comm)
                        Craig?!

           The water SHAKES -- VIBRATING like before, until --

                                 RAE (CONT’D)
                        No, no no no!

           BANG! The ground EXPLODES next to Rae --

                                 RAE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           But instead of a monster, Rae sees -- DAVID’S HEAD JUTTING 
           out of a hole. David just blasted a hole in the rock.

           Craig’s SCREEN lights up -- as the VITALS of the crew members 
           return. Craig floods with relief --

           But there’s silence from David -- as he pulls Anna out of the 
           hole, followed by Levan, who’s having trouble.

           They’re all breathing frantic, shallow breaths.
                                 DAVID
                             (to Rae, on her Tread)
                        Levan’s losing consciousness.

                                 RAE
                        Where’s Jen?

           David just looks at Rae, his silence saying so much.

                                 DAVID
                        We need to hurry.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What about Ox?

           More silence from both of them. Then -- 

           IN THE RIG

           Ehh Ehh Ehh! Alarms go off -- a read out on the control deck 
           shows, “BLOOD 02: 12%” Craig’s eyes go wide.

                                 CRAIG
                        Holy shit! You guys have to hurry. 
                        You’re gonna pass out any second.

                                 DAVID
                        Not good.

           David breathes, erratic, strained. Anna looks at him.

                                 ANNA
                        Full. Slow. Full. Slow.

                                 RAE
                        Get on. You’ll have to squeeze.

           David and Anna help Levan swing his legs over the TREAD, as 
           both of them hop on the back. It’s a tight fit.

                                 DAVID
                        Fast --
                             (breath)
                        -- as you can.

                                 RAE
                        It’s a lot of weight for one Tread.

                                 DAVID
                             (breath)
                        I know.
           Rae STARTS the engine, REVS it, then -- VROOM! The Tread 
           TAKES off toward the Rig.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Is the sub --
                             (breath)
                        -- online?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        It can be in ten. What happened?

                                 RAE
                        Save your breath.

                                 ANNA
                        No. Talking. Is good. Regulates 
                        breathing. We were --
                             (breath)
                        -- attacked.

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Craig works the control deck to BOOT the sub. He pushes a 
           button. “BOOT SUB.” 

                                 CRAIG
                        By what?

           BACK IN THE WATER

                                 ANNA
                        A.
                             (breath)
                        An.
                             (breath)
                        Animal.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What kind?

                                 DAVID
                        Too dark.
                             (breath)
                        To see.

                                 ANNA
                        Nothing on sonar?

           IN THE BULLPEN

                                 CRAIG
                        No.
           Suddenly -- ERH ERH ERH! Levan’s blood 02 is dropping out of 
           the sky. His heart is starting to FLUTTER.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        He’s fading. Levan?

           IN THE WATER

                                 LEVAN
                             (confused)
                        Huh...

                                 DAVID
                             (to Rae)
                        We can’t.
                             (breath)
                        Go faster?

           The Tread is really trying. They’re still a few minutes out.

                                 RAE
                        This is a one man ride.

                                 ANNA
                        David and I. Can walk.

                                 RAE
                        No fucking way.

           Anna looks at Levan. His eyes are dilating.

                                 ANNA
                        Levan...
                             (makes a choice)
                        He won’t make it. Hurry.

           Anna steps off the Tread. STUMBLES onto the Arena floor. 
           David JUMPS off the Tread, turns.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Go. GO!

           Rae nods, as -- the Tread ZOOMS off -- going MUCH faster.

                                 RAE
                        I’ll swing back once he’s inside.

           David starts off toward the Rig -- PUSHING forward. HARD. 
           Like walking through GLUE with a bag over your head.

                                 ANNA
                        David. Slower.
                                 DAVID
                        We don’t have. Time.

                                 ANNA
                        We have to save. Breath.

           David blinks -- his vision getting blurry. Keeps on.

           OUTSIDE THE RIG - MOMENTS LATER

           Rae arrives at the AIRLOCK DOOR. She JUMPS off the Tread. 
           Helps Levan up the ramp --

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        How is. Levan?

                                 RAE
                        Still conscious.

           Rae hurries him into the airlock, supporting him, as --

                                 RAE (CONT’D)
                        Shut the door!

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Closing.

           WHAM! The airlock door SLAMS shut. Locks them inside.

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Craig pulls up a SCHEMATIC for the AIRLOCK. He adjusts 
           repressurizing to “rapid.”

                                 CRAIG
                        We’re going turbo. 

           IN THE AIRLOCK

           The water level LOWERS, as quickly as it can. Alarm’s FLASH.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Ignore those, levels are fine. 

           As the water recedes, Rae supports Levan. Once it passes his 
           head -- Rae PULLS his helmet off.

           Levan takes an ENORMOUS breath. Life returns to him.
                                 LEVAN
                        I am here.

           BACK IN THE ARENA

           Anna and David still moving toward the Rig.

                                 DAVID
                        My eyes. Are blurring. 
                             (breath)
                        Fuck.

                                 ANNA
                        We’re doing. Okay.

                                 DAVID
                        Craig?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        You’ve got ten minutes at this 
                        level. Stay calm. Once Levan’s in, 
                        I’ll ready the airlock.

                                 DAVID
                        No. We’ll take. The single diver 
                        hatch. Faster.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Perfect.

           Anna and David can make out the SINGLE DIVER HATCH at the 
           bottom of the Rig. It looks like a little red door. 

           Just twenty yards away.

           IN THE RIG

           Craig’s at the control deck -- suddenly -- DING! A light 
           flashes green. “SUB ONLINE.”

                                 CRAIG
                        We’re ready to go. Get back here.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        Keep. Checking. Sonar. The animal.

                                 CRAIG
                        I’ve got an idea.

           Craig pulls up a different program on the control deck. We 
           see a SCHEMATIC of the RIG. A SATELLITE DISH on top BLINKS.
                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        It won’t be too dark for this!

           The AIRLOCK opens. Levan stumbles in, Rae supporting him. 
           Levan looks at Craig’s computer, sees --

                                 LEVAN
                        Don’t!

           Craig hits ENTER -- and --

           EXT. THE RIG - SAME

           A GIANT REFLECTIVE SATELLITE DISH suddenly LIGHTS UP -- 
           BLASTING a ray of light around THE RIG.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        I can keep it circling. Any 
                        movement, and --

           Craig PUSHES a button and the RAY moves like a searchlight.

                                 DAVID
                        Stop! No!

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                             (over comm)
                        What? Why?

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Levan RACES to Craig’s computer. He stumbles to the control 
           deck. Points to it -- manic. 

                                 LEVAN
                        Kill it -- stop it!

                                 CRAIG
                        What?

                                 LEVAN
                        The light! It feeds on light!

           Levan hits “TERMINATE” on the search light. 

           The satellite dish goes DARK -- the crew holds their breath.

           Did the Unseen notice? Does it even care...

           A heavy beat... 

           Maybe everything’s fine. But then --
           VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR... 

           The WATER BLURS -- 

           Terror strikes fucking everyone.

           David grits his teeth, moves faster.

           Anna breaths faster, fully hyperventilating.

           Craig’s mouth drops. What the fuck did he just do?

           The VRRRR stops. The water clears, as a second later we see --

           IN THE WATER

                                 DAVID
                        Look out!

           WHAM! The Unseen APPEARS out of nowhere -- SMACKS into the 
           satellite dish -- BREAKS the DISH off -- ROCKING the RIG --

           IN THE BULLPEN

           Rae and Craig are THROWN to the ground. Alarms go off. 

                                 CRAIG
                        Fuck -- there’s a breech.

                                 RAE
                        Where?

                                 CRAIG
                        Central ducts! 

                                 RAE
                        Fuck!

           INT. THE RIG - CENTRAL DUCTS - SAME

           An OPEN SPACE of an INDUSTRIAL FAN -- and a DOZEN AIR DUCTS. 
           On the ceiling -- a HAIRLINE CRACK sends little dribbles of 
           water dripping down the walls. Rae runs in -- sees the CRACK. 
           Her eyes fucking JERK WIDE, as --

                                 RAE
                        Oh, no --

           WHAM! A hole OPENS in the wall -- a STREAM of WATER SHOOTS 
           INTO the room with the strength of a fucking JUMBO JET.

           The water HITS Rae’s body -- OBLITERATES her instantly. 
           KILLING HER -- BREAKING her into tiny pieces.
           A MILLION GALLONS enter the Rig in a tenth of a second.

           A tenth of a second later -- EMERGENCY LOCKS SEAL ADJOINING 
           DOORS -- BLOCKING off this part of the Rig, but an OLYMPIC 
           SWIMMING POOL of water has already FLOODED into the Rig --

           IN THE BULLPEN

           A ROAR, as A FUCKING TSUNAMI FLOODS into the BULLPEN from 
           every HALLWAY and AIR DUCT. 

           Craig JUMPS into the open airlock -- HIDES in the corner -- 
           MISSING the BRUTE FRONTAL FORCE of the flood.

           Levan CLIMBS the wall with STRENGTH we hadn’t seen. He stays 
           high and DESPERATELY HOLDS ON -- his arm BLEEDING, as water 
           FLOODS below him.

           IN THE WATER

           Anna and David stare at the Rig. Their heart rates rise, as 
           their breathing grows faster. They’re losing it.

                                 DAVID
                        No. No.

                                 ANNA
                        Oh. God. Hurry.

           David and Anna start PUSHING toward the Rig. But it’s slow.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Try to keep --

           Anna starts PANTING -- can’t finish the sentence.

                                 DAVID
                        Rae? We need. 
                             (breath)
                        Help.

           But no one’s responding.

                                 ANNA
                        Maybe comm link. Shorted.

                                 DAVID
                        Or. They’re dead.

           Just then -- 

           BEHIND THEM -- at the far end of the Arena, the ARENA LIGHTS 
           start to flicker.
           Anna and David see it. Hope drains from their faces as they 
           realize now --

           The Unseen is coming for them.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Anna...

           Suddenly --

           CHUNG! 

           The FAR LIGHTS of the ENDZONE SHUT OFF.

                                 ANNA
                        No. No, no, no.

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t look back! Just move.

                                 ANNA
                        Can’t. Breath.

                                 DAVID
                        Try.

           They TURN -- start PUMPING their legs. WILLING them to go 
           faster through the water. Their oxygen levels close to zero.

           CHUNG! 

           The LIGHTS at the 10-yard line die, as the Unseen approaches. 

                                 ANNA
                        We. Won’t. Make  it.

           CHUNG! 

           The 20-yard line goes black.

           We’re TIGHT ON DAVID AND ANNA -- just their faces -- red -- 
           breathing frantic, shallow breaths. Terror in their eyes.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t. Breath.

           CHUNG! 

           The 30-yard line. Going SO MUCH FASTER than our heroes can.

           CHUNG! 
           40-yard line. Like the lights of a GIANT HALLWAY being shut 
           off, one by one. David and Anna are breathless -- heaving 
           with the impossible task.

           CHUNG! 

           50-yard line. It’s halfway to the Rig and gaining. 

           But David and Anna are in the HOME FIELD END ZONE. 

                                 DAVID
                        Almost. There.

           They’re close to the SINGLE DIVER HATCH.

           They just might make it --

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Come. On.

           Suddenly Anna DROPS from frame as we see --

           Her BOOT snagged a ROCK. As she panics --

           CHUNG! 

           The 40-yard line goes dark. Anna tries to JERK her boot free. 
           But it won’t budge.

           CHUNG!

           The 30-yard line. David turns back, sees Anna struggling.

                                 ANNA
                        Stuck.

           David doesn’t even think about it. He moves forward. His 
           oxygen almost out, he --

           DROPS to the ground. Crawling toward her now. Breathing so 
           hard. He can hardly make a sound.

           He grabs her leg, as --

                                 DAVID
                        Push!

           Anna PUSHES with her other foot, as David HEAVES. And -- 

           POP! Her boot breaks loose. And they move. Slowly. So. So.

           Slowly.

           CHUNG! 
           20-yard line and gaining.

           CHUNG! 

           10-yard line.

           Finally -- David looks behind him. We see --

           The silhouette of the UNSEEN, this fucking primal beast. But 
           it’s too late. They weren’t fast enough --

           The FINAL SET OF ARENA LIGHTS start to flicker, then -- 

           CHUNG! 

           The lights go off. And the only light is from Anna and 
           David’s HELMETS in total darkness. The Unseen reaches Anna --

           David can’t even yell, as --

           Anna’s helmet DISAPPEARS into the Unseen’s mouth. It’s all 
           over, until --

           POW!!!!!!!!

           A LIGHT -- brighter than anything you’ve ever seen -- BLASTS 
           from the Arena and completely WHITES out the screen.

           We have no idea what just happened.

           All we know is it’s white.

           And silent.

           White.

           Silent.

           David’s EYES open -- 

           His vision awful -- can barely see anything.

           The whole world ENTIRELY without sound.

           Hear his heart pounding. 

           Nothing else.

           He searches around -- madly. 

           The floodlights above him off --

           But he’s in the Arena -- the Rig glows behind him.
           A RINGING starts to fill his ears. 

           His vision still flashing white -- then black -- as his eyes 
           try to recover from the flash.

           We start to hear muffled sounds.

           Muffled screaming. 

           Then --

           FULL AUDIO KNOCKS DAVID IN THE FACE -- US WITH HIM -- 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        DAVID!!!!!

           David looks down and sees -- Anna at his feet. Almost 
           unconscious. That scream having taken the last of her energy.

           Her suit is DENTED at the neck line, where the Unseen BIT her 
           -- but wasn’t able to finish.

           The dent is STRANGLING her, cutting off her blood flow. This, 
           on top of her low O2. She’s as good as dead.

           Anna’s eyes roll back. Hear the GURGLING of her mouth. The 
           CHOKING noises, fucking horrifying.

           David GRABS Anna -- drags her toward the Rig.

           He STUMBLES in the ooze. No energy left in him.

           But somehow. 

           He gets back up.

           See a LADDER that leads up to a small, cylindrical PORT at 
           the bottom of the Rig. The SINGLE DIVER AIRLOCK.

           David hits a button, as --

           A DOOR opens up at the top of the ladder. He climbs it,

           Or rather. Tries. But can’t.

           At first. 

           He GRITS his teeth -- panting in and out, in and out. Then -- 

           SCREAMS! As he climbs into the airlock. Pulling Anna up.

           IN THE SINGLE DIVER AIRLOCK

           He supports Anna, who’s now unconscious.
           The bottom of the airlock SHUTS closed, as --

           David SMACKS a button “ENTER.”

           WHIRRRR -- the water starts EMPTYING. But it’s going slowly.

           An inch...

           Two inches...

           If it doesn’t go faster -- Anna’s going to die.

           Six inches... 

           It starts to pick up. Their heads now above water.

           David decides to act --

           He GRABS Anna’s helmet -- UNHOOKS it -- rips it off.

           She GASPS air, as her neck is freed from the clamp. But 
           BLOOD’s flowing from a wound where her neck was PINCHED.

           David PULLS his off, too. Takes an ENORMOUS breath of oxygen. 

           FORCES his senses back to him. As he looks to Anna. Suddenly, 
           her eyes open. She looks at him.

           She mumbles. Not yet able to talk.

                                 DAVID
                        Okay -- you’re okay.

           The water now at their waists.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (into comm, shouted)
                        Please! Guys -- can you hear me?

           David POUNDS on the door above him. No one responds.

           David GRABS Anna’s NECK -- tries to STOP the bleeding. But 
           it’s not enough. As the water in the airlock STAINS RED --

           He GRABS the cloth of her underarmour wet suit -- TEARS a 
           strip free -- He TIES it around her lower neck, securing it 
           under her shoulder. It’s not perfect. But the bleeding slows.

           The airlock finishes draining, and the HANDLE to the HATCH 
           lights up -- “ready to open.”

           David takes a few more breaths. Gets his head ready for this.
                                 ANNA
                        What happened?

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t know.
                             (into his comm)
                        Guys -- I’m opening the hatch.

           David GRABS the handle, he PULLS it toward him.

           The hatch ENGAGES. It starts to tilt open --

           But instead of seeing the bullpen --

           WHOOOSH!

           A FLOOD of dark water streams in, as we realize --

           THE RIG IS NOW FULL OF WATER. But not just that --

           ALL THE LIGHTS IN THE RIG ARE OUT. It’s TOTAL FUCKING DARK.

           David GRAPPLES with the water -- it’s pressure KNOCKING him 
           and Anna against the wall. The only light coming from the 
           collar of their suits.

           See Anna’s face. Trying SO FUCKING hard not to breathe in.

           The water settles, as it finishes filling the airlock. David 
           steadies himself, then PUSHES up, swimming blindly into --

           THE DARKENED, FLOODED BULLPEN

           David pulls Anna behind him, as he DESPERATELY moves toward 
           the surface -- 

           He gets to the surface, when --

           WHAM!

           He hits his head. Sees --

           It’s the fucking CEILING. The whole room is full of water.

           David’s trapped. Doesn’t know what to do.

           He looks at the ceiling. Tries to get his bearings when he 
           realizes --

           This isn’t ceiling. THIS IS THE WALL.

           In the total dark -- in his heavy suit, he got turned around. 

           Thought he was swimming upward -- but actually swam sideways.
           Now it’s all out panic. 

           He doesn’t even know which way to swim.

           Anna looks at him -- shaking her head -- she can’t hold her 
           breath any longer.

           David moves to her.

           He GRABS her head, HOLDS her nose shut, then BREATHES into 
           her mouth.

           Bubbles RISE as she takes in the air.

           He’s bought her a few more seconds.

           With no idea what to do -- with no light to see --

           David makes a decision -- CHOOSES a direction -- 

           SWIMS that way with all of his might, tracking the wall -- 
           DRAGGING Anna, hoping for some kind of opening to air --

           WHAM! 

           FUCK -- he hits another surface.

           It’s THE FLOOR.

           Bad news. 

           But also good news. 

           This means the SURFACE, if there is one, is straight up.

           He KICKS off the bottom. PUSHING upward.

           But his muscles start to spasm.

           He’s not gonna make it.

           He PUSHES Anna upward.

           His vision darkens.

           But he’s not giving up --

           He KICKS his legs a final time.

           EXPLODES ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WATER

           He GRABS some kind of ledge, pulls himself onto it --

           He GASPS IN and OUT -- Anna gasping beside him. 
           He rolls over onto his back.

           Looking straight up, we see --

           Nothing. 

           The entire room is dark.

           Nothing beyond his and Anna’s suit collars. 

           They just lie there, sucking desperate breaths into their 
           lungs. Their ribs aching from the effort.

           For a long moment, they’re too exhausted to care --

           About anything. Where they are. What surface they’re on. What 
           happened to the Rig.

           They BREATHE and BREATHE in total darkness.

           Their faces, only, lit.

           They breathe.

           Breathe.

           And finally... as senses return. David sees --

           The bullpen is filled with water. He turns on his side, sees--

           They’re on top of the INDUSTRIAL SHELVING UNITS that sit at 
           one side of the bullpen. The water’s ten feet high, ending 
           just beneath the shelf. The CEILING is eight feet above them.

                                 ANNA
                        It took me, David. I thought I was 
                        done. Then everything went white.

                                 DAVID
                        The oil main blew.
                             (before she can answer)
                        Nothing else would burn that 
                        bright.

           They breathe more, and more and more...

                                 ANNA
                        The crew. Do you think --

           Then, from the darkness --

                                 CRAIG (O.S.)
                        Hello!? Is someone there? 
                                 DAVID
                             (snapping to attention)
                        -- Craig!

                                 CRAIG
                        Help!!! God, please help --!

           David tries to stand up, but --

           NOPE! -- he’s still too light-headed. He stumbles back down 
           onto the shelf.

                                 ANNA
                        Craig, where are you --?

                                 CRAIG (O.S.)
                        Help! Someone!?

                                 ANNA
                        Craig --?

                                 DAVID
                        We can’t see you.

                                 CRAIG
                        Levan --?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s David! Anna. Where are you?

                                 CRAIG
                        I can’t see. I’m pinned --

                                 DAVID
                        Are you bleeding?

                                 CRAIG
                        I don’t know --

                                 DAVID
                        We can’t see you!

                                 CRAIG
                        Please!

                                 DAVID
                        Can you light a flare --?

                                 CRAIG
                        I can’t move my arms.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you in the water?
                                 CRAIG
                        Fuck. It hurts --

                                 DAVID
                        Craig, where are you?

                                 CRAIG
                        Hurry -- the water’s rising --

                                 DAVID
                             (doesn’t know where, but)
                        We’re coming --

                                 CRAIG
                        It hurts! Fuck!

                                 ANNA
                             (to David)
                        How could the waters be rising?

                                 DAVID
                        If the pumps backcharged... It’s 
                        gonna start filling fast.

                                 CRAIG
                        Ow, fuck! Shit. Come on!

           David SPARKS a flare -- he goes to jump into the water.

                                 DAVID
                        Keep talking. We’ll follow the 
                        sound. Look for our flare.

                                 ANNA
                        David, stop!

           Anna STOPS David from jumping in.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        We can’t spare the heat.

           And we notice -- both of them are shivering -- intensely!

                                 DAVID
                        What do we do --?

                                 ANNA
                        There!

           Anna points at -- the AIR DUCT -- a JUMP away. It spans the 
           bullpen, now, like a bridge or a catwalk.

                                 DAVID
                        Hang on --!
           They JUMP across the water -- 

           SLAM into the airlock. Holding on, PULLING themselves up onto 
           the make-shift walkway.

           They stand up, balancing, then rush down the metal bridge. 

                                 CRAIG
                        I see you --

                                 DAVID
                        Where --?

                                 CRAIG
                        In front of you.

           They hurry along the duct. Straight in front of them, see --

           Craig -- on his back, a LARGE STEEL BAR has FALLEN on his 
           chest -- pinning his arms. If he twists wrong -- it will roll 
           down his chest onto his neck.

           David runs to him. He struggles.

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t -- your neck. 

                                 CRAIG
                        It hurts.

                                 DAVID
                        Stay still --

                                 CRAIG
                        Is it dead?

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t talk --

                                 CRAIG
                        Did you see it --?

                                 DAVID
                        Gotta stop moving --

                                 CRAIG
                        If it’s dead we’ve got a chance.

                                 ANNA
                        How?

                                 CRAIG
                        The sub’s prepped. I got it going.
                                 DAVID
                        But the system power --

                                 CRAIG
                        Might just be the grid shorted --

                                 ANNA
                        Could you get it back on --?

                                 CRAIG
                        If I switch the power -- fuck -- 
                        source!

                                 ANNA
                        Could work. We only need a sec to 
                        unlock the sub -- transfer to 
                        remote controls.

                                 CRAIG
                        The electrical panel. If I reroute 
                        it to use the backup grid --

                                 DAVID
                        Which --?

                                 CRAIG
                        Above me.

                                 DAVID
                        This? Can I do it?

                                 CRAIG
                        Has to be me. But if he’s dead we 
                        can run.

                                 DAVID
                        Come on. Anna, help --

           Anna and David grab the steel bar. They conjure up strength --

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        One, two, three!

           They LIIIIIFT!!!! the bar, trying to FLIP it into the water. 
           The bar moves, then -- 

           WHAM! Lands back down on Craig’s chest.

                                 CRAIG
                        Ah! Fuck -- fuck -- fuck --

                                 DAVID
                        We got this -- liiiiiift!!!!
           They HEAVE the bar. But as they move it up, it SLIPS --

                                 ANNA
                        Shit!

           ROLLS onto Craig’s neck! He JERKS -- as his ARMS are freed, 
           but he’s choking -- clawing at the bar.

                                 DAVID
                        Shiiiiit!!!!! Lift!!!!

           Craig is gurgling -- his eyes bulging from his head. His 
           hands useless trying to lift it off himself.

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t!

                                 DAVID
                        You have to --!

           Craig’s a goner, when --

                                 LEVAN (O.S.)
                        Here!

           From NOWHERE -- Levan jumps in -- GRABS the bar.

                           DAVID
                                                          ANNA
                 (startled)
                                                (startled)
           Fuck!
                                              Oh, God --

                                 LEVAN
                        Lift!

           Levan LIFTS on the bar. And -- they lift it off Craig’s neck.

           Levan WINCES horribly, as we see -- he’s got a nasty cut 
           through his ribs. But as they lift --

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        Yes!!!

           The bar drops off the duct -- SPLASH! Lands in the water.

           David reaches down. Grabs Craig’s hand.

                                 CRAIG
                        I need a minute.

           Craig rubs the GIANT RED MARK across his neck. Then --

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Okay!
           David HOISTS him onto his feet.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Gimme some light.

           Anna swoops in -- holds the FLARE up to the panel -- it and 
           their suit collars, still the only light in the world.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                             (as he gains his footing)
                        Take it off. The door.

           David reaches for the panel -- he PULLS at its door. But it’s 
           not opening.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s stuck.

                                 CRAIG
                        You gotta do it.

           David HEAVES but it’s not moving.

                                 DAVID
                        Must have been damaged.

                                 CRAIG
                        Stand back --

           Craig straightens up now. Grabs something from his pocket --

                                 ANNA
                        What the fuck?

           It’s David’s gun. 

           David makes eyes at him. Realizes Craig found this in his 
           bag. Craig gives him a glance. But it doesn’t matter anymore.

           Craig holds the gun horizontally to the panel, and --

           BANG! The flash of the gun LIGHTS up the darkness, as -- he 
           shoots off the door’s hinges -- the door DROPS to the ground. 

           Craig digs into the board. Starts retooling wires. The rest 
           of the crew just watches -- silent.

                                 CRAIG
                        It’s sparking. This could work.

                                 ANNA
                        Come on.
                                 CRAIG
                        Guys. This might work.

           Craig CROSSES two wires, and -- 

           A SPARK flashes. Craig’s face lights up.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Yes!! Almost done --

           Levan crosses his fingers.

           Craig grabs a POWER LEVER at the side of the panel.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Here goes.

           He takes a breath, then --

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Please work. Please work.

                                 DAVID
                        It’ll work.

           Craig PULLS the lever, and --

                                 CRAIG
                        Come on, come on.

           Nothing. 

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        No... no no no no no!

           Didn’t work.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        No!!!!

           Craig POUNDS against the panel. BAM BAM BAM! His knuckles 
           TORN open. Bloody. Raw.

           And then it’s done.

           Everyone loses their breath.

           Game over.

           The dripping sound of the Rig filling up with water.

           Levan takes a breath.
                                 LEVAN
                        Perhaps there is another way.

           But Craig shakes his head.

           “There isn’t.”

           The reality slowly strikes them all.

           The darkness is permanent.

           Suddenly, it’s suffocating.

           The crew bend their heads. How does this get worse?

           WHAM! 

           The Rig ROCKS as something smacks against it from outside. 

                                 ANNA
                        Fuck!

                                 DAVID
                        No!

           What could this be? Take a guess --

           VRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!

           The hearts of our heroes RATTLE as the Unseen makes his 
           presence known.

           It’s like NAILS on a chalkboard. NEEDLES into their fingers. 
           SPIDERS crawling over their faces.

           Nothing is worse than this. 

           When they’re all on the verge of SCREAMING -- 

           WHAM! 

           It SMACKS the Rig again. Knocks our heroes. 

           Then goes silent.

           A single beat of still, before --

                                 CRAIG
                        I’m sorry.

                                 ANNA
                        Craig -- no!

           Craig puts the gun in his mouth, and -- 
           BANG! Shoots his brains all over the wall. 

           He DROPS the gun, slumps to the ground. Levan gasps.

                                 LEVAN
                        Dear boy.

           David GRABS him, supports his head, but there’s blood and 
           liquid brains flowing from it.

           Craig’s body jerks a few times, and it’s over. 

           David lowers him onto the air duct, straightening him out, 
           while Levan picks up the flare.

           Anna cries.

           David cries.

           Levan cries.

           There’s no fucking solace. 

           There’s nothing to do. 

           Suddenly --

           David GRABS the gun -- JUMPS up, and --

           BANG BANG BANG! Fires into the darkness at it.

                                 DAVID
                        Fuuuuuuuuuuck!!!!!!!!

           He fires until -- CLICK CLICK! The clip is out. He TOSSES the 
           gun into the water --

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!!!!!!

           David slumps down, so he’s sitting on the duct. His back 
           against the wall. We take in just how fucked up this all is. 

           Their dead friend’s body is splayed at their feet. 

           Their only light comes from a single flare. 

           The water level is rising. It’s risen over the duct, so 
           David’s now sitting in a foot of water.

           The Unseen is just outside the Rig.

           And everyone is shivering from the cold.
                                 LEVAN
                        You will freeze down there.

                                 DAVID
                        I did this.

           Anna moves to David, sits down beside him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I let it get Jen, I smashed Ox on a 
                        rock. I brought the gun -- I --

           David has something else to say. But he needs help.

                                 ANNA
                        Did you know? About the dead men?

           His soul the only thing at stake.

                                 DAVID
                        I knew something happened... They 
                        offered to tell me.

                                 LEVAN
                        You declined?

                                 DAVID
                        They promised it wouldn’t help my 
                        crew. It’d just make me liable for 
                        something I had nothing to do with.

           A beat.

                                 ANNA
                        Did you know there’d been deaths.

                                 DAVID
                        Yes. But it’s Chinese construction, 
                        people die pouring concrete. 
                             (a final beat)
                        That’s what I told myself, anyway. 
                        And then I brought us all to hell.

           Levan takes a breath, looks out over the water.

                                 LEVAN
                        Before working petrol, I dove in 
                        the Ukraine, retrieving boats and 
                        bodies and whatever treasures won 
                        me a paycheck.
                             (taking a breath)
                        One day, at a rig above the 
                        Mykolaiv tar pits, a bridge 
                        collapsed and a boy fell in. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEVAN (CONT'D)
                        Tar pits were the one dive we never 
                        took. The salt in the tar would 
                        strip a man to bones in only a few 
                        days. But this boy mattered. His 
                        father requested his body be 
                        retrieved, and requests from big 
                        men were not requests. So, for a 
                        normal wage, they lowered ten of us 
                        into the tar. We were told 
                        returning without the bones would 
                        not be returning at all. So down we 
                        went, the tar was impossible to 
                        maneuver; quickly, it began to seep 
                        into our suits. We understood, we 
                        would die.
                             (looking off)
                        But then a man, the oldest of us, 
                        Fidel, had an idea. Since we would 
                        never find the bones, we could kill 
                        the smallest of us, strip off his 
                        flesh and return him to the surface 
                        as our prize. The smallest diver’s 
                        name was Indar. Circassin. We 
                        decided he would work, and so we 
                        began. We had no tools, so we used 
                        our hands. An hour later we were 
                        done.

           Levan takes a breath. Even for a stiff motherfucker like him, 
           this doesn’t go down easy.

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        We took his bones to the surface, 
                        where we, the surviving nine, were 
                        declared heroes to the family.
                             (taking another breath)
                        The next day, I left for my sick 
                        mother in Tbilisi. But then the 
                        dead boy’s teeth were examined. Our 
                        secret came out and the eight 
                        remaining men were shot, while I 
                        was forgotten. Be grateful we have 
                        this to kill us.

           Silence from everyone. Some heavy fucking shit. And then --

           David laughs.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s the last fucking thought I’m 
                        gonna die with?
                                 ANNA
                             (she’s with David)
                        That wasn’t great, man.

           Levan looks at them, smiles.

                                 LEVAN
                        Allow me to make up for it.

           Levan points in the water -- there’s an unopened pack of OX’S 
           CIGARETTES, floating by. They’re dry, and there’s a SMALL box 
           of MATCHES taped onto them.

           David and Anna jump up, as Levan GRABS the pack. Tears it 
           open. Takes a cigarette. Lights a match. Then sparks it up, 
           as he passes the pack to Anna and David, who spark up, too.

           David, Anna and Levan all take full drags on their smokes. 
           And suddenly... there is solace.

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        The light of the gods.

                                 DAVID
                        I smoked for a year. Was always 
                        afraid I’d die of lung cancer.

                                 LEVAN
                        Where is the fun in that.

           David looks at the glowing stick in his hand. He exhales, as--

           ERHH ERHHH ERHHH! An ALARM blares in the Rig. The crew looks 
           to the ceiling -- panicked, but -- David realizes --

                                 DAVID
                        It’s the smoke alarms.

                                 ANNA
                        I thought those were broken.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe they were just scrambled. 
                             (putting it together)
                        ... and needed a system reboot.

                                 ANNA
                        That’s why the controls didn’t turn  
                        on right away.

                                 DAVID
                        It was warming up.
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        God dammit, Craig.
                                 LEVAN
                        Look.

           BELOW THE WATER we can see CONTROL LIGHTS on the DECK 
           blinking. They’re back online.

           On a SCREEN, beside the PANEL we see -- A FLASHING GREEN 
           LIGHT: “SUB ENGAGED.” 

                                 ANNA
                        Fuck yes!

                                 LEVAN
                        And what of our swimming friend?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s only three minutes to the sub. 
                        We just need to distract him.

                                 ANNA
                        We build a bomb.
                             (off their looks)
                        The airlock. Shove everything 
                        remotely explosive inside. If we 
                        turn the pressure up high enough. 

           Anna mouths, “kaboom!” David leans in -- KISSES her.

                                 DAVID
                        This could work.

                                 LEVAN
                        No.

           David turns, concerned. Levan is usually right...

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        No distractions. We kill the 
                        cocksucker.

                                 ANNA
                        How?

                                 LEVAN
                        Your method, the airlock. But 
                        instead of crushing explosives. We 
                        crush him.

           The three of them look at each other. He’s right.

                                 ANNA
                        If we could lure him inside. He’d 
                        pop. Life has its limits.
                                 LEVAN
                        At worst, we’ve trapped him in the 
                        airlock and you two escape through 
                        the single hatch.

           A stillness in the cabin. They realize what he means. Levan 
           preempts their question.

                                 LEVAN (CONT’D)
                        Someone must be the bait. I have no 
                        one in the world.

                                 DAVID
                        We draw for it. No discussion.

           Levan nods. Accepts the terms. 

           He grabs the box of matches from his pocket. Takes out three. 
           Passes it to Anna. She pockets the match box.

           Levan takes three matches. BREAKS one match into a “short 
           stick.” Then sets them out for Anna and David to choose. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Fuck the dark, huh?

                                 LEVAN
                        Seconded.

                                 ANNA
                        Thirded.

           David and Anna pick. They look among them to see.

           David got the short stick.

           He looks up to them. Tries to make a joke.

                                 DAVID
                        Captain goes down with the ship. 
                        Or, I guess, stays down.

           But no laughs. Just stares and silence from Levan and Anna. 

           The moment suddenly so singular and intimate. The end.

           Anna tears up. Levan, too. But all of them accept. There 
           isn’t another way.

           Anna reaches out. Touches David’s hand, as --

           He pulls her into a hug. HOLDS her tight. So, so tight.
                                 ANNA
                        All that time we could have had 
                        together.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey. These suits are pretty solid. 
                             (knows it’s a lie)
                        Maybe I’ll see you in the sub.

           Anna gives him one last hug. And then --

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Levan?

           But when they turn, they see -- Levan -- fully suited up. 
           Helmet attached. He waves to the two of them, as --

           SPLASH! He jumps off the air duct into the water. He’s going 
           to do it instead.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        No you don’t --

           David DROPS to his stomach. Reaches down into the water -- 
           GRABS Levan, but --  

           WHAM! Levan PUNCHES David in the face. David lets go -- 
           stunned. And by the time he gets his bearings --

           Levan’s sunk down to the bullpen floor. He starts trudging 
           through the water toward the airlock.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Hey! You don’t get to do this.

           David searches for his helmet, but --

           It’s FLOATING in the water across the room. Levan THREW it 
           out there to slow David down.

           UNDERWATER

           Levan SPARKS a flare, as he arrives at the OPEN AIRLOCK DOOR. 

           Beside it is a CONTROL PANEL with BUTTONS and GAUGES. He 
           finds the PRESSURE GAUGE -- turns its knob all the way up.

           Numbers RISE -- flashing, warning him of the danger.

           With that, Levan steps into the airlock, SHUTS the door, 
           locking himself inside.
           ABOVE WATER

           David STRAPS his helmet on, ready to go after Levan. But 
           before he can, Anna grabs him.

                                 ANNA
                        The door’s locked.

           David looks down. The RED from Levan’s flare has disappeared.

                                 DAVID
                        Dammit!

                                 ANNA
                        You want to do him right. Make this 
                        count.

           David hates this. But she’s right. He jumps to, resigned --

                                 DAVID
                        Grab our helmets. I’ll prep the 
                        hatch.

           As David grabs the remote deck unit --

           IN THE AIRLOCK

           Levan takes a breath, hits the “PRESSURIZE” button, as --

           ERRRRRRRRR -- the AIRLOCK CONTRACTS. The engine GRINDS as the 
           walls move in, and the water is crushed together.

           Levan closes his eyes. We’ve never seen him scared. 

           Suddenly -- the engine HALTS. Silence. The airlock’s finished 
           pressurizing. 

           Outside, we can now hear vague sounds of the Unseen swimming, 
           rubbing up against the airlock door.

           Levan takes a slow breath -- PRESSES the “OPEN” button, and -- 
           the OUTER DOOR opens. Its ramp leads down to the ocean floor.

           The entire world is dark, except the glow of Levan’s helmet 
           and the red shine of his flare.

           A moment rests.

           Is this going to work?

           Is the Unseen even here?

           Levan tries to keep questions away.
           Tries just to look forward.

           And then...

           The flare starts to dim. The awful fucking telltale sign.

           It dims and dims, as the Unseen swims into the open airlock. 
           We can’t so much see the beast as we can feel its presence.

           Levan backs up against the wall. He needs to trap this thing 
           inside the airlock. But he only gets one shot. If he closes 
           the outer door too early, everything will be lost.

           He sweats.

           Beat.

           Blinks.

           Beat.

           And just as the flare is about to go out -- 

           Levan JUMPS! SMACKS the “CLOSE” button for the outer door -- 

           WHAM! The door SNAPS closed -- LOCKING the Unseen inside.

           Instantly it TWISTS -- and THRASHES -- THROWING Levan against 
           the wall. It SCREAMS -- 

           VRRRRRRRRRR!!!! 

           Blurring the water.

           Levan SCRAMBLES -- WHAM! He’s SLAMMED against the wall AGAIN 
           and AGAIN as it THRASHES -- trying to escape its prison. 

           Levan can’t get his bearings. Can’t tell which way’s up --

           In its struggle, the Unseen BITES at the walls. TOOTH MARKS 
           appear, as if from nowhere. The Unseen is trying to CHEW his 
           way out of the airlock. But just then --

           The ENGINES of the airlock turn back on. ERRRRRRRRR! 
           SQUEEZING the room, INCREASING the pressure to deadly levels.

           Levan gets his bearings. Stands UPRIGHT. Eyes closed.

           The pressure PUSHES on the Unseen -- CHOKING it. HURTING it. 
           The Unseen SCREAMS -- TWISTS. But he’s not alone in here --

           CLANG -- CLANG! 

           Levan winces as the metal of his suit starts to buckle.
           It RINGS as the pressure TESTS its strength. 

           LOUD and FORCEFUL like a DEATH KNELL --

           CLANG! -- CLANG!

           The suit at Levan’s arm starts to tremble --

           He grits his teeth. Breathes. Waiting for what’s next.

           CLANG! CLANG!

           The metal suit SHAKES -- RATTLING -- Levan closes his eyes. 
           Any second now, when -- 

           CRUNCH! 

           The ARM of Levan’s SUIT COLLAPSES ON ITSELF -- CRUSHING HIS 
           ARM FLAT (but keeping its seal). Levan screams as -- 

           CRUNCH! His other arm is CRUSHED to nothing.

           CRUNCH! CRUNCH! -- his legs flattened, too.

           His eyes scream, as --

           CRUNCH! His CHEST PLATE COLLAPSES inward -- his TORSO 
           SQUEEZED to FOUR INCHES ACROSS!

           Blood SQUIRTS UP onto Levan’s STILL SCREAMING FACE, as --

           CLANG! His HELMET COLLAPSES, POPPING his SKULL LIKE A BUG. 

           Levan’s whole body is CRUSHED to nothing. 

           A FLESHY SOUP trapped in a STEEL BALL.

           And through it all the UNSEEN keeps THRASHING. More and more 
           intensely as the pressure continues to INCREASE... 

           The pressure is INSANE. It’d crush a tank. But is it enough?

           The DOOR into the bullpen starts to tremble. If it BREAKS 
           open -- the Unseen lives on -- and it’s over.

           INSIDE THE RIG

           Anna and David have found their helmets. They STRAP them on. 
           The water’s risen to their chests. 

           Anna and David turn back. Hear the door -- CLANG! CLANG! 
           BUCKLING on its hinges.
           FUCK.

           The door’s not going to hold. 

           David SPARKS a flare. Anna does not.

                                 ANNA
                             (re: no flare)
                        I’m out.

                                 DAVID
                        Stay close!

           They STEP off the air duct into the water--

           UNDERWATER

           They SINK to the bullpen floor, as we see -- the airlock door 
           starts to bevel, and then -- 

           WHAM!! 

           The door EXPLODES INWARD -- a WAVE OF PRESSURIZED WATER 
           SHOOTS INTO the BULLPEN -- like a JET into a swimming pool.

           The TURBULENT WATER KNOCKS the FLARE out of David’s hand -- 
           and PUSHES David backward, SLAMS him into the CONTROL DECK. 

           He tries to stand up, but -- he’s STUCK! His O2 TANK is 
           caught on a LEVER. 

           David struggles to break free, to untangle his TUBING. But 
           before he can make any progress --

           VRRRRRRRR!!!!! 

           That awful fucking scream! Which means --

           The Unseen is still alive. The pressure wasn’t enough to kill 
           it. And it’s not done.

           It SPEEDS into the bullpen, moving like a TORPEDO. We see its 
           SHADOWS in the sparse light from the flare.

           It’s dim, but we can hear it SMACK into the bullpen walls -- 
           SHATTERING the SHELVES -- 

           RIPPING through TABLES and PIPING as it speeds toward David.

           Anna trudges to David, JERKS him loose from the lever.
                                 ANNA
                             (shouted)
                        Stay low -- he’s coming!

           Anna and David DROP to their stomachs -- try to ARMY CRAWL 
           toward the airlock, which is now busted open.

                                 DAVID
                        Which way?

           Anna looks -- the flare is SWIRLING in the water, confusing 
           their position.

                                 ANNA
                        We were pointed right at it.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll spark my last flare, you run --

                                 ANNA
                        The minute you spark it, he’s going 
                        to --

           FWOOSH! David sparks a flare. Not waiting for her permission.

           Anna can see the airlock, now -- off to her right! 

                                 DAVID
                        Run!

           But just as she steps forward, she sees --

                                 ANNA
                        David!

           A BLACK TENTACLE WHIPS into the frame --

           WRAPS around David’s neck.

           It SQUEEZES him tight. And David gets a moment. Just enough 
           to mouth, “goodbye,” and then --

           He’s JERKED backward -- FLARE in hand -- toward the Unseen.

           This is it. It’s all over.

           But... suddenly...

           The PULL of the Unseen’s tentacle slows down. 

           Slower. And slower.

           And then -- it SPASMS. 
           Still moving him backward, but now, in bizarre JERKS.

           The tentacle around his neck starts to loosen.

                                 DAVID
                        Anna. Something’s...

           Then, as if being lowered onto a chair, David is gently 
           pulled down into the Unseen’s open mouth.

           And David stays still.

           Frozen.

           Confused.

           Afraid.

           And then the tentacle slacks completely. He takes a breath.

           David holds up his flare, and we see for the first time --

           The shark-like TERROR of the Unseen’s MOUTH. As WIDE as a 
           standing man. It’s TEETH long and thin like BUTCHER KNIVES.

           David tenses, realizing his metal suit is resting on these 
           sharpened teeth. Like he’s on a bed of nails.

           From the side of its mouth -- TWO GIANT TENTACLES stretch 
           out, arms, whose sole purpose is to pull food inside of it. 

           The FEROCITY of a SHARK, the BRUTE FORCE of a GIANT SQUID.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Is it dead?

                                 ANNA
                        It’s bleeding out.

                                 DAVID
                        It worked.
                             (almost crying)
                        Levan got him.

           Anna moves to David, she grabs him --

                                 ANNA
                        Careful -- they could pierce your 
                        suit.

           Anna lifts David off of its teeth, then helps him down, 
           maneuvering over the jelly-like surface of its skin. 
           From the light of David’s flare, we see -- BLACK BLOOD 
           spilling into the water like INK.

           It’s dead.

           But the horror isn’t finished.

           As the inky blood swirls toward them. It STICKS to their 
           helmets, a THICK BLACK SYRUP COATING the glass.

                                 DAVID
                        Get it off.

           As they scramble to wipe it clear, we see -- 

           The blood ISN’T HOMOGENOUS -- its made of a BILLION LITTLE 
           MICRO ORGANISMS -- SQUIRMING like BLACK MAGGOTS -- 

           David FURIOUSLY WIPES ANNA CLEAN -- scrubbing the dark 
           maggots from her suit.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Get off!!!!!

                                 ANNA
                        They’re just blood cells. It’s 
                        fine. Let’s go!

           David doesn’t need to be told twice. 

           The two start TRUDGING toward the NOW-BUSTED OPEN AIRLOCK. 
           Their steps labored. The resistance has never seemed so great

           David’s FLARE the only light in the universe. 

           They step through the airlock. David turns his head -- seeing 
           the STEEL BALL of Levan smashed in the corner of the room.

           He exits to --

           EXT. THE ARENA FLOOR - SAME

           But they might as well be in the middle of nowhere -- there’s 
           just darkness all around. Except -- ahead of them, where --

           The ESCAPE SUB SHINES. It’s booted up and ready.

                                 ANNA
                        We’ll have to flood the cabin.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s built for that. We can pump it 
                        out once it’s re-sealed.
           They hurry through the water -- obsessively looking behind -- 
           expecting to see the beast attacking. But instead... nothing.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe. He saved us.

                                 ANNA
                        Not yet.

           They arrive to the sub. Like a low ceilinged utilities van.

           David comes to the HATCH -- a RED WHEEL CRANK sticks out from 
           it. He GRABS the CRANK, starts to turn.

                                 DAVID
                        Move. The door’s gonna bust inward.

           Anna moves to the side, BRACES herself against the sub. GRABS 
           David with both hands, as --

           He SPINS the wheel -- 

           WHAM! The door FLIES inward -- water SHOOTS inside, and -- 

           KABOOM! A JET of pressurized air -- the entirety of the 
           oxygen in the sub -- goes SHOOTING back out like a bullet -- 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Good to go.

           David HURRIES into the flooded submarine. Anna behind him -- 
           their flare still burning strong. 

           INT. INSIDE THE SUB

           David PUSHES the door shut, as -- 

           It CLICKS into place. Seals. They’re in. They did it.

           David moves to a CONTROL DECK at the front. A COMPUTER 
           MONITOR behind pressurized glass shows the sub’s controls.

                                 DAVID
                        This takes just a second.

           David pulls up a command that says -- “DRAIN.” He hits “GO.”

           ENGINES turn on -- the WATER is PUMPED OUT of the sub, as the 
           sub’s 02 tanks pump air into the cabin. 

           The water level starts to lower, as oxygen floods in.

           Once there’s real air, Anna and David PULL off their helmets.
           David keeps at the controls, prepping the sub’s departure. He 
           finds a command that says, “LIGHTS.” He CLICKS it, and --

           The INTERIOR LIGHTS UP like an actual room. We haven't seen 
           real light in fifteen minutes. The flare’s still burning.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Take the wheel. I’ll do power.

                                 ANNA
                        Is this gonna work without someone 
                        on ballasts?

                                 DAVID
                        Let’s say yes. Engines starting -- 

           The sub JERKS as its engines turn on. 

           Anna smiles at David, but there are tears in her eyes. As 
           they’re waiting for the gears to engage -- 

           The flare goes out. David looks at it. Almost laughs.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Perfect timing. If we’d stalled 
                        even a minute, we wouldn’t be here.

                                 ANNA
                        That’s not entirely true.

           Anna reaches to her belt, grabs -- a FLARE she was hiding. 

                                 DAVID
                        You said you were out.

                                 ANNA
                        I lied. Wanted us to have one final 
                        backup. A Boy Scout I know taught 
                        me to “be prepared.”

           David takes the flare from her hand, looks it over.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m impressed. 

           But there’s one last thing to come clean about.

                                 ANNA
                        Don’t be too impressed.
                             (he looks up)
                        The auto-ignition cap broke off, 
                        so... wouldn’t have actually lit.
                                 DAVID
                        Maybe you’re more of a Cub Scout.

           David passes her back the unlit flare, as -- she LOOKS out 
           the window as the sub RISES off the ocean floor. It’s 
           surreal, after what they’ve been through.

           As the sub turns, their HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --

           The Rig. 

           Utterly pulverized. It already looks like ruins. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (shaking his head)
                        What was the point?

                                 ANNA
                        What do you mean?

                                 DAVID
                        Why attack Jen, why do any of it?

                                 ANNA
                        The same reason we did all this.  

           As the water drains more, we see -- it wasn’t just water. 
           They sucked up a foot of the gray FISH GUTS. The animals they 
           murdered.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        To survive and flourish. All... so 
                        we can reproduce. That’s the only 
                        reason for anything.

           They stare at the guts. So much death. When --

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry.

           Anna looks up -- confused.

                                 ANNA
                        For what?

                                 DAVID
                        I kicked you.

                                 ANNA
                        No you didn’t...

           And slowly, our heroes look down. Sitting in the slosh of 
           fish guts, they see, they also sucked in --
           AN EGG -- the size of a BOWLING BALL. 

           AND IT’S BLACK AS FUCKING NIGHT.

           The lights start to flicker, as --

                                 DAVID
                        No --

           POP! A BLACK CREATURE like a SNAKE SLITHERS out from the egg.

           David JUMPS up -- tries to stomp on it --

                                 ANNA
                        Get it!

           But --

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck!

           The creature JUMPS onto David’s TORSO. It’s so black we can’t 
           see what it is --

           David GRABS the thing on his chest. 

           He STRUGGLES with it in his hands -- trying to CONTROL it as 
           the lights dim LOWER and LOWER. And then --  

           CHOMP! 

           David’s LOWER JAW is RIPPED from his FACE. 

           His eyes TWIST back --

                                 ANNA
                        David!!!!!

           But before we can see more --

           CHUNG! The lights go out. 

           SPLASH! David’s body DROPS into the fish guts, as Anna, 
           again, is left completely in the dark.

           She SCREAMS as we hear the thing SPLASHING in the fish ooze 
           on the floor. Finishing David off.

           She’s SOCKED in the GUT by fear.

           Can’t think whole thoughts.

           Just instinct.
           Raw.

           Wild.

           Move!

           She scrambles backward against the sub wall. 

           We hear her HUFFING and WHIMPERING in panic.

           And then we hear the SPLASHING of the creature, as it moves 
           toward Anna.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        No, no no no no!

           Anna’s voice hysterical. Cracking.

           The SPLASHING moves closer.

           Anna searches her pockets for an answer, when --

           Hear the SHAKING of -- 

           The BOX OF MATCHES that Levan had passed her.

           She grabs a match.

           SPARKS IT!

           Sees the baby creature slithering toward her. The match dies. 

           SPARKS ANOTHER!

           The creature’s closed half the distance. The match dies.

           SPARKS ANOTHER!

           It’s practically at her feet. She jumps back, and --

           SPARKS ANOTHER.

           But sees... nothing. The creature’s stopped.

           We hear no sign of it.

           She holds the match.

           So carefully in front of her.

           AN INCH from her face.

           It burns. 
           And then we see --

           A REFLECTION in Anna’s eye.

           Inches from the match.

           A shape.

           Long.

           Thin.

           Black.

           Anna takes in a breath. The creature REARS back to strike.

           And JUST as the match is about to die --

           Anna PULLS the damaged flare from her belt.

           MANUALLY LIGHTS IT WITH THE MATCH. 

           It sparks as --

           She JUTS it forward like a knife --

           STABS it into the creature --

           PIERCES its skin --

           PINS the creature against the wall.

           It screams -- thrashing this way and that, as --

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Fucker!!!!!

           The flare BURNS in it. 

           LIGHTING the creature up from its insides.

           She grits her teeth, holding it in place, as it tries to 
           squirm free. And then we see --

           It’s BAKING from the inside -- its flesh HARDENING as it 
           cooks through.

           The LIGHT and HEAT the most PAINFUL FUCKING WAY for this 
           thing to die. And then -- 

           It stops moving. Smoke rises from it, until...

           It DROPS to the ground. Charred into ash. 
           Sizzling in the water on the sub floor.

           Dead.

           And with that, with the flare still burning in her hand -- 

           Anna SITS down on the captain’s seat.

           With one hand, she wipes sweat from her forehead. 

           She breathes.

           She leans back against the seat. 

           Breathes. 

           And then --

           With a final look at the burnt creature on the floor -- 

           She turns to the sub’s control deck.

           Its instruments turning back on.

           As the sub rises upward --

           Moving toward the surface.

           And light.

                                                              SMASH TO:

           TOTAL FUCKING BLACK
