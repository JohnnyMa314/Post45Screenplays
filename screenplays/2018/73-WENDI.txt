          Nov 2018
           INT. PRESS CONFERENCE HOLDING ROOM - DAY

           It’s a lavish room. The decor, fit for a queen. A WOMAN 
           (Asian, 44), graceful, prominent. She sits at a vanity, 
           reciting a speech. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Thank you all for being here today.

           Sounds of news reporters and cameras fighting for a prime 
           position outside. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        It is with great sadness that 
                        Rupert and I stand here today to 
                        announce our joint decision--

           She stops. Clears her throat.

           She stands up a little flustered. Her navy Chanel pant suit 
           cascades past her ankles. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                            (shouts)
                        RUBY!

           From outside the door--

                                 RUBY
                            (muffled)
                        Yes Mrs Murdoch?

                                 WOMAN
                        WATER.

           There’s a panic to her voice. 

           RUBY (early 20s), the woman’s assistant, stumbles in with a 
           jug. Swiftly pours a glass. As quickly as she entered, Ruby 
           disappears back outside.

           The Woman drinks. The water calms her.

           She looks back into the mirror. Practices smiling. She’s 
           regaining composure. 

           But then she stops. Just a second. And we see a glint of 
           sadness behind her eyes.

           PRE-LAP: Heavy rain against pavement.
           EXT. BUSY STREETS OF XUZHOU - DAY 

                              1973, XUZHOU, CHINA

           *All dialogue in italics are in mandarin.

           Communist China. The rain splatters hard against the mud. 
           Street vendors throw tarps over their exposed fruits and 
           vegetables. 

           Three sisters bolt through the crowd, almost knocking an 
           OLDER GENTLEMAN off his bike.

           The oldest - LI HUA (12) covers her hair with a piece of 
           cardboard. 

           WEN GE (5), the precocious one, rubs her big eyes, straining 
           to see past the rain. She runs, pulling on her older sister 
           MEI (7) to keep up.

           INT. THE DENG HOUSEHOLD - DAY

           The three sisters RUSH into the house; completely drenched.

           The house is more of a shack. The shoes on the rack reveal 4 
           pairs of kids shoes and 3 pairs of adult shoes.

           Li Hua runs to the--

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wen Ge watches her sister wring out her long, wet hair in 
           front of the mirror. She carefully brushes it so its nice and 
           untangled. 

           Li Hua catches her snooping. Slams the door in her face.

           INT. OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wen Ge bangs on the door.

                                 WEN GE
                        I need to pee!!

           BANG BANG BANG.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Li Hua!! I need to pee!!

           Mei, the quiet, responsible one, grabs Wen Ge’s hand.
                                 MEI
                        Come on. Let’s pee outside.

           INT/EXT. BACK DOOR - CONTINUOUS 

           Mei holds a drenched piece of cardboard over Wen Ge. She 
           hikes down her cotton pants and squats above the dirt. Her 
           stream of pee mixes in with the rain water. 

           The two of them giggle as a NEIGHBOR (70s), wrinkly 
           grandmother type, shouts from nearby--

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        I’M TELLING YOUR MOTHER ABOUT 
                        THIS!! 
                            (under her breath)
                        Ai yah...filthy children...

           They snicker under their breaths.

           INT. DENG HOUSEHOLD KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A tiny table in the centre of the room. It’s dim and dingy. 
           But it doesn’t take away from the spirited atmosphere.

           The 4 kids squeeze on one side and the 3 adults sit on the 
           other. Wen Ge’s AUNTY (47) with deep frown lines, shush the 
           children.

           Wen Ge pretends to eat from her empty bowl as her MOTHER (XUE 
           QIN, 35) serves her brother, FU (4) first. Fu always gets the 
           biggest portion because he’s a boy. This doesn’t sit well 
           with the girls. 

           Li Hua is still brushing her hair.

           Wen Ge hands her bowl to her dad, DEHUI (38) who gives her an 
           extra piece of meat. He winks at her. They share a special 
           bond.

                                 LI HUA
                        Why does Wen Ge get the extra 
                        piece?

           Wen Ge tries to grab the hairbrush from her. Dehui holds both 
           girls down. 

                                 DEHUI
                        Stop it. Wen Ge has her big test 
                        coming up on Monday. She needs the 
                        extra nutrients. 
           Wen Ge pokes Li Hua on her side. 

           Li Hua pokes her right back.

                                 MEI
                        What’s the prize tonight, baba?

           Dehui smiles.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY (BEHIND DENG HOUSEHOLD) - LATER

           Wen Ge opens the back door and pours dirty dish water 
           outside. It SPLASHES on the pavement. 

           INT. DENG HOUSEHOLD KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The four kids are frantically completing their chores. Mei 
           and Wen Ge are by the sink, washing and drying the plates. 

           Li Hua and Fu mop the floor and wipe down the table with 
           vigor. 

           Wen Ge’s competitive nature is taking over.

                                 WEN GE
                            (at Mei)
                        Wash faster!!

           Her father watches from the side with amusement. 

           Wen Ge wipes the final plate and jumps up in the air.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        FINISHED! WE’RE FINISHED!

           Fu groans. 

                                 LI HUA
                        It’s not fair! They always win! 
                        Cleaning plates is so much faster!

                                 WEN GE
                        We win when we’re mopping too! 
                        We’re just faster and more superior 
                        than you!

           Wen Ge wiggles her tongue at her eldest sister. 

           Dehui takes out a page taken from an American appliances 
           catalogue. And hands it to Wen Ge. She contains a squeal. 
           It’s like she’s received the Nobel prize. 
           Her and Mei run into their bedroom. 

           INT. PARENTS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           We catch a glimpse of the ‘master’ bedroom. A twin bed that 
           sleeps both parents and their son. 

           INT. WEN GE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Moonlight illuminates two twin beds, squeezed inside a tiny 
           room. Cramped.

           There’s an old, musty smell exuding from the sheets that have 
           been passed down for generations. 

           Li Hua tosses and turns next to their grumpy aunt. We hear 
           Wen Ge and Mei in the other bed, giggling under the sheets.

                                 AUNTY
                        Go to sleep. Your giggling is 
                        giving me a headache. 

                                 MEI
                            (muffled)
                        Sorry Aunty.

           They giggle some more. 

                                 AUNTY
                        Shhhhh!!

           Their aunty TURNS harshly on the bed.

           Mei and Wen Ge go silent. Beat. They peer over their 
           bedsheets. Their aunty snores loudly.

           From under the covers, Mei reveals a tin box with a dancing 
           hula girl on the lid. 

           It’s a treasure box filled with Western paraphernalia. There 
           are catalogues of Ford cars, pictures of Caucasian ladies 
           posing next to houses. 

           They hold up their latest acquisition up towards the 
           moonlight. Wen Ge touches the fridge catalogue. A blonde, 
           slim woman of about 21, stands next to her smiling husband, 
           dressed in a suit. Both wear cheesy grins.

                                 WEN GE
                        I want to be tall and slim like 
                        her. 
                                 MEI
                        You won’t be if you keep eating 
                        like a pig!

                                 WEN GE
                        Baba says I’m still growing!

                                 MEI
                        We must learn to be disciplined to 
                        be beautiful. 

           Wen Ge flips the page over to a family, complete with two 
           kids and their parents, stocking up a pale blue fridge.

           Wen Ge points to the fridge.

                                 WEN GE
                        What is that?

                                 MEI
                        It’s a fridge.

                                 WEN GE
                        What does it do?

                                 MEI
                        It keeps food cold.

                                 WEN GE
                        I want one.

                                 MEI
                        You’ll have to find an American 
                        husband to buy you one.

                                 WEN GE
                        Ewwww grosssss!! Husbands are 
                        grosss!!

                                 MEI
                        You need a husband to buy you a 
                        fridge.

                                 WEN GE
                        Why can’t I buy a fridge?

                                 MEI
                        Nonsense. 

           Mei moves the picture close to her lips and kisses the 
           handsome blonde husband.

                                 WEN GE
                        Ewwwww!!!
                                 MEI
                        You try it.

           Wen Ge pushes the picture away with disgust. 

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

                                 WEN GE
                        Gross!!!

           Their aunty stirs in her sleep. The girls freeze.

           The girls lay in the moonlight, dreaming of what their 
           futures will bring.

           Off Wen Ge’s face--

           INT. CHINESE CLASSROOM - DAY

                               5 YEARS LATER (1978)

           A blackboard with an improper fraction written in chalk. MR 
           WU (32) handsome, young and spunky looks around at a room 
           full of clueless kids. 

           A single hand is raised. It’s Wen Ge, now 9 years old with 
           short hair. She wears an old hand-me-down dress that hangs 
           off her small frame.

           All the kids appear older than her. 

           Mei (now 12), sits behind her sister. With a blank 
           expression.

                                 MR WU
                            (ignoring Wen Ge’s waving 
                             hand)
                        Mei?

                                 MEI
                        Yes?

                                 MR WU
                        What’s the answer to this problem?

           Wen Ge’s hand is detaching from her body.

                                 WEN GE
                        I know!

           Mr Wu ignores her.
           Mei is struggling. She feels everyone’s eyes on her.

                                 MEI
                        Uhhhh...

           She’s sweating.

                                 WEN GE
                            (whispers)
                        49. It’s 49 Mei.

           Before Mei can answer--

                                 MRS WU 
                        That’s correct Wen Ge. 

           Wen Ge beams.

                                 MR WU
                        Now, why is it that Wen Ge is 3 
                        years younger than all of you here. 
                        But she is the ONLY one who did her 
                        homework? Hm?

           Mei’s cheeks are burning now.

           EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

           A concrete slab with no grass or play equipment. But the 
           children make it work. 

           Wen Ge and Mei sit on the outskirts, munching on sweet 
           potato. Both wear clothes that are filled with holes. Is it 
           possible they got even poorer?

           In the distance, Li Hua (15), popular, laugh loudly with her 
           friends. Wen Ge watches HONG (16), handsome with kind eyes, 
           play with Li Hua’s long hair. Wen Ge waves. Li Hua ignores 
           them. 

           Wen Ge bites into the sweet potato and makes a face. 

                                 MEI
                        Pretend it’s a cheeseburger.

           Wen Ge bites again.

                                 WEN GE
                            (imitates an American 
                             accent)
                        Mmmm. Two all-beef patties, special 
                        sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, 
                        onions – on a sesame seed bun.
           Mei chuckles. 

           She bites down on her sweet potato. Spits it out.

                                 MEI
                        Ugh, it’s rotten!

           Wen Ge smells it.

                                 WEN GE
                        Here. 

           Wen Ge breaks her sweet potato in half and shares it. 

           SPLAT. A BOY (12) runs past. Throws a fistful of mud right at 
           Wen Ge’s face.

                                 BOY
                        Smarty pants.

           Wen Ge grabs Mei’s rotten sweet potato. HURLS it at him.

                                 WEN GE
                        OY! Get back here!

           Wen Ge BOLTS off, chasing him down.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. VICE PRINCIPAL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wen Ge is smeared in mud from head to toe. A nasty bruise 
           forms over her left eye. Mei sits quietly to the side having 
           been in this situation before.

           VICE PRINCIPAL ZHANG (35), long lashes with an hour glass 
           figure puts a giant SAFETY PIN on Wen Ge’s dress. It barely 
           stays up.

                                 ZHANG
                        You must be more careful little 
                        miss genius.

           She gives Wen Ge an ice pack.

                                 ZHANG (CONT’D)
                        You are very special.

           Mei looks around the room. Sees a PICTURE of Wen Ge receiving 
           a trophy from a politician. She’s intimidated.
                                 ZHANG (CONT’D)
                            (to Wen Ge)
                        It’s important for young ladies to 
                        be maintain a certain elegance. 
                        Boys only like girls who are smart 
                        and graceful. Do you understand?

           Wen Ge smells herself.

           INT. DENG HOUSEHOLD - WEN GE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           It’s late. Even the moonlight is sleepy. 

           Li Hua puts on her only pair of shoes and sneaks out the back 
           door. 

           Wen Ge peers out her window. Below, Li Hua runs into Hong’s 
           arms. Her long, silky hair glistens in the dim moonlight.

           Careful not to wake her snoring aunt, Wen Ge tip toes across 
           the creaking floorboards. She reaches underneath Li Hua’s bed 
           and pulls out a single red lipstick.

           She smears the rouge all over her lips, picks a provocative 
           dress from Li Hua’s wardrobe. Puts it on.

           From her pockets, she takes out a picture of a Caucasian girl 
           posing with her husband. Wen Ge imitates her stance. 

           She sticks out her chest, pouting and throwing kisses at the 
           mirror. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALL - DAY

           A small stage with the Vice Principal Zhang (now 41) at the 
           centre. Beneath sits the entire school alongside a sea of 
           parents. 

           A big banner hangs over the wall - END OF YEAR AWARDS - 1983

           Mei (now 17), with long hair sits quietly next to her parents 
           and two siblings. She watches Wen Ge (now 15) on stage. 

           Wen Ge’s still draped in a hand-me-down dress but with a more 
           feminine bob cut. She sits next to BO (18), chiselled 
           jawline. She looks at him, wishing he’d look back.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        The award for Excellence in English 
                        goes to Wen Ge.

           Thunderous applause.
           Dehui and Xueqin beam with pride.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Number 1 in Mathematics also goes 
                        to Wen Ge.

           Mei forces a smile as she claps. 

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        First in Chemistry...Wen Ge!

           As Mei watches her sister collect award after award, her 
           claps slow down. And her smile begins to waver. 

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

           An end of year gathering. Teenagers from 14-18yo drink soda 
           pretending to be cool. 

           Wen Ge is on the couch, feeling awkward. Bo fidgets on that 
           same couch. They have a hard time hearing each other over the 
           music.

                                 BO
                        I said your parents are smart for 
                        teaching you English. Are they 
                        academics?

                                 WEN GE
                        No. What about your parents?

                                 BO
                        They’re both teachers.

           Awkward pause.

                                 WEN GE
                        I like your jacket.

           Bo gestures that he can’t hear her.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        I said, I like your jacket.

                                 BO
                        Oh, thanks.

           He looks at her outfit but refrains from commenting. Ouch.

           Wen Ge touches his sleeve. 

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        You want a soda?
           Wen Ge nods. He’s so devastatingly handsome.

           Time passes. 

           People are beginning to thin out. 

           Still no sign of Bo.

           Wen Ge grows impatient. She gets off the couch, turns the 
           corner--

           INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Wen Ge stops in her tracks. Her mouth turns dry.

           Bo and Mei are in an embrace, passionately making out. 

           She blinks rapidly, hoping its a dream. But they continue 
           kissing, completely oblivious. 

           Wen Ge storms towards them. Rips them apart. SLAPS Bo hard 
           across the cheek. 

           INT. SIDE STREETS - NIGHT

           Wen Ge storms down the footpath. RIP to anyone who gets in 
           her way. 

           Mei catches up, out of breath. 

                                 MEI
                        Hey! Where are you going?

           Wen Ge storms harder.

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        Slow down!

                                 WEN GE
                        You knew I liked him.

                                 MEI
                        What? No, I didn’t!

                                 WEN GE
                        I was talking to him all night!

                                 MEI
                        I wasn’t with you all night! He 
                        just came up to me and said he 
                        liked my long hair. 
                                 WEN GE
                        Liar!

                                 MEI
                        I swear. 

                                 WEN GE
                        He was MINE. You know I’ve liked 
                        him since the beginning of last 
                        year!

                                 MEI
                        I didn’t know it was the same guy. 

                                 WEN GE
                        LIAR.

           Wen Ge brushes her off.

           INT. WEN GE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mei is fast asleep. The moonlight caresses her innocent face.

           A shadow creeps up towards her. It’s Wen Ge. She holds a pair 
           of scissors.

           Wen Ge carefully collects Mei’s hair into a bundle. With one 
           SNIP, she cuts her sister’s beautiful, long hair off. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. UNIVERSITY DORM ROOM - AFTERNOON

                           1987, GUANGZHOU COLLEGE

           Intensity. Passion. Lust. Wen Ge (now 19yo) with long, silky 
           hair mounts ZHANG WEI (mid 20s), boy band hair and a 6 pack. 
           Wen Ge’s red lipstick is smudged, her hair, wild. She 
           dominates him the way a man tames a horse. 

           Wen Ge wrestles Zhang Wei’s muscular arms, trying to keep 
           them pinned to the bed. They pant in unison.

           Zhang Wei and Wen Ge seem to climax at the same time before 
           collapsing on the bed. 

           Zhang Wei rolls over to cuddle Wen Ge but she’s not 
           interested.

           A wad of 20 dollar bills sits on the bedside table.
                                 WEN GE
                        For moi?

                                 ZHANG WEI
                        For last week’s and this week’s 
                        paper. 

           Wen Ge shoves the money in her back pack. She puts on jeans.

                                 WEN GE
                        When’s your next paper due?

                                 ZHANG WEI
                        Next Wednesday.

                                 WEN GE
                        I’ll see ya Tuesday then.

           Wen Ge pats down her long, silky hair in the mirror and 
           vanishes out the door. 

           EXT. UNIVERSITY BUILDING - AFTERNOON

           Students hustle and bustle around campus, wrapped in coats 
           and fingerless gloves. 

           INT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS

           A medium sized room with 10 rows of wooden seats.

           It’s empty except for two people at the front.

           Wen Ge holds out her paper, clearly upset at her PROFESSOR 
           (late 60s). It’s comical seeing a teenager tell her professor 
           off for negligence. 

                                 WEN GE 
                        I know I deserve 100%. I can speak 
                        English better than you can.

           PROFESSOR LEE, a short man with hunched shoulders tries to 
           reason with his student.

                                 PROFESSOR LEE
                        Wen Ge, I never give out 100% 
                        scores. They don’t exist in my 
                        class.

                                 WEN GE
                        I need 100% to get that scholarship 
                        to Yale. 
           Professor Lee sighs.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        The higher the mark, the better 
                        chance I have at getting that 
                        scholarship.

           Wen Ge shoves the paper up to the professor’s nose. 

           A knock at the door. JAKE CHERRY (50) and his wife JOYCE 
           CHERRY (42), stand awkwardly by the entrance. Joyce is plump 
           and dressed like a man. Jake looks worn down.

                                 JAKE
                        Is this a bad time?

           Before Professor Lee can even speak, Wen Ge marches up to the 
           couple.

                                 WEN GE
                            (in English)
                        You are both American. Will you 
                        read this and tell me if I deserve 
                        100%?

           Joyce takes the paper and skims it.

                                 JOYCE
                        It seems like a 100% paper to me.

                                 PROFESSOR LEE
                            (in English)
                        Yes but doesn’t the English 
                        language also hinge on taste? 

                                 JOYCE
                        Well, depends what you’re writing. 
                        Literature relies on taste. But if 
                        it’s an essay about...

           Joyce reads the title.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        The unrestricted free market in the 
                        United States. 

           Jake gives off an awkward laugh. 

                                 JAKE
                        We shouldn’t question the professor 
                        here, honey. This is his student. 

           Ignoring Jake--
                                 JOYCE
                            (at Wen Ge)
                        What’s your name?

                                 WEN GE
                        Wen Ge.

                                 JOYCE
                        Wen Ge here is obviously a very 
                        talented student. I think she 
                        deserves the marks. 

           Wen Ge snatches up her paper and grins.

                                 WEN GE
                        Thank you!

           Wen Ge holds out her hand. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Who are you?

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m Joyce Cherry and this is my 
                        husband Jake Cherry. 

                                 WEN GE
                        Why are you here?

                                 PROFESSOR LEE
                            (in mandarin)
                        Watch your manners Wen Ge.

           Wen Ge ignores him.

                                 JAKE
                        Your professor here is our 
                        translator while we’re on business. 

                                 WEN GE
                        What business?

                                 JAKE
                        Refrigerators. 

                                 WEN GE
                        Refritigers?

                                 JAKE
                        Refrigerators. 

                                 WEN GE
                        What’s that?
                                 PROFESSOR LEE
                            (in mandarin)
                        A fridge.

           The professor tries to shoo Wen Ge out of the classroom but 
           she won’t budge. 

                                 WEN GE
                        FRIDGES? I love fridges! 

                                 PROFESSOR LEE
                        That’s enough Wen Ge. 

           Professor Lee points to the door.

           EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS - NIGHT

           Wen Ge chases down Jake and Joyce as they walk towards their 
           car.

                                 WEN GE
                        Hey! Hey! Joyce! Jake!

           Joyce turns around. She’s amused. Jake, a little hesitant.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        I have a proposal. How about you 
                        teach me English and in return, I 
                        will be your translator free of 
                        charge!

                                 JAKE
                        We already have a translator--

                                 JOYCE
                        Oh, shut it Jake. Let her speak.

                                 WEN GE
                        I am better at English than he is 
                        and I’m a business major. 

           Joyce listens while Jake tries to leave.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        I love English. And I love America. 
                        What more do you need?

           EXT. SIDE STREET VENDORS - DUSK

           Mei (now 21), short hair and demure as ever sits alongside 
           Wen Ge. A lifetime of being second best has taken a toll on 
           Mei’s confidence. 
           The ground is filthy. In front of them is a pile of chalk 
           drawings of American brands and Caucasian people. It’s laid 
           out to sell.

           A PASSERBY steps on one and leaves a huge footprint.

                                 WEN GE
                            (screams)
                        Eh! You devil! Come back and pay 
                        for this!

           The passerby ignores them. 

           Wen Ge picks up the ruined drawing. It’s of a young Caucasian 
           girl looking up at a refrigerator. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Is this new?

                                 MEI
                        Yeah. You like it?

                                 WEN GE
                        I’ll buy it from you one day for a 
                        thousand dollars. 

           A bicycle rides by and splashes dirty water on the sidewalk. 
           It barely misses the drawings.

                                 MEI
                        It’s getting dark. 

           Mei begins to pack up her things.

                                 WEN GE
                        Guess what?

                                 MEI
                        What?

           Wen Ge has a grin on her face.

           INT. TINY APARTMENTS - STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

           Cave like interiors. Moisture sticks to the walls. Everything 
           looks old and decrepid. A string of rusty bicycles line the 
           ground floor.

           INT. WEN GE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A cramped studio with one twin bed squished against the back. 
           The walls are peeling.
           Near a dusty window, a pile of books are stacked sky high.

           On closer look, the books are all American catalogues. 
           Catalogues for Tiffany and Co, Chanel Handbags, Chevy Cars, a 
           Michael Jackson “Bad” CD.

           Mei breaks a mantou in half. Hands it to Wen Ge. It’s plain 
           and a little chewy. 

                                 WEN GE
                        Lee was being a real bastard. He 
                        wouldn’t give me 100%. 

                                 MEI
                        You can’t expect 100% every time.

                                 WEN GE
                        Why not? 

                                 MEI
                        It’s just--nevermind.

           Wen Ge retrieves the tin box from their childhood.

                                 WEN GE
                        They’re all just threatened by my 
                        intelligence. They know I could be 
                        teaching them if I really wanted 
                        to. 

           From Wen Ge’s pocket, she takes out a fridge catalogue with a 
           white couple posing on the front page. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, so their names are Joyce and 
                        Jake. And they’re real Americans! 
                        They work for this company here--

           She points to the brand: CHAMBERS

           Wen Ge grabs her sister’s small, dainty hands.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        They’re going to be our teachers.

           Mei’s lifeless eyes spark up. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        We are going to go to America one 
                        day and all of this
                            (she looks around her)
                        ...will seem like a dream.
           EXT. JAKE+JOYCE CHERRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A thick fog hovers just below a small apartment block. This 
           is a wealthier part of town. There are no bicycles here, only 
           cars and motorcycles.

           Wen Ge and Mei, dressed in thick, puffy jackets marvel at the 
           cleanliness. 

           INT. CHERRY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joyce, dressed in a shabby dress opens the door to two, red 
           cheeked girls.

           Wen Ge takes off her puffy jacket and drops it on the ground. 
           Mei picks it up and hangs both her and Wen Ge’s jackets on 
           the coat rack. 

           Thick, velvet drapes block all the windows. A shiny cabinet 
           full of Swarovski crystals in various shapes sits next to the 
           TV.

           Wen Ge walks around the room, touching everything she can. 
           Mei stands by the door, timid. 

           Wen Ge follows Joyce into the--

           INT. CHERRY’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Two giant, state of the art refrigerators sit side by side, 
           taking up a quarter of the space.

           Wen Ge can hardly contain her excitement. She runs towards 
           the first fridge, opens it up and marvels at the interiors.

           INT. CHERRY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joyce hands over a cup of tea for each girl. Mei blows on the 
           tea while impatient Wen Ge burns her tongue. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Make yourselves at home, girls. 
                            (passive aggressive)
                        Jake hasn’t been helping me around 
                        the house lately so I apologize for 
                        the mess.

           Jake doesn’t pay attention. Instead, he’s fascinated by Mei. 
           She’s the exact opposite to Joyce’s abrasive personality. 
                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Jake will be teaching you girls. 
                        But when he’s busy, I’ll take over.

           Jake watches Mei sip her tea quietly.

           INT. JAKE CHERRY’S STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           Mei sits legs crossed in a chair. Wen Ge walks around the 
           room, touching everything again.

           Jake smiles at Mei. 

                                 JAKE
                        Your sister there has quite the 
                        mouth.

                                 MEI
                            (smiles)
                        Yes, I’m aware.

                                 JAKE
                        Do you like America as much as she 
                        does?

                                 MEI
                        I do.

                                 JAKE
                        What do you like most about 
                        America?

                                 MEI
                        I like the culture. I like the 
                        people. I like that it’s the land 
                        of opportunity. 

           Mei looks up at Jake. They share a smile oblivious to Wen Ge.

           EXT. CHINESE STREETS - AFTERNOON

           The fog has dissipated. But now the air is smoky from all the 
           street vendors.

           Mei looks the other way, mind preoccupied.

                                 WEN GE
                        Why do you have that look? 

                                 MEI
                        What look?
                                 WEN GE
                        This one right now.

                                 MEI
                        It’s nothing.

           Mei goes back to staring into space.

                                 WEN GE
                        You like him don’t you?

                                 MEI
                        What? No! He’s married!

                                 WEN GE
                        I know.

                                 MEI
                        Stop it! You shouldn’t speak of 
                        such evils.

                                 WEN GE
                        What’s wrong with that? Love is 
                        love.

                                 MEI
                        I don’t like him. 

           Mei hides her flushed cheeks.

           INT. JAKE CHERRY’S STUDY - NIGHT

           A little black board, filled up with homophones - Flower, 
           Flour. Bear, Bare. 

           Mei stares lovingly at Jake Cherry’s back. He writes two more 
           words - Male, Mail.

                                 JAKE
                        Anymore?

                                 MEI
                        What about Two and Too?

                                 JAKE
                        Very good Mei!

                                 MEI
                        And to! With one “o”.

           Wen Ge racks her brains for an example. Before she opens her 
           mouth--
                                 JAKE
                        I think you’ll do just fine in the 
                        United States. If you choose to go.

           Mei blushes.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I have an important business 
                        meeting tonight and I’d like for 
                        you to accompany me. As my 
                        translator. 

           Wen Ge swallows hard.

           INT. WEN GE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Enclosed in darkness, blinds drawn, Wen Ge faces a corner of 
           the room. She plays with the telephone cord, twirling it 
           around her fingers.

                                 WEN GE
                        You don’t understand, baba. I’m the 
                        smart one. I asked the couple for 
                        classes. Without me, there’d be no 
                        classes.

           Wen Ge picks at a crack in the wall.

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        She’s your sister Wen Ge. Her 
                        success is your success.

                                 WEN GE
                        An opportunity to go to America 
                        would be wasted on her. She 
                        wouldn’t know what to do. 

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        Why is staying in China so awful to 
                        you girls?

                                 WEN GE
                        You don’t understand baba. 

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        You have Yale. Let her have her 
                        route.

           O.S. We hear the front door open and shut.

                                 WEN GE
                        I gotta go.
           Wen Ge hangs up quickly.

           Mei walks over to Wen Ge’s bed in a daze. Closes her eyes and 
           falls back onto the mattress.

                                 MEI
                        I think I’m in love.

           Wen Ge switches on a light. Mei’s eyes are glazed.

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        Joyce is always ordering him 
                        around. He needs someone gentle. 

                                 WEN GE
                        What happened?

                                 MEI
                        We kissed Wen Ge. And it was 
                        perfect. We went to that chocolate 
                        stand after dinner! It was so 
                        romantic.

                                 WEN GE
                        Did anyone see?

                                 MEI
                        We were careful.

           Beat.

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        He says he wants to take me to 
                        America with him. 

           Wen Ge’s heart skips a beat. 

                                 WEN GE
                        That’s wonderful.

           Wen Ge hugs her. It’s forced. Mei senses her sister’s 
           discomfort.

                                 MEI
                        I know he’s married. But I love 
                        him.

                                 WEN GE
                        Just be careful.

           Wen Ge panics in secret. Her stomach, churning with jealousy. 
           EXT. JAKE+JOYCE CHERRY’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Winter is here. A soft, fluffy coat of fresh snow has fallen 
           over the city.

           INT. JAKE CHERRY’S STUDY - AFTERNOON

           Jake leans against Mei’s desk. 

                                 JAKE
                        Open up your books. 

           Wen Ge watches a mouse run towards the foot of the table. It 
           begins to groom itself right between Jake and Mei’s feet. 

           Jake’s leather shoes reach under Mei’s skirt and caresses her 
           leg. 

                                 WEN GE
                        What are we learning today?

           Jake’s distracted.

           Wen Ge bangs the table. Points to the blank white board.

                                 JAKE
                        We’ll be mapping out the States 
                        within the USA. 

           Mei opens up her notebook diligently, holding onto his every 
           word.

           The mouse beneath Mei’s feet has scurried away.

           Wen Ge is wreaking with resentment. 

           EXT. STREETS - AFTERNOON

           CLOSE on Wen Ge and Mei’s boots, crunching on dirty snow.

                                 MEI
                        Have you heard from Yale yet?

                                 WEN GE 
                        Any day now.

           They walk in silence. The cold seeps through their bones. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to get hurt.

           Pause.
                                 MEI
                        You’re not the only one with 
                        dreams, you know. I want to go to 
                        America too. You have your brains 
                        and your looks. What do I have? I’m 
                        just the older sister who makes $2 
                        a day selling drawings. This is my 
                        one chance...

           Wen Ge thinks.

                                 WEN GE
                        You’re better than this.

           They reach their decaying apartment. Mei hesitates.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go inside. I’ll make us a hot 
                        cup of tea. Talk about this like 
                        adults.

                                 MEI
                        No, I think I’ll go for a walk. 

           Mei stomps off in the snow.

           INT. WEN GE’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Wen Ge watches the snow covered world through her bedroom 
           window. She looks for any sign of her sister. But instead, 
           spots the MAILWOMAN (50s), drop off the mail. 

           Wen Ge disappears and returns with a letter.

           It’s from Yale. 

           Her heart’s in her throat. 

           She rips it open and reads the first two lines.

           Dear Miss Deng,

           The Yale Admissions Committee received a record 10,000 
           applications this year. At this time, we regret to inform you 
           that you have not been approved for a scholarship to Yale 
           School of Management, Class of 1988.

           Wen Ge stops reading. 

           Her eyes glaze over. 

           The letter HITS the ground. 
           INT. WEN GE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A soft glow coming from a candle. Wen Ge holds the rejection 
           letter close to her face, eyes scanning each line over and 
           over again. Obsessing.

           She holds the paper over the fire. It starts to burn. The 
           edges crumple to ash. 

           We hear faint mumbling coming from outside.

           Keys jingle.

           INT. MEI’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wen Ge is in her pyjamas, pretending to sleep. Mei, drunk, 
           face plants onto the bed.

                                 WEN GE
                        Where were you?

           Wen Ge rolls Mei’s droopy body over on her back.

           Incredibly drunk--

                                 MEI
                        Men are pigs.

           Mei blows into a tissue.

                                 WEN GE
                        What happened?

                                 MEI
                        He wanted to have sex...

           Pause.

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        And I just...I thought about his 
                        wife and his family. And I just 
                        couldn’t do it. You were right. 

           Mei closes her eyes. Cuddles up to Wen Ge on the bed. 

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        I hope he doesn’t hate me.

           Wen Ge caresses Mei’s hair. 

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we’re both destined to be 
                        stuck here. Forever.
           Wen Ge holds Mei in her arms, cradling her head. Her mind, 
           churning. 

                                 WEN GE
                        We’ll find a way. 
                            (pause)
                        We’ll find a way.

           A raging fire burns behind those eyes. 

           EXT. CHERRY’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Wen Ge pedals quickly. She hops off her bike, out of breath.

           INT. CHERRY’S APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE on Wen Ge’s fist hitting the door. KNOCK KNOCK.

           INT. CHERRY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           There are boxes scattered around. Some of the furniture are 
           in bubble wrap.

           Joyce scurries around, shoving her dresses inside a box 
           that’s already filled to the brim.

                                 JOYCE
                        Now’s not really a good time Wen 
                        Ge.

                                 WEN GE
                        I just wanted to see how you were. 
                        And if you needed help with 
                        anything.

                                 JOYCE
                        I’m a little busy as you can see.

           Wen Ge saves a pile of clothes that’s falling off a chair.

                                 WEN GE
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 JOYCE
                        Depends what it is.

                                 WEN GE
                        I just loved learning English from 
                        you and your husband. Is there an 
                        opportunity for me to continue 
                        learning...
           She takes a deep breath.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps in America?

           Joyce stops stuffing her clothes. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Did my husband say something?

                                 WEN GE
                        No! Of course not! I just wanted to 
                        know if that was a possibility. To 
                        come to America in study.

           Joyce disappears into her bedroom and comes out with her work 
           shirts. She opens up an empty box.

                                 JOYCE
                        Absolutely not.

           Wen Ge is hurt.

                                 WEN GE
                        It’s just, your husband told my 
                        sister that he knows people in 
                        education...

                                 JOYCE
                        No. The answer is no.

           Wen Ge knows better than to push back.

                                 WEN GE
                        Where is all of your husband’s 
                        stuff Mrs. Cherry?

                                 JOYCE
                        Jake’s not coming with me. He’s 
                        going to finalize some deals we 
                        have going on here.

           Wen Ge acts shocked to hear this. 

                                 WEN GE
                        He’s staying here?

                                 JOYCE
                        Yes.

           Joyce stuffs too many shirts in the box. It bursts open. She 
           curses under her breath.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. WEN GE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wen Ge draws very precisely on her lips.

           A slim, tight fitted dress hugs her body. Seductive, yet 
           sophisticated.

           She peaks out to the living room. Mei is cuddled up on the 
           couch, reading an English novel (think Pride and Prejudice) 
           with an English dictionary open.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wen Ge’s heels CLANK on the concrete floor. Mei--without 
           looking up--

                                 MEI
                        Who you meeting?

                                 WEN GE
                        Just some delinquent. From class.

                                 MEI
                        Poor boy...

           Mei smirks.

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        Bring a coat. It’s cold out.

           EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Heavy rain hammers down on Wen Ge’s tattered umbrella. She 
           shivers, curses herself for not bringing a coat. 

           Jake appears, holding a much larger umbrella. 

           He’s reluctant. Wary of Wen Ge.

                                 JAKE
                        Thank you for helping out. It 
                        should be very quick. You should be 
                        home by 9.

           Wen Ge steps into the light and he gets a glimpse of her 
           dress. She’s absolutely gorgeous. 

           They enter--
           INT. FANCY CHINESE RESTAURANT (RECEPTION) - CONTINUOUS

           A slim HOSTESS wearing a red, traditional qipao smiles 
           graciously.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Do you have a reservation with us 
                        today?

                                 JAKE
                        Yes. Under Jake Cherry.

                                 HOSTESS
                        Oh yes. There are 2 gentlemen 
                        already seated inside.

           Jake looks confused.

                                 JAKE
                        Two?

           The hostess turns--

                                 HOSTESS
                        Come with me please.

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Wen Ge struts through the elite crowd, past the glares of 
           Caucasian men and their wives. 

           The hostess shows them to their table. MR WANG (late 50s) and 
           MR CHIN (early 60s), both with red, round faces, dressed in 
           business suits, stand up to shake Jake’s hands. 

           They sway a little from the alcohol. 

                                 JAKE
                        I am so sorry we are late.

                                 WEN GE
                            (translates)
                        Jake wants to apologize for being 
                        late.

                                 MR WONG
                            (in mandarin)
                        Don’t worry, don’t worry! Mr 
                        Cherry, meet Mr Chin. He is the 
                        owner of CHIN Refrigeration. 
                        China’s largest appliance 
                        corporation.
           Jake glances over to Wen Ge. He’s confused why Mr Chin has 
           accompanied his dinner guest.

                                 MR CHIN
                        Please sit!

           Mr Chin passes Jake a menu.

                                 MR CHIN (CONT’D)
                        The sea urchin is a delicacy. You 
                        must try it!

           Wen Ge translates.

                                 JAKE
                            (in English)
                        Can you tell Mr Chin that I am 
                        allergic to sea urchin?

           Mr Chin first looks offended by this news. But then, he 
           starts to make choking noises. His face goes red and his eyes 
           roll back. 

           Jake scans the room for help...

           Mr Wong and Mr Chin erupt in laughter. 

           Jake realizes it’s a joke. He laughs along - halfheartedly.

                                 MR WONG
                            (shouts)
                        SHOTS! LETS GET A ROUND OF SHOTS! 
                        WAITRESS!!

           A petite WAITRESS rushes over. 

                                 MR WONG (CONT’D)
                        ANOTHER ROUND!

           Mr Chin and Mr Wong erupt in laughter once again. 

                                 MR WONG (CONT’D)
                        Mr Cherry. We like American brands. 
                        We just think they are too 
                        expensive. The Chinese will always 
                        like cheap things!

                                 JAKE
                        I understand Mr Wong. But the 
                        quality you get from American 
                        refrigerators is unparalleled to 
                        anything the Chinese can offer.

           Mr Wong’s eyes grow large. He’s offended.
                                 MR WONG
                        The Chinese make the best fridges 
                        in the world. At a fraction of what 
                        you charge Mr Cherry.

                                 JAKE
                        Of course, of course Mr Wong. I did 
                        not mean to offend. Mr Chin’s 
                        products are of the highest 
                        quality. But our products are 
                        guaranteed a 5 year warrantee. Can 
                        you say the same for your products?

           Wen Ge whispers into Jake’s ears.

                                 WEN GE
                            (whispers)
                        Mr Cherry, I think what you said 
                        may offend them.

                                 JAKE
                        But its the truth.

                                 WEN GE
                        May I try something?

           Jake looks at Wen Ge. An 18 year old girl with no experience 
           in business. And yet, she speaks with pure conviction. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        You want to expand in China. But 
                        they will not accept you unless 
                        they get something in return. 

                                 JAKE
                        They get our wonderful fridges!

                                 WEN GE
                        Yes but then they’ll just see you 
                        as stealing their business.

                                 JAKE
                        Ok...

                                 WEN GE
                        What they want is to expand into 
                        America.

                                 JAKE
                        But their cheap fridges won’t sell 
                        there.
                                 WEN GE
                        But that’s not your problem. Your 
                        job is to just sell your 
                        refrigerators in China. Whether or 
                        not their fridges sell in America 
                        does not matter.

                                 JAKE
                        They just want to expand?

                                 WEN GE
                        Why do you think Mr Chin is here? 
                        Mr Wong brought him here as a 
                        bargaining chip. Mr Chin represents 
                        the Chinese brand. You represent 
                        the West. Give and take.

           Jake gives Wen Ge a little nod. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                            (to Mr Wong)
                        We would like to offer you a 
                        partnership. 1000 of our units in 
                        your flagship stores Mr Wong. And 
                        in return, we will sell Mr Chin’s 
                        units in America.

           Mr Wong looks from Wen Ge to Jake. A satisfied look on his 
           red, drunk face. 

           INT. JAKE CHERRY’S FORD (MOVING CAR) - NIGHT

           A soft hum omits from the radio. 

           Jake and Wen Ge sit in silence, still a little buzzed from 
           the evening affairs. 

           Jake turns the radio down.

                                 JAKE
                        Where did you learn to do that?

                                 WEN GE
                        I just know how the Chinese think.

           Jake is trying to suppress his growing attraction. 

                                 JAKE
                        Thanks you for tonight. This was a 
                        huge deal. Joyce will be happy.

                                 WEN GE
                        Anytime.
           Jake pulls over to the curb. Wen Ge’s apartment is just 
           outside.

           Wen Ge looks up at her sister’s window. The lights are out. 
           She thinks for a brief moment. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to go home just yet. 

           There is a speck of food smeared on the side of Jake’s lips. 
           Wen Ge reaches over and wipes it off. 

           Jake enjoys the touch. An intimate moment.

           EXT. JAKE+JOYCE CHERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The snow has started to melt. An incandescent street lamp 
           casts a warm spotlight on Jake’s car. 

           All is still.

           INT. JAKE+JOYCE CHERRY’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Jake hands Wen Ge a beer. 

           Wen Ge sees that the fridge is still in the kitchen. She 
           marvels at it. 

                                 WEN GE
                        What made you want to get into 
                        refrigeration? 

                                 JAKE
                        My father. He was known as Mr 
                        Freeze back in the 40s. He was one 
                        of the first guys to have home 
                        freezers as a separate compartment 
                        rather than its own item. 

           Wen Ge studies Jake’s face. 

                                 WEN GE
                        You are very handsome, you know 
                        that?

           Jake blushes.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Except for your big nose.

           Jake laughs. 
           Wen Ge leans in and kisses Jake on the lips. He savors the 
           moment but pulls away. He’s unsure...

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        Did you know I fell for you the 
                        first time I met you? In the 
                        lecture hall. Do you remember? 

                                 JAKE
                        Yes. That poor professor.

                                 WEN GE
                        You looked so successful and 
                        handsome. I knew Joyce didn’t 
                        deserve you. 

           Wen Ge strokes Jake’s hair. 

           Jake loosens up. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        And when Mei told me she liked you, 
                        I was devastated. But she’s my 
                        sister. What could I do?

           Wen Ge edges closer. 

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        But right now. I have never been 
                        happier. Being here with you. In 
                        this moment. 

           Jake touches Wen Ge’s hand. The two of them kiss. Jake 
           doesn’t pull away this time.

                                                         CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. WEN GE’S OLD HOME - DAY

                                 6 MONTHS LATER

           Red origami decorations hang around the walls. The words - 
           HAPPY CHINESE NEW YEAR in Mandarin characters hang above the 
           dining table. 

           Outside, crackles and fireworks explode in the streets. 

           Wen Ge’s mother (Xue Qin) rushes around the kitchen, checking 
           on the dumplings. A grilled fish sits in the pan, sizzling 
           loudly.

           Fu (Wen Ge’s younger brother) tries to taste the fish. Xue 
           Qin swats his hand away.
                                 XUE QIN
                            (at Fu)
                        Go check on the wantons. 

           Fu dips his fingers into the wanton soup. 

           EXT. BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           De Hui sits on a stool, with a needle and thread, mending his 
           wife’s dress.

           He holds it up, pleased. The tear is gone.

           Wen Ge sits nearby. A pile of to-be-mended clothes, next to 
           her.

                                 DEHUI
                        Hand me your mother’s pants, will 
                        you?

                                 WEN GE
                        Which ones?

                                 DEHUI
                        The grey ones.

           Wen Ge fishes a pair of grey pyjamas with several holes on 
           the pant leg. 

                                 WEN GE
                        Chinese New Year is for new 
                        clothes, dad.

                                 DEHUI
                        What are you talking about? See? 
                        Brand new!

           Dehui holds up the dress.

                                 WEN GE
                        One day, I’ll buy you and mom the 
                        most expensive clothes ever made. 

           Dehui chuckles.

                                 DEHUI
                        Your mother and I are simple 
                        people. We’d want you to spend that 
                        money on yourself. 

           Beat.
           Dehui gets up and goes to his bedside table. He takes out an 
           envelope. Hands it to Wen Ge.

           It’s a wad of cash. 

                                 DEHUI (CONT’D)
                        Your mother and I have been saving 
                        since you were very young. We both 
                        knew you’d do something spectacular 
                        with your life. 

           Wen Ge is speechless. 

                                 WEN GE
                        Dad, I can’t take this. 

                                 DEHUI
                        Nonsense! Make sure you pay for the 
                        groceries to lessen their burden. 
                        The Cherrys are good people for 
                        taking you in. 

           Pause.

                                 DEHUI (CONT’D)
                        Just remember to always be honest 
                        and hard-working. That’s all.

           Dehui motions for Wen Ge to pass another pair of pants to 
           mend. 

           INT. WEN GE’S OLD BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           We hear CRACKLES from fireworks.

           Wen Ge packs quietly. Mei sits in a corner, drawing.

           An uncomfortable silence.

                                 WEN GE
                        What are you drawing?

           A long pause. 

                                 MEI
                        Nothing. 

           Wen Ge grabs her socks and underwear. Folds it neatly into 
           her bag.

                                 WEN GE
                        Can I see?
           Mei ignores her. 

           Pause.

           Mei holds the drawing up. It’s a self portrait. But Mei’s 
           hair looks like it’s just been cut off. And she’s wearing a 
           tattered dress. 

           Wen Ge looks away. 

           She continues to pack.

                                 WEN GE (CONT’D)
                        I like your hair short.

                                 MEI
                        I kept it short after you cut it 
                        off.

           Beat.

                                 WEN GE
                        You knew I liked him.

           A tense moment. Mei shakes her head in disbelief.

                                 MEI
                        It’s ok Wen Ge. You’ve won. It’s 
                        ok. 

           Wen Ge goes to say something but can’t get the words out. 

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           The fireworks have died down but there are still celebrations 
           nearby. 

           Red streamers and glitter confetti litter the streets. 
           Children run around playing tag. Laughter fills the air.

           INT. AROUND THE DINING TABLE - NIGHT

           A Chinese New Year banquet. Chopsticks fight for the 
           remaining dumplings. A giant fish bone. It’s dead eyes stare 
           up at Wen Ge.

           Wen Ge watches her family chew on leftovers and laugh with 
           their mouths full.
                                 DEHUI
                        Let us give thanks to the New Year! 
                        And to Wen Ge. We wish her every 
                        success. Cheers!

           The family clink their glasses.

           But there is a somber tone to the celebrations.

           Because Mei is absent.

           Wen Ge forces a smile and drinks her wine.

                                                         CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. JAKE’S FORD (DRIVING) - DAY

           CLOSE ON-- Wen Ge grabbing Jake’s hand. She squeezes it. The 
           shadows of trees cast strange shapes on their arms. 

           Wen Ge looks up towards the sky-- a skyline of palm trees 
           that stretch out as far as the eye can see.

           Wen Ge’s shabby luggage sits in the back seat. 

           She peers out the window. A limousine passes with tinted 
           windows. 

           We wonder who’s inside. 

           Billboards, Rodeo drive, the Hollywood sign.

           EXT. CHERRY’S HOUSE LA - DAY

           A one-storey house with white picket fences.

           Wen Ge steps out onto the perfectly groomed lawn.

           A NEIGHBOR (40s, Caucasian) mows his lawn with precision. He 
           waves to Jake enthusiastically.

           Jake smiles awkwardly, walking with haste towards the front 
           door.

                                 JAKE
                            (whispers to Wen Ge)
                        That’s Henry. He works at your 
                        University.
           The neighbor looks suspiciously at Wen Ge as they disappear 
           inside the house.

           INT. CHERRY’S LIVING ROOM LA - CONTINUOUS

           A neat and tidy space with cream furniture. The house is dark 
           and quiet. 

           Jake leads Wen Ge into the--

           DAUGHTER’S BEDROOM

           Where Jake sets Wen Ge’s luggage down. It’s a young child’s 
           bedroom with fairy stickers across an entire wall. Most of 
           the room is pink except the drapes, which are a jade green. 

                                 WEN GE
                        I love it.

                                 JAKE
                        I’m sorry you have to share. 

           Wen Ge touches Jake’s cheeks and kisses him with passion.

           Their two bodies slide onto the ground, kissing on top of a 
           heap of Barbie Dolls and Lego. Wen Ge lies in Jake’s arms, 
           kissing his neck. He reaches inside her jeans.

           INT. ALL AMERICAN DINER - DAY

           A bustling room, packed with families out for their weekly 
           routine of chocolate milkshakes and greasy burgers. 

           A giant cow dressed in rodeo clothing greets guests at the 
           entrance.

           Amongst the flurry, we FOCUS IN on The Cherries and Wen Ge. 
           Their young daughter, CAROLINE (5yo) has ketchup smeared all 
           over her face.

           Joyce looks tired. Frumpier than ever. A little neurotic. 

                                 JAKE
                        So, Wen Ge! We have to come up with 
                        an English name for you!

                                 WEN GE 
                        Why?
                                 JAKE
                        So it’s easier for Americans to 
                        pronounce. Trust me, it’ll be 
                        easier in the long run.

                                 WEN GE
                        Wen Ge is not very hard to 
                        pronounce.

                                 JAKE
                        But it’s not an English name. In 
                        America, you must adopt an English 
                        name.

                                 WEN GE
                        Did you have a Chinese name in 
                        China?

           Pause.

                                 JAKE
                        Well, no...

           Caroline is playing with the salt and pepper shakers. 

                                 JOYCE
                            (at Caroline)
                        Stop that.

                                 JAKE
                        How about Wendi? It’s close to Wen 
                        Ge?

           Wen Ge ponders the name.

                                 WEN GE
                        Wendi...

           INT. CHERRY’S HOUSE - WENDI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wendi’s back is to us. She’s on the phone.

           Caroline sleeps on the second tier of a bunk bed behind her. 

                                 WENDI
                            (in mandarin)
                        I don’t know how I feel about it.
                            (listens)
                        Wendi.
                            (listens)
                        I guess I don’t know any famous 
                        Wendi’s...I’ll be the first...
           Caroline turns in her sleep.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go dad. 

           Wendi stands up and puts on a wide brim hat. She poses in 
           front of the mirror, waving to non existent adoring fans. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Hello everyone! My name is Wendi. 
                        Wendi Deng.

           She blows a kiss at herself. 

           Suddenly, footsteps. Wendi takes the hat off and slips into 
           bed. She closes her eyes just in time.

           Joyce opens the door.

           She stands there in the doorway, eyes filled with hate. 
           Whatever it is, she does NOT want Wendi here. The door shuts 
           abruptly.

           INT. CAL STATE LECTURE ROOM - DAY

                             CAL STATE, NORTHRIDGE

           MRS. GRAHAM (50s), balding with round glasses points to a 
           slideshow. A picture of every brand owned by the Murdoch 
           Empire.

                                 MRS GRAHAM
                        The Murdochs. Net worth of 17 
                        billion dollars. 

           Wendi is the only one scribbling down notes.

           DAVID GOLDMANN (20), greasy black hair and bushy eyebrows 
           watches her tenacity with interest.

                                 DAVID
                            (whispers)
                        What are you writing?

           Wendi looks at him suspiciously.

                                 WENDI
                        None of your business.

           Up the front, Mrs Graham has changed to the next slide. 
                                 MRS GRAHAM
                        Political manoeuvring, leveraging 
                        public opinion, customizing media 
                        content to fit their intent. I 
                        would dare say Rupert Murdoch is 
                        one of the most powerful men in the 
                        Western World. There’s not much 
                        else he does not control.

           Wendi’s hand shoots up. Mrs Graham is taken aback.

                                 MRS GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        That wasn’t a question...but yes. 
                        The girl in the front.

                                 WENDI
                        He doesn’t control China.

                                 MRS GRAHAM
                        Excuse me?

                                 WENDI
                        China has the world’s largest 
                        population. Whoever controls China 
                        is the most powerful man in the 
                        world. And Rupert Murdoch does not 
                        control China. 

                                 MRS GRAHAM
                        Yet.

           INT. CAL STATE, CORRIDORS - DAY

           Wendi walks with purpose, head deep in thought. David catches 
           up next to her.

                                 DAVID
                        You know my father works for 
                        Murdoch?

                                 WENDI
                        Is that a pick up line?

                                 DAVID
                        I swear.

                                 WENDI
                        Where?

                                 DAVID
                        Star TV. It’s Murdoch’s venture 
                        into Chinese TV.
                                 WENDI
                        I know what Star TV is.

           Wendi’s brashness would scare most people but not David. He’s 
           infatuated.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Get me a job there.

                                 DAVID
                        Excuse me?

                                 WENDI
                        I don’t believe you. Get me a job 
                        and I’ll believe you.

                                 DAVID
                        Are you even legally allowed to 
                        work?

                                 WENDI
                        Soon.

           Wendi walks out the front doors.

           INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Wendi BANGS on the walls. B-52’s hit Love Shack plays loudly 
           next door.

           Jake lays naked on a pile of cheap sheets, his socks still 
           on.

           Wendi continues to BANG loudly. BANG BANG BANG. She waits. 
           BANG BANG BANG.

                                 JAKE
                        I think it’s getting louder.

           Wendi puts on her slippers. Is about to walk out the door 
           when-- Jake jumps up and cuddles her. Tries to calm her down.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Come to bed. Tell me about school. 

                                 WENDI
                        I’m sick of these hotel rooms. I 
                        don’t want to be a secret anymore.

           Wendi throws the sheets off the bed.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I’m sick of sneaking around.
                                 JAKE
                        Well, what do you want?

                                 WENDI
                        I want to get married.

           Jake sits up. The mattress creaks like its a thousand years 
           old.

                                 JAKE
                        Wendi, we’ve talked about this.

                                 WENDI
                        Joyce isn’t stupid. She knows 
                        what’s going on. 

                                 JAKE
                        I can’t do it to Caroline.

                                 WENDI
                        Do what? You’re in a loveless 
                        marriage, Jake. You and Caroline 
                        will be much happier with me.

                                 JAKE
                        She’ll hate me.

                                 WENDI
                        Caroline will hate you for staying. 
                        She will grow to resent you. Trust 
                        me.

                                 JAKE
                        I just need more time.

           Wendi can feel her rage rising, but she suppresses it. 

           She sits down beside Jake and cradles his head on her lap, 
           caresses his beard.

                                 WENDI
                        You know I love you and will wait 
                        for you forever. 
                            (Pause)
                        But the longer you take, the harder 
                        it’ll be on everyone. 

           Beat.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Just think about it. You, me and 
                        little Carrie. We’ll be the perfect 
                        family. 
           Wendi bends down and kisses Jake’s forehead.

           EXT. CAL STATE, NORTHRIDGE CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

           A multicolored hacky sack gets kicked around a circle of 
           hippie looking TEENS. 

           David hurries past.

           INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

           David walks towards Wendi, who is buried inside a thick 
           textbook.

           He takes out a security pass and badge. Hands it to Wendi.

                                 DAVID
                        You start Monday.

           Wendi looks up. A little shocked.

                                 WENDI
                        What’s my job?

                                 DAVID
                        Just an intern. That’s the best I 
                        could do...for now.

                                 WENDI
                        That’ll work.

           Wendi turns the security pass around in her hands.

           INT. STAR TV LOBBY - DAY

           Wendi struts with purpose towards the security gates. When 
           her hair is down, she means business. She flashes her badge 
           and walks straight into the elevators packed with the suits 
           and stilettos. 

           INT. STAR TV RECEPTIONIST AREA - DAY

           The elevator DINGS open. The top floor of the building. Wendi 
           steps out onto an open floor plan. A blonde RECEPTIONIST sits 
           by the glass door.

                                 WENDI
                        Hi. I’m Wendi and today’s my first 
                        day!
           Wendi shakes the receptionist’s hand almost crushing her. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        And who are you here to see?

                                 WENDI
                        Bruce Goldmann.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Please take a seat over there.

           The receptionist points to a cushy couch surrounded by 
           orchards. 

           Within seconds, another skinny brunette, KATE (21) impeccably 
           dressed greets Wendi.

                                 KATE
                        You must be Wendi! I’m Kate, 
                        Bruce’s assistant. May I offer you 
                        a beverage? A water, tea, coffee 
                        perhaps?

                                 WENDI
                        I’m ok, thank you!

                                 KATE
                        Oh, you have an accent! Where are 
                        you from?

                                 WENDI
                        China.

           They start walking through endless rows of cubicles.

                                 KATE
                        You know, it’s funny. We’re a 
                        Chinese television station, but 
                        you’re the first Chinese person 
                        I’ve met!

           They walk the rest of the way in silence.

           INT. BRUCE GOLDMANN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           BRUCE GOLDMANN (54), a direct replica of David but add 30 
           years. His stomach pours over his expensive trousers. He has 
           no time for the new intern--

                                 BRUCE
                        You speak Chinese?

           Wendi nods.
           INT. KATE’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Wendi shares Kate’s tiny desk. 

           Kate types furiously on her keyboard, almost attacking the 
           keys. Her elbow bangs Wendi’s arm incessantly.

           Wendi has on headphones, translating mandarin into English. 
           ZOOM IN on Wendi’s ears.

                                 CHINESE RADIO HOST #1
                            (in mandarin)
                        Star TV will be buying up the most 
                        satellite dishes in Northern and 
                        Southern China. This could really 
                        give CCTV a run for its money.

                                 CHINESE RADIO HOST #2
                        Yes definite. But the network is 
                        still a baby. And it’s bringing in 
                        Western shows for the first time. I 
                        don’t know if it can hold up 
                        against the CCTV audience. 

           Kate’s elbow nudges Wendi, causing her to misspell a word. 
           Wendi’s had it.

           Wendi stands up, unplugs her cubic IBM computer that weighs a 
           million pounds. She lugs it into--

           INT. MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A spacious room with a large meeting desk in the centre. 

           Wendi is at the end of the table, with all the arm room in 
           the world, typing away.

           We see Bruce walk along the glass walls. Kate trails behind 
           him, obviously upset at Wendi’s audacity. 

           He knocks.

                                 BRUCE
                        Wendi, this is a board room. You 
                        are not allowed in here.

                                 WENDI
                        I need to have a place to work, 
                        don’t I?

                                 BRUCE
                        Well, yes. But you have a place. 
                        Next to Kate.
                                 WENDI
                        This is much better. I have almost 
                        finished the first tape.

                                 BRUCE
                        Already?

           Bruce is beyond impressed.

                                 WENDI
                        Shall I continue?

           Lost for words--

                                 BRUCE
                        Err...yes. Yes, please continue.

           Bruce closes the door quietly. 

           Kate walks behind him, confused as hell.

           INT. WENDI’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Wendi sits on the floor, fiddling with a Barbie doll. She’s 
           on the phone--

                                 WENDI
                            (on the phone)
                        Can you tell her I started a new 
                        job? I love it here. I’m going to 
                        do everything in my power to stay.

           O.S. We hear the front door open and close.

           INT. CHERRY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joyce seems to have put on weight. Her clothes are baggier 
           than ever. 

           She looks like she’s been crying.

           INT. WENDI’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wendi talks in hushed tones.

                                 WENDI
                            (on the phone)
                        How is Mei?

           A deafening BANG. Wendi jumps.
                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                            (on the phone)
                        I gotta go dad. 

           Wendi hangs up.

           INT. CHERRY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joyce has thrown a giant luggage bag in the center of the 
           room. It’s open and empty.

                                 JOYCE
                        Start packing.

           Wendi freezes.

                                 WENDI
                        What’s going on?

                                 JOYCE
                        You heard me. Start packing. 

           Wendi doesn’t move. 

           Joyce grabs Wendi’s arm forcefully. Wendi shakes her off.

                                 WENDI
                        Don’t touch me.

                                 JOYCE
                        GET OUT. GET OUT. GET OUT.

           Joyce grabs vase after vase and throws them at the wall. One 
           by one, they SHATTER. 

           Joyce storms into Caroline’s room and begins to bring out 
           piles of Wendi’s clothes. She drops them inside the bag. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        GET. OUT.

           Back and forth.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        OF.

           Back and forth.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        MY. HOUSE. 

           Back and forth until...
           Silence. 

           Joyce doesn’t reappear. 

           Wendi walks into--

           INT. WENDI’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Joyce sits on the bunk bed, weeping into her hands.

           Wendi doesn’t know what to do.

           Wendi quietly starts to gather the rest of her clothes from 
           the wardrobe. Stepping over the mess Joyce has made. 

                                 JOYCE
                        I had no choice you know? Jake was 
                        going to leave us if we didn’t 
                        sponsor you. I thought putting you 
                        in Caroline’s room would remind him 
                        that you’re still just a child...

                                 JOYCE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I thought, maybe if I waited it 
                        out, he’d--

           Joyce blows her nose into her daughter’s pyjamas. 

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        He’d stay.

           Wendi takes a step towards Joyce.

                                 JOYCE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you dare show me sympathy.

           Wendi grabs the last of her clothes and disappears out the 
           room. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Joyce follows Wendi into the living room. Her hands are 
           shaking. Her makeup, running. 

                                 JOYCE
                        Do you love him?

           Wendi zips up her bag. 

           A long beat. 

           Wendi doesn’t look up. Her eyes betray the truth. 
           She rolls the bag through the front door. BANG. The door 
           shuts.

           Joyce just stands there. Broken and alone.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Wendi, dressed in a plain white dress stands next to Jake, in 
           a cheap suit.

           The cold, almost clinical layout of the courtroom makes their 
           marriage seem more like a transaction than a celebration.

           Jake’s daughter, Caroline sits in the stands with two MALE 
           STRANGERS (40s). STRANGER #1 glares at Caroline to stop 
           fidgeting. 

           Wendi’s hand quivers slight, as she signs the most important 
           document she’s ever signed. Then Jake signs. It’s as if the 
           world has been lifted off her shoulders.

           INT. STAR TV BOARD ROOM - DAY

                                STAR TV, 1995

           Wendi (25), in a navy suit, hair is neatly tucked behind her 
           ears. She sits in a room of men. She looks older, wiser.

           Bruce (her old boss) sits next to Wendi, now a peer.

           HANK (60s), the CEO of Star TV, clean shaven with a youthful 
           bounce, passes around the annual earnings of the company.

           Immediately, Wendi’s hand shoots up.

                                 WENDI
                        This is terrible.

           Hank laughs. Obviously accustomed to Wendi’s abrupt manner.

                                 HANK
                        We know, Wendi. For now, there’s 
                        nothing we can do. The government 
                        has passed the bill.

                                 WENDI
                        Murdoch offended them.

                                 HANK
                        Now, we don’t know that.
                                 WENDI
                        You offend the Chinese and they’ll 
                        pass a bill to keep you out.

           Again, Wendi is the only Chinese woman in the boardroom. 

                                 HANK
                        Mr Murdoch himself will be 
                        attending our annual meeting next 
                        Monday afternoon. Please come 
                        prepared with solutions for our 
                        dwindling shares. 

                                 WENDI
                        The solution is that he needs to 
                        apologize to Li Peng personally.

           Wendi is once again, ignored.

           INT. LUNCHROOM - DAY

           Wendi walks in on TWO FEMALE CO-WORKERS gossiping by the 
           microwave. They eye her suspiciously. People don’t trust her 
           here and she knows it.

           Wendi waits for her turn to heat up her container of rice and 
           bok choy. 

                                 CO-WORKER 1
                        Have you heard the rumor? 

                                 CO-WORKER 2
                        About Murdoch’s wife?

                                 CO-WORKER 1
                        No! That he’s looking for an 
                        assistant to translate for him in 
                        China. 

                                 CO-WORKER 2
                        I’d kill for that job. 

           The microwave BEEPS.

           INT. HANK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Wendi barges in.

                                 WENDI
                        I’d like to be put up for the 
                        Murdoch translating job.
                                 HANK
                        We’re looking for someone who is a 
                        little more senior. With a little 
                        more knowledge of the TV biz.

                                 WENDI
                        It won’t matter if they’re a 
                        veteran in TV or not. If they don’t 
                        understand Chinese culture, they 
                        can’t make deals.

           Hank knows he doesn’t win fights with Wendi.

                                 HANK
                        I’ll bring it up to my boss and see 
                        what he says, ok?

                                 WENDI
                        I want an interview with Murdoch. 

                                 HANK
                        With Rupert Murdoch?

           Hank lets out a laugh.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        Wendi, I can’t even get a meeting 
                        with Murdoch. Let alone a low level 
                        executive like yourself...

                                 WENDI
                        This isn’t a meeting. It’s a job 
                        interview. 

                                 HANK
                        I’ll tell you what. I’ll bring it 
                        up with him on our Monday meeting 
                        when he’s here in person. And see 
                        if he’s interested. Deal?

           Wendi’s not convinced.

           INT. WENDI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wendi writes a check to her family and seals it inside an 
           envelope addressed to China. 

           Around her table, a dozen books are open about television 
           management and media in China. The three stained coffee mugs 
           near her books are beginning to stink.

           The television plays loudly in the other room. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           This is the first look at Wendi and Jake’s new home. Think 
           Ikea style furniture. Cheap and bland. However, a state of 
           the art refrigerator peeks out from the kitchen. 

           Jake, no longer clean shaven, is sunken on the sofa seat, 
           drinking a beer. His eyes are bloodshot. He gives off an 
           unemployed vibe.

                                 WENDI (O.S.)
                        Can you turn it down? I’m trying to 
                        work.

           Jake goes to look for the remote. He doesn’t look very hard. 
           Wendi watches him, unwilling to help. Finally he looks under 
           his ass and pulls out the remote.

           He motions at an unopened beer.

                                 JAKE
                        Wanna take a break?

                                 WENDI
                        No thank you.

                                 JAKE
                        This came for you.

           Jake points to letter resting beneath the beer. Wendi grabs 
           it. Rips it open. It’s her green card.

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Everyone is dressed in their best gear. They’re all here to 
           impress the big man, the legend, the boss, the billionaire. 

           RUPERT MURDOCH (61), wearing casual beige pants and a button 
           up shirt, like he’s going golfing after this meeting. 

           His TWO ASSISTANTS, HAMISH (25) and YOLANDE (mid 30s) stick 
           to him like Velcro.

           Wendi arrived early and therefore scored the best seat in the 
           house; directly opposite Murdoch. She clutches a thick 
           binder.

                                 HANK
                        Everyone, please take your seats. 

           Everyone puts away their organizers.
                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        This man needs no introduction. 
                        He’s here today to talk about the 
                        future of Star TV and our place in 
                        Chinese Media. Our boss and legend, 
                        Rupert Murdoch. 

           Enthusiastic applause with a few ‘woos’. Murdoch stays 
           seated. Gives an obligatory smile to the crowd. He’s firm and 
           in control.

                                 MURDOCH
                        Hello everyone. I’m sure you’ve all 
                        heard about the Chinese 
                        Government’s recent ban on Star TV 
                        satellite dishes. It’s a shock to 
                        me and it’s definitely a shock to 
                        the company.

           Immediately, Wendi’s hands shoot up. Hank does his best to 
           play down his embarrassment.

           Murdoch points to her.

                                 MURDOCH (CONT’D)
                        Yes?

                                 WENDI
                        Hi Mr Murdoch. My name is Wendi 
                        Deng and I’m a junior sales 
                        executive here at Star TV. As the 
                        only Chinese woman working at this 
                        office. I just want to clarify one 
                        thing. Did you offend the second in 
                        command to Jiang Zemin last summer 
                        in Shanghai?

           Hank’s forehead begins to sweat. His eyes dart to Murdoch who 
           seems relaxed. Almost amused at what is happening.

                                 MURDOCH
                        Miss Deng. Firstly, I’m sorry to 
                        hear you are the only Chinese woman 
                        working for my company. That needs 
                        to change. Secondly, I am well 
                        versed in business affairs in 
                        China. If I did offend Li Peng, it 
                        was because my speech writer was a 
                        moron and he had no idea how 
                        business works in China. 

                                 WENDI
                        So should your speech writer draft 
                        out an apology?
                                 MURDOCH
                        It is too late for an apology at 
                        this point Miss Deng.

           Wendi shifts in her seat, a little wary about what she’s 
           about to ask next.

                                 WENDI
                        So what about our jobs? If there’s 
                        no possible way of salvaging the 
                        satellite dishes, will the company 
                        downsize?

           A nervous Hank fiddles with his suit pants underneath the 
           table. He avoids the eye contact of every employee sitting in 
           the room.

           A long and drawn out pause.

                                 MURDOCH
                        There will be layoffs, yes.

           The room bursts to life with whispers and panic.

           Wendi slams open her binder with one swift motion.

                                 WENDI
                        I thought so. Which is why I came 
                        up with 3 plans on how to keep 
                        company growth and maintain our 
                        stake in the Chinese market. I am 
                        available to speak to you privately 
                        after this meeting if you are 
                        interested.

           Wendi stares directly into Murdoch’s eyes. He’s never met 
           someone so young and audacious before. 

           INT. HANK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hank is pacing around the room in a fit of rage. Wendi sits 
           patiently on a sofa, watching him make up his mind.

                                 HANK
                        I should fire you right now.

                                 WENDI
                        Why don’t you?

                                 HANK
                        You’re fired.

           Wendi hops up from the sofa.
                                 WENDI
                        Ok.

                                 HANK
                        No, wait. Sit down.

           Wendi sits back down. Hank puffs out his chest. 

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        You can’t do that. You work for ME 
                        do you understand? You do what I 
                        tell you to do. You don’t come into 
                        MY board room and ask MY boss if 
                        we’re doing layoffs.

                                 WENDI
                        I wanted to help. I have been 
                        working on these plans. 

                                 HANK
                        You can’t surprise me like that. I 
                        need to know everything you are 
                        working on.

           Hank resumes his chair behind the desk. He leans forward.

                                 HANK (CONT’D)
                        This entire office looks to me to 
                        be their leader. I need to know 
                        what’s going on at ALL TIMES. Do 
                        you understand?

                                 WENDI
                        Sure.

           A long pause. Hank’s ego is still recovering. 

                                 HANK
                        Rupert wants to speak with you. 
                        Tonight 8 o’clock at Linq.

           A smile spreads quickly across her face.

           EXT. WENDI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wendi waits for a cab. She’s in a fancy yet restrained, black 
           dress. The cool, summer breeze caresses her long black hair. 

           Behind her, through the window, we see the television blaring 
           against the white walls. And a shadow of a man we can only 
           presume to be Jake, watching with a beer. 
           EXT. LINQ RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A quiet and dark building with no signs. 

           Wendi’s hesitant to knock and stands there for about a 
           minute, contemplating whether or not this is the right place.

           Finally, she knocks. One KNOCK and the door slowly opens. We 
           hear the crowds and laughter emanate from within.

           INT. LINQ RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A large Asian inspired private room. Paintings of golden 
           dragons adorn the walls.

           Rupert turns to their stylish PRIVATE WAITER (20s)--

                                 RUPERT
                        Let’s get the usual banquet. For 
                        three.

           Wendi picks up her chopsticks. They’re made of jade. 

                                 WAITER
                        Very good, sir.

                                 RUPERT
                            (to Wendi)
                        You know, in my years in this 
                        business, I’ve never had a stranger 
                        speak to me like that before. About 
                        my business.

                                 WENDI
                        I’m sorry, sir.

                                 RUPERT
                        Don’t apologize. And never call me 
                        sir.

           Wendi is suddenly at ease. Murdoch seems relaxed, almost 
           conversational.

                                 RUPERT(CONT’D)
                        It’s refreshing to know you’re not 
                        afraid of me.

                                 WENDI
                        No si----

           Wendi stops herself from saying sir. 
                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I want to make you money. 

                                 RUPERT
                        We can both agree on that.

                                 WENDI
                        There is so much in the Chinese 
                        market you’re not tapping into.

                                 RUPERT
                        And what do you propose Miss Deng?

                                 WENDI
                        The biggest hurdle in China is 
                        censorship. You will not win with 
                        Western shows. You must invest in 
                        Chinese content. You were trying to 
                        control the Chinese market by 
                        having the most satellite dishes. 
                        Now, the government has banned Star 
                        TV dishes. Use the remaining dishes 
                        to broadcast Chinese shows. Not 
                        this American bullshit.

           Rupert listens, thinking intensely. 

                                 RUPERT
                        What’s your background Miss Deng?

                                 WENDI
                        I was born in China.

                                 RUPERT
                        Your parents?

                                 WENDI
                        They were factory workers. 

                                 RUPERT
                        You’ve seen China grow from the 
                        bottom up. 

                                 WENDI
                        Yes.

                                 RUPERT
                        What brought you to America?

                                 WENDI
                        School.

                                 RUPERT
                        What else?
           Pause.

                                 WENDI
                        Opportunity.

                                 RUPERT
                        I’m looking for a translator to 
                        accompany me on my next trip to 
                        China. I would like for you to be 
                        my translator. 

           Her head is exploding, but her face remains calm.

                                 RUPERT (CONT’D)
                        What do you say?

           Wendi can barely see straight. She hardly registers the 
           assistant coming inside and pouring everyone a shot of hot 
           rice wine. 

           This is what pure bliss feels like.

           INT. WENDI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wendi tip toes inside the bedroom. Jake snores loudly with 
           his phone still in his hand.

           She makes a banging noise on purpose - hoping to wake him. He 
           just snores louder.

           Wendi BANGS again. Louder. Jake turns in his sleep, still 
           dreaming.

           Wendi leans into Jake’s ear--

                                 WENDI
                        JAKE. Wake up.

           Jake’s eyes open. 

                                 JAKE
                        What’s wrong? Is everything ok?

                                 WENDI
                        Guess what?

           Jake moans.

                                 JAKE
                        Tell me tomorrow.

           Wendi turns on the lights. Jake shields his eyes.
                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Turn it off!

                                 WENDI
                        Listen! I’m going to be Rupert 
                        Murdoch’s personal translator.

                                 JAKE
                        That’s great. Can you just turn off 
                        the light?

                                 WENDI
                        Did you hear me?

                                 JAKE
                        Yes, I heard you. That’s fantastic.

           Jake walks over to the light switch like a zombie. Turns off 
           the light. He collapses back on the bed.

           Wendi turns the lights back on. 

                                 WENDI
                        We need to talk.

                                 JAKE
                        Not tonight, please.

                                 WENDI
                        I want a divorce.

           Jake sits up straight, facing his wife who’s dressed up like 
           a movie star.

           EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - EVENING

           Murdoch’s private plane sits on the tarmac, ready for take 
           off. At $84 million dollars in value, this luxury plane puts 
           all other luxury planes to shame.

           INT. MURDOCH’S PRIVATE PLANE - CONTINUOUS

           Three HOSTESSES fuss over the placement of cushions on the 
           leather couches. 

                                 HOSTESS 1
                        Mr Murdoch likes whiskey near his 
                        chair. 

           Wendi lays across two chairs, marvelling at the grandeur.
           The air suddenly grows tense.

           Wendi straightens up.

           Rupert Murdoch appears with his long line of lawyers, 
           assistants and business associates. Intimidating.

                                 RUPERT
                        Wendi. Welcome.  

           To his assistant--

                                 RUPERT (CONT’D)
                        Wendi will sit by me. 

           EXT. TARMAC - SHANGHAI - SUNSET

           If you can look past the smog, Shanghai actually delivers a 
           pretty decent sunset. 

           On the tarmac--three limousines await Murdoch and his crew.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

           Hamish immediately hands Rupert his missed call messages and 
           today’s newspapers from all of his publications.

           ROGER AILES (59), bushy eyebrows on a round face sit opposite 
           Wendi.

           The car is silent as Rupert rifles through his papers. 

           Wendi gets a weird vibe from Roger. He’s sizing her up and 
           down, like she doesn’t belong here.

                                 ROGER
                        Where in China are you from, Wendi?

                                 WENDI
                        Grew up in Guangzhou.

                                 ROGER
                        Is that a wealthy city?

                                 WENDI
                        Yes it is. But I grew up very poor, 
                        if that’s what you’re asking. I had 
                        to work very hard to get to where I 
                        am.

           Tense atmosphere.
           Having been completely oblivious to the entire interaction--
           Rupert looks up--

                                 RUPERT
                        Wendi, you will accompany me to 
                        dinner with the communications 
                        minister tonight. 

           Hamish whispers to Wendi--

                                 HAMISH
                        A driver will pick you up at 7pm 
                        sharp. Please dress appropriately. 

                                 ROGER
                        Didn’t Anna call before? You should 
                        call your wife back eh Rupert?

                                 MURDOCH
                        I’ll call her later. There’s no 
                        rush.

           Rupert returns to his papers. 

           EXT. LIMOUSINE/MARRIOT HOTEL - DAY

           Wendi is dropped off in front of the Marriot. It’s opulence 
           intimidates anyone who doesn’t view hundred dollar bills as 
           spare change.

           A DOORMAN with a top hat opens the door with a bow--

           INT. MARRIOT LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Wives wrapped in fur coats. Men giving $500 tips. Marble 
           ceilings and floors. 

           Wendi is immediately led into the elevator by her own private 
           CONCIERGE (35).

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           The floors zoom by. One after the other until she realizes 
           she is being taken to the presidential suite.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Here we are miss. Your bags should 
                        already be in your room. 

           Wendi steps out into--
           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A lavishly decorated space, with 60s Shanghai chic as the 
           theme. Beautiful oak furniture and wall panels. A giant 
           chandelier as the centerpiece. 

           Wendi walks into the--

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A king sized bed made from the same delicate oak. The room 
           looks fit for a queen. 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        You and Mr Murdoch share the same 
                        elevator. But his suite is to the 
                        left whereas yours is to the right. 

           As soon as the concierge leaves, Wendi jumps onto the bed and 
           curls herself around the sheets. She grabs a pillow and 
           smells its freshly washed scent. Her head’s on cloud nine.

           The room is larger than her entire house back in China. It 
           could house a family of 10 and still have room. 

           Wendi runs into the--

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A giant, marble bathtub gleams in the centre of the room. 
           Wendi disappears and reappears completely naked. She hops 
           into the bathtub and turns on the tap. She leans back, 
           feeling the warm water against her skin. 

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wendi holds up her slightly old business dresses to the 
           mirror. Unsatisfied, she puts both options down and takes out 
           a third option. Still not satisfactory. 

           Her father is on speaker phone.

                                 WENDI
                        Did you get the check?

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        Yes, but we’ve told you a thousand 
                        times. Keep the money for yourself. 
                        Don’t waste it on us!

           In the background, we hear severe coughing from someone.
                                 DEHUI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re on a very important 
                        business trip but your mother and I 
                        would love it if you could take 
                        some time off to visit us. 

           Beat.

                                 DEHUI (CONT’D)
                        It would mean a lot if you came 
                        home, Wen Ge. Your mother and I 
                        miss you very much.

                                 WENDI
                        It’s a little difficult right now. 
                        I’m finally hitting a stride with 
                        work. 

                                 DEHUI
                        Can you come after the trip?

                                 WENDI
                        I can’t. I’m too busy, dad. 

           Wendi tries on her first dress. In her eyes, it’s the least 
           tacky. She checks the time.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I have to go ok?

           We hear coughing again. 

           INT. 5 STAR RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The 99th floor. A quiet and respectable atmosphere. Everyone 
           speaks at a moderate volume. 

           Wendi clinks her wine glass with Murdoch and his guest - the 
           communications minister - ZHENG XIAO WEN (late 60s). 

           Zheng’s entire face crinkles when he smiles. He wears The 
           Monkey King cuff links.

                                 WENDI
                        How many grand children do you 
                        have?

                                 ZHENG
                        5 scoundrels!

           Wendi points to his cuff links.
                                 WENDI
                        What’s their favorite show?

                                 ZHENG
                        Monkey King of course!

                                 WENDI
                        Mr Murdoch has 6 grandchildren!

           Wendi whispers something to Murdoch. He reaches into his 
           wallet and brings out a family photo.

                                 ZHENG
                        Wow. A huge family! 

           Wendi and Murdoch exchange a glance. They have Zheng wrapped 
           around their finger. 

                                 WENDI
                        I grew up very poor so we didn’t 
                        have a television set. But my 
                        father used to tell me Monkey King 
                        stories as a child. They gave me 
                        the strength to overcome my bullies 
                        and grow stronger. 

                                 ZHENG
                        Hmmm yes, he has been inspiring 
                        kids for generations. 

                                 WENDI
                        I understand Monkey King is for 
                        sale right now. I would love for 
                        you to put Star TV at the top of 
                        the list. The show has a very 
                        special place in my heart. 

           Zheng nods slowly.

           INT. BLACK SUV - NIGHT

           Wendi and Rupert sit side by side, having just had their 
           first successful meeting. Rupert may not be showing it, but 
           he’s grinning from ear to ear. 

           He notices how old Wendi’s clothes look--

                                 RUPERT
                        You need new clothes.

           Offended--
                                 WENDI
                        I like my clothes, thank you very 
                        much. And on that note, I think you 
                        should change your clothes.

                                 RUPERT
                        Oh? What’s wrong with my clothes?

                                 WENDI
                        They’re old fashioned.

                                 RUPERT
                        I refuse to wear pants that drape 
                        on my bottom.

           Wendi laughs.

                                 WENDI
                        You should at least change your 
                        tie. 

           Wendi slides her hand up and down Murdoch’s tie. Examining 
           the fabric. 

           Murdoch’s phone rings. Ruining the moment. He looks at it and 
           turns it off. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Is everything alright?

                                 RUPERT
                        Yes.

           Rupert’s phone rings again. This time, Wendi catches a 
           glimpse. It’s Murdoch’s wife - ANNA. 

                                 RUPERT (CONT’D)
                        Hello.
                            (listens)
                        Yes, go without me. 
                            (listens)
                        The 14th. 
                            (listens)

           The car slows at a traffic light. Outside, a group of street 
           dancers, hopping around in eccentric costumes and banging 
           drums that shoot sparklers into the sky. 

                                 WENDI
                        Driver! Pull over!

           The driver pulls over to the side--
                                 RUPERT
                        Anna, I’m about to step into a 
                        meeting--

           Wendi opens the door and jumps out. She beckons for Rupert to 
           follow.

                                 RUPERT (CONT’D)
                            (into phone)
                        Love you too.

           Rupert’s eyes are on Wendi as he chases after her.

           EXT. SHANGHAI STREETS - NIGHT

           Wendi drags Rupert through the crowded streets of Shanghai. 
           The lights overwhelm Rupert. Trailing behind them are his two 
           security guards. 

           The street performers are now twirling their drum sticks that 
           are on fire. They do a handstand while holding the flaming 
           sticks between their teeth. 

           Rupert hasn’t felt this free in a long time. He claps along 
           to the music, hypnotized by Wendi’s laughter.

           EXT. TIE SHOP - NIGHT

           A small, tie cart with an OLD MAN (80s) operating from 
           inside. The old man takes a long drag of his cigarette, 
           coughs loudly and spits out his cart.

           Wendi holds up a Roberto Cavalli tie to Rupert’s neck. It’s 
           gold with navy stripes.

                                 WENDI
                        Mmmm...too old.

                                 RUPERT
                        I think it looks handsome.

           Wendi looks through the rack. Picks out a light blue tie. 

                                 RUPERT (CONT’D)
                        Too blue.

                                 WENDI
                        We can compromise.

           Wendi turns to the old man and begins to haggle. 

           Off Rupert’s amused face--
                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Aiyah...too expensive. I’m buying 
                        2. $20

                                 OLD MAN
                        I gotta feed my family. $40.

                                 WENDI
                        I know how much they cost. They’re 
                        fake. $20

                                 OLD MAN
                        $35 is the best I can do.

                                 WENDI
                        My mother works in these factories. 
                        She can get it for me for $10!

                                 OLD MAN
                        I have to make some money!

           Wendi begins to walk away. Rupert follows suit. 

           They hear the old man’s cane get closer and closer.

                                 OLD MAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey hey! $20 $20.

           Wendi hands over $20 renmenbi. 

           Murdoch is impressed.

                                 RUPERT
                        He didn’t look very happy.

                                 WENDI
                        It’s all a front. Chinese people 
                        will never show you how they truly 
                        feel.

           Rupert hands the ties over to his security guards.

           EXT. PIER OVERLOOKING THE BUND - NIGHT

           The sun sets behind the Bund - a technological island 
           brimming with the tallest buildings in the world. 

           Wendi and Rupert stroll the scenic route, looking out at the 
           yellow moon. They each cradle a Tsingtao beer. 
                                 WENDI
                        I really think purchasing Monkey 
                        King is the first step to gaining a 
                        loyal Chinese following.

                                 RUPERT
                        You know I’ve been chasing that 
                        show for months. And after one 
                        meeting, you bump us straight to 
                        the top.

                                 WENDI
                        You needed a Chinese woman’s touch.

                                 RUPERT
                        Have you always been this 
                        ambitious?

                                 WENDI
                        Yes.

                                 RUPERT
                        Why did you leave China? 

                                 WENDI
                        I wanted a western husband.

           Wendi jokes. 

                                 RUPERT
                        Have you found one?

                                 WENDI
                        Not yet. 

           Wendi takes a sip of her beer. Rupert studies her, unsure if 
           Wendi is flirting or not. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        When you come from nothing,
                        being ambitious means never having 
                        to go back to that.

           They continue to walk in the dimming light. 

           EXT. MARRIOT HOTEL - NIGHT

           The limousine pulls up to the paparazzi SNAPPING and 
           screaming Murdoch’s name. 

           Hamish ushers his boss and Wendi through the crowd.
           INT. MARRIOT LOBBY - NIGHT

           The paparazzi bang against the winding doors, squishing their 
           noses to the glass for a better look. 

           Hamish carries Rupert’s array of shopping bags and hands over 
           his schedule for the next day. 

                                 HAMISH
                        Tomorrow, you have lunch with the 
                        Transport minister. He wants to 
                        know why you published that article 
                        about him and his second wife--

           Murdoch is not listening. Instead, he’s fixated on Wendi. 
           He’s completely infatuated.

           INT. MARRIOT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Hamish continues to speak as Rupert opens the elevator doors 
           for Wendi. 

                                 WENDI
                        Thank you.

           Murdoch presses the top floor. 

                                 HAMISH
                        Sir? Sir?

                                 RUPERT
                        Hm. Yes?

                                 HAMISH
                        Is 7am a good time for pick-up?

                                 RUPERT
                        Yes.

           Wendi looks in one of the shopping bags. Fishes out the light 
           blue tie.

           She undoes Rupert’s current tie. Wraps the younger, hipper 
           tie onto his neck. She stands back. Marvels at the 
           difference.

                                 WENDI
                        I’ll be working out in the morning. 
                        Would you care to join me?

                                 RUPERT
                        What time?
                                 WENDI
                        Around 7.

                                 RUPERT
                            (to Hamish)
                        Change my pick up time to 8.

           On Murdoch’s face as he exits the elevator--

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

           Murdoch opens the door to his suite. Wendi opens her door. 
           Hamish follows Murdoch in, still talking a mile a minute.

                                 HAMISH
                        But sir, you haven’t worked out in 
                        years...

                                 RUPERT
                            (ignoring Hamish)
                        Good night.

                                 WENDI
                        Good night.

           They close their doors simultaneously. 

           INT. WENDI’S SUITE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

           Wendi lays down on the bed and kicks off her shoes. 

           She’s in a romantic daze. 

           She spreads her arms out like she’s flying. Turns to see the 
           entire city of Shanghai, dazzling outside her window. A light 
           seems to sparkle extra bright. She looks closer, it’s coming 
           from inside her room. It’s the answering machine.

           Wendi presses the messages button--

                                 RECORDING 
                        Hi Wen Ge. It’s Mei. Dad didn’t 
                        want to tell you, but mom has 
                        cancer. You need to come home right 
                        now. The doctor says she has 2 
                        weeks.
                            (Pause)
                        Call me.

           Wendi looks at the telephone and then back outside to the 
           lights of Shanghai. The view is intoxicating.
           She can’t let this opportunity slip by. 

           Feeling just a hint of guilt, Wendi deletes the message. 

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. $50M BOAT OFF HUDSON RIVER - DAY

           We are on a luxurious boat floating along the East River off 
           Manhattan; a party in full swing. The world’s wealthiest men 
           and their gorgeous wives gossip among themselves as a four-
           piece string quartet strum elegantly to the side. 

           Suddenly the music drifts off. An anticipatory hush fills the 
           room. 

           The quartet begins to play the wedding march. 

                                June 25th 1999

           An unknown woman steps into view. We do not see her face, 
           just her extravagant wedding dress. Her long veil cascades on 
           the wooden boards.

           The woman is revealed to be Wendi. Her makeup is 
           sophisticated and simple. 

           Wendi (now 29) beckons for a YOUNG ASSISTANT, 23, hair in a 
           ponytail, wearing an ear piece. 

                                 WENDI
                            (whispers)
                        There is a woman near the front 
                        wearing white. 

           The assistant knows what to do. A momentary commotion. The 
           woman is removed and taken inside.

           Wendi resumes her walk. Up ahead, Rupert Murdoch (68) stands 
           in a suit way too expensive to comprehend.

           Wendi steps up to face her soon to be husband. The smile on 
           her face is priceless. This is the moment she becomes queen.

           Wendi’s family watches on from the back row. The odd ones 
           out. Her mother is missing. 

                                                               CUT TO:
           INT. HOTEL PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT

           It is their wedding night and Rupert makes love to Wendi. It 
           is not the love making that blows peoples’ minds. It’s soft, 
           calm and a little boring. 

           Wendi grows impatient. She jumps on top and pushes Rupert 
           down against the pillow. Her youth revitalizes Rupert. 

                                                              LATER...

           Wendi stares at the ceiling as the most powerful man in the 
           world falls asleep in her arms.

           MONTAGE - VARIOUS

           - Wendi decorates her new Soho Loft Apartment. She’s still 
           new to this grandeur.

           - New York Newsstand. Her face is plastered on the cover of 
           Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Vogue all introducing her as 
           “MRS RUPERT MURDOCH”. 

           - In the front row at NY fashion week. Anna Wintour (51, 
           Editor-in-Chief of Vogue) whispers something in Wendi’s ear. 
           The lights and cameras are dazzling. 

           - Wendi moves into her new corner office at Star TV. She 
           looks out at the skyline of Los Angeles. Endless possibility.

           - Wendi furnishes their Carmel Ranch. She’s rocking a new bob 
           haircut. More confidence. She installs a state of the art 
           fridge as the centerpiece to her kitchen.

           - Decked out in a dark, red gown. Wendi hooks arms with her 
           new best friend, NICOLE KIDMAN. Her hair is different again. 
           Blowing kisses on the red carpet. A professional now.

           - Wendi has lost a lot of weight. She’s almost 
           unrecognizable. We see her shouting at an interior decorator. 
           Her office has grown in size and grandeur.

           - With another new haircut, she waves her two assistants 
           away. The biggest refrigerator you’ve ever seen sits in her 
           SOHO kitchen. 

           END OF MONTAGE.

           INT. SOHO MANSION - NYC - DAY

                                    June 2001
           The Soho Mansion is completely furnished. The interior design 
           looks modern and impeccable. 

           Wendi, rocks another new haircut.

           She motions for a WORKER to hang a Jackson Pollock on the 
           wall. 

                                 WENDI
                        Hurry up. What am I pay you for?

           She looks over to Rupert who is in his office in hysterics at 
           a joke his MAID (early 20s) just told. A hint of jealousy.

           She motions for a second painting to be put up.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        It’s too small. 

           The worker nods. Scurries away to call his boss. 

           Rupert’s old friend - Roger Ailes (now 61), disappears inside 
           Rupert’s office.

           He sees Wendi but doesn’t say hi.

           INT. SOHO MANSION - NYC - LATER THAT EVENING

           Wendi gets her nails painted while receiving a back massage.

           Roger reappears from Rupert’s office.

                                 ROGER
                            (to Rupert)
                        Yes, yes, see you Friday.

                                 WENDI
                        Hi Roger. Care to stay for dinner? 
                        We have a chef flying in from 
                        Osaka.

                                 ROGER
                        No, thank you. I hate Japanese 
                        food.

                                 WENDI
                        He’s cooking us Greek.

           Roger manages a smile.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Did you see me earlier?
                                 ROGER
                        Excuse me?

                                 WENDI
                        When you arrived earlier today. Did 
                        you see me?

                                 ROGER
                        I believe so.

                                 WENDI
                        Why didn’t you say hi?

                                 ROGER
                        You looked so busy spending 
                        Rupert’s money, I didn’t want to 
                        disturb you.

           Roger turns to leave.

                                 WENDI
                        Speaking of my husband’s money. 
                        What was Fox News’ losses last 
                        financial year? 22 million and 
                        counting?

                                 ROGER
                        We have our ups and downs but I’ve 
                        been in this industry a long time. 
                        We always bounce back.

                                 WENDI
                        You sure about that? According to 
                        my reviews, Fox News has been 
                        losing money pretty consistently 
                        for the last 5 years. That doesn’t 
                        sound like you’ll be bouncing back 
                        any time soon. 

                                 ROGER
                        No need to strain your pretty, 
                        little head. Fox is doing just 
                        fine. You just stick to what you’re 
                        good at. 

           He points to the newly installed Pollock painting?

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        An original?

           Wendi nods.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Expensive.
           Roger turns to leave.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                            (shouts)
                        Good night Rupert. Always a 
                        pleasure.

           The door SLAMS shut.

           INT. EVENING BENEFIT - NIGHT

           Velvet table clothes draped over round tables. Just another 
           elite benefit. Open bar, fancy people.

           On stage, a swanky HOST (40s) introduces the main speaker.

                                 HOST
                        With his terrible physique and bald 
                        patches, you’d never guess that 
                        he’s our youngest Prime Minister 
                        since 1812. 

           The crowd laughs.

                                 HOST (CONT’D)
                        But he is. And God do we hate him 
                        for being our leader and looking so 
                        good doing it. To launch tonight’s 
                        JUSTICE Human Rights Gala, please 
                        welcome Tony Blair!

           The crowd erupts.

           INT. EVENING BENEFIT - LATER

           Packed with the 1%, drinking from bottles of champagne, 
           smoking, toasting, shouting to be heard.

           Wendi speaks to Murdoch’s LAWYER, LON JACOBS (44), 
           trustworthy with a laid back attitude.

                                 WENDI
                        How are the kids?

                                 LON
                        Just got back from the Caribbean 
                        actually! I’m completely sunburnt! 
                        My nose is peeling.

           Cutting to the chase--
                                 WENDI
                        If I were to fire any house staff 
                        under the age of 40--

                                 LON
                        That would be illegal. But if you 
                        don’t mention the age as a 
                        reason...I guess you can get away 
                        with it. Just don’t fire them all 
                        at once.

           Wendi looks over to Rupert who is speaking with Tony. Tony 
           waves to her. She smiles. 

                                 WENDI
                        How is the acquisition coming 
                        along?

                                 LON
                        Not long now.

                                 WENDI
                        Has Rupert appointed a CEO yet?

                                 LON
                        It will most likely be Lachlan. 

           Wendi contemplates this news.

           Tony walks over, greets her with a kiss on the cheek.

           INT. WENDI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wendi is on her side as Murdoch makes love to her. It’s slow 
           and dreary, like a rainy London day. 

           Murdoch finishes and cleans Wendi up. Wendi holds Rupert’s 
           head again, just like before. He falls asleep instantly. 

                                 WENDI
                        Rupert?

           Rupert opens his eyes.

                                 RUPERT
                        Hm?

                                 WENDI
                        I want to sit on the board for 
                        Myspace China.

                                 RUPERT
                        The acquisition’s not final yet.
                                 WENDI
                        When it’s acquired. I want to be 
                        partners with Lachlan. 

           Rupert is more awake now.

                                 RUPERT
                        We’ll talk about this tomorrow.

                                 WENDI
                        No, now.

                                 RUPERT
                        Lachlan won’t be happy.

                                 WENDI
                        I don’t give a shit.

                                 RUPERT
                        What about Star TV?

                                 WENDI
                        I can do both.

                                 RUPERT
                        This is a huge takeover. I’m not 
                        sure you’re han--

                                 WENDI
                        You’re dealing with the Chinese. I 
                        know how my people think.

                                 RUPERT
                        We can talk about this tomorrow 
                        morning.

           Wendi doesn’t answer.

                                 RUPERT (CONT’D)
                        Has the renovations for the games 
                        room been completed?

                                 WENDI
                        I don’t fucking know. I’m not your 
                        interior designer. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Wendi picks at a bowl of fruit at the end of a long dining 
           table. 

           A young maid, MARIA, 28, pretty with long brown lashes, 
           clears the table.
                                 WENDI
                        Do me a favor and knock on Rupert’s 
                        door. Ask Lachlan if he needs a 
                        coffee and then leave the door 
                        slightly open. 

           Maria nods diligently.

           Wendi watches Maria do just that.

           Wendi begins to eavesdrop. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        Dad, she’s just bored. 

           Beat.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        She’s a conniving gold digger. When 
                        are you gonna fucking see that?

           Rupert doesn’t speak. 

           Wendi gets up from her chair. Knocks quietly on the door.

                                 RUPERT (O.S.)
                        Come in.

           INT. RUPERT’S HOME OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Wendi floats in, taking Lachlan by surprise.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Hi Wendi.

                                 WENDI
                        How’s Sarah?

                                 LACHLAN
                        She’s pregnant.

                                 WENDI
                        Congratulations! And 
                        congratulations to us! I’m very 
                        excited to be working together on 
                        launching MySpace in China.

                                 LACHLAN
                        That’s not going to happen, Wendi.
                                 WENDI
                        I don’t think you can handle the 
                        expansion by yourself, Lachlan. Not 
                        with your history.

                                 LACHLAN
                        And what gives you the right to run 
                        MySpace? 

                                 WENDI
                        I know the Chinese. I have been 
                        doing business in China my entire 
                        life. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        This is the most important launch 
                        at Newscorp right now. My dad 
                        bought it for 580 million dollars. 
                        He’s not about to let some Chinese 
                        woman off the streets run this 
                        business to the ground. Tell her 
                        dad.

           Lachlan glares at Rupert who says nothing.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           Back in the dining room, Maria collect’s Wendi’s plates.

           Wendi, triumphant, sips her coffee.

           We hear a muffled screaming match coming from Rupert’s 
           office.

                                 WENDI
                        Maria? Finish what you are doing 
                        and then you may go. We no longer 
                        require your services.

           Maria is frozen.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        You heard me. Finish what you’re 
                        doing. Go on.

           Maria doesn’t dare to speak back. She collects the remaining 
           plates. They make clanking sounds as her hand shakes, walking 
           away. 
           INT. WENDI AND RUPERT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rupert is in bed. Dressed in silk pyjamas, typing away on his 
           laptop. His glasses rests gently on his nose bridge.

           Wendi walks in from the ensuite. She’s dressed in a black, 
           lacy dress that’s almost see through.

           Without looking up--

                                 RUPERT
                        Who are the new maids?

                                 WENDI
                        The old ones weren’t working out.

           Rupert looks up. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Do you like it?

           Rupert smiles.

           She climbs into bed next to him. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I want a child, Rupert. 

           Rupert stares at Wendi, mesmerized by her beauty but also 
           hesitant. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I want us to have a child.

                                 RUPERT
                        Where is this coming from?

                                 WENDI
                        I’m 31. I want to have a child with 
                        you before it’s too late. I want 
                        our own little family. Away from 
                        everyone else. 

           Wendi touches Rupert’s cheek. It’s tender. Rupert kisses 
           Wendi’s hand and pulls her in. 

           INT. MYSPACE LAUNCH PARTY - NIGHT

           Through the crowd, Lachlan watches Wendi and Rupert kiss 
           cheeks with Tony Blair and his wife, CHERIE (47). 

           Cherie opens her mouth in shock. Touches Wendi’s stomach. A 
           little bump is already starting to form.
           LATER...

           Wendi is sipping a mocktail by the bar. Lachlan walks over.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Myspace only received an initial 
                        600,000 sign ups in China. 

                                 WENDI
                        Just mainland or including Hong 
                        Kong?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Everything.

           Wendi thinks.

                                 WENDI
                        What did Baidu get?

                                 LACHLAN
                        20 million sign ups.

                                 WENDI
                        That’s easy. We just implement what 
                        we talked about.

                                 LACHLAN
                        No. It’ll alienate the audience.

                                 WENDI
                        Trust me. I know the Chinese 
                        market. They won’t care. They’re 
                        all consumers at heart. 

           Wendi raises her glass.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let’s celebrate!

           PRE-LAP of crowd applause--

           INT. CHINESE TALK SHOW - NIGHT

           A Chinese Oprah style show with spunk. Mostly women in the 
           audience. 

           The host, WANG TAO (28), peppy and energetic. Wears a crisp, 
           black suit with a cute bow tie. He has a face for showbiz. 

                                 HOST
                        Welcome to the first episode of 
                        Dialogue in the new year. 
           A HUGE banner: 2002, YEAR OF THE HORSE drops from the stage. 
           Confetti and balloons fall from the ceiling. 

                                 WANG TAO
                        Let’s bring out our first guest! 
                        She needs no introduction. A fierce 
                        business woman and wife to Rupert 
                        Murdoch. Wendi Deng!

           The audience stands up to cheer--

           Wendi as fashionable as always, walks out on stage with 
           grace. She thrives in the spotlight. 

                                 WANG TAO (CONT’D)
                        Wow. What a reception! Thank you 
                        for being here tonight!

                                 WENDI
                        What a cute bow tie!

           Wang Tao takes it off.

                                 WANG TAO
                        Here! It’s yours!

           He hands it to Wendi. Immediately, a producer runs on stage. 
           Hands him a duplicate tie. 

                                 WANG TAO (CONT’D)
                        I have a million more!

           Wendi puts it on. Now they have matching bow ties. The 
           audience are amused.

                                 WANG TAO (CONT’D)
                        Now, you recently launched Myspace 
                        in China. How has it been going?

                                 WENDI
                        It’s been going wonderfully. We 
                        have seen a 12% growth in the last 
                        quarter since our latest addition.

           Crowd applause.

                                 WANG TAO
                        Now this latest addition has been  
                        a little controversial. Can you 
                        tell us a little bit about it?
                                 WENDI
                        Well, our algorithms will play a 
                        specific advertisement tailored to 
                        you, before every video.

                                 WANG TAO
                        Now, many people have complained 
                        that it’s just a scheme for you to 
                        make money. I mean, who wants to be 
                        forced to watch an ad before every 
                        video?

                                 WENDI

           The crowd applauds again.

           EXT. BABY SHOWER POOL PARTY - DAY

           Skinny, gorgeous women lounge around the pool in bikinis, 
           sipping Piña Coladas. The sun reflects off their fake tans.

           They all surround Wendi, who sits back on a chair, heavily 
           pregnant. Everyone is dying to congratulate her or to just be 
           near her. 

           JILL (45), leathery skin with bleached blonde hair is lucky 
           enough to be within ear shot.

                                 JILL
                        You are absolutely killing it 
                        honey. My husband is OBSESSED with 
                        Myspace China. 

                                 WENDI
                        Well, tell Peter I am always 
                        looking for investors. And since 
                        he’s such a dear friend, I’d be 
                        willing to cut him a family deal.

                                 JILL
                        He will be thrilled!!

           Jill opens her legs a little.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever had a tuck?
           She’s talking about between her legs.

                                 WENDI
                        A tuck?

                                 JILL
                        I look like a porn star now, I 
                        swear to God. 

           Wendi forces a smile. 

                                 WENDI
                        Excuse me.

           The other girls all try to speak at once.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back ladies. Just going in 
                        to freshen up.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A pile of neatly wrapped presents sit near a window. It’s 
           quiet inside. 

           Wendi picks up the latest issue of The Economist. Headline 
           says “WENDI DENG MURDOCH, THE FACE OF MYSPACE”. 

           A young maid, Maria, who looks awfully familiar, waters a 
           plant nearby.

                                 WENDI
                        Didn’t I fire you?

                                 MARIA
                        Yes ma’am. But Mr Murdoch hired us 
                        back. 

                                 WENDI
                        Who is us?

                                 MARIA
                        The ones who were let go, ma’am.

           The maid walks off to resume her chores. Wendi is furious. 

           As soon as Murdoch is off the phone, Wendi marches into--

           INT. MURDOCH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rupert raises a finger to silence her. He’s thinking. 
           Wendi won’t be treated this way. 

                                 WENDI
                        Don’t treat me like one of your 
                        lawyers. 

           Rupert jots something down in a calculator. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Why did you rehire the maids I 
                        fired?

                                 RUPERT
                        I didn’t feel the need to be sued. 

                                 WENDI
                        I fired them under the impression 
                        that they were no longer needed.

                                 RUPERT
                        Well, by firing everyone under the 
                        age of 35, they formed a group who 
                        had a very strong case against me. 
                        And I just don’t need the extra 
                        stress right now. 

                                 WENDI
                        Who do you have to thank for the 
                        recent profit margins? 

                                 RUPERT
                        You made a smart call with the 
                        advertising.

                                 WENDI
                        Who is on the cover of The 
                        Economist?

           Rupert gestures to her. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Don’t question me again, Rupert. 
                        Fire them.

           Rupert sighs.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Wendi in yet another evening gown. Her baby bump is bigger 
           than ever.

           She is surrounded by three assistants. Murdoch only has 
           Hamish.
                                 ASSISTANT 2
                        Mrs Deng, it’s your dad’s birthday 
                        tomorrow.

                                 WENDI
                        Why are you telling me?

                                 ASSISTANT 2
                        Did you want to send him a gift?

                                 WENDI
                        That’s your job isn’t it?

           Feeling stupid, the assistant nods.

           EXT. CHARITY EVENT FOR AIDS - NIGHT

           The car pulls up to a decked out building, bustling with 
           paparazzi. 

           Wendi poses, smiling for the cameras.

           INT. HALL - NIGHT

           A giant hall with guests seated at dinner tables, swirling 
           their wines and comparing thousand dollar watches. 

           On stage - HUGH JACKMAN speaks, oozing charisma and charm.

                                 HUGH JACKMAN
                        We started this fund just 5 years 
                        ago. And this year, thanks to you 
                        all, we have raised over 30 million 
                        dollars to help fight the spread of 
                        HIV in developing nations. Now I 
                        want to bring someone up here who 
                        is very special to my heart. I 
                        first met her 2 years ago in 
                        Somalia. I held her at birth and 
                        she was the most beautiful girl I 
                        had ever seen. She was born with 
                        HIV and has been fighting the 
                        disease since her birth. But thanks 
                        to your donations, she will now get 
                        the help she needs. Please welcome 
                        to the stage - Jamilah Omar. 

           We PAN along the crowd until we see a particularly crowded 
           area. 

           A line of celebrities and millionaires have lined up to shake 
           JAMILAH’S hand and take selfies. 
           Jamilah (12) sits in a wheelchair, her short hair is spiky, 
           her hands small and bony. 

           Jamilah’s caretaker excuses them and wheels her towards the 
           stage. The camera pans with them until we pause with Wendi 
           and Lachlan backstage.

           INT. BEHIND THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Wendi and Lachlan’s eyes are locked on their phones. They’re 
           both reading the same text.

                                 LACHLAN
                        Fuck. FUCK. FUCK FUCK FUCK.

           Lachlan punches the wall.

                                 WENDI
                        This can’t be right.

           Lachlan’s eyes are bloodshot. Too much cocaine.

                                 LACHLAN
                        I KNEW it was a bad idea.

                                 WENDI
                        This can’t be right.

                                 LACHLAN
                        It is Wendi! These are the numbers. 

           Wendi internalizes her panic. Desperate to hold it together.

           Lachlan’s phone lights up.

           He reads a text.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        FUCK. Peter’s out. 

                                 WENDI
                        What?

                                 LACHLAN
                        Am I mumbling? Peter’s pulling out.

           His phone lights up again.

                                 LACHLAN (CONT’D)
                        So is Miles. And Reece.

           Lachlan’s phone is buzzing non stop now. His teeth grit.
           Wendi’s panic begins to seep through. She looks around, 
           trying to find a seat.

                                 WENDI
                        There’s got to be some sort of 
                        mistake. The shares can’t drop this 
                        suddenly.

                                 LACHLAN
                        The shares were being inflated. The 
                        Chinese were never into those ads. 
                        It was all just inflation after the 
                        takeover. This.
                            (He points to his phone)
                        These are the real numbers. 

           Increasing heart rate. Jelly legs.

                                 WENDI
                        It’s ok. We can get rid of the 
                        advertising then. 

                                 LACHLAN
                        We can’t just get rid of 
                        advertising! That’s our primary 
                        source of revenue. God, why did I 
                        listen to you...

                                 WENDI
                        It’s ok. It’s ok. It’s ok--

           Suddenly--SPLAT. Wendi looks down. Her water has broken. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Oh God.

           Heart pounding. Everything’s suddenly gone quiet. Slow.

           Lachlan helps steady Wendi. Wendi’s vision goes in and out of 
           focus. She barely registers a group of men carrying her 
           outside...

           Her eyes, darting around...

           She feels the floor drop out underneath.

           Black.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Things are calm. A heart monitor beeps quietly. Wendi’s eyes 
           open to a NURSE (60) smiling down on her. 
           Wendi tries to sit up. Groans.

                                 NURSE
                        Rest Mrs Deng. You need rest.

           The nurse pushes her back onto her back.

                                 WENDI
                        What’s the share price?

           Delirious.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m sorry ma’am?

           More conscious.

                                 WENDI
                        Where is she?

                                 NURSE
                        She’s with her daddy. 

                                 WENDI
                        Let me see her.

           The nurse disappears. 

           Seconds later, Rupert walks in with the baby cradling in his 
           arms. His expression is tender. Loving.

           He hands the baby to Wendi.

           Wendi looks down at her tiny face and smiles. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Grace. 

           Wendi’s sweat infused hair falls onto the baby’s face. GRACE 
           tries to catch it with her mouth, then with her tiny hands.

           Wendi looks up to find Rupert laughing. 

                                 NURSE
                        You’ll need to sit back Mrs Deng. 
                        The stitches are still fresh. So 
                        I’ll need you to lay back down and 
                        relax. 

           Wendi hands the baby back to Rupert. An unspoken bond. 
           Suddenly, nothing else matters. 

           But then the phone beeps. It’s Rupert’s cell. He takes out 
           his phone and stares at the text. 
           Off Wendi’s worried face--

                                 RUPERT
                        I gotta make some calls.

           Rupert hands the baby to the nurse and walks out the room. 
           And just like that, the moment is gone and the world goes 
           back to how it was.

           INT. WENDI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The news plays on television loudly. Wendi has changed into a 
           see-through slip. She slides into bed and faces Rupert, 
           hoping he’ll notice her sexy wardrobe.

           Rupert doesn’t.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                            (on TV)
                        In recent news, MySpace shares has 
                        suffered another whopping 23% drop. 
                        This is a devastating blow to 
                        Murdoch’s new internet venture--

           Angry-- Wendi switches the TV off. 

           She crawls up next to Rupert’s ear, begins to nibble gently. 

                                 RUPERT
                        I’m tired.

           Wendi doesn’t give up. She continues kissing Rupert’s chest 
           all the way down to his belly button.

           She mounts him, making love to him slowly--

           Suddenly, snoring. 

           Wendi looks down. Rupert is asleep. She’s about to whack his 
           head when--

           The baby monitor bursts to life. We hear soft whimpering and 
           then a baby starts to cry. The crying grows louder and louder 
           until it fills the room completely. 

           Wendi dismounts. 

           The crying continues. Wendi stops and glares at the monitor.

           The crying intensifies. Then--

           Beat.
           The crying slows to a sob. We hear Mrs Chu whisper something 
           to the baby. She begins to hum quietly. 

           Defeated, Wendi switches off the monitor. Rupert’s snoring 
           escalates. 

                                 HOST (PRE-LAP)
                        Welcome to the show, RUPERT MURDOCH 
                        AND OUR VERY OWN, WENDI DENG!!

           INT. CHINESE TALK SHOW - NIGHT

           The crowd erupts in applause. We are back in the studio. This 
           time, Wendi sits beside Rupert, holding hands.

           Behind them on a screen reads: HAPPY NEW YEAR 2003 with 
           electronic fireworks.

                                 WANG TAO
                        We have a returning guest tonight 
                        and guess who she’s brought with 
                        her?

           Rupert waves to the audience. They clap and whistle.

                                 WANG TAO (CONT’D)
                        Thank you both for being here!

                                 WENDI
                        Thank you for having us.

           Wendi and Rupert are still holding hands.

                                 WANG TAO
                        Now, I know you are both very eager 
                        to share this news. And I am 
                        blessed to be the show you chose to 
                        do this on. What is it you want to 
                        share with China and the world?

                                 WENDI
                        I am pregnant!

                                 WANG TAO
                        Again!

                                 WENDI
                        Yes.

           The crowd bursts into applauds. 
                                 WANG TAO
                        Now do you know if it will be a 
                        girl or boy this time?

                                 WENDI
                        We know but we don’t want to share 
                        it just yet!

                                 WANG TAO
                        And who are the famous God parents?

                                 RUPERT
                        My dear friend Tony Blair. 

           A translator on the side translates Rupert’s words.

                                 WANG TAO
                        Now Mr Murdoch. You have some news 
                        yourself about your latest internet 
                        venture.

           Wendi’s smile cracks just a little. But it’s too subtle for 
           the crowd to see.

                                 RUPERT
                        Yes. My wife and son are currently 
                        developing a new strategy to combat 
                        the failed algorithm from before.

                                 WANG TAO
                        What was wrong with it?

                                 RUPERT
                        The Myspace algorithm was showing 
                        advertisements before every video. 
                        Now, there are no more ads!

           The crowd applauds. 

                                 WANG TAO
                            (looks straight into 
                             camera)
                        We’ll hear more about that right 
                        after the break!

           Someone from backstage shouts - CUT.

                                                         CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Wendi in a different dress. Murdoch sits on the furthest end 
           of the car, engrossed on his phone. 
           Wendi stares out the window. Neither are talking. 

                                 RUPERT
                        I’m having you step off the board.

                                 WENDI
                        What?

                                 RUPERT
                        Lachlan has it under control from 
                        here on out.

           Before Wendi can protest any more--

           The car pulls to a stop outside a red carpet. Murdoch grabs 
           Wendi’s hand. 

           She takes a moment to put on her best smile.

           EXT. MANSION GARDENS - NIGHT

           A giant fountain sits in the centre of the front yard. Beds 
           of yellow lilies surround the footpath. The Los Angeles 
           skyline is in the background.

           Jill, the tanned woman from Wendi’s pool party runs up to 
           greet them. A big kiss on both cheeks. She wears a head piece 
           larger than her head.

                                 JILL
                        Look at all the paparazzi! Some 
                        darling must’ve leaked the event!

           Jill pouts at a camera. 

           She leads them towards the mansion in the distance. It’s 
           spectacular.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        Peter is over there. 

           Jill runs off, waving her hand around. 

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        PETER! PETER!

           PETER (57) notices Rupert and Wendi. Excuses himself from his 
           current conversation--

                                 PETER
                        Rupert!

           Kisses Wendi’s cheek.
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Wendi, you look scrumptious. Sorry 
                        about the paparazzi. 
                            (whispers)
                        Jill loves the press.

           Peter has a feminine vibe. In the distance, a young STUD (23) 
           waves at him.

           Peter, desperate to get away--

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Eat and drink. Do what you like. 

           Peter winks at Rupert.

                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me.

           Wendi is finally left alone with her husband.

                                 WENDI
                            (whispers)
                        You don’t get to drop that on me 
                        and then walk away.

                                 RUPERT
                        Don’t make a scene. We’ll talk 
                        about it later.

           Rupert wanders towards the bar. Begins to engage in a 
           conversation with a YOUNGER WOMAN (25), pretty, wearing a 
           short dress. 

           Wendi watches her touch Rupert’s arm. Fuming.

           INT. MANSION LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Wendi waits for Peter to finish flirting with his young stud.

                                 WENDI
                        Peter. Gorgeous party, as always.

                                 PETER
                        Thanks darl. Help yourself to some 
                        Rose Champagne. It’s divine.

                                 WENDI
                        Did Jill talk to you about the 
                        Myspace investment?
                                 PETER
                        Yes she did. I love you but I’m 
                        hosting tonight. Maybe another 
                        time?

           Ignoring his request--

                                 WENDI
                        Did you look at the proposal my 
                        assistant sent you?

                                 PETER
                        Look Wendi, I’m a business man and 
                        I just don’t see this as a good 
                        investment anymore.

                                 WENDI
                        But six months ago, you were 
                        practically begging me to--

                                 PETER
                        Honey...6 months ago, Myspace was 
                        still profitable. It’s shares are 
                        so low right now, it’s practically 
                        a start up.

                                 WENDI
                        Well, that’s the thing I was going 
                        to talk to you about.

           Peter waves to another YOUNG MAN (23), half listening.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        We’re actually selling to Facebook. 
                        So shares are low right now. But as 
                        soon as the merger is finalized, 
                        it’s going to drive share prices 
                        through the roof.

                                 PETER
                        I’m not the right person for this. 
                        I hear Xing Chang right now might 
                        be looking to invest. Stick to the 
                        Chinese. That’s the best I got 
                        right now.

                                 WENDI
                        This is the investment of a 
                        lifetime Peter--

                                 PETER
                            (cuts her off)
                        Look Wendi. I’m a huge fan of 
                        Rupert and I’m a huge fan of yours. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        But please stop asking me to invest 
                        in this sinking ship. It’s 
                        pathetic.

                                 WENDI
                        What’s pathetic is your marriage to 
                        Jill.

                                 PETER
                        Excuse me?

                                 WENDI
                        We all know you’re as gay as Elton 
                        John. 

                                 PETER
                        How dare you?

           Rupert notices the commotion. Makes his way over.

                                 RUPERT
                        What’s the matter?

                                 PETER
                            (to Rupert)
                        You need to sush your wife. She’s 
                        out of line.

                                 RUPERT
                        What did you say Wendi?

           Wendi can feel every pair of eyes side glancing at her.

                                 WENDI
                        I SAID HE’S GAY. HOMOSEXUAL. GAY AS 
                        ELTON JOHN. 

           The crowd gasps.

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Wendi’s shoes are off as she storms the gates. Rupert is 
           nowhere to be seen.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Wendi!

           Tony Blair (50), dressed as dapper as ever, catches up to 
           her. 

                                 TONY
                        You caused quite a commotion back 
                        there.
           Wendi continues storming.

                                 WENDI
                        They’re all playing dress up. But 
                        it’s all just a lie. It’s all make 
                        believe.

                                 TONY
                        I’ll have a word with Peter. If 
                        that means anything.

           Wendi is quiet.

                                 WENDI
                        I don’t need your help.

                                 TONY
                        Clearly.

           Wendi speeds up.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, hey slow down. You’re not 
                        actually going to make the prime 
                        minister run, are you?

           Wendi slows down. Then stops.

                                 WENDI
                        This is all Lachlan’s fault. I 
                        should’ve been the only one in 
                        charge.

                                 TONY
                        We all have our ups and downs.

                                 WENDI
                        I never have downs. 

                                 TONY
                        That’s impossible.

                                 WENDI
                        I only have ups. 

                                 TONY
                        Right. Well, sooner or later, 
                        you’re going to have some downs.

           Wendi pauses. 

                                 WENDI
                        No, not me.
           Wendi turns to walk off.

           INT. EXPENSIVE SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - SHANGHAI - EVENING

           This is the first time we have seen Wendi’s family since the 
           wedding. Wendi’s dad - Dehui, dressed in a poor man’s suit, 
           that seems to have been worn a thousand times. 

           Mei (now 34yo) has gained a little weight. But still 
           recognizable with her plain face and quiet demeanor. She’s 
           quiet. Years of resentment towards her sister has made her 
           sick. 

           Li Hua (now 40yo), still skinny and wears her signature red 
           lipstick. Her caked on makeup gathers between her wrinkles.

           Wendi is at the head of the table.

                                 WENDI
                            (to the waiter)
                        Let’s have banquet number 5. 

           She sends the waiter away. 

           Dehui picks up his chopsticks and uses his shirt to clean it.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Dad, you don’t have to do that 
                        here.

           Embarrassed, Dehui puts the chopsticks down. 

                                 DEHUI
                        I’m so happy we are all finally 
                        together. 

                                 WENDI
                        Where is my little brother?

                                 DEHUI
                        He couldn’t get time off work.

                                 WENDI
                        I told him I would pay for the time 
                        off. 

                                 DEHUI
                        I know. But I think he’s trying to 
                        get a promotion right now. So he 
                        wants to look good.

                                 WENDI
                        Tell him I’ll speak to his boss. 
                                 DEHUI
                            (obedient)
                        I will.

           Wendi looks around the restaurant, almost like she’s looking 
           for someone. No one catches her eye. 

                                 WENDI
                        Why all the dreary faces! We’re 
                        celebrating!

                                 LI HUA
                        What are we celebrating?

                                 WENDI
                        My baby!

           Wendi rubs her stomach. 

           Li Hua is genuinely excited. 

                                 LI HUA
                        How many weeks?

                                 WENDI

                                 DEHUI
                        I’m going to spoil him to death. 

                                 WENDI
                        It’s a girl. 

                                 DEHUI
                        Wahhhh another little princess! 

           Mei hasn’t spoken a word this entire time.

                                 WENDI
                        I’m excited for Grace to have a 
                        sister.

           Mei’s eyes flicker to Wendi. An acknowledgement. Is this the 
           beginning of a reconciliation? 

           Wendi notices a MAN in a business suit sit down with his 
           family.

           From the corner of Wendi’s eye, she watches him. 

           Mei notices that Wendi is secretly watching the Man and his 
           family. But no one else seems to notice. 
           Wendi calls the Waiter over. Whispers something in his ear. 
           Immediately, the Waiter brings an expensive looking bottle of 
           wine to the mysterious Man and his family. He looks over. 
           Wendi gives a small wave.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                            (to her own family)
                        Excuse me for a moment.

           She gets up and walks over to the MAN. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Mr Chang. So great to see you here 
                        tonight! This must be your 
                        beautiful family. 

           XING CHANG (54), awkward with thinning hair introduces his 
           family.

                                 XING CHANG
                        This is my wife, Xiu and my 
                        daughter Ting Ting. 

                                 WENDI
                            (to Ting Ting)
                        What a beautiful necklace! Did your 
                        dad buy that for you?

           Ting Ting nods.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Your dad has very good taste!

           Wendi points over to her table.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I’m here having dinner with my 
                        family! I see we are both family 
                        oriented people!

                                 XING CHANG
                        Absolutely. Family ALWAYS comes 
                        first, right honey?

           Their daughter nods vigorously.

                                 WENDI
                        May I speak with you privately?

           Xing Chang excuses himself from the table and follow Wendi to 
           the back of the restaurant. 
                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I fly to China to see my family 
                        once a month. I want to make sure 
                        they are doing ok.

                                 XING CHANG
                        That’s very noble of you.

                                 WENDI
                        We are very family driven. Once you 
                        are a part of the family, we take 
                        very good care of you. 

                                 XING CHANG
                        I can only imagine so.

                                 WENDI
                        So I would be honored if you 
                        considered investing in Myspace and 
                        becoming a part of the family. 
                        Because once you invest in the 
                        family, you’re in for life. 

           Xing Chang chuckles.

                                 XING CHANG
                        You are very sneaky Mrs Murdoch. 
                        Bringing your family here today 
                        knowing I’d be here.
                            (beat)
                        I’ll tell you what, I know you are 
                        good friends with the Prime 
                        Minister of Great Britain. I wish 
                        to lower tariffs on Chinese coal in  
                        Great Britain right now, but he is 
                        adamant on keeping it high. If you 
                        help me out, I’m sure I can find a 
                        way to invest some of my new 
                        profits into your little internet 
                        venture.

           Xing Chang returns to his family like nothing happened. 

           INT. EXPENSIVE SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Wendi, excited and barely able to keep it together, returns 
           to her family. 

           Wendi resumes her meal like nothing’s wrong. Her family 
           however, is uncomfortable with what just transpired. 

           You can cut the tension with a knife.
           The waiter returns with bowls of frog legs. 

                                 WENDI
                        What’s wrong with you all? Eat up!

           Mei slams the table and storms out. Denhui and Lihua chase 
           after her.

           EXT. SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Wendi bursts through the double doors.

           In the distance, she sees her father hurrying off with her 
           two sisters. She runs towards them. 

                                 WENDI
                            (screaming)
                        Where are you going?

                                 MEI
                            (to her father and sister)
                        Don’t look back. Ignore her.

           Wendi pulls on Mei’s shoulder.

                                 MEI (CONT’D)
                        I should’ve known. 

                                 WENDI
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MEI
                        You were using us.

                                 WENDI
                        That’s ridiculous! I ran into an 
                        old friend. 

                                 MEI
                        You knew he was going to be there. 

                                 WENDI
                        I had no idea he wa--

           Interrupts--

                                 MEI
                        All of these years, you’ve cast us 
                        aside. The only people who gave a 
                        shit about you. And now, you use us 
                        like we’re trash. Shame on your Wen 
                        Ge. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEI (CONT'D)
                        I grew up in your shadows, 
                        wondering why I was never good 
                        enough. Wondering why I wasn’t as 
                        smart or as pretty as you. But now? 
                        I’m glad I’m not you. Because 
                        everything you’ve ever done has 
                        been to service yourself. I may not 
                        be rich or successful. But at least 
                        I have integrity. At least I’m 
                        capable of love. 

           Wendi stands there, stunned. Cheeks, burning. 

                                 WENDI
                        You have no idea what it’s like for 
                        me. You’ll never be as good as me. 
                        And that kills you doesn’t it? You 
                        stopped giving a shit when you 
                        realized you were never going to 
                        amount to anything. So don’t even 
                        pretend you have an idea of what 
                        I’ve had to do to get to where I 
                        am.

                                 MEI
                        It’s clear to me. You sold your 
                        soul.

           Dehui drags Mei away. 

           EXT. MURDOCH’S PRIVATE BOAT - DAY

           Two masseuse tables side by side, Wendi and Tony each have 
           their personal massage therapists. Pounding away on their 
           backs. 

           A large banner hangs between two poles - HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
           PRINCESS GRACE!

           Grace is nowhere to be seen.

           Wendi and Tony’s heads are facing the floor. 

                                 WENDI
                        What are you doing next weekend?

                                 TONY
                        Depends what you’re proposing.

                                 WENDI
                        Fancy a weekend away? 

                                                               CUT TO:
           EXT. CARMEL RANCH - CALIFORNIA - DAY

           A huge castle like structure greets us. With stone walls and 
           tiled roofs in the shape of cones.

           It’s hard to believe we’re not in the South of France.

           EXT. RANCH POOL - CONTINUOUS

           Topless waiters serving elaborate cocktails to all the 
           guests. 

           Wendi, who is normally the life of the party is nowhere to be 
           found. 

           We finally spot her, sitting on the side talking with Tony 
           Blair. 

                                 TONY
                        The sunshine feels good on my 
                        British skin.

                                 WENDI
                        The air is so fresh here. It’s my 
                        favorite getaway.

           Tony takes a deep breath in and then releases it.

                                 TONY
                        Smells like freedom.

           Beat.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        You know I’ve known Rupert for over 
                        20 years?

                                 WENDI
                        What was he like back then?

                                 TONY
                        He was ambitious. He worked so damn 
                        hard. Never had time for anyone.

                                 WENDI
                        What’s changed?

                                 TONY
                        I think you breathed life into him. 
                        Made him feel young again. 

                                 WENDI
                        He’s a hard man to please.
           Tony chuckles.

                                 TONY
                        The problem with men like Rupert is 
                        that they’re always chasing the 
                        next fad. He’s a businessman. He’s 
                        always thinking about the next 
                        investment.

                                 WENDI
                        I feel like I’m no longer 
                        profitable. 

           Tony finishes his drink.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Do you want another?

           Tony hesitates. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        It’s ok. We’re just enjoying each 
                        others’ company.

           Wendi motions for a maid to bring him another drink. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM/DANCE HALL - NIGHT

           One half of the living room has been transformed into a dance 
           floor. Disco balls droop from the ceiling, casting shards of 
           light on the sweaty bodies. 

           Wendi is in the centre, dancing freely with Tony and a few 
           female friends. 

           The music picks up. Wendi begins to dance harder to the beat. 
           She edges closer to Tony who is tipsy from the alcohol. 

           Their bodies are close. Tony’s hot breath is inches from 
           Wendi’s neck.

           EXT. RANCH POOL - NIGHT

           Wendi is inside the infinity pool still in her dress. 

           Tony stands on the edge, refusing to get in.

                                 WENDI
                        Come on! Don’t be a pussy!
                                 TONY
                        Did you just call the Prime 
                        Minister of Great Britain a pussy?

                                 WENDI
                        PUSSY!

           Wendi swims to the other side of the pool.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Come on! Just jump!

                                 TONY
                        I really shouldn’t. They’re 
                        watching.

           Wendi looks around in the darkness, expecting to see the 
           secret service with binoculars. 

                                 WENDI
                        Where are they?

                                 TONY
                        Up high somewhere.

                                 WENDI
                        Follow me.

           Wendi hops out of the pool, and wraps herself in a towel.

           EXT. RANCH BALCONY - NIGHT

           Wendi and Tony are tucked away. High above the ground, 
           looking through a telescope into the star studded sky. 

           They’re finally alone. 

           Wendi points to a random star.

                                 WENDI
                        That’s the Orion’s belt.

                                 TONY
                        Is that right?

                                 WENDI
                        I’ve learned that if you say 
                        anything with complete conviction, 
                        99% of the time, nobody will 
                        question you. 

           Tony chuckles.
                                 TONY
                        That’s my life motto. 

           Beat.

                                 WENDI
                        Back in China, I was very poor. And 
                        my sister and I would pray to the 
                        stars that one day, we could come 
                        to America and live like queens. 

           Pause.

                                 TONY
                        Where’s your sister now?

                                 WENDI
                        In China.

                                 TONY
                        She never made it out?

                                 WENDI
                        No. She didn’t have my stamina. My 
                        drive. 

           Pause.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        She would’ve been eaten alive out 
                        here. 

           Wendi looks out at the gardens. Fairy lights dangle over a 
           water feature. 

           A long silence. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I can talk to you about 
                        anything.

           Wendi looks through the telescope. But instead of looking up 
           into the sky, she points it forward.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I think I can see China 
                        from here. 

           Wendi looks through the telescope again. POV of lens - of 
           just blurry shapes of trees and buildings. No China. No Mei. 

           Beat. 

           Wendi looks into Tony’s blue eyes. 
                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        I need a favor, Tony.

                                 TONY
                        What is it?

                                 WENDI
                        Those coal tariffs you’ve imposed 
                        on Chinese imports. I need them 
                        lifted.

           She takes a seductive step towards Tony. He stays put.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Wendi, naked. Intertwined in satin sheets. The sun is barely 
           poking out. 

           Wendi opens her eyes and looks to her right expecting someone 
           there. But it’s empty.

           A folded up piece of paper sits on the bedside table: 

           “You scratched my back, I scratch yours. Expect good news 
           from the Chinese in 2 weeks. Love, Tony.”

           Instead of rejoicing, Wendi looks tired. Sad. Defeated.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Water BLASTS onto Wendi’s back. She dips her head under the 
           shower head. Closes her eyes.

           FLASH FROM LAST NIGHT: Wendi and Tony’s bodies intertwining. 
           Tony kisses her neck.

           BACK TO PRESENT: Wendi scrubs her neck viciously. 

           FLASH: Tony making love to Wendi. Panting.

           BACK TO PRESENT: Wendi scrubs between her legs. Her thighs 
           turn pink.

           She turns off the shower. Stands there, dripping. Head 
           starring at the ground. Disgusted with herself.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wendi dressed in track pants and an XL t-shirt. For the first 
           time in a long time, she’s dressed like a normal person. 
           She draws the blinds. Darkness.

           The house is quiet.

           Wendi sits on the edge of the bed. Sees her lacy underwear 
           from last night. She picks it up and BURIES it in the trash. 

           A realization. Maybe she has sold her soul.

           A beat. 

           Wendi picks up the phone and dials. 

           RING RING. RING RING.

           INT. TINY STUDIO APARTMENT (SOMEWHERE ELSE) - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON a cell phone. It lights up. We are in an old, modest 
           home but cosy. Various colored chalk is spread around the 
           table. 

           We HEAR footsteps.

           A hand reaches in, grabs the phone. 

           It’s Mei.

                                 MEI
                        Hello?

           BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. They’ve hung up.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Wendi looks at her phone. Shuts it off. 

           Her breathing is shallow. She can’t tear her eyes off the 
           ground. A frail figure. Alone. 

           EXT. NYC SOHO APARTMENT - DAY

           Back inside the hustle and bustle of NYC. A HOMELESS MAN (45) 
           wakes up cuddling an empty bottle of rum.

           INT. MURDOCH DINING ROOM - DAY

           The sound of a blender. CLOSE ON strawberries and raspberries 
           disintegrating into a milky substance.
           Her hand rests on the blender but Wendi’s mind is elsewhere. 
           She stares out the window at the skyline. Feeling nothing.

           Rupert sits at the other end of the dining table, reading 
           this week’s issue of The Economist. 

           Rupert is cold. Expressionless. 

           A baby cries in the next room.

           The life from this household has been sucked dry.

           Mrs Chu carries baby CHLOE, Wendi’s newborn into the room. 
           The baby cries loudly, snot flooding down her lips. 

                                 MRS CHU
                        Mrs Deng--

           Wendi doesn’t notice. 

           Mrs Chu is trying to shush the baby but it only makes her cry 
           louder.

                                 MRS CHU (CONT’D)
                        Please Mrs Deng. I think she’s 
                        hungry.

           Wendi is snapped back into reality. 

                                 WENDI
                        Feed her! What am I paying you for?

           Mrs Chu bows and disappears out of the room. 

           Wendi’s assistant - Ruby runs into the room--

                                 RUBY
                        Your dad’s on the line Mrs Deng. He 
                        says it’s urgent.

                                 WENDI
                        Tell him I’m busy.

                                 RUBY
                        He sounds desperate ma’am.

           Wendi sighs. Exits into--

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Wendi shuffles down the hallway.
                                 WENDI
                            (impatient)
                        Make it quick dad.

           Muffled sounds.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                            (into the phone)
                        Hello? Can you hear me?

           The phone crackles. Dehui’s voice goes in and out. 

           Wendi walks into:

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Two chefs quickly abandon their posts and disappear.

           Dehui’s voice still sounds crackly. 

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        Hel...hel...yo....ter....hi

                                 WENDI
                            (into the phone)
                        You need to call me back later. I 
                        can’t hear you.

           Wendi walks into:

           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Suddenly the phone clicks and everything is clear. 

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? 

                                 WENDI
                        Yes dad. Now’s not a good time. 
                        What is it?

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        It’s your sister. 

                                 WENDI
                        What’s wrong with her now?

           Wendi closes the laundry room door.

           There is a long pause. 
                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Dad? You there?

           And then...we hear a soft sobbing...

           Wendi doesn’t know what to think.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Dad? What’s wrong?

           Another long pause. 

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        Your sister.

           Denhui’s voice quivers.

                                 DEHUI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        She was found by her friend. 

           Silence.

                                 DEHUI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        She had a bed sheet tied around her 
                        neck. 

           A long, drawn out silence.

                                 DEHUI (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I know you and Mei never mended 
                        things...I don’t want you to blame 
                        yourself.

           Wendi’s hand shakes. The walls close in, as if suffocating 
           her.

                                 WENDI
                        Why would you say that? Of course I 
                        don’t blame myself. Why would you 
                        say something like that?

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        No--he--hell-- 

                                 WENDI
                        Hello? Hello?

                                 DEHUI (O.S.)
                        I--wa-----i-----d---o

                                 WENDI
                        I can’t hear you dad. Hello?

           BEEP BEEP BEEP. The line goes dead.
           Wendi sinks to the floor. The room spins. 

           Frustration. Regret. Heartbreak.

           She grabs an armful of fresh laundry and buries her face in 
           it. She shrieks at the top of her lungs.

           The baby starts to cry. 

           INT. LIMOUSINE - GUANGZHOU, CHINA - DAY

           Wendi, dressed in all black, looks out the tinted windows. 
           Guangzhou has changed since she last visited. 

           The street vendors are now replaced by leering skyscrapers.

           EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

           Wendi’s black stilettos get caught in the soft grass. 

           A small gathering of close family and friends crowd around a 
           small tomb. 

           Wendi tries her best to suppress her emotions.

           Dehui runs over to greet Wendi--

           They embrace but it’s cold. Void of connection.

           Wendi greets the rest of her family. They look like 
           strangers.

                                 LI HUA 
                        Hello Wendi. 

           Li Hua gives her sister a cold hug. She’s put on weight. Her 
           two sons run in the distance, playing tag. 

                                 LI HUA (CONT’D)
                            (screams at her sons)
                        CUT IT OUT. SHOW SOME RESPECT FOR 
                        THE DEAD.

           Wendi’s younger brother Deng Fu is in his 30s. She can’t help 
           but notice a tiny bald patch.

                                 DENG FU
                        Good to see you, Wendi.

           They hug. It’s awkward.
           Wendi walks up to the tiny tomb. She stares at it, unable to 
           look away. 

           From behind--Dehui hands Wendi a metal box. It’s the tin box 
           from her childhood. 

                                 DEHUI
                        I found this underneath her bed in 
                        her apartment. 

           Wendi takes the box. Those same hula hooping, Hawaiian girls 
           adorn the lid.

           It feels foreign in her hands.

           She finds a spot away from the proceedings.

           Opens the lid and peers inside.

           Those same fridge pamphlets. Caucasian families. 

           Wendi flips through more pamphlets. 

           Mixed in is a New York Times article. Curious, she reads it. 
           It’s cut out from a newspaper. The heading reads MURDOCH 
           MARRIES SECOND WIFE. 

           Wendi reaches into the box and takes out the rest of the 
           papers. They’re all cut outs from various media outlets. All 
           about her. 

           She flips through. Page after page. 

           Until suddenly. She stops.

           A drawing. Of Wendi and Mei as children. They are holding 
           hands next to a large fridge. Wide smiles with hope in their 
           eyes.

           Suddenly, Wendi begins to weep.

           INT. LIMOUSINE (PARKED) - NIGHT

           The tin rests gently on Wendi’s lap. She holds it while 
           peering through the tinted glass at her old home. 

           The city may have changed but her old neighborhood is still 
           the same.

           Kids are on skateboards now instead of bikes. 

           Wendi can see inside the house, her father is cooking.
           Steam rises from the hot dumplings, fogging up the window.

           INT. WENDI’S OLD HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Dehui washes a pan. He notices a limousine outside. 

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Dehui knocks on the tinted window. Wendi rolls it down 
           halfway.

                                 DEHUI
                        What are you doing outside? Come 
                        in, come in!

                                 WENDI
                        I’m ok. I just stopped by on my way 
                        to the airport. 

                                 DEHUI
                        Nonsense! Come in!

                                 WENDI
                        No really dad. I’m ok.

                                 DEHUI
                        I made your favorite. Chives 
                        dumplings! Lihua and Fu are inside! 
                        We’re all dying to see photos of 
                        your new baby. 

           Dehui tries to open the door but it’s locked. 

                                 WENDI
                        I have a flight to catch, dad.

                                 DEHUI
                        Just come in for some dumplings! 
                        Remember when we used to play games 
                        after dinner? And I’d give you 
                        pamphlets I’d collect from work?

           Beat.

                                 WENDI
                        Why did Mei collect articles about 
                        me?

                                 DEHUI
                        She looked up to you. She wanted to 
                        keep track of all your successes.
                                 WENDI
                        But she hated me.

                                 DEHUI
                        She never stopped loving you. 

                                 WENDI
                        I don’t believe it.

                                 DEHUI
                        She was so proud of you.

                                 WENDI
                        She was always jealous of me. 

                                 DEHUI
                        You have no idea how much she 
                        adored you. She never stopped 
                        loving you.

           Wendi turns away. Wipes away tears.

           She can barely look at her father.

                                 DEHUI (CONT’D)
                        Please come in. Just for a minute. 

           Wendi can sense the desperation in her father’s voice. 

                                 DEHUI (CONT’D)
                        We miss you, Wen Ge.

           Wendi notices a tiny hole starting to form on her father’s 
           sleeve. The hole has been mended before. Over and over again. 

           Beat.

                                 DEHUI (CONT’D)
                        Please. Come home. 

           Unable to make eye contact, Wendi rolls up her tinted window. 

           Dehui just stares at the limousine, the floor giving out 
           under him. 

           INT. MURDOCH LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The tin box is emptied out. Wendi has all the articles spread 
           out. But her focus is on the picture of her and Mei as kids. 

           Wendi’s daughter, Grace (now 12) walks past the double doors.
                                 WENDI
                            (calls out)
                        GRACE?

           Grace peers in.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Come here.

           Grace knows better than to say no. Grace sits stiffly on her 
           mother’s lap. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        How is school?

                                 GRACE
                        It’s fine.

                                 WENDI
                        What’s your favorite subject?

                                 GRACE
                        English.

                                 WENDI
                        How’s Mrs Hoover?

                                 GRACE
                        She was my teacher 2 years ago.

                                 WENDI
                        Oh.

                                 GRACE
                        Can I be excused? I have homework 
                        to do.

           Grace’s pearly brown eyes are void of any emotion. They’re 
           like two empty marbles. Indifferent.

                                 WENDI
                        Yes. Go on.

           Grace races out the door like she’s running from the plague. 

           Wendi swallows.

           INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING

           Hollow eyes and sagging skin. Wendi looks like she hasn’t 
           slept in days. She sips a hot tea, bundled in winter clothes. 
           Rain splashes against her grandiose windows. NYC looks dreary 
           and cold.
           A MAID (50s) hand delivers an A4 envelope.

           Confused, Wendi rips it open.

           It’s a petition for divorce.

           Wendi’s heart stops.

           Outside, a pigeon flies, head first, into the window. The 
           dead bird smears the window as it falls to its death, 200 
           storeys below.

           EXT. NEWSCORP BUILDING - DOWNTOWN NYC - DAY

           The rain drops have hardened, almost making indents on the 
           concrete ground. 

           Wendi’s assistant holds up a golden yellow umbrella, 
           struggling to keep up.

           Outside the revolving doors, a HOMELESS MAN (mid 50s), a 
           white beard and bald patch, shakes in the cold.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Miss? It’s my birthday today. Care 
                        to make my birthday wish come true?

           The sight of him disgusts her. She walks right by as if he 
           doesn’t exist.

           INT. RUPERT’S OFFICE - DAY

           The corner office in the highest part of the building. Rupert 
           is surrounded by 5 of his top lawyers. 

           Wendi storms in with her assistant, completely drenched, 
           trailing behind.

           She slams the divorce papers on the table.

                                 WENDI
                        Explain.

           One of Murdoch’s clingy lawyers takes the reigns.

                                 LAWYER #1
                        My client wishes for you to sign 
                        these papers within 3 business 
                        days. After which the courts will 
                        determine who will get custody of 
                        the children. 
                                 WENDI
                        You’ve got to be joking me.

           Rupert remains silent.

           The lawyer is about to start speaking again when--

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Shut your fucking mouth and get 
                        out. All of you. 

           Wendi turns to Rupert.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Have the fucking decency to talk to 
                        me.

           Pause.

           Rupert waves his lawyers out the room. They file out, like 
           toy soldiers. 

           Wendi closes the door. 

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        Why?

                                 RUPERT
                        Why do you think?

                                 WENDI
                        Is this because I sank the Myspace 
                        acquisition? For Gods sake Rupert. 
                        You know I can make all that back 
                        in a year--

                                 RUPERT
                        Maria found emails between you and 
                        Tony.

           Wendi goes quiet.

           A long and agonizing pause.

                                 RUPERT (CONT’D)
                        What were you thinking?

                                 WENDI
                        I don’t know what she thinks she 
                        found, but it’s nothing. 

                                 RUPERT
                        Do you want me to read them out?
           Rupert opens up a manila folder, rifles through the papers.

                                 WENDI
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 RUPERT
                        Tony admitted to the whole thing.

                                 WENDI
                        He’s a liar. He just wants you to 
                        divorce me so he can get rid of me. 
                        He knows I’m not a fan of his 
                        political agenda--

           Rupert reads from a piece of paper.

                                 RUPERT
                        Oh Tony, I miss you so much. Your 
                        body--

                                 WENDI
                        Stop it.

           Wendi panics.

                                 WENDI (CONT’D)
                        You know what? I’m divorcing you. 
                        You were a heartless husband who 
                        only cared about money and nothing 
                        else. You used me to make you money 
                        in China and now you’re done. So 
                        you’re tossing me aside. You think 
                        you’re so powerful with your team 
                        of lawyers but I’m going to destroy 
                        you. You’ll never see Chloe and 
                        Grace ever again.

                                 RUPERT
                        I look forward to it.

                                 WENDI
                        The entire world is going to know 
                        what a selfish, cruel man you are. 
                        You’d have driven me to suicide if 
                        I was anyone else. 

           A long pause.

           Rupert presses a button on his Cisco phone. 

                                 RUPERT
                            (into the phone)
                        I’m done.
           The toy soldiers march back in.

           EXT. NEWSCORP BUILDING - DOWNTOWN NYC - CONTINUOUS

           Wendi steps outside, barely keeping it together. The rain 
           SPLATTERS harder than ever. 

           A black BMW is waiting. 

           The homeless person has shifted closer to the doors now.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Please lady. It’s my birthday.

           The Homeless man tries to touch her hand. Wendi jumps back.

                                 WENDI
                        Ugh...don’t touch me! 

           The homeless man spits on her shoe.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Fuck you, you fucking whore.

           Wendi SLAPS him straight across the face. She’s shocked by 
           her own strength. The homeless man lunges forward.

           Wendi stumbles. 

           Smashes on the ground. 

           Ruby drops the umbrella. 

           Water hits Wendi’s face like rocks. Her mascara, although 
           waterproof, cannot handle this amount of rain. 

           Two SECURITY GUARDS run towards them. Detain the homeless 
           man. He spits again.

           Wendi rubs her eyes. Unsure if it’s rain or tears. 

           Off her look--

           INT. GREEN ROOM (PRESS CONFERENCE) - DAY

           This is the first scene of the film. We have come full 
           circle. 

           Wendi’s entourage fuss over her hair and makeup. She’s 
           dressed in a Chanel suit with Leboutin heels. 
                                 WENDI
                        When is Grace and Chloe arriving?

                                 RUBY
                        They’re with your husband. 

                                 WENDI
                        Why are they with him?

                                 RUBY
                        Their preference. 

                                 WENDI
                        Tell them their mother wants to see 
                        them.

                                 RUBY
                        I have ma’am. 

                                 WENDI
                        And?

           Beat.

                                 RUBY
                        I can’t force them, ma’am.

           Wendi lets that sink in.

                                 WENDI
                        I want to be alone.

                                 RUBY
                        Mrs Deng, we still need to rehearse 
                        the speech.

                                 WENDI
                        I will not repeat myself.

           Ruby understands.

                                 RUBY
                        OUT, OUT, EVERYONE OUT. OUT.

           Wendi is left alone. 

           Behind her, a television is on.

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        In most recent news, Newscorp has 
                        just sold Myspace to Facebook at a 
                        whopping 93% loss. This is a 
                        historic blow to the Murdoch empire-
           Wendi doesn’t seem to be listening because she’s taken out 
           the tin box from her childhood.

           The contents are once again spread out before her. Articles, 
           photographs of her with celebrities, exam papers...

           She basks in its glory, touching the 100% mark on all her 
           tests. It makes her feel better. Like she’s a star.

           She keeps flipping. Looking for something. 

           The childhood drawing falls out. Wendi looks at it.

           Beat.

           Wendi’s eyes close. She takes a deep breath. 

           She scrunches the picture up. Tosses it into the trash can. 

           She re-opens her eyes. Breathes out. Buries any sign of 
           weakness. Full denial mode. 

           Wendi begins to recite her speech; perfectly, with extreme 
           precision. 

                                 WENDI
                        Rupert and I are announcing our 
                        joint decision for divorce. I will 
                        also be stepping down from the 
                        board at Star TV, which was a 
                        personal decision. I want to take 
                        this moment to thank my husband for 
                        being the best friend and partner 
                        anyone could ask for. And I want to 
                        thank my family for being so 
                        supportive and loving through this 
                        tough time. I have always put 
                        family first and this is no 
                        exception. My two children are my 
                        best friends. They love spending 
                        time with me and doing eachothers’ 
                        nails. They’re such darlings. 
                        Rupert and I will do our best to 
                        shower them with the love that they 
                        deserve.

           She practices her smiles. Each one as genuine as the last. 
           Then she stops smiling. She looks at herself...

           Truly looks at herself. 

                                CUT TO BLACK.
