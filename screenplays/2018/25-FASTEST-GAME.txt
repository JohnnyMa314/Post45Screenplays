           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - FRONTON - NIGHT

           SLOW MOTION -- Two JAI ALAI PLAYERS, foot-long cestas
           (baskets) strapped to their forearms, brace for a
           potential game-winning point.

           Sweat beads on their noses. They breathe heavily. 

           A LARGE CROWD stands with anticipation.

           The gravity of the moment hangs in the air.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Guinness World Records dubbed jai
                        alai the fastest ball sport in
                        the world.

           PLAYER 1 serves the pelota (ball) -- CLOSE UP SLOW
           MOTION -- of the pelota rolling through his cesta and
           snapping off the tip. Tight on the ball as it hurls
           through the air, hitting the wall and FREEZES, flat as a
           pancake.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        A goatskin covered ball so
                        lethal, it's left some of the
                        sport's best players wishing
                        they'd never stepped foot inside
                        a fronton.

           THWACK -- back to REGULAR SPEED -- the pelota flies off
           the wall back at PLAYER 2, who jerks his head as the
           ball speeds by, narrowly missing his face.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - VIP BOX - CONTINUOUS

           RONNIE WEISS, 26, handsome, intense, in a perfectly
           tailored tuxedo, closely watches the heated match.

           SUPER: MIAMI, CHRISTMAS 1975

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Certain types of people gravitate
                        to the game despite the danger,
                        and some, because of it.

           Player 1 wins the point pumping his fist. Ronnie cracks
           a big smile, marking a “W” next to the winning
           combination on his list. 
                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Present company included. But I
                        didn't play, fuck that, I bet it.
                        And I bet big.

           RITA VARGAS, 24, Ronnie’s Cuban girlfriend, tanned with
           shinny black hair and green eyes, in a green sequined
           halter dress, leaps into his arms and kisses him.

                                 RITA
                        Feliz Navidad, amor.

                        My father said jai alai was the
                        most beautiful thing he’d ever
                        seen.

           STOCK FOOTAGE: SLOW MOTION -- A PLAYER jumps and flings
           the pelota against the granite wall.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Pure. Elegant. Graceful.

           BLACK AND WHITE STOCK FOOTAGE: Jai alai played in Basque
           Country, Spain.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Told me stories of farmers in the
                        Basque Country of Spain playing
                        in church courtyards under the
                        Pyrenees mountains. As if he’d
                        been there himself, seen it with
                        his own eyes.

           INT. DINGY POKER ROOM - MIAMI BEACH - FLASHBACK - DAY

           HARRY WEISS, 40, 5 o'clock shadow, tan linen suit, sits
           with other DEGENERATES, nervously organizing his cards.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        But he never left Miami. Couldn't 
                        afford to.

           Harry loses the hand and the pot goes to his OPPONENT.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - FLASHBACK - DAY

           A YOUNG RONNIE, 10, and Harry watch a match in progress.

           PLAYERS battle back and forth, fast and furious.
                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Took me to the fronton every
                        weekend as a kid. 

           Eating a hot dog Ronnie smiles as Harry motions around
           the fronton, passionately describing the scene.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Taught me the rules.

           Players line the bench waiting to play.

                                 HARRY
                        The pelota has to hit between
                        lines 4 and 7 on the serve.

           PLAYER 1 serves.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                        Single elimination round robin.

           PLAYER 2 tries to field the ball, misses...

           Ronnie smiles at his dad, with admiration.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                        So one player gets eliminated
                        every point...

           ...and moves to his spot at the end of the bench.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                        ...the next in line gets up and
                        plays the winner.

           NEXT PLAYER goes up to face Player 1.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                        First to score 7 points wins.

           EXT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - LATER

           Ronnie and his father exit the fronton hand in hand.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        After he died, I thought I’d
                        never step foot inside a fronton
                        again.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - AUDITORIUM - 1975 - NIGHT

           The packed auditorium watches a match.
                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        But by 1975, Miami Jai Alai was
                        the largest fronton in the world.
                        The hottest ticket in town filled
                        with movie stars, Presidents...

           BLACK AND WHITE NEWS FOOTAGE: PAUL NEWMAN, JOHN
           TRAVOLTA, and RICHARD NIXON at Miami Jai Alai.

                        ...and huge crowds. Over 15,000 a
                        night and a million dollars in
                        the handle. Where all the money
                        was.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - COUNTING ROOM  - CONTINUOUS

           Fronton EMPLOYEES dump buckets of cash on a table, sort,
           stack and count the endless bills.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        And that’s what I wanted, all the
                        money.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI  - CONTINUOUS

           Ronnie and Rita walk toward the ticket window.

                                 RITA
                        You speak to Looney yet?

                                 RONNIE
                        'Bout to.

                                 RITA
                        He hasn't been reliable in weeks.
                        The team's starting to notice.

                                 RONNIE
                        I'll handle it.

           Rita side-eyes Ronnie and smirks.

                                 RITA
                        Don't be a pussy.

           Rita peels off towards the ticket windows. 

                                 RONNIE
                        I'm not being a pussy.
           Ronnie exchanges nods with JOHN DEWEES, 35, pale and
           wiry, sitting behind a window in a Miami Jai Alai
           employee vest.

           John puts three stacks of win tickets into a paper bag,
           and slides it down the long counter to his wife KATHY,
           28, blonde, tall and thin with amazing breasts.

           Kathy passes the bag through her window to Rita, who
           grabs it and winks.

           EXT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - COUNTINUOUS

           Ronnie exits, walks up to the valet stand where DAVID
           “LOONEY” HARMEN, 28, gaunt with chiseled features, in a
           tuxedo, chain-smoking to the filter, waits anxiously in
           his Thunderbird, suicide doors ajar.

           Ronnie jumps in and smiles. Looney doesn't reciprocate.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Looney and I met playing baseball
                        for the P.A.L. at Flamingo park
                        on Miami Beach.

           EXT. FLAMINGO PARK - MIAMI BEACH - FLASHBACK - DAY

           Close on a Police Athletic League Logo on a COACH’S
           jersey.

                                 UMPIRE
                        One out, man on 3rd, batter up.

           Looney, 14, pours Coke on a pile of red fire ants.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Everybody called him Looney
                        'cause he was fucking crazy.

           Coach turns to the dugout.

                                 COACH
                        Looney, you’re up!

           Looney puts on a helmet, grabs a bat and runs out of the
           dugout.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Wired that way 'cause of his home
                        life. Father was alcoholic,
                        mother bible thumper. Stayed at
                        my house most of the time.
           Harry taps another FATHER on the shoulder.

                                 HARRY
                        50 bucks he gets on base.

           A few opposing team PARENTS look over at Harry with
           contempt.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                        C'mon Looney, get us a run!

           Looney takes the bat and hits himself in the helmet,
           psyching himself up.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        He was our best player and my
                        best friend.

           Ronnie, 12, sits in the dugout entering stats into a
           chart. 

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        I was team manager.

           The Coach sends signs to Looney, tapping two fingers on
           his forearm, grabbing the bill of his cap and clapping
           his hands.

           Ronnie sees this and runs out of the dugout.

                                 RONNIE
                        Time! Time! Time!

           The Umpire looks over like: "Who's running this team?"

           Coach's pissed. Looney smirks, he's seen this before.

                                 COACH
                        What the fuck, Weiss?!

           Ronnie approaches the Coach. Everyone waits impatiently.
           Harry smiles, he too has seen this before.

                                 OPPOSING COACH
                        C'mon ump! Delay of game.

                                 RONNIE
                                 whispers to Coach

                                (
                        Don't bunt.

                                 COACH
                        We're down by a run. I got a man
                        on 3rd and one out, he's buntin'.
                                 RONNIE
                        Looney's hitting .351 over the
                        last 5 games and .360 lifetime.

                                 COACH
                        Lifetime?! He's fuckin' 14.

                                 RONNIE
                        He's Ty Cobb is what he is.

           Ronnie turns and walks back to the dugout.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        Let him swing away.

           Reluctantly, the Coach signs for "swing away."

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        We each had our talents. 

           Looney smiles and sets up to hit. Cracking a line drive
           on the first pitch, Looney speeds around the bases. The
           crowd cheers as he dives head-first into second base.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Numbers came naturally to me. In
                        my DNA.

           Looney gets up, dusts himself off and adjusts his cup. 

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah Looney, atta boy!

           Harry stands up and cheers.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                                (

                        Pay up! 

           Ronnie jealously watches his father cheering for Looney.
           He adds another double next to Looney’s name.

           EXT. FLAMINGO PARK - PARKING LOT - AFTER GAME

           Harry, Looney and Ronnie walk towards Harry's beater
           car. A few OPPOSING PLAYERS and Parents approach.

                                 OPPOSING PLAYER
                        Hey, Hymie!

           Harry, Ronnie and Looney turn around. Looney grips his
           bat tightly.
           Opposing Player gets in Ronnie's face.

           Ronnie looks nervous.

                                 OPPOSING PLAYER (cont'd)
                        How 'bout you pick up a bat and
                        play like the rest of us? 

           Harry does nothing.

           BAM! Looney jams his bat into the gut of Opposing
           Player. The kid drops to his knees.

           Other Opposing Players and Parents step up, Looney
           raises his bat, crazed look.

                                 LOONEY
                        Who else wants some?

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)

                                 BEN
                        You could have all this.

           Ronnie smiles tightly.

                        You don't want to end up like
                        that father of yours.

           Ronnie doesn't react.

                                 BEN (cont'd)
                        I think it's admirable, coming
                        home to the battleground where
                        your father surrendered.

           Ronnie nods and smiles.

                        Now get those dirty sneakers off
                        my marble. The laundry room's
                        back there.

           Ronnie pivots, walks through the crowd and kicks open... 
           INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...the swinging door, almost striking ALFIE MART, 50’s,
           immaculately dressed in designer shoes, shiny slacks,
           and a pink button down shirt, talking on the phone.

           Alfie looks up, annoyed, but softens when he recognizes
           Ronnie. Smiling, he holds up his finger, “one second,”
           and motions for Ronnie to come in.

                                 ALFIE
                        Red Sox, minus 200 at Tigers,
                        giving 175. It’s two to one if
                        you take Boston.

           Ronnie quietly puts his stuff down and heads to a
           utility sink to freshen up.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Look, handicapping small
                        favorites and underdogs,
                        particularly home underdogs,
                        while watching out for good
                        pitchers on bad teams can go a
                        long way in building your
                        bankroll.

           Alfie jots numbers into a little black book with a gold
           Mont Blanc pen.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Alfie Mart, Miami Beach's
                        untouchable resident bookmaker,
                        handled over 100 million a year
                        in bets.

           Alfie winks at Ronnie, who puts on a fresh shirt and
           jeans.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Even J. Edgar Hoover tried
                        nailing Alfie to a Las Vegas
                        racketeering charge, but it
                        didn't stick.

           Ronnie puts on his dirty sneakers.

           Closing the pen, Alfie slips it into his shirt pocket
           embroidered with a gold AM and hangs up the phone.

                                 ALFIE
                        Look who it is, man of the hour.
                        How you doin', kid?
                                 RONNIE
                        Terrible.

                                 ALFIE
                        Terrific.

           Alfie pulls a wad of hundreds and peels off three bills.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Mazel Tov. A little something to
                        help you enjoy the summer.
                                 off: his shoes
                                (
                                               )
                        Get some loafers.

           Ronnie slips the bills into his pocket.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Some party you got out there.

                                 RONNIE
                        My mother showing off her new
                        life.

                                 ALFIE
                        Landed a good one.

           Alfie grabs his blazer off a hanger and puts it on.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Wanna get outta here? Skip’s over
                        at the house. He'd love to see
                        ya.

           Ronnie looks relieved.

                                 RONNIE
                        You don’t mind?

                                 ALFIE
                        Not one iota.

           Alfie puts his hand on Ronnie's shoulder and smiles.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Gotta make a quick stop.

           The two walk out the side door.

           INT. ROLLS ROYCE CORNICHE CONVERTIBLE - MOMENTS LATER

           The sun goes down over Miami Beach as Alfie cruises
           north on A1A, top down, windows up.
           Alfie takes out a Cohiba and pushes in the lighter.

                                 ALFIE
                        Take the wheel.

           The lighter pops.

           Ronnie holds the wheel while Alfie presses the red hot
           coil to the tip of his cigar, turning it in circles,
           illuminating his face as he puffs.

           Alfie deposits the lighter, and puts his hand back on
           the wheel. 

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Your mother said you sailed
                        through law school, top of your
                        class?

           Alfie takes a big puff.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        You gonna practice?

                                 RONNIE
                        Gotta pass the bar first, but
                        that's the plan.

                                 ALFIE
                        Don't seem too excited.

           Ronnie shrugs.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        That's 'cause you're your
                        father's son. Workin' behind a
                        desk ain't in your blood.

                                 RONNIE
                        My father was a coward.

                                 ALFIE
                        Hey, don't talk like that. He
                        loved your mother and you.

                                 RONNIE
                        Then he wouldn'ta done what he
                        did.

                                 ALFIE
                        One of the sharpest guys I knew,
                        could see a play five steps
                        ahead, just couldn't color within
                        the lines of life.
           Ronnie looks out the window at a strip of hotels. In his
           mind’s eye, projected in the reflection of his passenger
           side window, a MAN falls from one of the buildings.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        My father took a swan dive out
                        the tenth floor window of the
                        Eden Roc hotel when I was 16.
                        Becoming him was my biggest fear.

           Ronnie traces the trajectory of the fall with his finger
           on the window, continuing down to the window button and
           lowering it as if wiping the image away.

           They hit a pothole. Ash falls on Alfie’s pink shirt.

                                 ALFIE
                        Shit, hand me a tissue in the
                        glove box.

           Ronnie opens the glove compartment. A nickel plated 9mm
           sits next to the tissue box. Ronnie grabs a tissue and
           hands it to Alfie who rubs the ash.

           Alfie turns into a dark parking lot.

           EXT. MIAMI BEACH - BEACH PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           The Rolls Royce headlights illuminate a parked Cadillac.

           Two GANGSTERS exit the Cadi in slacks, terrycloth
           shirts, and gold necklaces with Star of David ornaments.

           Grabbing a THIRD MAN out of the back seat, they throw
           him to the concrete.

           Alfie puts the car in park, leaving it running.
           Headlights frame the scene.

           He takes out his gold Mont Blanc and puts it in the
           center console.

                                 ALFIE
                        This’ll just take a minute.

           Alfie walks towards the three Men.

           Standing over the beaten Man, Alfie smacks him a few
           times in the face.

           Alfie looks back in Ronnie’s direction, making eye
           contact, before raising his foot and driving his heel
           into the Man’s forearm, breaking his humerus.
           Ronnie turns away.

           Alfie walks back and gets in the car.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Deadbeat motherfucker.

           EXT. MART HOUSE - BAL HARBOR - LATER

           Ronnie and Alfie pull into the driveway of Alfie’s upper
           middle class home and park.

                                 ALFIE
                        Skip should be out back.

           Ronnie reaches for the door handle, Alfie grabs his
           shoulder.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        Your father was like a brother to
                        me, you need anything...

           Ronnie eyes a spec of blood on Alfie’s cheek.

                                 RONNIE
                        Thanks, Mr. Mart.

           Alfie squeezes his shoulder and smiles. 

                                 ALFIE
                        Welcome home.

           INT. COHEN, STEVENS, & BREIER LAW FIRM (C, S & B) - DAY

           Ronnie, wearing the suit, tours the office with a middle
           aged RECEPTIONIST.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        That’s Mr. Breier’s office.

           Ronnie looks at BOB BREIER, 60's, pacing his office on a
           conference call. Bob sees Ronnie and closes the door.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (cont'd)
                        You sit over there.

           She points to a little cubicle. 

           EXT. SHANKMAN HOME - EARLY EVENING

           Ronnie pulls into the driveway, still dressed from work.
           Looney, 27, thin frame and sunken cheeks, leans on his
           beat-up 1970 Chevy.

           Ronnie parks and gets out. Ronnie stares at Looney,
           shocked at his friend's appearance.

                                 LOONEY
                        I look like shit, huh?

           Ronnie walks towards Looney.

                                 RONNIE
                        You surprised me's all.

           The two embrace.

           INT. DEUCE BAR - LATER

           Ronnie and Looney sit in the dimly lit bar. Looney
           smokes a cigarette.

                                 LOONEY
                        My first tour we were down in
                        Thua Thien province movin’
                        supplies. Met some good guys. And
                        the women over there, Ronnie. The
                        women.

           Looney bites his knuckle and leans back.

                                 LOONEY (cont'd)
                        I remember thinking, shit, I
                        could get used to this. It wasn’t
                        ‘till my second tour that shit
                        got real.

           Looney looks at his drink and spins it, going somewhere
           else.

                                 LOONEY (cont'd)
                        I heard you were back and knew it
                        was a fuckin' sign.

           Looney slides the Miami Herald sports section across the
           bar.

           Ronnie reads the headline: “TRIFECTA BET INTRODUCED AT
           MIAMI JAI ALAI."

                                 RONNIE
                        A sign?
                                 LOONEY
                        Ronnie man, the place's changed.
                        It’s not like when we were
                        sneakin’ in bettin' pennies with
                        your dad. When I got back, I was
                        bored out of my mind, desperate
                        for some fuckin' action.

           INT. LOONEY’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - EVENING

           Looney sits alone on the couch in his dingy studio
           apartment smoking a joint.

                                 LOONEY (O.S)
                        Guy I used to hang with in
                        Saigon...

           INT. SAIGON BAR - FLASHBACK - DAY

           PAPA RICO, 30’s, jolly, sits at the bar draped in
           VIETNAMESE PROSTITUTES. Looney sits next to him.

                                 LOONEY (O.S.)
                        ...big Cuban motherfucker, Papa
                        Rico. Loved that I was from Miami
                        and he’d go on and on about...

           Papa Rico stands pretending to talk into a microphone as
           we hear Looney...

                                 LOONEY (O.S.) (cont'd)
                                (
                                 Cuban announcer
                                 voice)
                        “Miami Jai Alai. The Palace of
                        Champions.”

           Freeze frame on Papa Rico, mid-gesticulation:

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        To be clear, without this fucking
                        crazy Cuban, none of this
                        would've ever happened.

           Action continues as Looney grabs one of the Prostitutes.

                                 LOONEY (O.S.)
                        Rico played back in Havana, and
                        now he’s the announcer at Miami

           EXT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           A NEON SIGN ON THE BUILDING FLASHES: “Miami Jai Alai” 

                                 LOONEY (O.S.)
                        So one night, I take a ride over
                        the bridge.

           Looney stands looking up at the blinking sign.

           A metallic beige Jaguar SJX screeches up to the valet.
           The OWNER hops out, throws the keys to the ATTENDANT and
           walks inside with a beautiful GIRL half his age. 

           Looney follows them with his eyes.

                        You can’t imagine the action,
                        Ron. I’m talkin' thousands of
                        people, from all walks.

           A bus full of sunburned TOURISTS and SENIORS pulls up.  

                                 LOONEY (O.S.) (cont'd)

           GAMBLERS of all kinds fill the stands and the THWACK of
           a pelota hitting the wall can be heard over the buzz.

           Everyone's heads swivel back and forth with the action.

           Looney finishes his drink and motions to the bartender.

                        The handle ranges between 500k to
                        a million a night. It’s a

           Ronnie, 12, Looney, 14 and Harry, 42, sit in the stands.

                        Who's the best player?

                                 HARRY
                        Irrelevant. Skill plays no part
                        when betting.

           Looney looks puzzled.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                        Statistically speaking, any
                        single point can be won or lost
                        by any player in any game,
                        regardless of anything.

           Ronnie sits up, proud of his dad.
                                 RONNIE
                        Just like any single point in

                        That’s right, Ronnie. Forget
                        about handicapping the players.
                        You’ll die a thousand deaths and
                        go broke. It’s all about the
                        numbers. They never lie.

           Looney tries to keep up.

                                 HARRY (cont'd)
                        Which is why?

                                 LOONEY
                        Your father understood that
                        people bet the sport wrong. They
                        go in asking who’s the best
                        player, pump their money in, and
                        walk away with nothing but a buzz
                        and a good story. Since I got
                        back, I’ve been searching. Trying
                        to understand what’s next for me.
                        And then I see this headline, and
                        I fucking knew. This is our

                        These new trifecta bets are high
                        risk, high reward. If I had the
                        brains to analyze the numbers,
                        I'd come up with a system to win
                        big. But, I don’t and you do.

           Ronnie picks up the Herald.

                        I should be stuck holding the
                        bag? What am I, a schmuck? A
                        charity paying for their house on

                        Consider it my debt.

           Alfie scoffs.

                        Law clerking for minimum wage?

                        Okay, big man. The debt's on you.
                        You owe me 175K. Get me 75 in the

                        payment plan after that. My gift

           Ronnie drives, wheels spinning in his head.

                        She was smart, made herself
                        valuable.

           In Ronnie's minds eye...

           INT.  FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - NIGHT

           Rose, nervous, moves down a hallway towards the
           Penthouse. The door opens, she walks in and it closes
           behind her.

           A truck speeds by blasting it's horn.

                        Fuuuuuck!
           I/E. C, S & B LAW FIRM - BOB BREIER'S OFFICE - DAY

           Ronnie knocks on the doorway of Bob's office.

                                 RONNIE
                        Mr. Breier.

                        Come in, Weiss.

           Ronnie crosses to Bob's desk.

                                 BOB (cont'd)
                        Things okay?

                                 RONNIE
                        Yes, everything's great.

                        You ready for the bar?

                                 RONNIE
                        Almost.

                                 BOB
                        Something I can help you with?

                                 RONNIE
                        Actually, I'm in a bit of a bind.

           Bob motions for Ronnie to take a seat.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        I was wondering if I could get an
                        advance.

                                 BOB
                        Advance?

                                 RONNIE
                        On my future salary.

                                 BOB
                        How much you need?

                                 RONNIE
                        $75,000.

           Bob sits back in his chair, shocked.

                                 BOB
                        What've you gotten yourself into?

           Ronnie doesn't answer.
                                 BOB (cont'd)
                        That's more than an entire first
                        year associate salary.

                                 RONNIE
                        I'll work until it's paid off,

                                 BOB
                        Couldn't if I wanted to. I have
                        overhead: employees, insurance. 

                                 RONNIE
                        I understand. 

                                 BOB
                        Have you spoken to Ben? He may be
                        able to help.

                                 RONNIE
                        No, and I'd prefer if you kept
                        this conversation between us.

           Bob exhales, thinks.

                                 BOB
                        Gimme a dollar.

                                 RONNIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 BOB
                        C'mon, gimme a dollar.

           Confused, Ronnie reaches into his pocket and takes out a
           dollar.

                                 BOB (cont'd)
                        Now you're a client, so I'll give
                        you the privilege.

                                 RONNIE
                        I appreciate it.

           Ronnie gets up and turns to leave.

                                 BOB
                        Ronnie, should I be worried?

                                 RONNIE
                        No, it's under control.
           INT. SHANKMAN HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Ronnie walks in, drained.

           Ben and his friends SETH and VICTOR, 60's, smoke cigars
           on the couch. Michigan State vs. USC basketball blares
           on the TV. Michigan’s winning.

                                 SETH
                        All I’m saying is if they landed
                        on the moon, we would’ve seen
                        something other than a few measly
                        pictures.

                                 VICTOR
                        What about the moon rock?

                                 SETH
                        Gimme a break.

                                 BEN
                        Why would they fake it?

                                 SETH
                        You ever heard of the arms race?

           Ronnie goes to the bar sink and washes his face.

                                 SETH (cont'd)
                        Also, it served as a distraction.

                                 BEN

           Ben laughs to his friends.

                        Kid comes home from college and
                        thinks I'm running a boarding
                        house.

           Ronnie zones out.

                        Ronnie!

                        Rent's due.

           Ben laughs again.

                        It’s not fucking over.

           The room closes in on Ronnie. He’s gonna pop.

           The game blasts on the T.V.

           Ronnie’s head spins.

                                 RONNIE
                        ENOUGH! Everybody SHUT UUUUUUP!

           The room goes quiet, except for the game. All the Men

                        You're the worst gamblers I’ve

                        lose.

           Ben looks at Ronnie like he’s crazy.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        All Michigan’s done all game is
                        hoist up three pointers. They
                        can’t get their inside game going
                        and USC has one of the best
                        defenses in the paint. Michigan’s
                        been shooting around 40%, which
                        is already way above their
                        average. They’re done. USC’s
                        defense will win out. Watch.

                        The hell you know?

           USC steals the ball. The PLAYER runs down the court and
           score. It’s a five point game.

                                 RONNIE
                        I read the newspaper. They

                        Number’s don’t lie.

           A light bulb goes off in Ronnie’s head.

           Michigan hoists up another three pointer. It hits the
           rim, USC snags the rebound, pushes the ball up the court
           and scores.

                        Smart kid. Get your wallet's out.

           Ronnie runs out of the house, slamming the door.

           Ronnie and Looney run into the lobby and up to the

           RECEPTIONIST walks them into the stacks. Rows and rows

                        Just dates, honey.

           Ronnie and Looney look up and down at the stacks.

           Ronnie and Looney walk out of the building, dejected. 

           I/E. RONNIE’S CAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Ronnie pulls up to Looney’s building.

                                 LOONEY
                        What made you change your mind?

                        What's the difference?

           Looney gets out and Ronnie drives off.

           INT. RONNIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ronnie sits on the edge of his bed, looking down at the
           jai alai article in the Miami Herald.

           He clicks his lamp off. BLACK.

           INT. C, S & B LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Ronnie sits at a conference table with Bob and POTENTIAL
           CLIENTS, facing the glass wall that looks out into the
           open office.
                                 BOB
                        What we offer is a comprehensive

                        the other side of this merger
                        with a rock solid financial
                        restructuring that'll save you a
                        lot of money and stand up to any
                        audit.

           Ronnie takes notes. Looking up, his eyes go wide as
           Looney walks into the office wearing ratty jeans, a t-
           shirt, and a week-long beard with a cigarette dangling
           from his mouth. 

                                 CLIENT
                        You think we'll get audited?

           Looney leans down to talk to the Receptionist, who
           points towards the conference room.

                                 BOB
                        You never know with the IRS. Why
                        take the chance?

           Bob follows Ronnie's gaze to see Looney approaching.

                                 BOB (cont'd)
                                (

                                           )
                        What the fuck?

           Looney slams both hands onto the glass partition,
           displaying jai alai programs.

                                 LOONEY
                        We hit the fuckin' mother load!

           Looney grins, gripping his cigarette in his teeth.

           Everyone in the room's shocked. Ronnie looks at Bob,
           mortified. Bob sees red.

           INT. LOONEY’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

           Looney drives.

                                 LOONEY
                        Saturday night. We were partying
                        at Rico’s after the matches.

           INT. PAPA RICO’S APARTMENT - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           Looney sits on the couch surrounded by people.
           A SEXY CUBAN in a skimpy red dress grabs Looney’s hand
           and leads him towards the back of the apartment.

           INT. PAPA RICO'S APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The Sexy Cuban pushes him down on the bed. Crawling on
           top of him, she unzips his pants and pulls them down.

           Slithering up the length of his body.

                                 SEXY CUBAN
                                (
                                 whispering
                                           )
                        Quiero verte (I want to see you.)

           She clicks on the lamp, dropping to her knees.

                                 SEXY CUBAN (cont'd)
                        Abre tus ojos (Open your eyes).

           Looney opens his eyes, through his drugged-out haze he 
           sees the walls papered with jai alai programs and bags
           of programs stacked across the length of the room.

           Jumping up, Looney knocks the girl onto her back and
           shimmies, pants around his ankles, towards the bags.

                                 SEXY CUBAN (cont'd)
                        What the fuck?

           Looney rips a program off the wall and flips to the back
           page, with its Win, Place, and Show results.

           Looney rushes out of the room tripping as he pulls up
           his pants. 

           EXT. PAPA RICO'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Ronnie and Looney stand at the door. Looney knocks.

                                 LOONEY
                        He’s a fuckin' night owl.

           The door opens and Papa Rico stands in a silk robe over
           boxers and a wife beater.

                                 PAPA RICO
                        Qué carajo, brothe’?! 

           Looney smiles.

           SUPER: THE SYSTEM

           Ronnie dumps a bag of programs onto the bed.

                        Turned out, Rico was a huge pack
                        rat. Had a treasure trove of over
                        4,000 jai alai programs from
                        prior seasons listing every
                        match's result.

           Ronnie and Looney pour through programs.

                        statistics had been compiled
                        because the bet was brand new. We
                        had to go through every program
                        and chart the win, place, show
                        results for every match.  

           TIME LAPSE -- Ronnie and Looney fill out a huge

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - DAY

           A PLAYER flings the pelota at the front wall - the ball
           ricochets from wall to wall.

                        A good or bad serve, a kill shot

                        bad bounce...
           PLAYER 2 runs to the ball and leaps off the side wall
           reaching high in the air. The pelota hits Player 2’s
           cesta and drops to the ground. Point over.

                        Spectacular Seven scoring gives
                        the advantage to players in
                        certain post positions.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - FRONTON - DAY

           PLAYERS line up on the bench, waiting to go out.

                        Every game starts with the 1st

                        post position, and so on. 

           Players in post position’s three through eight sit on a
           bench waiting their turn to play. They watch as Player 2
           slam the ball crushing the point.

                        points, wins.

           PLAYER 3 gets up to take on Player 2; 1 walks to the

                        Unfortunately, that was taking

                        reward for each winning volley
                        after the 1st round from 1 to 2
                        points. Speeding up the game.

                        By losing a single volley late in
                        the game, a player can go from
                        first to worst; sit at the end of
                        the bench, and never play again.
                        It’s ruthless.

           A Player loses a point and slams his cesta onto the
           granite floor in frustration. He knows he’s fucked, and
           walks towards the end of the bench.

           INT. PAPA RICO'S APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ronnie runs around the room, charting numbers,
           energized.

           Looney snorts a bump off the back of his hand.

                        The seventh and eighth positions
                        are at a serious disadvantage
                        because players starting closer
                        to the front of the line have
                        more opportunity to score points.

           TIME LAPSE -- programs stack neatly against the walls.
           Piles grow taller and taller.

                                 RONNIE
                        If we’re right, out of the 336
                        possible Trifecta combinations
                        certain numbers should come in
                        more frequently. Others will
                        never come in or only once in a
                        blue moon. So why bet them?

           Ronnie turns around.

           Ronnie walks out of the back room and stretches. He
           walks into the kitchen and he gets a glass of water.
           Ronnie sees Looney talking on the phone.

                                 LOONEY

                        Washington State minus 4, and
                        Foreman in 5.

           Ronnie takes note.

           INT. PAPA RICO'S APARTMENT - GUEST ROOM - DAY

           Ronnie, rocking a week-old beard, quietly concentrates,
           studying the numbers on the big ledger.

           Looney, pacing around, lights a cigarette. Ronnie stands
           up and looks at the charted combinations on the
           spreadsheet to see the frequency patterns for each one. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Now that we know how many times
                        each Trifecta combination comes
                        in from our sample of 4,000
                        results we need to figure out the
                        break-even payoffs for each of
                        the 336 possibilities.

           Grabbing the cigarette from Looney’s hand, Ronnie takes
           a drag and slowly nods his head.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        We gotta know how to bet em'.

                        How the fuck we do that?

                        Divide the number of times each
                        combination comes in from the
                        4,000 results. At $2 per
                        combination it would cost us
                        $8,000 to bet that number every
                        game.
                                (beat)
                        For example, if the 4-3-1
                        Trifecta came in 40 times and we
                        invested $8,000 betting it every
                        game then it would have to pay
                        $200 for us to break even.

           Ronnie writes this out on the big board.
                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        If a more difficult combination
                        comes in 12 times like the 8-7-4
                        and we invested $8,000 betting it
                        every game over the next 4,000
                        games then it would have to pay

                        That was only half the list, but

                        nothing to do with it.

           Ronnie takes Looney's hand.

                        Looney, no more gambling. We work
                        the system. That's it or I walk.

           Looney takes a beat.

                                 LOONEY
                        Deal.
           They shake.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - AUDITORIUM - MINUTES LATER

           Ronnie and Looney watch the match intently.

           PLAYER after PLAYER rotate on and off the bench. Points
           are won and lost.

           The scoreboard clicks to the seventh game.

           1-4-2 appears on the scoreboard. Ronnie marks a “W” next
           to 1-4-2 on his sheet.

           They lose the eighth game. Ronnie crosses it out,
           looking nervous. 

           The ninth game starts. The point goes back and fourth.

                                 RONNIE
                        Moment of truth.

           The sixth player wins, pumps his fist and sits down.
           Ronnie circles the number and marks it “W.”

           PLAYER 5 and PLAYER 2 playoff for Place and Show. Looney
           grips the back of the seat in front of him and Ronnie
           closes his eyes.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        We need player 5.

                                 LOONEY
                        Come on 5, come on!

           Player 2 over-serves the playoff point and loses.

           6-5-2 hits for the win!

           The scoreboard next to the court and T.V. screens in
           standing room areas flash the winning numbers: 6-5-2, 6-
           5-2, 6-5-2.

                                 RONNIE (V.O)
                        Only one ticket that night was
                        sold with the winning
                        combination.

           The screen flashes the winning payout: $10,000, $10,000,
           $10,000.

           The place goes crazy. The electricity in the air and
           noise levels throughout are deafening.
           Looney leaps up.

           Ronnie smiles, dazed.

                        We walked away with 13 grand and

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - NIGHT

           Cash fans through the machine.

           Ronnie, in brand new white sneakers, tight bell bottom
           jeans and a terry cloth polo, stands in front of the
           cashier, MAUREEN, 50's, blue hair, who pushes ten
           thousand dollar stacks toward him.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Once we had a decent stake, we
                        kept applying our system and it 
                        kept delivering. As time went
                        on...

           CU ON: Half-written list of combinations. New numbers
           start to appear down the page, filling in the negative
           space.

                        ...we added and dropped
                        combinations, increasing the size
                        of our list and betting the long
                        shots. 

           Ronnie rubs his eyes, tired.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        We bet 84 games a week for six
                        weeks. I felt 500 games was
                        enough to let the system work.
                        That meant that one of us had to
                        be at the fronton every match,
                        without fail.

           Ronnie takes a crisp hundred off the top and slides it
           to Maureen. 

                                 RONNIE
                        Thanks, Maureen.

           Maureen smiles. Ronnie walks down the hall.

                        If we missed betting games, we

           Ronnie's walks into the newsstand with his attaché case.

                        Told him I took an advance on

           INT. MIAMI FRONTON - TICKET WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           Ronnie walks past the ticket punchers.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        I put enough back to work the

                        new clothes.

           INT. MIAMI FRONTON - EXIT - CONTINUOUS

           Ronnie approaches the exit.

           He notices a CREEPER in a brown leather jacket.

                        Eventually, word spread about our
                        golden touch...

           Pushing off the wall, Creeper slips brass knuckles onto
           his hand. Ronnie turns and walks the opposite direction.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        ...which exposed us to
                        undesirables.

           Creeper gains on Ronnie who picks up the pace and ducks
           into the VIP cocktail lounge, nodding to a SECURITY
           GUARD.

           Creeper tries following Ronnie, but can’t get past the
           velvet rope.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - VIP COCKTAIL LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           Ronnie sits at the bar and flags the BARTENDER.

                                 RONNIE
                        Terry, could I use your phone?

           TERRY puts the phone on the bar and walks away. Ronnie
           dials and waits. The phone rings and rings.

           Ronnie hangs up, annoyed, as Terry walks back over.

                                 TERRY
                        All set?

           Ronnie nods and Terry puts the phone back.

                                 RONNIE
                        Seven and seven.

           INT. VIP COCKTAIL LOUNGE - MINUTES LATER

           Ronnie sips his drink and searches the room for Creeper.
           His eyes fall instead on a Cocktail Waitress, who we
           recognize as Rita, making her way across the room,
           balancing a tray of drinks.

           She looks at Ronnie, they lock eyes. BANG! A PATRON
           knocks into her tray, sending drinks flying.

           Terry rushes over with a bar towel. Everyone, including
           Ronnie, watches the commotion.
                                 TERRY
                        Jesus, Rita.

                        I’m sorry, he popped up outta
                        nowhere.

                                 PATRON
                        You should watch where you’re
                        going, bitch.

           Rita picks a drink up off the table next to her...

                                 RITA
                        My apologies, this one’s on the
                        house.

           ...and throws it in the guy’s face. People laugh. A few
           women clap.

           Terry tries to dry the guy off. Looks at Rita.

                                 TERRY
                        You’re fired.

                                 RITA
                        Over this asshole?

                                 TERRY
                        Adios.

                                 RITA
                        Fuck you, Terry.

           Ronnie tracks Rita as she walks toward the exit door,
           kicks it open, and disappears into the night.

           EXT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Ronnie walks out of the fronton, his attaché case
           tightly under his arm.

           Ronnie puts the key in his car door. BAM, brass knuckles
           rock the side of his head and he falls to the ground.

           Creeper violently grabs the attaché case and takes the
           money, leaving the case behind.

                        I don’t know how much longer we

                                 RONNIE
                        It’s not just security.
                        The pace, the hours. The whole
                        thing’s unsustainable.

                                 LOONEY
                        We’re making a fucking fortune.

                        Tell me what you need.

           EXT. RITA’S HOUSE - LITTLE HAVANA - DUSK

           Ronnie walks up to a one-story island-style bungalow and
           knocks. Salsa music plays through the open windows.
           Rita opens the door.

                                 RITA

           LARGE CUBAN MAN, 49, slim build with a mustache and an

                                 RONNIE
                        You're Jewban?

           Ronnie looks at Rita like she’s too good to be true.

                        He doesn’t want to stay papa.

           Ronnie walks past Rita through the doorway.

                        I’m starved.

           INT. RITA'S HOUSE - LITTLE HAVANA - LATER

           Rita’s father lights candles and says the Shabbat
           prayer.

           Ronnie, wearing a Yarmulke, keeps his eyes glued on
           Rita - who’s not so sure she likes it. 

           EXT. CALLE OCHO (SW 8TH ST.) - LITTLE HAVANA - LATER

           Ronnie and Rita walk past bustling bars and restaurants
           blaring Cuban music.

                                 RITA
                        So you gamble for a living?

                                 RONNIE
                        It's not gambling if you don't
                        lose.

                                 RITA
                        So you cheat?

           Ronnie laughs.

                                 RONNIE
                        No. I analyzed past winning
                        numbers based on certain
                        variables unique to the game and
                        when the trifecta bet was
                        introduced...um...

           Ronnie looks over at Rita, insecure.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        ...You don't want to hear this,
                        it's boring. 
                                 RITA
                        Boring?! You just told me that
                        you figured out a way to do what
                        legions of gamblers have been
                        trying to do for centuries - with
                        a pencil and paper. That's about
                        the least boring thing I've ever
                        heard.

           Ronnie's impressed by Rita's ability to keep up.

                                 RITA (cont'd)
                        Keep going.

           Ronnie considers if he should and then...

                                 RONNIE
                        So, we knew that people bet the
                        whole sport wrong...

           Ronnie talks excitedly as they walk through the streets.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Without a second thought, I told
                        her everything. The system.
                        Looney. My father. I'd known her
                        all of two hours and she knew
                        more about me than my oldest
                        friends. What can I say? I
                        trusted her.

           They continue walking and talking...

           EXT. CALLE OCHO (SW 8TH ST.) - CONTINUOUS

           ...walking and talking...

                                 RITA
                        I couldn't get used to the
                        structure of the hospital.
                        Thought my father was gonna have
                        a heart attack when I quit, but
                        he took it in stride.

                                 RONNIE
                        You two close?

           Rita nods.

                                 RITA
                        He's been fighting his whole
                        life. First Hitler. Then Batista.

                                 RITA (cont'd)
                        Then Castro. Taught me to stand
                        up for myself and what's mine.   

                                 RONNIE
                        How 'bout your mother?

           Rita's demeanor changes, she gets angry.

                                 RITA
                        When it was time to leave Cuba,
                        she lost her nerve. Rather die in
                        the familiar than take a chance
                        on the unknown. She was a coward.

           This resonates with Ronnie.

                                 RONNIE
                        You weren't scared?

                                 RITA
                        I got on that boat and never
                        looked back.

           Rita takes Ronnie's hand.

                                 RITA (cont'd)
                        Anything's possible here, that's
                        what I love. 

           Smiling mischievously, Rita pulls him into...  

           INT. BALL AND CHAIN - CUBAN BAR - CONTINUOUS

           ...Ronnie and Rita enter the bar, bustling with CUBANS
           dancing to a AFRO-CUBAN BAND. 

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        I read in Mademoiselle, that
                        everyone has a soulmate, one true
                        love somewhere out there in the
                        world. I call bullshit.
                        Trajectory. What it's all about.

           Rita leads Ronnie by the hand through the crowd toward
           the bar.

                                 RITA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Linking up with someone on the
                        same trajectory and feeding off
                        each other's mojo.

           Rita grabs the last two stools at the bar from a less
           aggressive COUPLE.
                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        She exuded confidence. Didn't
                        take shit off anybody.

           INT. BALL AND CHAIN - CUBAN BAR - LATER

           Ronnie and Rita talk and drink Mojitos.

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        He was cute. Told me about
                        growing up poor and how his
                        brains gave him opportunities
                        others in his situation didn't
                        have. Different from the guys I
                        was used to dating, machismo
                        Cubans...

           Two MACHISMO CUBAN's, 20's, feathered hair, stare at
           Rita from across the bar.

                                 RITA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        ...who cared more about their
                        bodies than mine.

           INT. BALL AND CHAIN - CUBAN BAR - LATER

           A CUBAN man, 60's, takes Rita's hand and the two salsa
           dance.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Rita was exotic. Before the
                        system, I never would've had the
                        confidence to land a girl like
                        her.

           All the men in the bar look at Rita as she dances.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        I was used to women like my
                        mother, hardened, cynical, unable
                        to trust. Rita was different. Had
                        a way of seeing the world. Spun a
                        negative into a positive.

           Rita, sweat glistening on her bronzed skin, dances up to
           Ronnie, putting her face close to his.

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        Ronnie had a quiet confidence. He
                        knew what he wanted and went
                        after it. But behind those eyes I
                        saw a sadness, a sweet soul.
                                 RITA
                        I see a sparkle in your eye.

           Rita points into his eye.

                                 RITA (cont'd)
                        Right there, I see it.

           Rita takes Ronnie's hand and the two dance. He's
           terrible.

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        He had two left feet, but he had
                        the balls to get out and dance
                        anyway. Life excited him and that
                        excited me. It turned me on.

           Rita takes Ronnie's face in her hands and kisses him.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        I felt like with her on my arm, I
                        could do anything.

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        We never left each other's side
                        again.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - TICKET AREA

           SUPER: THE TEAM

           Ronnie stands in line impatiently waiting to get his
           numbers down.

           The clock reads: 11:53 p.m.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        The first crucial team member we
                        needed was a ticket puncher ready
                        to place our bets before every
                        match. 

           Ronnie leans out to look at the front of the line.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        There was usually 13-15 minutes
                        to bet between games. If the
                        games ran long, we’d have less
                        time to get our tickets.

           An OLD LADY with a walker gets to the front of the line.
                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        We couldn’t anticipate everything
                        and there was no margin for
                        error. 

                                 OLD LADY
                        Who’s your favorite player?

                                 TICKET PUNCHER
                        Number 6, Joey Cornblit, he's the
                        best.

                                 PATRON
                        C'mon! Let's go!

           Ronnie looks over at Looney stuck in another long line.
           Ronnie puts his hands up: “Fuck!”

                                 OLD LADY
                        I’ll take number six to win.

           Old Lady dumps change out of her pocketbook.

           A warning bell goes off and a red siren light spins.

                                 RONNIE
                        C'mon!

           The clock on the wall tick, tick, ticks to: 12:00 a.m.

                                 TICKET PUNCHER
                        No more bets.

           The window closes. Ronnie’s furious.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        The worst feeling in the world
                        was getting shut out at the
                        window and having one of your
                        numbers come in for a big price.

           Ronnie marks his sheet with an “X” over the last match.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - NIGHT

           Ronnie, at the front of the line, bets the list.
                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        When we did get to the front of
                        the line, it took almost the
                        entire post time to punch out our
                        list. 99% of betters could finish
                        the exercise in a few seconds.
                        Not us. 

           TICKET PUNCHER goes fast, trying to keep up.

                                 RONNIE
                        4-3-1, 4-3-2...

                                 TICKET PUNCHER
                        Slow down please.

           Tickets pump out of the machine as the line stacks up.

           A big CRAZY CUBAN in a fedora, chewing on a cigar,
           becomes impatient.

                                 RONNIE
                        6-5-1, 6-5-2...

                        Coño meng! Hurry the fuck up!

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) 
                        Then the spotlight was on us and
                        our exposure went up.

           Patrons in other lines look over at Ronnie, curious
           about what he’s betting.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Our worst nightmare would be
                        someone catching on, getting the
                        list, and betting down our
                        numbers.

           Crazy Cuban bites down on his cigar and then moves
           toward Ronnie...

                                  RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Betting 150 plus combinations a
                        game, it was almost impossible to
                        blend in.

           ...grabbing him by the arm.

                                 CRAZY CUBAN
                        Qué pasando aqui arriba, bro?
                                 TICKET PUNCHER
                        Sir, please don’t touch other
                        patrons.

           Ronnie barely manages to grab all his tickets and
           escape.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        We needed a team to lighten the
                        load, spread out, give us an
                        advantage, and keep us from
                        getting killed in the process.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - TICKET AREA - DAY

           Ronnie and Looney stand across from the ticket area
           watching...

                                 LOONEY
                        John DeWees.

           ...who we recognize from the open, with long spider
           hands, sitting behind the window working the keyboard
           with dexterity, speed, and concentration.

                                 LOONEY (cont'd)
                        They call him the maestro. Hands
                        like a fucking concert pianist.

           Tickets pump out of the machine.

           Looney nods towards the window next to John.

                                 LOONEY (cont'd)
                        That's his wife, Kathy. 

           Kathy, with a Farrah Fawcett haircut, winks and jokes
           with an old man who palms her a tip, which she demurely
           deposits in her ample cleavage.

                                 LOONEY (cont'd)
                        She has her own talents.

                        I’ll separate out the winners

           INT. CALL CENTER - BISCAYNE BOULEVARD - DAY

           Ronnie and Looney walk through a bullpen of eager SALES

           John and Looney walk in.

           Towering identical twin brothers, VINNY and CHRIS

           Chris pounds it.

           BANG. BANG. BANG.

           Looney smiles.

                                 LOONEY

           Ronnie, attaché under his arm, approaches the ticket
           window - no line - opens the case and slides out a stack
           of winners.

           puts the cash in his case and walks out.
           I/E. MIAMI JAI ALAI - CONTINUOUS

           Ronnie exits the building where the DeLuca brothers, in
           matching velour warm-up suits, wait patiently. Ronnie
           nods at them and they follow him to his car.

                        Cash came in so quickly we barely
                        had time to get it into the bank.

           Ronnie opens the trunk and puts cash into a cardboard
           box filled with stacks of hundreds.

                        And I used the majority of my

           INT. RASCAL HOUSE - MIAMI BEACH

           Ronnie sits across the table from Rose. Two half-eaten
           sandwiches between them.

                                 ROSE
                        Shoulda' split one.

           Rose opens a leather cigarette purse, takes out a long
           Pall Mall, lights it and takes a deep drag.

           Ronnie slides a Tiffany box across the table.

                                 ROSE (cont'd)
                        What's this?

                        You don't have to worry about
                        Alfie anymore.

                        know you're not stupid.

           Rose takes another drag.

                        Talk.

           Rose pauses for a moment before cracking up.

                        Are you out of your fucking mind?

           Ronnie and Rita sit side by side. He whispers in her ear

           Looney sits behind them, annoyed.

           Ronnie hands her tickets with red crosses through the

           Rita puts the tickets in a bag and stores it under her

           Rita holds up an empty champagne glass, Terry runs over

           Rita looks over at Looney, sitting in the corner
           snorting cocaine from his bullet.

                        But his partner Looney, I knew
                        the type. Worked with them in the

           Looney and Rita make eye contact. Looney stands up and

                        Ronnie looked up to Looney, saw
                        him like an older brother.

           They win and Ronnie marks a "W" on his sheet.

           Alfie plays gin with a few other GUYS on deck. A BROAD

                        figure out a way to beat the

           Alfie winks. Ronnie's shocked that he knows.

                        You threatening me?

                                 ALFIE
                        Hey! I don't want any of that.
                        That's not my business model.
                        That's your money. You want to
                        bet jai alai, go ahead. You wanna
                        go back to the square world, I
                        support you. Whatever you want.

           He taps the bag.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        I'm whole again. Our business is
                        done. I'm just concerned for your
                        wellbeing's all. That much cash
                        can be corrosive. Don't want you
                        going down the wrong path.

                        I'm going back to the law firm.
                        Taking the bar next month and
                        becoming a lawyer.

                                 ALFIE
                        Yeah. Sure. Whatever. I'm happy
                        for you either way, boychick.
                        Good luck.

           Alfie sticks out his hand.

                                 ALFIE (cont'd)
                        It was business, never personal.

           Ronnie shakes Alfie's hand.
           Ronnie disembarks and walks down the dock.

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE  - LATER

           Ronnie's parked in front of the law firm looking up at
           the building.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Alfie had me pegged. He knew
                        exactly who I was. I couldn't go
                        back to sitting in an office all
                        day. Fuck that.

           Ronnie turns the key in the ignition and reverses.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Now that Alfie was paid in full,
                        I could reinvest every dime into
                        the system, make as much money as
                        humanly possible...

           Putting the car in first, Ronnie revs the engine. The
           sound gets louder and louder until it's a...

           ...Corvette engine - VRMMMMMM. He pops the clutch and
           speeds off...

           Ronnie and Rita speed up to the valet stand in a brand
           new Corvette Stingray, black with tan interior.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        ...and finally start enjoying the
                        fruits of my labor.

           Ronnie hops out, throws the keys to the Valet, and grabs
           Rita's hand spinning her around with elegance.

                                                           MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. MUTINY BAR - CHRISTMAS NIGHT

           Ronnie in his tuxedo spins Rita in her green sequined
           dress. The lovers kiss and dance as the -- CAMERA

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        The 1975 season was in the rear-
                        view mirror. The team was a well-
                        oiled machine, armed with cash
                        and every shortcut to maximize
                        the system.

           Ronnie pulls a diamond bracelet out of his pocket and
           hands it to Rita.

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        Ronnie and I were in love. I
                        could see spending the rest of my
                        life with him.

           Twisting her wrist, the bracelet sparkles in the club
           lights like a disco ball.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        I did what my father could never
                        do. I was becoming my own man. 

           Ronnie dances, carefree.

           Looney walks out of the bathroom, wiping cocaine
           remnants from his nose.

           Walking over to a house phone, Looney picks up the

           Looney grabs a champagne from a passing Slutty Santa and
           chugs it.

           Latin Band performs and the drummer bangs his congas.
           The energy reaches a frenzy.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        In the 40 some-odd years since
                        Florida legalized betting in the
                        sport of jai alai, there wasn’t a
                        peep. Not a murmur. Not an

           EXT. HARTFORD COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           A beautiful, sunny day on the golf course. Trees sway in
           the breeze. Swans swim in the lake. Fountains spurt
           water. MEMBERS make and miss putts.

           SUPER: HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT - 1976

           EXT. HARTFORD COUNTRY CLUB - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           HARVEY ZISKIS, 32, in country club clothes, sits on the
           bumper of his beat-up Chevy Monte Carlo, trunk ajar.
           Taking off his golf spikes, he bangs out the dirt,
           counts out $750 in cash, and slips it into his pocket.
           Putting on flip flops, he gets up and slams the trunk.   

           Three pissed-off MEMBERS, 40’s, fraternity-type WASPs in
           pastel golf outfits, stand in front of his car,
           accompanied by TWO CADDIES in white coveralls. 

                                 MEMBER 1
                        Friends of the club president,
                        huh, Jewboy?

           Ziskis beelines for his door and opens it. One of the
           caddies kicks the door shut.
                                 MEMBER 2
                        We ran into Cap and he never
                        heard of a Harvey Ziskis.

                        Best nine I ever played, swear.
                        Lucky shots all.

           Ziskis pulls the cash out of his pocket.

                        Here, take it.

                        Too late for that.

           The Country Clubbers jump Ziskis and wail on him.

           WHACK. WHACK. WHACK.

           EXT. HARTFORD COUNTRY CLUB - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           They slam his head into the Monte Carlo door.

           BANG.

           EXT. HARTFORD COUNTRY CLUB - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ziskis, bloodied, leans against his front tire. Member 2
           throws the cash in his face.

                                 MEMBER 2
                        We got our money's worth.

           Member 2 spits on Harvey.

                                 MEMBER 3
                        Better not see your kike ass
                        around here again.

           They walk away. The Members hi-five.

           Ziskis jams the bill in his nose to stop the bleeding. 

           EXT. HARTFORD COUNTRY CLUB - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Harvey crawls into his car, and reverses out. His rusted
           axle squeaks as he peels off.
           EXT. HARVEY’S STUDIO APARTMENT - LATER

           Ziskis limps into his dark, messy apartment, still
           bloody, clutching his ribs. His cat walks over and
           scratches at his leg.

           Ziskis kicks the cat. RAWR!

           He opens the freezer, grabs a bottle of cheap Vodka,
           swigs it and puts the bottle to his black eye.

           A framed picture of Ziskis, his WIFE and BABY GIRL, all
           smiles, sits on the bookshelf.

           Based on the appearance of the apartment they’re not
           living there. Another photo of Ziskis with his PLATOON
           in Vietnam.

           Ziskis clicks on the TV and slowly sinks into the couch,
           wincing in pain. 

           A commercial announcing the grand opening of the
           Hartford fronton appears.

           Ziskis takes out the cash with traces of blood, folds it
           and stuffs it under the couch cushion. 

           He watches the commercial intently, wheels spinning.

           EXT. HARTFORD HOLIDAY INN - DAY

           Looney stands in front of the hotel and snorts a bump of
           cocaine in each nostril from a bullet.

                        Once Miami Jai Alai closed for
                        the season, Hartford Jai Alai was
                        the place to be. Now we could
                        spend winters in Miami and
                        summers in Hartford at the two
                        biggest frontons in America.

           Ronnie and Rita pull into the parking lot in Ronnie’s
           Corvette Stingray. The front grill and windshield are
           plastered with dead bugs.

           They climb out and stretch.

           Looney walks over.

                                 LOONEY

           Ronnie, Rita and Looney walk into the fronton and

           Harvey Ziskis - still bruised from his beating - emerges
           from behind the counter and wipes it down.

                        ...and a Coke.

           Ziskis looks to Ronnie, who shakes his head. 

           Ziskis prepares the dogs.

                                 LOONEY
                        Kathy and John arrive today. I
                        got a designated ticket window
                        just for us. Had to tip this
                        ball-breaking security asshole,
                        but...

           Ronnie eyes Ziskis eavesdropping as he pours the Coke.
                                 LOONEY (cont'd)
                        ...I got the usual detail with a
                        special door to the parking lot.
                        Typically...

           Ronnie puts his hand on Looney's shoulder.

                                 RONNIE
                        Not here.

           Ziskis slides the Coke to Rita and Looney notices a
           U.S.M.C. (United States Marine Corp) tattoo on his
           forearm.

                                 LOONEY
                        What regiment?

                        Till the bitter end.

           Ronnie and Rita take in Ziskis’ black eye, swollen lip
           and scabby face.

                                 RONNIE
                        What happened?

           Ziskis gives Rita the creeps. She walks away.

                                 ZISKIS
                        I love me a Latin ass.

                        Ronnie, chill.  No hard feelings.

           Ronnie walks off.
           Looney pulls out a wad of cash. Peeling a hundred dollar
           bill off the top...

                                 LOONEY (cont'd)
                        Here.

           ...he hands it to Ziskis, who clocks the wad.

                        Keep it. 

           Looney grabs his dogs and walks after Ronnie. Ziskis
           follows Looney with with his eyes, slips the hundred
           into his pocket, and smiles.

                                 ZISKIS
                        See you 'round.

           Rita sits on Ronnie’s lap, relaxing at a Sunday BBQ,
           surrounded by jai alai PLAYERS and their WIVES.

           John, Kathy, and the DeLuca Brothers mingle.

                                 RITA (V.O)
                        When we weren't at the fronton,
                        we were hanging with players and
                        their wives.

           A Player's KID walks over and tugs on his MOTHER's arm.
           Rita leans down to talk to him.

                                 RITA
                        Cariño, ve a jugar y deja que
                        mami y Tía Rita hablen.

                        Rita loved it because all the
                        players wives were Latin and she
                        could speak Spanish.

           Looney sits next to them, bored. He checks his watch.

           A KID runs up to Looney and sprays him with a water
           pistol right in the face.

           Looney wipes his face, not amused.

                                 LOONEY
                        Perfect.

           Ronnie and Rita chuckle.

           Ziskis walks into the BBQ. Looney jumps up to greet him.

           Ronnie and Rita watch Looney walk towards Ziskis.

           Looney motions for Ziskis to join the party.

           Ronnie and Rita stay seated in their chair as...

           ... TIME LAPSE -- The BBQ continues through three
           seasons.
           Everyone goes from summer to winter clothes as the
           leaves turn from green to orange and yellow and then
           fall off the trees.

           The BBQ party never stops...

                        Right when Rita warmed up to
                        Hartford, it got cold.

           Rita, in a thick fur coat, watches Looney and Ziskis
           talk quietly to a Player, DOMINGO, 20's, tall, lanky.

           Looney removes a glove from his hand, takes a bump from
           his bullet and passes it to Ziskis.

                                 RITA (V.O.)
                        Ronnie thought over time winning
                        might change Looney, but you
                        can’t change who you are. 

           Rita nudges Ronnie and motions her head towards Looney
           and Ziskis.

           Ronnie takes note.

           INT. HARTFORD JAI ALAI - VIP BOX - NIGHT

           Ronnie stands in his box, staring out at the court, the
           king in his kingdom.

           Looney and Ziskis rail cocaine with RANDOM GIRLS.

           Ziskis watches Ronnie take out his list and mark "W."

           Rita enters the VIP with a bag of win tickets and slides
           it behind a seat in the corner.

           Ziskis' eyes follow Rita's ass as she sits. Ziskis looks
           over at Ronnie who stares right at him. The two lock
           eyes, Ziskis grins.

           Ronnie turns back to the match and slips his list into
           his pocket.

           Rita looks back over her shoulder at Ziskis who blows
           her a kiss.

           Ronnie and Rita watch a match in tense silence.

           Domingo, who we recognize from the the BBQ, gets up to
           serve. Standing at the service line, he glances over his
           shoulder.

           Ronnie follows his gaze to Looney and Ziskis, standing
           behind the player's bench. He watches them exchange a
           nod.

           Domingo under-serves the point.

           The other PLAYER reacts, getting in Domingo's face. They
           begin to fight. 

           The large CROWD jumps up and gasps.

           SECURITY runs onto the court and breaks up the fight.

           Ronnie watches Looney and Ziskis walk up the aisle. 

           Ronnie hands Rita the car keys.

           EXT. HARTFORD JAI ALAI - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Snow comes down as Rita walks out to Ronnie’s car
           sitting all alone in the parking lot.

           Pulling her collar up around her neck to shield her from
           the icy wind, Rita reaches the car and tries to open the
           door. The handle and lock are frozen shut.

           Looney and DeLuca Brothers break up Ronnie and Ziskis.

                        We got something going here that

           EXT. HARTFORD JAI ALAI - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           A Lincoln town car pulls up behind Rita. Its tires
           crackle on the black ice-covered asphalt.

           Rita turns around.

           the passenger side window lowers, revealing TWO GOONS

           Passenger approaches Rita, unscrewing the thermos and
           pours steaming hot coffee on the Corvette handle and
           lock, melting the ice.

           Rita turns to thank him and BAM!

           The metal thermos cracks Rita across the face. She falls
           to the asphalt. Her nose gushes blood.

                        she could've suffered
                        hypothermia, which can be
                        especially dangerous in her

                        Turns out, the more we won, the

                        base, but Rita was right. I
                        should've seen it. I fuckin' grew
                        up with it.

           Looney puts his head in his hands.

                                 LOONEY
                        I was sure I could make it up on
                        the side without coming to you.

           Shutting the trunk, Ronnie circles to the driver's side
           and gets in. 

           Speeding out, they head south toward Miami.

                        That means, I'd have to average

           The door to the Lincoln opens. Ronnie rushes to put his
           key in the door...

           An OLD WOMEN gets out of the Lincoln and heads toward
           the restaurant. 

           Ronnie quickly jumps in his Corvette and speeds off.

                        over time. Some days are better
                        than others. If some grandma
                        comes in on an afternoon, bets
                        her birthday and hits, that
                        dilutes the pot.

           Grandmas win big and cheer.

           Ronnie's Corvette pulls up to the curb.

           Rita's father looks through the blinds, paranoid.

           He answers the door in his robe holding a bolt action
           army riffle. He nods to Ronnie, who hops out of his
           Corvette and rushes into the house.

           Rita sleeps on the couch, Ronnie covers her with a

           yell at him for the delay.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        I don't know if Looney showed
                        Ziskis more than he should've or
                        if he  picked up some of our
                        combinations from hanging around.

           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - AUDITORIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ronnie watches Ziskis from across the auditorium. A

                        I could get used to this.

           Maureen smiles dryly and counts his money out.

                                 MAUREEN
                        Here, let me give you a bag for
                        all your winnings.
           Maureen reaches under the counter, grabs a brown paper
           bag and slips in his cash.

           Ziskis takes the bag, slides a five across the counter.

                                 ZISKIS
                        Get yourself a drink on me.

                                 MAUREEN
                        You're too kind.

           Ziskis walks towards the front door.

           Two SECURITY GUARDS approach.

                                 SECURITY GUARD 1
                        I'm gonna need to search your
                        bag.

                                 ZISKIS
                        What's the problem? I won this
                        fair and square.

                                 SECURITY GUARD 2
                        Then you should have nothing to
                        worry about.

           Ziskis reluctantly hands over the bag. Security Guard 1
           thumbs through Ziskis' winnings. He finds a cashed win
           ticket.

                                 SECURITY GUARD 1
                        What's this?

           Ziskis looks confused.

                                 ZISKIS
                        That's a mistake. An oversight,
                        she must've...

           He looks over at Maureen's window. A different CASHIER
           occupies her booth.

                                 SECURITY GUARD 2
                        Please follow us, sir.

           Ronnie stands across the room watching Security grab
           Ziskis by the arm and usher him away.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Trying to re-cash a win ticket,
                        big no no, illegal and could get
                        you banned for life.
           INT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - UPSTAIRS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ziskis sits in front of a MANAGER pleading his case.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Ziskis was banned for one year.

                                 ZISKIS
                        I'll tell you one thing, you
                        throw me outta here, I'm gonna
                        blow the lid off this place!

           Ziskis stands up writhing, his chair falls back.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        I heard he didn't take it so
                        well.

           I/E. MIAMI JAI ALAI - MOMENT LATER

           Ziskis, in a choke hold, is thrown out of the fronton.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        With Ziskis out of the picture, I
                        could get back to work.

           EXT. MIAMI JAI ALAI - PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Ronnie walks through the parking lot, flanked by DeLuca
           Brothers. A black Lincoln town car with limo-tinted
           windows pulls up and drives beside him, slowly.

           Ronnie stops dead. DeLuca Brothers pull out 9mm pistols
           and RACK the slides.

           The car stops. DeLuca Brothers train their guns on the
           vehicle. The front door opens and Ronnie watches,
           anxiously, anticipating a mobster. Instead AGENT PARKER,
           40’s, emerges in a cheap gray suit and flashes his
           badge.

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        Special agent Parker, FBI.
                        Expecting somebody else?

           INT. FBI OFFICES - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Ronnie sits in front of Agent Parker and his partner,
           AGENT STEVENS, 50’s, grizzled.
                                 AGENT PARKER
                        We know that you and your
                        partner've been betting lists...

                                 RONNIE
                        Not illegal.

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        ...making a fortune...

                                 RONNIE
                        Just living the American Dream.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        And you expect us to believe it's
                        all above board?

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        Who you workin' for?

                                 RONNIE
                        Myself.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        You a stand in? Who's bankrolling
                        your operation?

                                 RONNIE
                        Happy to put you in contact with
                        my accountant, I have nothing to
                        hide.

           Agent Stevens opens a file and slides several
           surveillance photos across the table.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        You sure about that, tough guy?

           Ronnie's eyes moves back and forth over photos of his
           life over the last few months:

           Rita getting jumped in the parking lot.

           Looney and Ziskis talking to the Boston Guys.

           Ronnie and Ziskis fighting at Hartford fronton.

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        You keep pretty rough company for
                        such straight shooters.
                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        Winter Hill gang don't fuck
                        around. These guys fix horse
                        races, ship guns to the IRA...

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        ...Whaddaya think they do to guys
                        with over a million in
                        outstanding debts?

           Ronnie looks up coolly.

                                 RONNIE
                        I've had a long night. As much as
                        I appreciate the education, I've
                        done nothing illegal. Charge me
                        or let me go.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        We have testimony from Domingo
                        Santiago that he received money
                        from your partners, Harmen and
                        Ziskis, to tank games.

                                 RONNIE
                        Harvey Ziskis isn't my partner, I
                        hardly know the guy.

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        Well, he sure seems to know you.

           They slap down an early edition of tomorrow's Miami
           Herald with the headline: "ILLEGAL HAPPENINGS AT MIAMI
           JAI ALAI."

           Ronnie picks up the paper and reads.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Turns out, Ziskis was true to his
                        word on one thing...

           EXT. MIAMI HERALD BUILDING - DAY

           Ziskis walks into the building.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        ...he walked directly from the
                        fronton to the Miami Herald and
                        talked a journalist's ear off for
                        eight hours straight.
           INT. MIAMI HERALD BUILDING - NEWSROOM - DAY

           Ziskis spills his guts to a REPORTER.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Gave them all our names, our team
                        of employees at the fronton, and
                        everything he knew about the
                        system. 

           INT. HARTFORD JAI ALAI - TICKET WINDOW - NIGHT

           Ziskis watches Rita take a brown paper bag of win
           tickets from Kathy.

           INT. FBI OFFICES - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ronnie finishes reading the article...

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        ...Everything. We were dubbed,
                        The Miami Syndicate.

           ...and looks up.

                                 RONNIE
                        This guy's a hustler and a liar,
                        he can't prove any of this and
                        neither can you.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        That may be true, but
                        unfortunately for you, our boss
                        doesn't like getting scooped by
                        the Miami-fucking-Herald.

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        She's ready for a few of her own
                        headlines, and you're...

           Parker picks up the paper and throws it in the trash.
                                 AGENT PARKER (cont'd)
                        ...as good a place to start as
                        any.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        So if you wanna see your kid
                        before his seventh birthday,
                        you'll help us...

           Stevens sets down a picture of Alfie Mart standing in
           front of Alfie's Newsstand on Miami Beach.

                                 AGENT STEVENS (cont'd)
                        ...get Alfie Mart.

           Ronnie looks down at the picture and back up at the
           agents, blankly.

                                 RONNIE
                        Never met him.

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        Uncle Alfie, yeah right.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        30 years. That's how long Alfie
                        Mart kept his nose clean and out
                        of trouble. A few minor arrests,
                        but never convicted. Now they
                        wanted me to help take him down. 

           Agent Parker gets in Ronnie's face.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        When your father did a half
                        gainer off the Eden Roc hotel,
                        Alfie took care of you.

                                 AGENT PARKER
                        And let's not forget about mom.

           Agent Parker winks.

                                 RONNIE
                        Go fuck yourself.

                                 AGENT STEVENS
                        Wear a wire, get us something we
                        can use.  

           Ronnie sits back in his chair, defeated.
                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        Were we breaking the law? No. Was
                        there a vast gray area of
                        unregulated shit we took full
                        fucking advantage of? You better
                        believe it.

           Ronnie walks out of the FBI offices.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        I knew when I left the Fed's
                        office that day, I'd never step
                        foot inside a fronton again.

           INT. RITA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           Ronnie walks in to find Rita sitting in the darkened
           living room.

                                 RITA
                        How was work?

                                 RONNIE

                                 RITA
                        I thought we weren't gonna do
                        that?

                                 RONNIE
                        What?

                        picked up.

           Ronnie looks at Rita, caught.

                        They're just cage rattling. They

                        I just need a little more time,
                        figure things out.

                                 RITA
                        You don't have it. Not with me.
                        I'm done.

           Ronnie moves towards her.

                                 RONNIE
                        Rita, please, listen.

           Rita holds up her hand, stopping him.

                                 RITA
                        No. You listen to me. This is not
                        about us anymore.

           Rita touches her stomach.

                                 RONNIE
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 RITA
                        Let's go somewhere, I don't care.
                        Disappear.

                                 RONNIE
                        They'll kill him.

                                 RITA
                        That's not your problem.

           Rita looks at Ronnie, finally understanding the
           situation.

                                 RITA (cont'd)
                        We're your family now. You have
                        to let him go. A new door's
                        opened, I'm walking through it
                        with or without you.
                                 RONNIE
                        I can't let him die!

                                 RITA
                        Well, then I don't want you here.
                        Leave.

           Ronnie doesn't move.

                                 RITA (cont'd)
                        Get out!

           Ronnie turns and walks out.

           INT. SHANKMAN HOME - SUNROOM - NIGHT

           Rose and Ben play gin rummy with another COUPLE.

           Ronnie walks into the room.

                                 BEN
                        Look who it is, Mr. Miami.
                        Whataya want? We're in the middle
                        of an important hand.

           Rose sees the distress on Ronnie's face.

                                 ROSE
                        I'm out.

           She throws her cards away.

                                 BEN
                        Rose, that was a big hand.

                                 ROSE
                        You'll survive. I need to talk to
                        my son.

           Rose gets up and walks towards the kitchen. Ron follows.

           INT. SHANKMAN HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Rose sits at the kitchen table.

           She takes a cigarette out of her top shirt pocket,
           lights it, and exhales smoke.

           Ronnie paces back and forth.

                                 RONNIE
                        I'm in trouble.
                                 ROSE
                        Sit, you're making me nervous.
                        We'll figure it out, we always
                        do.

                                 RONNIE
                        Not this time. I can't find the
                        angle.

                                 ROSE
                        There's always an angle, you just
                        need to make the right deal.

                                 RONALD
                        What if there's no good deal?

                                 ROSE
                        Then jump.

                                 RONNIE
                        Huh?!

                                 ROSE
                        Just go jump.
                                (
                                                 )
                                 Ronnie's shocked
                        No, you're not gonna do that.
                        That's not an option, so think.
                        What do you have the other guy
                        wants? We all make our deals.
                        Your father made his...

           Rose looks around the house.

                                 ROSE (cont'd)
                        I made mine.

           Rose stands up, turns on the sink and extinguishes the
           cigarette. Putting the butt in the garbage can.

                                 ROSE (cont'd)
                        You just have to decide what
                        you're willing to give up.

           She walks out, door swinging behind her.

           EXT. ALFIE'S NEWSSTAND - DAY

           Ronnie stands out in front of Alfie's newsstand and
           adjusts his shirt...

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        I had to make a move.
           ...and walks inside.

           INT. RONNIE'S CAR - DAY

           Ronnie sits in a parked car across the street from the
           Eden Roc Hotel wearing the suit Ben gave him. Taking in
           the building, he steadies himself, turns on the car and
           pulls into the driveway.

           INT. EDEN ROC HOTEL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Walking into the lobby of the storied hotel, Ronnie
           catches his image in the mirror and adjusts his tie as
           he approaches the elevator.

           The bell dings, and Ronnie enters as the doors shut
           behind him.

           INT. EDEN ROC HOTEL - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ronnie walks into the suite. One of the Goons who
           assaulted Rita pats him down and leads him out onto...

           I/E. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           ...A balcony overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. HOWIE
           WINTER, 50's, flat face, thick head of ginger hair,
           wearing an open bathrobe over a swimsuit, stands at the
           railing peering out.

                                 WINTER
                        Crazy how vast this fuckin' world
                        is. Hard enough for guys like me
                        to escape the little shit
                        neighborhoods we grew up in, let
                        alone wrap our heads around all
                        this.

           Winter turns and examines Ronnie, who's already sweating
           in the thick Miami air.

                                 WINTER (cont'd)
                        Wrong suit, kid.

           Sitting down at a small table, Winter motions for Ronnie
           to join him.

                                 WINTER (cont'd)
                        What's it like to grow up in a
                        place like this?
           Ronnie sits down. A platter of Joe's Stone Crab claws
           sits on the table between them.

                                 RONNIE
                        Only the tourists get this view.

                                 WINTER
                        Love the tropics, but damn I
                        don't belong here.

           Winter nods towards the beach.

                                 WINTER (cont'd)
                        Twenty minutes down there, I look
                        like a fuckin' lobsta'.

           Winter grabs a stone crab claw.

                                 WINTER (cont'd)
                        So I wake up before the sun and
                        go float.

           Dipping the claw in mustard sauce, Winter sucks the meat
           off the bone in one quick motion and tosses the shell
           off the balcony.

                                 WINTER (cont'd)
                        Then the rest of the day I sit up
                        here in the shade and listen to
                        that damn ocean, get a little me
                        time.

           Winter closes his eyes and listens to the waves crashing
           in the background. Opening his eyes, he looks at Ronnie.
           He's no longer friendly.

                                 WINTER (cont'd)
                        Alfie got you in the room - so
                        tell me, why am I cutting into me
                        time talking to you instead of
                        throwing you over the fucking
                        balcony?

                                 RONNIE
                        I have a proposition.

                                 WINTER
                        I'm not lookin' for a new
                        partner, I'm lookin' for the
                        million dollars you and your
                        friend owe me...

           Winter looks at Ronnie's feet.
                                 WINTER (cont'd)
                        ...and I-don't-see-it.

                                 RONNIE
                        That's 'cause I don't have it.

           Winter motions for the Goons to toss Ronnie. Grabbing
           him under the arms, they drag him to the railing, and
           lower him over the edge by his ankles.

           Ronnie speaks upside down.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        I have a way you can make ten
                        times the money we owe! Legally!
                        Above board!

           Winter holds up his hand for the Goons to give Ronnie a
           second. 

           They lift Ronnie back up and drop him on the balcony.

           We -- TRACK BACKWARDS -- off the balcony. 

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        So I gave the Boston mob the
                        entire system in exchange for
                        Looney's debt.

           INT. EDEN ROC HOTEL - LOBBY - LATER

           Ronnie strolls through the lobby, relieved.

                                 RONNIE (V.O.)
                        They must've done well, because I
                        never heard from them again. It
                        could also be because the Winter
                        Hill Gang got into some trouble
                        of their own.

           EXT. EDEN ROC HOTEL - VALET STAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Ronnie takes one last look up at the 10th floor balcony,
           gets in his car and drives off.

           INT. DEUCE BAR - NIGHT

           Looney sits at the bar nursing a beer. Ronnie walks in
           and sits next to him. 

                                 RONNIE
                        It's done. I gave Winter Hill the
                        system. 

                                 LOONEY
                        You crazy?! This is just a bump
                        in the road, we could've made it
                        all back and then some.

                                 RONNIE
                        We're done. 

           Looney takes a long sip of his drink, thinking.

                                 LOONEY
                        When I heard you were back and
                        saw that trifecta bet, I thought
                        this could be a way for you and I
                        to run the bases again.

                                 RONNIE
                        We're not in little league
                        anymore. I'm gonna have my own
                        family. I have to take care of
                        them.

           Ronnie looks at him, making a decision.

                                 RONNIE (cont'd)
                        My father was proud of you.
                        Sometimes I think he loved you
                        more than me.
                                 LOONEY
                        That's not true and you know it.
                        He saw himself in you and that
                        scared him to death.

                                 RONNIE
                        I wish I could have one more day
                        with him. Even just an hour, so I
                        could ask him why he did it.

                                 LOONEY
                        Does it matter?

                                 RONNIE
                        It does to me.
                                (
                                 Ronnie tears up
                                                )
                        Why were we never enough?

                                 LOONEY
                        You'd only be asking him what he
                        asked himself every day. Drunks
                        don't know why they're drunks...
                        they drink. No one wants to fuck
                        up their lives, we just do. 

           Ronnie, realizes that they're not talking about Harry

                        about Ziskis and their plans to

                        Jai alai's still around, but it's
                        a shell of what it once was.

                        As for the Feds, with the right
                        legal advice and the deal Looney
                        made, the DA didn't have enough
                        to build a case against me. If
                        they wanted Alfie, they'd have to
                        find their own way.

           Alfie stands at the payphone talking business.

           A BEAT COP walks up behind him, and overhears part of

                        And if it wasn't for a Miami

                        point spreads they probably never
                        would've. Arrested him on
                        probable cause. Can you believe
                        that? Dumb-fuckin'-luck. Spent

                        After the baby was born, Rita and

                        Because Looney broke the law in
                        Hartford, he served his time in
                        Connecticut.

           Looney slides in and there's a bag on the back seat. He
           opens the bag and it's filled with cash.

           Looney wins a hand and rakes in the chips, smiling.

                        I heard he stayed clean after
