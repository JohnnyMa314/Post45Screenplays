           EXT. PODIUM - RICE UNIVERSITY - DAY

           ON A MASSIVE AMERICAN FLAG BLOWING PICTURESQUELY IN THE 
           BREEZE. Just BEYOND it... is a PERFECTLY BLUE SKY... THE MOON 
           is showing itself in the bright light of day, reminding us 
           that we’re part of something much BIGGER than ourselves.

           WE PULL BACK ON JOHN F. KENNEDY (45). He’s at the podium 
           staring out into a sea of students. Behind him, members of 
           the faculty are sitting, hanging onto his every word as if he 
           were Aristotle speaking to a mass of young Alexander The 
           Greats.

           SUPER: SEPTEMBER 12, 1962

                                 JOHN F. KENNEDY
                        ...No man can fully grasp how far 
                        and how fast we have come, but 
                        condense, if you will, the 50,000 
                        years of man’s recorded history in 
                        a time span of but a half-century. 
                        Stated in these terms, we know very 
                        little about the first 40 years, 
                        except at the end of them advanced 
                        man had learned to use the skins of 
                        animals to cover them. Then about 
                        10 years ago, under this standard, 
                        man emerged from his caves to 
                        construct other kinds of shelter. 
                        Only five years ago man learned to 
                        write and use a cart with wheels. 
                        Christianity began less than two 
                        years ago. ...The printing press 
                        came this year, and then less than 
                        two months ago, during this whole 
                        50 year span of human history, the 
                        steam engine provided a new source 
                        of power.

           JFK adjusts his tie, looks out into the crowd, gripping the 
           podium, refocusing... 

                                 JOHN F. KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        Newton just explored the meaning of 
                        gravity... Last month electric 
                        lights and telephones and 
                        automobiles and airplanes became 
                        available. ...Only last week did we 
                        develop penicillin and television 
                        and nuclear power, and now if 
                        America's new spacecraft succeeds 
                        in reaching the moon, we will have 
                        literally reached the stars before 
                        midnight tonight...

                            (beat)
                        This is a breathtaking pace, and 
                        such a pace cannot help but create 
                        new ills as it dispels old. New 
                        ignorance. New problems. New 
                        dangers. Surely the opening vistas 
                        of space promise high costs and 
                        hardships, as well as high 
                        reward...

           Full of HOPE, the students begin to CLAP. The faculty follows 
           soon behind... everyone in attendance is giving the president 
           a standing ovation. America is ready to, Go Where No Man Has 
           Gone Before. At least for a little while... 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           BLACK SCREEN. RUN CAPTIONS:

           Christmas 1972. Apollo 17 ushered the last 12 men into space 
           and onto the moon. 

           America’s interest in space travel by that time was DEAD. 

           The government had turned it’s attention and investments 
           toward the Vietnam War. Thus forcing the Apollo program to 
           SHUT DOWN. 

           During that time The Equal Employment Opportunity Act was 
           passed. Authorizing the illegality of discrimination based on 
           gender. Every government agency was ordered to comply.

           After the Vietnam War ended, America looked toward the stars 
           once more...

           With a small budget, a new program to create a shuttle fleet 
           was set into motion. A program that had to INCLUDE women. 

           FADE IN...

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - HOUSTON TEXAS - MORNING

           SUPER: NASA’S APOLLO PROGRAM TRAINING FACILITY, 1975

           DARKNESS. WE SEE NOTHING BUT CAN HEAR THE RATTLING OF A LARGE 
           AIR DUCT. FOOTSTEPS... A SWITCH is TURNED ON... OLD APOLLO 
           ASTRONAUTICS TRAINING EQUIPMENT is ILLUMINATED EXPOSING DUST 
           from years of SITTING UNUSED in the DARK. THE MOON LANDING 
           MODULE’S AMERICAN FLAG HAS FALLEN OVER. THE SUBMERGENCE TANK 
           IS EMPTY. THE LUNAR ROVER’S TIRES HAVE DEFLATED... NASA 
           ADMINISTRATOR, JAMES C. FLETCHER (50’s thin, tall) WALKS INTO 
           FRAME... his hands in his suit pockets. 
           He HALTS and takes in the relics as if they were old 
           comforting friends. GEORGE ABBEY (44, dark hair, kind eyes a 
           reassuring face) HEAD of FLIGHT OPERATIONS and the ASTRONAUT 
           SELECTION BOARD, ENTERS. James doesn’t turn around, his focus 
           stays on the Apollo toys as if he were standing at a grave 
           site.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        Hello, George.

           George looks around at the machines indifferently. He clears 
           his throat -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        ...They’re ready whenever you are.

           James nods. 

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        ...When man learned to walk, do 
                        ever think that it may have hurt?

           George considers it. He looks at James’ stern glare. He tries 
           to break the tension -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        ...Not if he walked slow.

           James’ doesn’t laugh.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        I can’t help but feel as though 
                        NASA is crippled. That, or mankind 
                        is reverting... people only see 
                        what’s in front of them these days.

           George peers up at the large rafters. 

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Whenever I’m feeling down, my wife 
                        always tells me that every 
                        accomplishment starts with the 
                        decision to try...

           Glancing over -

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        You’re feeling down?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Not today, no.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        But, you like it here...
                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Of course. ...It was an example, 
                        James. 

           James exhales. Straightens himself up. 

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        An example. This entire operation 
                        was an example. An example of what 
                        we could become... and now, what? 
                        We mull around, orbiting the 
                        Earth... releasing satellites? We 
                        won the race but lost the marathon. 
                            (beat)
                        There will never be another John 
                        Glenn, Gus Grissom, John Young...

           Optimistically -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        There could be someone just as 
                        exciting. Just as good even...

           James shakes his head and places his defeated hand on 
           George’s shoulder, turning to him -

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        You can tell them I’m ready.

           George nods, walks out. James moves toward the Moon Landing 
           Module... he runs his hand along the ladder. BRIGHT SUNLIGHT 
           EMERGES THROUGH as the MASSIVE SLIDING DOORS OPEN... James 
           turns, SQUINTING as the facility’s LARGE GOVERNMENT TRUCKS 
           BEEP, BACKING UP onto the SIGHT. The men EXIT the trucks. One 
           of the drivers hands James a clipboard - 

                                 GOVERNMENT OPERATOR 
                        Mister Fletcher?

           James nods.

                                 GOVERNMENT OPERATOR (CONT’D)
                        Just sign here... and here...

           James reluctantly signs. The man whistles. The men begin 
           unemotionally disassembling the Apollo equipment. WE TRACK 
           BEHIND James as he WALKS OUT OF THE -

           EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

           He looks back as the men TOSSING the equipment into the 
           trucks as if it were nothing more than a play-set. James 
           PEERS UP at the SKY and CLOSES his eyes.

           “GOOD MORNING STARSHINE” by OLIVER CONTINUES OVER:

           WE’RE WATCHING THE SUN RISE OVER the San Fernando valley... 
           ANGLE ON TWO HANDS HOISTING UP, GRIPPING a tree branch... 
           WIDE: ON an attractive brunette woman with curly feathered 
           hair and piercing blue eyes. THIS IS SALLY RIDE (24). She 
           PULLS HERSELF UP INTO the orange tree, barefoot, wearing 
           flannel pajamas and a tote over her shoulder. She looks WILD. 

           Sally BEGINS picking the oranges, placing them in her tote. 
           She continues watching the SUN RISE over the mountain, she 
           loses her balance, she CATCHES herself... ALL of her oranges 
           FALL out of her bag... 

           EXT. DALE & CAROL RIDE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           “GOOD MORNING STARSHINE” by OLIVER FADES OUT.

           Sally is RUNNING barefoot towards a pretty, ranch style home. 
           Her parents house. She PULLS her tote off as she gets to the 
           side (kitchen) door.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Sally’s mother, CAROL JOYCE RIDE (late 40’s) is making 
           breakfast. There’s a small television on the counter in the 
           corner, the SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN is on. Sally ENTERS and 
           PULLS her tote over her head setting it on the counter. 
           Kissing Carol’s cheek -

                                 SALLY 
                          (cheerfully)
                        Morning mom...

           Taking in sally’s wild bed-head and attire -

                        My god, you were out there 
                        barefoot?

           Grabbing an orange, pulling up a chair, sitting in it 
           backwards -

                                 SALLY
                        I wanted to get grounded...
                                 CAROL RIDE
                        And pajamas? Really, what would the 
                        neighbors think?

                                 SALLY
                        They would probably think, flannels 
                        are really hot for California... I 
                        need new clothes now that I’m 
                        home...

           Carol SIGHS and shakes her head as she continues to cook. 
           DALE BURDELL RIDE (50’s, a political science college 
           professor) ENTERS in corduroy slacks, collard shirt and tie. 
           Kissing Sally on the head as she watches the SIX MILLION 
           DOLLAR MAN -

                                 DALE RIDE
                        There’s my little dropout...

           Sally puts the orange peel over her teeth and smiles at him. 

                                 DALE RIDE (CONT’D)
                        Hope you’re not wearing those to 
                        your first day of school...

                                 SALLY
                        I’m hoping Bear can loan me 
                        something... 

           Setting down a plate of pancakes and eggs -

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        It’s still snowing in Swarthmore?

           Turning her chair around, fixing her plate -

                                 SALLY
                        It was when I left.

           The last to ENTER is KAREN “BEAR” RIDE (17). She’s fully 
           dressed for school in a floral shirt and (short) skirt with 
           knee high boots. She takes a seat next to Sally.

                                 DALE RIDE
                           (to Bear)
                        I hope you know you’re not wearing 
                        that...

                                 BEAR RIDE
                        It’s not like I’m at your school, 
                        daddy...
                                 DALE RIDE
                        If you were at my school I’d send 
                        you home...

                                 SALLY
                        If Bear were at your school she 
                        wouldn’t take your class, dad. 

           Sally elbows Bear and smiles.

                                 BEAR RIDE
                        I like Political Science... 

           Taking a seat at the table -

                                 CAROL RIDE
                          (to Sally)
                        I wish you had transferred to Santa  
                        Monica College... you and dad could 
                        carpool.

                                 DALE RIDE
                        No. It’s a hard enough keeping 
                        track of my students, let alone my 
                        own daughter... 

                                 SALLY
                        UCLA has the best tennis program, 
                        mom. 

           Carol and Dale glance at each other. Sally notices. 

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        ...And yes, that’s the only reason 
                        I’m even going back to school... 
                        And before you say anything, I know 
                        what you’re both thinking- 

                                 DALE RIDE
                        You should. ...You should know what 
                        we’re thinking... You dropped out 
                        of Swarthmore College as if it 
                        where nothing... 

                                 SALLY
                        It was nothing, dad.

           Dale slams his coffee down, chewing fast, upset. 

                                 DALE RIDE
                        To you maybe. ...You can’t float 
                        around on this- this- pipe dream 
                        like some hippy...
                                 SALLY
                        I was a nationally ranked tennis 
                        player... something you used to 
                        love to brag about...

                                 DALE RIDE
                        You’re not getting any younger. And 
                        the older you get the further 
                        tennis gets away from you...

           Sally focuses on the tv. The SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN aka STEVE 
           AUSTEN is boarding a SPACE SHUTTLE.

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        ...I just don’t understand why you 
                        couldn’t just stay and play tennis 
                        in Swarthmore?

           Sally is getting upset. 

                                 SALLY
                        You can’t play tennis in the snow 
                        mom. ...You’re both acting like 
                        you’re not happy that I moved 
                        home...

                                 DALE RIDE
                        Just concerned.

                                 BEAR RIDE
                        I’m happy you’re home, Sally.

           Sally leans her head on her sister. Her wild brown hair 
           getting in Bear’s eyes.

                                 SALLY
                           (to Bear)
                        Can I borrow an outfit?

           Dale GROANS, drops his fork.

           EXT. UCLA CAMPUS - AFTERNOON

           Sally is holding her class program. She’s sporting a 
           backpack, with a tennis racket hanging out, shorts, a tee 
           shirt, knee high socks, converse and a baseball hat that 
           she’s turned backwards. She looks LOST as she PEERS around, 
           looking for her next class. 

           Sitting under a tree, jotting down last minute notes is JOHN 
           TOMPKINS (30, blonde, tall, tan, handsome). He NOTICES Sally. 
           Her wild demeanor stands out. 
           He curiously WATCHES her as she GLANCES around, moving in one 
           direction then stopping, looking down at her program again. 
           He SMIRKS and PACKS up his books, heading over to her. 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS 
                        Need help?

           Sally TURNS, glancing up at John. He notices her tennis 
           racket -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        Tennis courts are just beyond the 
                        football field...

                                 SALLY
                        I’m not playing tennis. ...I mean, 
                        I am. ...Just not now. I’m looking 
                        for the Elementary Quantum Physics 
                        class?

           John takes a step back. He looks her over, scraped knees, 
           pretty face, surprised and perplexed... What and who is she?

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        That’s my class.

           Now, it’s Sally who is surprised. 

                                 SALLY
                        You’re teaching Quantum Physics?

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Kinda. Well... No. ...I’m the 
                        volunteer teaching assistant...
                            (smiling)
                        ...I’ll walk you there.

           INT. ELEMENTARY QUANTUM PHYSICS CLASS - MOMENTS LATER

           ON JOHN sitting in the corner beside the professors desk, 
           SMILING, he looks down. 

                                 PROFESSOR  (O.S.)
                        As we look at a part of the 
                        derivation for Schrödinger's 
                        equation... We’ll find that he had 
                        finally grasped that the atomic 
                        world is full of chaos... When you 
                        break down an atom, you will find 
                        everything and nothing...
           WIDE: ON THE CLASS. It’s a room full of NERDY MEN. Sally is 
           the ONLY WOMAN. She’s not looking at the professor but at his 
           assistant John (smiling). She smiles back. 

           INT. ELEMENTARY QUANTUM PHYSICS CLASS - DAY

           The class has been paired in groups. Sally is with four 
           (male) students that look annoyed to have her on their team. 
           They’ve huddled around their table. Sally is standing on the 
           tips of her toes to try to get a peek at the words that have 
           been placed by the professor and John. 

           Reading the question out loud -

                                 PROFESSOR
                        When we are considering the total 
                        system as a composite system of two 
                        subsystems A and B, the wave 
                        functions of the composite system 
                        are in a... what?

           The groups chatter amongst themselves. Poking her teammates -

                                 SALLY
                        Hey guys... ...Guys?

           The group ignores her. To herself -

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s Hilbert space...

           The next team overhears her and RUNS up with the answer, 
           hands it to the professor.

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Correct. It’s Hilbert Space.

           Sally crosses her arms. The professor reads the next 
           question...

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        What is synonymous to wave 
                        function?

           John glances across the room at Sally as she contemplates the 
           question... Her eyes light up, she moves around her team’s 
           table and FORCES her way in... She shuffles through the words 
           on the table.

                                 TEAMMATE
                        Hey, stop. You’re messing it all 
                        up...
           Grabbing the STATE VECTOR card, shoving her teammate out of 
           the way -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m fixing it.

           Sally RUNS to the front and hands the professor the STATE 
           VECTOR card. 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Correct! Table two and four are 
                        tied...

           Sally’s teammates look at each other. One of the boys moves 
           over to give her room to see the cards. John has been 
           watching the entire time. He smiles. Sally’s demeanor shifts 
           from lighthearted to competitive. She hovers over the words, 
           ready to grab them -

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        A large number of copies in a 
                        system is called what?

           Sally glances over her shoulder at the other tables... 
           They’re talking amongst each other.

                                 PROFESSOR (CONT’D)
                        Remember if you bring the wrong 
                        card up... a point is taken away 
                        from the group...

           Sally pushes the cards around, trying to trigger her memory. 

                                 TEAMMATE
                        It’s Pure State. 

                                 TEAMMATE 2
                        You sure?

           Sally is staring the cards down as if they’ll start talking 
           to her.

                                 SALLY
                        No...

                                 TEAMMATE
                        What do you mean, no? It’s Pure 
                        State... 
                            (grabbing the card)
                        I’m going up.

           Sally’s eyes LOCK ONTO a card that reads: Statistical 
           Ensemble... She GRABS it and MOVES PAST her teammate... 
           handing it to the professor. He reads the card... 
           Sally bites her thumb, waiting, she glances at her table, 
           they all look mad at her... 

                                 PROFESSOR
                        Correct... Very good, Sally. The 
                        answer was statistical ensemble.

           Sally’s posture relaxes. She glances over at John. He winks 
           at her. She looks down, trying not to smile as she heads back 
           to her table. She puts her hand up to high five her team... 

                                 SALLY
                        Good job guys...

           None of them high five her.

                                 TEAMMATE 
                          (to the other teammates)
                        Why do I feel like we still lost?

           Teammate 2 motions toward Sally and rolls his eyes as she 
           happily clears the cards from the table.

           EXT. TENNIS COURT - UCLA - LATE AFTERNOON

           “TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE” by LOU REED PLAYS OVER:

           ANGLE ON a TENNIS BALL AS IT SPINS in MID AIR... DESCENDING 
           to EARTH... aka the TENNIS COURT... A RACKET MEETS it in the 
           AIR and IT’S THRUST FORWARD ACROSS the NET... WE PULL BACK ON 
           Sally... IT’S GAME DAY. She’s POISED ready for the ball to 
           FLY back over... 

           IN THE STANDS: JOHN is watching. He’s wearing sunglasses, but 
           WE CAN TELL the only woman on the court he’s staring at is 
           SALLY.

           “TAKE A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE” by LOU REED FADES OUT.

           Sally LUNGES FORWARD and HITS the BALL with ALL of her 
           MIGHT... MAKING A HEAVING NOISE... She WIPES her face with 
           her wrist band and GLANCES UP at the SCORE. It’s 15 to 40. 
           She’s LOSING. WE SEE her EYES LOCK onto her opponent with 
           fervor as a SWATTING MATCH ENSUES, a BACK and FORTH... 

           TEN MINUTES LATER...

           Sally looks EXHAUSTED. Her face is BEET RED. Her hair is 
           dripping with SWEAT... Her opponent, a 17 year old USC player 
           looks like she’s just warming up. Sally LOSES her FOOTING as 
           she JOLTS FORWARD to SMACK the BALL... SHE MISSES. 
                                 CHAIR UMPIRE
                        GAME POINT!

           Sally LOST. She DROPS her tennis racket, and BENDS down to 
           catch her breath, frustrated with herself. BEAT. She moves 
           across the court and shakes her opponent’s hand. She GLANCES 
           up in the stands and FINDS John... he RAISES his glasses up 
           and smiles at her as people begin to clear out. She RUNS her 
           hand through her hair and motions for him to WAIT there...

           EXT. TENNIS COURT - UCLA - EARLY EVENING

           Sally and John are sitting on the now EMPTY tennis court. 
           She’s peering at the stands. 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        What do you want to be Sally?

                                 SALLY
                        Seriously? 

           She nudges John playfully with her shoulder.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I know I’ll never be an 
                        Arthur Ashe... I’m not here to 
                        change the world... but... look, 
                        you didn’t know me when I was a 
                        national player... I was good. I 
                        just need to get my rhythm back, 
                        that’s all...

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I thought you were good today... 
                            (beat)
                        With a mind like yours... you could 
                        really do anything you wanted.

           Sally shrugs. 

                                 SALLY
                        I could say the same about you... 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        You’re smarter than I am. 

                                 SALLY
                        If I were smarter than you, I 
                        wouldn’t be chasing tennis... 

           Sally leans forward, resting her head in her hand.
                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        You should be scientist. 

           With a groan -

                                 SALLY
                        You sound like my dad.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Your dad must be a smart man.

                                 SALLY
                        He taught me the basics... 

           Completely intrigued -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Who taught you the rest?

           Looking up at the sky -

                                 SALLY
                        I did. ...I like figuring out how 
                        things work... What something is 
                        made of... 
                            (peering over at John)
                        What are you made of, John?

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL - OSHKOSH WISCONSIN - MORNING

           WE’RE INSIDE A LARGE MANUFACTURING FACILITY RAMP AS WE TRACK 
           BEHIND NASA’S ADMINISTRATOR JAMES FLETCHER. JOHNSON SPACE 
           CENTER’S DIRECTOR CHRIS KRAFT (50’S). AND GEORGE ABBEY, HEAD 
           OF THE ASTRONAUT SELECTION BOARD AND HEAD OF FLIGHT 
           OPERATIONS.

           They’re being lead by Rockwell International’s President... 

                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                        We’ve just started on the crew 
                        module for STA-099...

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        And the vibration and thermal 
                        testing?

                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                        It went well. It held up for 12 
                        months and counting... 
           The GROUP of men EMERGE OUT INTO a LARGER PORTION of the 
           assembly facility, OVERLOOKING the CREW MODULE for STA-099 
           aka CHALLENGER ORBITER beginning to be constructed below... 
           BESIDE IT the almost completed, STS-1 aka the COLUMBIA 
           ORBITER. 

           James GRIPS the railing, leans closer...

                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        It will fit up to five astronauts  
                        of course as requested...

           Watching a man CLIMB UP and INTO the side of the SHUTTLE -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                           (to Rockwell President)
                        It’s being constructed for the 
                        accommodation of women of course...

           James looks over as if he forgot. Rockwell’s President looks 
           taken aback. George glances over at Chris, he shugs, it’s out 
           of his hands.

                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                        The what?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Women. We’re -
                            (glancing over at James & 
                              Chris)
                        We’re considering a woman or women 
                        for all future missions...

           Straightening up defensively -

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        Not all missions... 

           Scrambled -

                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                        ..We hadn’t discussed the 
                        accommodations. It’s something that 
                        needs to uh, well... We’ll have to 
                        alter some things... with NASA’S 
                        approval of course...

           Finally speaking up -

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        Like?
                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                        Well, the urination process for one 
                        thing... and then, we... We don’t 
                        want women sleeping too close to 
                        the astronauts...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        The women would be called 
                        astronauts too. 

                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                           (uncomfortable)
                        Oh, I- I see.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        I want to go down and get a closer 
                        look at shuttles...

                                 ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL PRESIDENT
                          (flustered)
                        Of course.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                           (in jest)
                        I’ll measure for bed sizes...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. JOHN’S MUSTANG - EARLY EVENING

           “MOONLIGHT” by STARBUCK PLAYS OVER:

           WE’RE IN John’s white Mustang with the top down. Sally and 
           John’s hair is WHIPPING around as he drives down the Pacific 
           Coast Highway. Sally STANDS UP and PUTS her arms out -- 
           CAREFREE. John PULLS her back down... She WHISPERS something 
           to him and he glances over and mirrors the GLEAM in her eye 
           before PULLING OVER... He gets out, Sally SLIDES over to the 
           drivers seat she stares at the ocean that seems to go on 
           forever as John walks around to the passengers seat. 

           He pats her leg, ready to go. She gives him a devilish smile 
           and PUTS the stick in gear, FLOORING IT... CAUSING a WAVE OF 
           DUST BEHIND THEM...

           EXT. DALE & CAROL RIDE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally and John PULL up in his convertible. Her HAIR is CRAZY 
           from driving FAST. She doesn’t care. John looks nervous as he 
           straightens out his hair and shirt, exiting the car. 

           Taking him by the hand -
                                 SALLY
                        I swear they don’t bite...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           ON the Ride’s family (Collie) dog as it NIPS John’s hand 
           under the table. He winces to himself and pulls his hand up. 
           WIDE: Sally’s parents and sister are sitting around the table 
           focused on John as they eat. Sally’s hair still mussed from 
           the car ride.

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        You’re the first boy Sally’s 
                        brought around to these parts...

                                 SALLY
                        He’s not a boy Mom.

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        Man. Either way it’s true...

                                 DALE RIDE
                        Sally says you’re a science 
                        professor like myself...

           Clearing his throat nervously -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Yes and no... I’m an assistant. I- 
                        I don’t really want to teach, I’m 
                        more interested in lab work... The 
                        actual breakdown of molecules and 
                        particles... 

                                 DALE RIDE
                        Then why are you teaching?

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Assisting? ...College credits.

                                 CAROL RIDE
                          (to John)
                        You ought to take Sally on your 
                        next scientific venture... 

                                 SALLY
                        Mom!

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        You love science.
           Mashing her food down, annoyed -

                                 SALLY
                        I love tennis more.

                                 DALE RIDE
                        You spend all day reading quantum 
                        physics books and only an hour 
                        practicing tennis... What does that 
                        tell you? I don’t need to be a 
                        science professor to give you that 
                        answer...

                                 BEAR RIDE
                        What do you think, John? 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        About Sally? ...I think-

           He looks at Sally, clearly in love with her -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        I think she’s scared. 

           Sally smacks his arm.

                                 SALLY
                        I’m not scared of anything.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Except the one thing you’re great 
                        at...

           Sally takes his words in. She folds her arms.

                                 DALE RIDE
                          (to Carol, pointing at John)
                        I like him...

           EXT. PING PONG TABLE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

           ANGLE ON a PING PONG BALL...

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        von Neumann or Schrödinger?

           WIDE: As Sally SMACKS the ball over to John. They begin 
           playing.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        It depends. 
                                 SALLY
                        As a separate mode of time 
                        evolution for a quantum system... 
                        do you agree with it?

           Sally HITS the BALL HARDER and FASTER. John can barely keep 
           up.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        It has it’s difficulties. I like to 
                        stick with unitary time 
                        evolution...

                                 SALLY
                        But Conditional probabilities are 
                        just as important as one outcome...

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        How so?

                                 SALLY
                        Well... for example if you hadn’t 
                        decided to give me directions that 
                        day... I may have never ended up 
                        noticing you...

           John GRABS the incoming ping pong ball. Insecure -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Really? 

           Sally sets her paddle down. She’d rather mentally spare -

                                 SALLY
                        The collapse of a wave function or 
                        theory is just a theory... but it’s 
                        still a probability... although you 
                        didn’t have to help me that day... 
                        in which case another amount of 
                        probabilities come into play on 
                        your end...

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        There was only one outcome... I 
                        knew I had to talk to you that day. 
                        ...Theories aren’t used in 
                        laboratories. ...Just outcomes.

           Sally stares John down, she’s met her intellectual match. 

                                 SALLY
                        I want to show you something...
           EXT. ATTIC - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally is holding a flashlight, leading the way as John 
           follows...

                                 SALLY
                        Watch your step...

           He trips. 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Too late.

           She stops and shines her light at a roof hatch... she OPENS 
           IT... a LADDER SLIDES DOWN. John raises his eyebrows. 

                                 SALLY
                        Dad built it last year... 

           Sally hands John the flashlight and CLIMBS UP... ONTO-

           EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Sally EMERGES out FOLLOWED by John. She takes the flashlight 
           and CLICKS it OFF. WE’RE LEFT with the MOONLIGHT and STARS. 

           Pointing at the mounted telescope -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Yours?

                                 SALLY
                        Dad’s...

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        May I?

           Sally NODS. John leans down and LOOKS through the 
           telescope... he POINTS it UP and OVER... Sally stands next to 
           him. He STOPS ON SOMETHING -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        Look...

           Sally PEERS IN...

                                 SALLY
                        Nasa’s ATS satellite... 

           John pulls the telescope back, looking impressed by her. He 
           takes a seat on the roof. Sally sits next to him. She takes 
           his hand.
                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Just think... Men... Man... 
                        Humans... put that satellite up 
                        there... 

           Peering up at the stars -

                                 SALLY
                        A group of men did. 

           John leans back -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Sally...

           Sally glances over and leans back too. They’re laying side by 
           side, John caresses her face, wanting to kiss her, she cups 
           his hand on her cheek.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        ...If- If I had to go away for a 
                        while... would you wait for me?

           Peering into his eyes, concerned -

                                 SALLY
                        Is this a probability or an actual 
                        outcome?

           John pulls his hand away. Sits up. Sighs. She sits up -

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        ...John? 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        It’s an outcome. 

           All the wind is taken from Sally’s sails. 

                                 SALLY
                        And you’re telling me now?

           Running his hand through his hair -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I didn’t... I didn’t know how... 
                        and everything happened so fast 
                        and... and... I didn’t except -

           Hurt -

                                 SALLY
                        To leave?
                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        To fall in love with you.

           This only hurts Sally more. She looks down.

                                 SALLY
                        Well, I won’t be here when you get 
                        back from wherever you’re going...

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Where would you go?

                                 SALLY
                        Where are you going?

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        The UCLA physics department 
                        selected me... I’m going to Moscow. 
                        ...It’s cutting edge, Sal... I’ll 
                        be working with the world’s highest 
                        energy proton accelerator... 

           Standing up, dusting off -

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah, well... you should’ve said 
                        something...

           Trying to read her expression, standing up -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        You’re jealous.

                                 SALLY
                        No I’m not.

           Grabbing her shoulders as she tries not to cry -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Sally, you have twice the 
                        scientific mind I have... if you 
                        really aren’t here when I get back, 
                        please promise me you’ll use it...

           Sally turns away from him, heartbroken -

                                 SALLY
                        Please leave. 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Sally...

                                 SALLY
                        Go.
           John pulls his hands away. He stares at her for a BEAT. She 
           won’t make eye contact. He kisses his hand and places to her 
           cheek before heading to the hatch... Sally TURNS - HE’S GONE. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. BOARD ROOM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER (NASA) - MORNING

           WE’RE LOOKING AT A voluptuous mannequin wearing an IN-FLIGHT 
           SUIT. WE SEE MULTIPLE POCKETS that have been fitted to the 
           legs of the space pants, the top is formfitting and low cut -- 
           shaping a perfect bottle shaped curve. 

                                 KEN PRICE (O.S.)
                        As you can see, gentlemen, we’ve 
                        enhanced the design to compliment 
                        the attributes of the female 
                        form... 

           WE PULL BACK ON the board room... ALL of the MEN are PEERING 
           at the mannequin who looks like a double for Kim Novak. 
           NASA’S SPACESUIT PROJECT MANAGER, KEN PRICE (late 30’s) is 
           enthusiastically standing next to the busty mannequin. 

                                 KEN PRICE (CONT’D)
                        The top gives her breathing room...

           Leaning over to Chris Kraft -

                                 JAMES C. FLETHER
                        I’ll say...

           Some of the men, snicker. Chris doesn’t. George Abbey looks 
           disappointed. 

                                 KEN PRICE
                        And the bottom doesn’t hide her 
                        femininity... 
                            (turning the mannequin 
                              around)
                        And... as for comfort we’ve fitted 
                        the buttocks with easy access for 
                        urination... 

           The board room is hanging on by a thread, trying not to 
           LAUGH. Some of the men have covered their mouths, others have 
           tears forming from suppressing their giggles. George glances 
           over at James... who’s removed his glasses, smirking. 

           Ken UNZIPS the BUTT of the suit and EXPOSES the mannequin’s 
           BUNS. The board ERUPTS. George can’t take anymore, he stands 
           up and GRABS the mannequin by the arm -
                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                            (to Ken)
                        Get this out of here...
                            (to Nasa officials)
                        Gentlemen we don’t need a special 
                        suit for women. Pants fitted with 
                        pockets, yes... but when we cross 
                        over into altering designs for 
                        appearance, I think we’ve failed at 
                        our duty to unify a team...

           Eyeing the big boobed, big bunned mannequin -

                                 BOARD MEMBER
                        I liked it... I’d fly with her.

           More snickering. James can see the seriousness on George’s 
           face. As the administrator he straightens up. 

                                 JAMES C. FLETHER
                        As fun as it was, George is right. 
                        The same suit for both sexes is the 
                        only possible way to not get 
                        criticized by the media.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Not only the media sir, but whoever 
                        the woman is -- needs to not feel 
                        like she’s being mocked as some 
                        sort of afterthought or joke when 
                        she’s in space...

           Defensively -

                                 JAMES C. FLETHER
                        No one said a woman was going to 
                        space, George. The government 
                        mandate doesn’t say anything about 
                        forcing NASA to shoot a woman to 
                        the stars... We just need to hire 
                        them. If we put a woman in a 
                        spacesuit just to look good we’d be 
                        shitting on all the men that have 
                        worked and trained and put their 
                        lives on the line for our 
                        country... for humanity. 
                        ...Besides, the kind of woman it 
                        would take to pass training doesn’t 
                        exist...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. SALLY’S HOUSE - SILICON VALLEY - EVENING - 1978

           “AMERICAN WOMAN” by THE GUESS WHO is PLAYING OVER:

           FUZZY YELLOW COUCHES, A SUNKEN LIVING ROOM, ORANGE BEAN 
           BAGS... MULTICOLORED LIGHTS, BOOKS RANGING FROM SHAKESPEARE 
           TO GERTRUDE STEIN LINE THE MULTIPLE BOOKSHELVES... AS WE 
           DOLLY THROUGH SALLY’S COLLEGE STYLE HOUSE. ...IT’S PACKED 
           WITH FELLOW STANFORD STUDENTS... SOME ARE DANCING, SOME ARE 
           DRINKING, BEATNIKS HAVE GATHERED IN A CORNER TO RECITE POETRY 
           AND SMOKE WEED... 

           WE COME TO A HALT ON Sally DANCING her heart out with a group 
           of classmates/friends... LINDA (24) dances closer to Sally 
           (27), putting her hands on Sally’s waist, making eye contact 
           with her. They’ve clearly done this before.

           LATER...

           “STORMY” by CLASSIC IV IS PLAYING OVER:

           Sally and Linda are still dancing. A large number of party-
           goers have cleared out. Hugging Sally before EXITING -

                                 FEMALE CLASSMATE
                        Congratulations again Sally... I’m 
                        still working on one degree and to 
                        think you have two now...

           Sally stops dancing.

                                 SALLY
                        You’re leaving?

                                 FEMALE CLASSMATE
                        I have class tomorrow... 

           Sally brushes the hair from her face and hugs her goodbye. 
           Linda leans over, putting her arm around Sally, whispering -

                                 LINDA
                           (to Sally)
                        Do you want me to stay?

           Sally grabs hold of Linda’s arm, moving off of her shoulder.

                                 SALLY
                        There are too many people here...
           INT. SALLY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone is GONE. EXCEPT for Linda. Sally is cleaning up, 
           holding a garbage bag, picking up various paper cups and 
           plates... 

           Linda emerges from the hallway and wraps her arms around 
           Sally -

                                 LINDA
                        Want me to help?

           Sally smiles -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m almost done.

                                 LINDA
                        Are you going to push me away 
                        again?

           Sally turns, unsure what to say, unsure how to feel. Linda 
           brushes her hand across Sally’s cheek.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        You think too much. ...I’m going to 
                        lay down.

           Sally nods, uncertain. She takes a seat on the couch. BEAT. 
           She leans forward staring at the telescope made of frosting 
           on her half consumed graduation cake.

           INT. BED - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ON SALLY staring at the ceiling. Beside her, Linda is asleep. 
           Sally glances over and quietly gets out of bed, crossing the 
           room...

           ANGLE ON a jewelry box as it’s OPENED... there isn’t jewelry 
           inside, just years of letters... From JOHN. Post marked from 
           Moscow. NONE of them have been OPENED. 

           WIDE: Sally takes them out with the heaviness of what she may 
           find inside, she’s still hurt... BEAT. She takes the first 
           letter... steadies it in her hand... then DROPS it back into 
           the box, closing it. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           EXT. OBSERVATORY - STANFORD UNIVERSITY - EARLY MORNING

           WE’RE LOOKING AT a beautiful wooden and glass two story 
           structure. The first story is a classroom lined with glass 
           windows. An exterior wooden staircase wraps around and up to 
           the second story: A GLASS DOMED OBSERVATORY. INTO FRAME: 
           Sally, SPORTING high top converse, ripped jeans and a tee 
           shirt, damp hair and a book bag walking toward the 
           building... She gets out a set of keys and unlocks the 
           classroom, ENTERS.

           INT. ASTRONOMY CLASS/OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           The classroom is EMPTY. Sally is prepping, placing advanced 
           astronomy books on each desk...

                                                              DISSOLVE:

           INT. ASTRONOMY CLASS/OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           The classroom is FULL. Sally is sitting in the corner where 
           John sat when she was a fresh faced student at UCLA. Now 
           she’s a Stanford double major graduate. PROFESSOR TATE (60’s) 
           a regal looking professor with a white beard and an English 
           accent is standing in front of the class.

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        We’re lucky enough to have Sally 
                        Ride with us as the active 
                        assistant... Although, Sally’s 
                        graduated with distinction, she’s 
                        not done- 

           Sally looks embarrassed, she crosses her arms.

                                 SALLY
                        We don’t need a full bio Mister 
                        Tate...

           The class laughs. Sally puts her hand on her brow, wanting to 
           melt into the floor. 

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        Sally is working on her 
                        doctorate... I mention this because 
                        when Sally was a student in this 
                        class she was also mastering 
                        literature while balancing 
                        science... Balance is the key to 
                        any form of success... 
                            (jokingly)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PROFESSOR TATE (CONT'D)
                        And if you’re determined enough you 
                        can end up... in the corner where 
                        Sally is...
                            (to Sally)
                        I promised I wouldn’t praise you 
                        too much...

           Sally’s face is now beet red.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. ASTRONOMY CLASS/OBSERVATORY - AFTERNOON

           DARKNESS. WE WATCH AS the ROOF OPENS UP... LETTING LIGHT IN 
           and ILLUMINATING the students and Sally as they HUDDLE around 
           a MASSIVE TELESCOPE. Everyone is chattering. Sally takes to 
           the helm of the giant telescope... 

                                 SALLY
                            (to class)
                        Ancient astronomers would follow 
                        points of light that appeared to 
                        move among the stars... Luckily 
                        today we have big toys like this 
                        one that helps us see things a lot 
                        better...

           NONE of the students are listening to her. They’re 
           chattering. Sally clears her throat... She turns her 
           attention back to the telescope. The professor SNEAKS in and 
           observes Sally with the class. 

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to adjust these two 
                        lenses that will focus the light... 
                        This will make whatever object 
                        we’re focusing on the object look 
                        closer...

           Only a couple of students are actually listening. Professor 
           Tate SPEAKS up from the back, letting his presence be KNOWN.

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        Quiet!

           INSTANT SILENCE FALLS OVER THE ROOM. Sally GLANCES at the 
           back where Professor Tate is stoically standing, she looks 
           relieved. 
           INT. ASTRONOMY CLASS/OBSERVATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Class is over. Sally and professor Tate are the only two 
           left... Sally leans on the giant telescope, defeatedly. 

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        No one takes the assistant 
                        seriously on their first day. 
                        You’re still a student to them. 

           Peering out of the ROOF at the sky -

                                 SALLY
                        I don’t care if they talk over 
                        me... I just don’t like thinking 
                        that they’re clearly not here for 
                        this (points at sky)...

           Professor Tate stares up with Sally.

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        I’m sure that Galileo and Newton 
                        had students that weren't 
                        interested at first. It’s the job 
                        of the teacher to generate that 
                        interest...

                                 SALLY
                        Great. So I’m just boring then.

           Putting his arm around her -

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        Until you’re teaching your own 
                        class, that’s not something you 
                        should worry about...

           Matter of fact -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m not going to be a teacher.

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        Really? ...My dear girl, what on 
                        earth do you want to be?

           ON SALLY crouched in a ready POSITION... 
           WIDE: Linda is on the other side of the court... She SLAPS 
           the BALL FAST TOWARDS Sally... Sally HITS it HARD, taking out 
           her frustrations. Linda side steps, letting the ball hit the 
           fence. Walking toward the net -

                                 LINDA
                        If this is about last night...

           Lowering her racket -

                                 SALLY
                        It’s not. Let’s just focus on 
                        tennis, okay?

                                 LINDA
                        Sally... there’s no shame in what 
                        we feel. It doesn’t make you a 
                        leper...

                                 SALLY
                        Can we just play? ...Are you gonna 
                        pick up the ball or should I? 

                                 LINDA
                        I just wish you’d acknowledge in 
                        broad daylight how you’re 
                        feeling...

           Sally leaps over the net, grabs the ball and jumps back over 
           to her side. Pushing back her emotions with a joke -

                                 SALLY
                        You should really start bringing 
                        more balls to the court...

           Linda shakes her head. Sally smiles.

           Trek has been fitted into a NASA suit customized with her

                        Correct.

           WE PULL BACK FURTHER... James and George are standing off to 
           the side, watching.

           Concerned -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        A commercial with a known face from 
                        television isn’t going to pull in 
                        the women we’re looking for. We’ll 
                        just end up with a bunch of would-
                        be actresses knocking on Nasa’s 
                        door... You were the one that told 
                        me you were afraid that mankind had 
                        given up on space... and that Nasa 
                        was crippled, this won’t help the 
                        cause... People will take it as a 
                        joke...

           James crosses his arms, thinking.

                                 JAMES C. FLETHER
                        Women aren’t applying to our call 
                        for candidates. If we don’t 
                        broadcast how on earth do you 
                        expect us to find anyone? 

           George glances over at Nichelle as she leans against the 
           rocket. BEAT. 

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        A tour. ...We have Nichelle go on a 
                        college tour as a recruiter... 
                        Throw away her corny lines and give 
                        her facts about training... Hell, 
                        we can show her first hand... If 
                        she’s in front of college women 
                        looking to make their mark on life 
                        and she’s authentically talking to 
                        them about our program -- I think 
                        they’ll take it more seriously... 

           James mulls this over.

                        They’d have to be scientists of

                        Of course. ...And what scientist

           EXT. ASTRONOMY CLASS/OBSERVATORY - STANFORD UNIVERSITY - 
           MORNING

           ANGLE ON THE STANFORD DAILY... the headline reads: NASA to 
           recruit women. Rally begins at 3pm on the east lawn. With 
           guest speaker, Nichelle Nichols.

                                 SALLY (O.S.)
                        It’s just a gimmick... 

           WIDE: Sally is holding the paper. Professor Tate is clearing 
           the classes shadow line (experiment with shadows and light 
           sources) length projects from each table... 

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        What you call a gimmick others in 
                        your position will call an 
                        opportunity...

           Sally looks down at the NASA article. Shakes her head.

                                 SALLY
                        It’s convenient. They don’t want to 
                        hire women, they have to... 

           She balls up the paper and tosses it in the trash. Professor 
           Tate, stops cleaning and sits on top of one of the desks -

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        A cracked door can be opened, 
                        Sally.

                                 SALLY
                        A character from Star Trek isn’t 
                        going to convince me to willingly 
                        fall for some desperate attempt to 
                        convince women that they’re all of 
                        a sudden welcome in a field that 
                        looks at us as a weaker, less 
                        intelligent sex...  

           Removing his glasses, cleaning them with his sweater -
                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        And how will that view ever change 
                        if the ones that are meant to 
                        change it, won’t? 

           Crossing her arms -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m not a pilot. I’m a scientist. 

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        And who better to go to space? 
                        That’s the point of this bloody 
                        thing... they want change Sally. 
                        They want scientists. If it’s a 
                        sideshow, make it your sideshow... 
                        and let’s be honest, the odds of 
                        them actually replying are slim to 
                        none anyway... 

           Smirking -

                                 SALLY
                        Is that a threat or a promise? 

           Professor Tate sighs, shakes his head and puts his glasses 
           back on -

                                 PROFESSOR TATE
                        It’s always the ones with a gift 
                        that never want to give it away...

           EXT. TENNIS COURT - STANFORD UNIVERSITY - MOMENTS LATER

           The courts are EMPTY. With the exception of Sally. WE CAN SEE 
           just beyond/below the tennis court... a HUGE crowd of women 
           has gathered on the east lawn as Nichelle Nichols takes to 
           the podium... A NASA banner is hanging overhead.  

           Sally is working up a SWEAT -- SWATTING tennis balls as they 
           SHOOT out of the ball machine. She CHARGES them, trying to 
           get out her pent-up energy. 

           EAST LAWN

           The large crowd applauds. Nichelle is sporting NASA’S in 
           flight suit. She adjusts the microphone as the clapping dies 
           down.

                                 NICHELLE
                        Thank you so much... As I look out

                        Women have been ruled out when it 
                        comes to questioning. We’ve been 
                        subjected to assisting rather than 
                        participating in these quests for

           WE WATCH Sally CROSS the court. She turns off the ball 
           machine. LISTENS... before heading to the chain link fence

                        I’m not here to tell you that you 
                        should apply to NASA because I 
                        think that it’s ready for women. 
                        I’m here to ask you to apply 
                        because I think that it’s the only 
                        way we can begin to write our own 
                        history... and define who we really 
                        are...

           Nichelle steps away from the mic and the crowd ERUPTS with 
           applauds. There’s an application booth beside the stage, 
           students are swarming to it.

           INT. BEDROOM - SALLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON THE NASA, “MISSION SPECIALIST” APPLICATION. It’s 
           thin. A pen is being tapped over and over again. 

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        What happens to us if you’re 
                        accepted?

           WIDE: Sally and Linda are sitting up in bed as Sally attempts 
           to fill out the application.

                                 SALLY
                        I’m not allowed to talk to you if 
                        I’m at NASA? 

                                 LINDA
                        You know what I mean...

                                 SALLY
                        ...The odds of them actually 
                        responding are not in my favor.
           Linda sighs. Sally glances over, looking at Linda’s troubled 
           face.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t want me to fill it 
                        out, I won’t...

           Sally takes the application... folds it up, stuffs it in her 
           drawer. Linda relaxes. Sally turns the light off.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ON SALLY staring up at the ceiling, unable to sleep. She 
           glances over at Linda sleeping... then... slips out of bed...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SALLY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           ANGLE ON THE NASA, “MISSION SPECIALIST” APPLICATION. 

           WIDE: Sally lying on her shag carpet. She’s WATCHING the 
           BIONIC WOMAN outrunning THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN. There’s a 
           pint of ice cream beside her. She stops tapping her pen and 
           eats a spoon full of ice cream. She glances down at the 
           application and flips it over... they ask for her medical 
           history, her academic record, any legal offenses... AND... 

           A LIST OF: REFERENCES. She taps her pen on the paper again... 
           her hand wants to write but her mind doesn’t... The pen 
           waivers over the paper... until... she FOLDS it and closes it 
           in her book. She PEERS up at the screen, her head resting in 
           her hands... THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN is professing his 
           LOVE to the BIONIC WOMAN, he’s telling her that, they’re two 
           sides of the same coin and no matter how hard she tries she 
           won’t be able to deny it. Sally internalizes this, she 
           glances over at her book and OPENS it. She PULLS the paper 
           out... and PEERS at the blank REFERENCES... she jots down: 
           JOHN TOMPKINS.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

           ON ASTRONAUT COMMANDER JOHN W. YOUNG. He’s sporting a helmet 
           that is mic’d up. He NODS. John is strapped inside a GIMBLE 
           RIG. His left hand rests on the radio transmission switch as 
           his right clings to a nitrogen jet controller. He gives a 
           THUMBS UP to the test engineer and PULLS BACK igniting the 
           JETS. The test engineer begins rotating the RIG.

           WIDE: Johnson Space Center’s Director Chris Kraft, is 
           watching/sitting silently in the corner. 
           The three caged RIG BEGINS to SPIN... John is piloting the 
           AXIS of the machine as the SPINNING BUILDS. 

           REVERSE ANGLE... WE’RE SPINNING FAST, WE CAN SEE John’s 
           reflection in motion from across the room on the glass... WE 
           DOLLY TOWARD IT...

           INT. STATISTICAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           WE’RE ON THE OPPOSITE side of the glass in a room full of 
           NASA specialists, recording his reaction time, and his 
           ability to control the rig is jotted down. James is watching 
           John Young maneuver the rig. George ENTERS and stands next to 
           James -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                           (to James)
                        Out of the twenty five thousand 
                        applications we sent out, eight 
                        thousand came back... 

           James doesn’t seem to care too much, he’s locked onto the 
           astronaut on the other side of the glass.  

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        Well... anyone that stood out? 
                           (pointing at the rig)
                        Anyone that could ride that?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        I’m sure with training... I want to 
                        narrow the selection down-

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        Majors in Astrophysics should be 
                        the first to qualify... 

           Putting his hands in his pockets -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        I did. That doesn’t narrow it down 
                        too much. I was thinking we could 
                        interview the applicants references 
                        to sharpen our focus...

           Through the glass WE SEE the rig come to a halt. John Young 
           PULLS his helmet off and gives a thumbs up through the glass. 
           James smiles with pride at the astronaut. George looks 
           frustrated.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (CONT’D)
                        Is that a yes?
                                 JAMES C. FLETHER
                        Do what you have to. We just need a 
                        handful of women that won’t cry at 
                        the first sign of challenge... We 
                        still need men to do the dirty 
                        work...

           James EXITS. George stays in front of the glass watching John 
           who is getting unbuckled from the rig. Chris pats him on the 
           back like an endearing father. James ENTERS and gives John a 
           hearty embrace. George looks down.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. TENNIS COURT - STANFORD UNIVERSITY - AFTERNOON

           ANGLE ON a TENNIS RACKET as it SMACKS the tennis BALL... WE 
           HEAR a GROAN... 

           WIDE: WE’RE WATCHING a women’s doubles match. STANFORD vs. 
           USC. Sally wipes her sweaty hair from her face and looks up 
           at the score... 45 to 35. She and Linda (same team) look 
           exhausted as the BALL is SMACKED back to their side... Sally 
           lunges for it, HITS it back... a SWATTING MATCH ENSUES. 

           The spectators in the stands are glancing back and forth as 
           the ball is quickly hit from one side of the court to the 
           other. One observer in the stands ISN’T looking at the ball, 
           but at Sally... 

           It’s JOHN TOMPKINS. His sunglasses don’t give away his glare 
           but his lack of head movement does. 

           ON THE COURT: Sally SLAMS the BALL across the NET SCORING. 
           They’re tied 45 - 45. Linda embraces her. Sally smiles, she 
           glances out at the stands and raises her racket up, 
           competitively. Her smile morphs as her eyes lock onto John...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. TENNIS COURT - STANFORD UNIVERSITY - POST GAME

           Spectators are flooding out of the stands... Stanford WON. 
           John stands with his hands in his pockets, staring at Sally 
           on the court. Sally wipes her face with a towel as Linda 
           pulls it away from her, playfully -

                                 LINDA
                        I’m going to go home... Should we 
                        meet up tonight?
           Sally glances up at the stands, John is GONE. Glancing 
           around...

                                 SALLY
                        Sure... 

           Linda slides her hand across Sally’s back.

                                 LINDA
                        I’ll see you tonight...

           Linda EXITS. Sally crouches down with her back turned away 
           from the stands. 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS (O.S.)
                        So the girl with the big mind 
                        decided to use it after all...

           Her eyes are searching for words, reluctant to turn around. 
           BEAT. Sally turns and takes John in.

                                 SALLY
                        ...I was expecting you to be 
                        wearing a red army hat. 

           John pulls his sunglasses off, his emotions on his sleeve - 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I wasn’t gone that long. I looked 
                        for you when I came back...

           Holding back -

                                 SALLY
                        I know. 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I wrote-

                                 SALLY
                        I know.

           Shrugging -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        That’s all you can say? 

                                 SALLY
                        What am I supposed to say? 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Did you read any of my letters?

           Defensively -
                                 SALLY
                        ...No.

           John shakes his head in disbelief -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I was expecting you to be 
                        welcoming, but instead I find the 
                        exact girl I left on the rooftop.

                                 SALLY
                        My emotions can’t change all of a 
                        sudden just because you decided to 
                        pop back into my life.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Pop back in? Sally... you popped 
                        back in, not the other way around. 
                        Writing my name down as a reference 
                        wasn’t a probability. It was a 
                        definite outcome. You knew that.

           Picking up her tennis bag starts walking, John follows -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m past probabilities. 

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I know. And I know you’d be great 
                        at NASA... I told them you were 
                        brilliant. 

           Finally letting her guard down a bit -

                                 SALLY
                        You did?

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Of course. What did you think I’d 
                        say? 
                            (beat)
                        ...Or did you put me down as a 
                        reference thinking I’d be an ass? I 
                        know how you like to self sabotage 
                        yourself...

           Glancing down -

                                 SALLY
                        I put you down because... 
                            (beat)
                        Because I saw myself in you.
                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I still see myself in you. 
                        Sally...

           Sally looks back up at him, her arms crossed protectively. 
           She heads toward the EXIT. John continues to follow.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS (CONT’D)
                        Have dinner with me. 

                                 SALLY
                           (torn)
                        ...I can’t.

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        Tomorrow then.

                                 SALLY
                        ...I can’t any time soon.

           Coming to a halt -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        So this is it then? You can just 
                        walk away?

                                 SALLY
                           (upset)
                        You walked away. 

           Boiling point -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        When I came back home you were 
                        gone. You ran. You’re still 
                        running. ...You spend all these 
                        hours analyzing the stars, 
                        searching for some sort of 
                        meaning... and the irony is, you 
                        can’t even analyze yourself... 

           Sally’s face is flushed, upset -  

                                 SALLY
                        Are you finished?

           Regretfully -

                                 JOHN TOMPKINS
                        I’m sorry.

           Sally turns away from John, hurt, she opens the chain link 
           door, EXITING. 
           INT. FRONT DOOR - LIVING ROOM - SALLY’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally drops her tennis bag onto the ground and leans against 
           the door, hurt/angry. She rubs her face and heads across the 
           room. Turns the radio on...

           “BLUE BAYOU” by LINDA RONSTADT BEGINS TO PLAY OVER:

           INT. SALLY’S SMALL HOUSE - SILICON VALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           “BLUE BAYOU” by LINDA RONSTADT CONTINUES TO PLAY OVER:

           Sally grabs her jewelry box... she DUMPS out ALL of John’s 
           letters onto the floor and sits. She takes one of the 
           envelopes and steadies it in her hand. BEAT. She OPENS it and 
           begins to read... After a few lines she shakes her head in 
           frustration and BALLS the letter up, THROWING it across the 
           room. 

           --KNOCKING--

           BEAT.

                                 SALLY
                          (shouting)
                        Go away.

           --KNOCKING--

           Standing up -

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I said, GO AWAY!

           --KNOCKING--

           Sally shakes her head and STORMS OUT INTO-

           INT. FRONT DOOR - LIVING ROOM - SALLY HOUSE

           “BLUE BAYOU” by LINDA RONSTADT CONTINUES TO PLAY OVER:

           Sally kicks her tennis bag away from the door...

                                 SALLY
                          (opening the door)
                        What part of go away don’t you 
                        unders-

           GEORGE ABBEY is standing in front of her. His eyes glance 
           around her house as the music blasts.
                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Have I come at a bad time?

                                 SALLY
                        Are you looking for someone?

           Trying to talk over the music -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Yes. I’m George Abbey... from NASA.

           Pulling her tennis headband off -

                                 SALLY
                        Oh, gosh... Hi... hold- just hold 
                        on a minute...

           Sally CLOSES the door in George’s face. She TURNS the music 
           off and returns to the door, OPENING it.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about that...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Music is good for the soul.

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah... Yeah it is... Come in-

           George ENTERS. Looks around. Sally gestures toward the couch -

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to sit?

           Removing his hat -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Thank you.

           George takes a seat on her couch. 

                                 SALLY
                        You thirsty? All I have right now 
                        is water... but I can put ice in 
                        it...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        I’m fine. 

           Sally sits across from him, Indian style. 

                                 SALLY
                        I’m almost afraid to ask...
                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        You play tennis?

           Leaning forward -

                                 SALLY
                        You tell me...

           Smiling -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        You do... you spent your youth 
                        playing and then pursued it as a 
                        profession before switching gears 
                        into science.

                                 SALLY
                        Well, actually, it was always 
                        both... Why did you ask if you knew 
                        already?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Just a way of getting you to relax.

           Sally takes this in, processing it, analyzing it. George can 
           tell that she’s in her head.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m not here to give you bad news. 
                        I’m here to invite you to Johnson 
                        Space Center for two weeks. All 
                        expenses paid of course... 

                                 SALLY
                        For... a tryout?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        For medical tests, interviews... 
                        the gamut.

           Sally is mulling it over. BEAT. She shakes her head.

                                 SALLY
                        I don’t know.

           George can tell that she’s almost too smart for her own good.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Sally... We had over eight thousand 
                        submissions. I narrowed it down to 
                        two hundred and eight. 
                        We’re inviting ten groups. Twenty 
                        applicants per group...
                                 SALLY
                        How many are women?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Twenty one. 

                                 SALLY
                        I’m sure you’ll find one then...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        It’s not about finding someone to 
                        fill a position... it’s about 
                        finding the one that will prove 
                        that women have a place in space.

                                 SALLY
                        Valentina Tereshkova proved that 
                        already.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        I mean the first American woman. 
                        And in Valentina Tereshkova’s case 
                        she flew once and Russia made sure 
                        she never flew again. I’m talking 
                        about a permanent place in history 
                        and in space for women... 

           Sally stands up, unsure, arms crossed, thinking.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (CONT’D)
                        What do you have to lose?

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - EVENING

           ON LINDA smiling across a candlelit table in an upscale 
           restaurant. 

                                 LINDA
                        If I knew we were coming here I 
                        would have dressed up...

           WIDE: Sally and Linda are siting at a corner table.  

                                 SALLY
                        It’s pretty dark, I doubt anyone is 
                        paying attention to us...

           Reaching over, playfully -
                                 LINDA
                        Is that why you brought me here? So 
                        we can hide in public...

           Sally PULLS her hand away. She swallows, straightens up. 
           Linda peers at her, trying to read her face.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        What?

           Reluctantly, Sally looks down, she fiddles with her napkin, 
           before -

                                 SALLY
                        I... I’ve been invited to NASA.

                                 LINDA
                        For what?

                                 SALLY
                        ...To be evaluated. 

           BEAT. Realizing what she means -

                                 LINDA
                        ...I can’t believe you.
                            (raising her voice)
                        You said you weren’t going to 
                        apply! 

           Glancing around -

                                 SALLY
                        Shhhhhh-

                                 LINDA
                        I don’t care! I really DON’T CARE. 
                        You’re never going to find 
                        happiness if you keep hiding who 
                        you are...

           Lowering her voice -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m not hiding...

           Laughing -

                                 LINDA
                        That’s the saddest part... You 
                        don’t even realize you’re doing 
                        it... 
           Sally looks down. Linda stands up, grabs her napkin and 
           tosses it in Sally’s face -

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Screw you Sally Ride...

           Sally watches Linda STORM out. She glances around, everyone 
           in the restuarant is staring at her. Embarrassed, she turns 
           her head toward the window.

           buildings.

           EXT. BUS - ROAD 1 - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally EXITS the bus with the other candidates. She LOOKS UP 
           at a scaled to life model of a NASA JET mounted with a 
           SHUTTLE that sits stoically in front of the main facility as 
           a promise for the future.    

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Welcome to NASA. Can I have 
                        everyone inside please... We’re 
                        going to give you a briefing on the

           George notices Sally lingering/gazing at the staged 
           jet/shuttle. He SMILES.
           INT. SMALL WHITE ROOM - NASA - MOMENTS LATER

           ANGLE ON a WHITE CHAIR in the middle of a small empty white 
           room. There’s a stationary camera mounted across the room, 
           focused on the chair. Sally is ESCORTED IN. She is wearing 
           ONLY a BRA and SHORTS. The escort exits. Sally folds her arms 
           uncomfortably. 

           OVER SPEAKER: Ms. Ride...

           Sally glances around.

           OVER SPEAKER: Have a seat, please.

           Sally sits. Her eyes wander around.

           OVER SPEAKER: Eyes forward.

           Sally sits up, suspiciously glancing around. Then looks 
           forward. a BULB FLASHES. She BLINKS. 

                                 SALLY
                          (rubbing her eyes)
                        Jesus! You could’ve warned me...

           OVER SPEAKER: Two more. Turn to your right please.

           Sally turns to her right, still blinking. 

           OVER SPEAKER: Eyes open.

           Sally reluctantly OPENS her eyes wide. The bulb FLASHES. She 
           cups her eyes.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                          (groaning)
                        Good god... Does it have to be so 
                        bright?

           OVER SPEAKER: One more. To your left please...

           Sally squints and turns to her left. The BULB FLASHES.

           Two physicians are observing. Sally is out in front... Her 
           face is FLUSHED. She’s clearly been jogging for awhile. As 
           she rounds the TURN -- her EYES lock onto the massive GLASS 
           window, where the COLUMBIA ORBITER astronauts are watching 
           John Young their Commander ride the RIG... Sally SLOWS her

           George and James are standing at his window that overlooks

                        She’s intrigued...

                        She’s distracted. Get rid of her.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        She had the best performance out of 
                        every candidate so far...

           Staring at Sally below, skeptically -

                        Has she had her psych evaluation?

                        I want her to have two. Something’s 
                        not right with her...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        Exactly. She’s not. She’s too busy 
                        spying on our astronauts...

           Frustrated, George tightens his jaw.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        She’s smart. And... clearly 
                        improvises... why don’t you go down 
                        and meet her... evaluate her for 
                        yourself...

           James looks over, nonplussed. 

           INT. INDOOR TRACK - NASA - CONTINUOUS

           Sally is WATCHING the COLUMBIA ORBITER Astronaut crew and 
           John Young in the RIG. Astronaut, OWEN (40) NOTICES Sally 
           through the window... He NUDGES his fellow crew members. 
           Sally SMILES. Knowing they’re American HEROES. 
           Owen CROSSES the room and LIFTS his shirt up jokingly 
           gesturing her to do the same. He SHAKES his BARE titties at 
           her. His fellow astronauts LAUGH. Sally BACKS UP, insulted... 

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (O.S.)
                        Sally...

           Sally TURNS. BEHIND THE GLASS: The Columbia crew straightens 
           up. Owen puts his shirt down. John finishes his run on the 
           rig. They help him off. 

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (CONT’D)
                        This is James Fletcher. He’s NASA’S 
                        administrator. Normally you can 
                        find him in Washington, but he’s 
                        been hands on with this particular 
                        project.

           Shaking his hand -

                                 SALLY
                          (to James)
                        Hello...

           James turns Sally’s hand over, looking at it.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        You have a very firm hand shake.

                                 SALLY
                        This is my tennis hand...

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        That’s right. I was told you’re an 
                        athlete... Why aren’t you running?

           Gesturing toward the glass -

                                 SALLY
                        Is that the crew for the Columbia?

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                           (proudly)
                        Yes...

           Sally turns, looks at the crew, her eyes sharpen. John Young 
           GLANCES over.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER (CONT’D)
                        They’re the best astronauts in the 
                        world... If you’re lucky enough 
                        you’ll be able to work with them in 
                        some capacity.
           Sally SIZES them up, looks unimpressed. Owen looks away from 
           her, embarrassed. John Young stares her down. She turns back 
           toward James - 

                                 SALLY
                        I should probably catch up with the 
                        other candidates...

           Sally jogs off/around the track. James GLARES.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        I want her gone.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        She still has to complete the 
                        evaluation. ...If she passes, it’s 
                        only fair that she’s hired.

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        Do you want to chaperone her to 
                        make sure she stays on task? 
                        Because I won’t.

           George GLANCES over at Sally RUNNING on the track. She 
           NOTICES and WAVES. He WAVES back, as she accidently gives the 
           candidate in front of her a flat tire. James STORMS OFF. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. PSYCH ROOM - NASA - MORNING

           ON SALLY as she sits on a big comfy couch. Looking nervous.

                                 MALE ANALYST (O.S.)
                        Your name is Sally Kristen Ride... 
                        Is that correct? 

                                 SALLY
                        That’s correct.

           WIDE: WE’RE IN what looks like a cozy living room... WHEN WE 
           PULL BACK FURTHER WE CAN SEE that it’s a mock living room. 
           WE’RE actually in the cold Johnson Center medical facility. 
           The analyst is a man. He looks stern as he sits across from 
           Sally in a chair with a pad and pencil.

                                 MALE ANALYST
                        Your childhood in Encino, 
                        California... How would you 
                        describe it using one word?

           Smiling -
                                 SALLY
                        Warm.

                                 MALE ANALYST
                        And your childhood?

                                 SALLY
                        Using one word?

                                 MALE ANALYST
                        Yes.

           Pondering -

                                 SALLY
                        Happy.

                                 MALE ANALYST
                        Your parents?

           Contemplating -

                                 SALLY
                        Kind.

                                 MALE ANALYST
                        The first love of your life? 

           Sally swallows. Thinking. LONG BEAT.

                                 MALE ANALYST (CONT’D)
                        Sally?

                                 SALLY
                        ...Competition.

           The analyst jots this down. Sally watches him. 

                                 MALE ANALYST
                        Would you excuse me?

           The analyst gets up, sets his pad down and EXITS. Sally 
           watches him leave. She relaxes into the couch, rubbing her 
           face. BEAT. The door OPENS... A woman ENTERS. She takes the 
           male analyst’s seat and sits, using his pad and pencil. 

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Now, where were we?

           Sally peers at her and then back at the door, completely 
           confused.
                                 FEMALE ANALYST (CONT’D)
                        Your first love was your 
                        competition... Were you in love 
                        with yourself?

           This throws Sally off. 

                                 SALLY
                        I... I don’t think so.

           Sally glances back at the door. Where did the man go?

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Count backwards by nine for me 
                        please... starting NOW-

           Scattered -

                                 SALLY
                        Uh - 
                        108... 99... 90... 81, 72, 63... 
                        54, 45, 36, 27... 18, 9... 0.

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Incorrect. ...You started with, UH. 
                        Uh, isn’t in the alphabet.

           Sally leans forward, starting to get frustrated.

                                 FEMALE ANALYST (CONT’D)
                        Why do you think you’re special?

                                 SALLY
                        I don’t. 

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Yes you do. NASA doesn’t hire 
                        people that aren’t special... You 
                        must think you’re special or 
                        wouldn’t have applied. Be honest 
                        and tell me about yourself...

                                 SALLY
                        ...I’m smart. I like competition. 
                        If you teach me something I’ll 
                        master it and do it better than 
                        you...

           The analyst jots this down.

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Do you think you think like a man?
                                 SALLY
                        No.

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        So you think like a woman.

                                 SALLY
                        Yes.

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Do you like women?

           Sally’s eyes dart down to the ground. Wanting to say, YES.

                                 SALLY
                        No.

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Have you ever been attracted to a 
                        woman?

           Sally forces herself to peer up at the analyst. Unsure.

                                 SALLY
                           (beat)
                        No...

                                 FEMALE ANALYST
                        Would you say you know who you are 
                        as an individual?

           Sally waivers, then -

                                 SALLY
                        Yes...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. RESCUE SPHERE - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - AFTERNOON

           WE LOOKING THROUGH a GLASS WINDOW at a RESCUE SPHERE (a small 
           yard wide, inflated fabric ball). WE DOLLY INTO the ROOM... 
           and get right on top of the ball.

           INT. RESCUE SPHERE - CONTINUOUS

           ON SALLY STUFFED INSIDE. She’s wearing a helmet, hooked up to 
           oxygen. It’s a STRESS TEST. She’s staring straight ahead, 
           counting each breath.
           INT. RESCUE SPHERE - AN HOUR LATER

           SUPER: AN HOUR LATER...

           SWEAT has FORMED on Sally’s face. She CLOSES her EYES.

           INT. RESCUE SPHERE - FIVE HOURS LATER

           SUPER: FIVE HOURS LATER...

           Sally’s eyes are still CLOSED. Her face is FLUSHED covered in 
           SWEAT. 

                                 FEMALE ANALYST (V.O.)
                        Would you say you know who you are 
                        as an individual?

           Sally’s EYES OPEN. Her breathing accelerates. 

                                 FEMALE ANALYST (V.O.)
                        Would you say you know who you are 
                        as an individual?

           Sally begins to PUSH against the sphere... 

                                 FEMALE ANALYST (V.O.)
                        Would you say you know who you are 
                        as an individual?

           Sally PUSHES with ALL of MIGHT... and... then... SCREAMS. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. DINNER TABLE - DALE & CAROL RIDE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Dale, Carol and Bear are fixing their plates. There’s an 
           EMPTY chair and an empty plate... Dale glances at it, sighs. 

                                 DALE RIDE
                        Did she come down at all today?

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        She did once, this morning...

                                 BEAR RIDE
                        Should I go get her?

           Dale shakes his head, sets his plate down, wipes his mouth. 
           He grabs the empty plate and begins to fix it with food.
           EXT. ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally is sitting on the roof staring up at the stars, she 
           looks tired.  

                                 DALE RIDE
                        Am I invited?

           Sally TURNS. Her father is holding a plate of food and a 
           blanket. He walks over sits beside her.

                                 DALE RIDE (CONT’D)
                        I figured you’d be hungry...

                                 SALLY
                        I’m not. But, thanks dad.

           Peering up at the sky -

                                 DALE RIDE
                        What are we looking at tonight? 

           Sally shrugs. 

                                 DALE RIDE (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes not looking at anything 
                        in particular can be a good 
                        thing... I think people can get so 
                        focused on one aspect of something 
                        that they forget the bigger 
                        picture.

           Sally takes a deep breath. 

                                 DALE RIDE (CONT’D)
                        ...Whatever happened at NASA 
                        doesn’t make you who you are. 

           Sally looks down and over at her father. Dale puts his arm 
           around her.

                                 DALE RIDE (CONT’D)
                        In all my years of teaching 
                        political science there’s one thing 
                        I can definitively say about 
                        life... It chooses us, not the 
                        other way around.

                                 SALLY
                           (beat)
                        What if life wants to change you?
                                 DALE RIDE
                        That’s evolution. We all have to 
                        change one way or another in order 
                        to survive...

           Sally leans against her father and peers back up at the 
           stars.

           in the WOMEN ONLY SIGN. James is HOLDING his briefcase 
           tightly. Chris Kraft is standing beside him.

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        I’ll walk you out...

           “GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD” by ELTON JOHN FADES OUT...

           EXITING, to James -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Where are you going? You both you 
                        should sit in for this...

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        I’ve resigned, George. I knew it 
                        was selection day so, I figured I’d 
                        call you once I’m back in 
                        Washington...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        That’s it? You’re just done...  
                        Just like that?

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        James needs a break, George. I 
                        think he’s earned that. Dr. 
                        Lovelace is stepping in as 
                        Administrator...

           James is peering at the projection through the glass, coming 
           from the board room. Noticing, turning, pointing -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Sally came in first. We can’t deny 
                        her...

           Defeatedly -

                                 JAMES C. FLETCHER
                        ...I know.

           INT. BEDROOM - SALLY’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           ON THE telephone sitting next to Sally’s nightstand beside 
           her clock. It’s 5 A.M. The PHONE BEGINS TO RING... 

           WIDE: Sally isn’t home. The bed is neatly made and EMPTY. The 
           PHONE continues to RING...

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - ENCINO, CA - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally (in pajamas) is sitting in an orange tree, WATCHING the 
           sun come up over the mountains. It’s peacefully quiet. 
                                 CAROL RIDE (O.S.)
                        ...SAAALLY!

           Sally TURNS. Carol is in a ROBE RUNNING down their dirt road 
           toward her... Sally hops down from the tree, concerned. 

                                 SALLY
                        Mom!?

           Out of breath -

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        It’s NASA...

           INT. KITCHEN - DALE & CAROL RIDE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally RUSHES INSIDE... Carol is on her heels out of BREATH. 
           Dale ENTERS the kitchen.

                                 DALE RIDE
                        What’s wrong?

           Pointing at the phone -

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        Shhhhh! It’s NASA...

           Grabbing the phone -

                                 SALLY
                        Hello?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (O.S.)
                        Sally?

                                 SALLY
                        Yes...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (O.S.)
                        That job you applied for at Nasa... 
                        Do you still want it?

           Sally LEANS against the wall to keep her legs from 
           buckling... Carol is clinging onto her glass of water, Dale 
           is FROZEN. 

                                 SALLY
                        I thought you’d never ask...

           Dale and Carol EMBRACE knowing their daughter’s life will 
           never be the same. 
                                 GEORGE ABBEY (O.S.)
                        Good. ...We need you to report 
                        immediately to Washington. We’re 
                        holding a press conference to 
                        introduce the AsCans... 

                                 SALLY
                        AsCans?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (O.S.)
                        Astronaut candidates... Just 
                        because you’re chosen doesn’t 
                        instantly make you an astronaut... 
                        We’ll prep you to be ready for any 
                        questions the press may throw at 
                        you...

           Deflating -

                                 SALLY
                        What kind of questions?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (O.S.)
                        Anything, everything... What you 
                        eat for breakfast, what’s your 
                        favorite color... who are you 
                        dating... that kinda stuff... 
                        You’ll be fine...

                                 SALLY
                        Right... Thanks.

           Sally HANGS UP. Concerned.

                                 CAROL RIDE
                        I thought it was good news...

                                 SALLY
                        They want to hold a press 
                        conference...

           Putting his arm around her -

                                 DALE RIDE
                        That’s great! It’s not like you 
                        have anything to hide...

           OFF SALLY.

           WIDE: GEORGE ABBEY (HEAD OF SELECTION BOARD and HEAD OF 
           FLIGHT OPERATIONS), CHRIS KRAFT (DIRECTOR at JOHNSON SPACE

           SELECTION COMMITTEE) and the new ADMINISTRATOR DR. ALAN 
           LOVELACE (40’s) are SITTING on a PANEL underneath a MASSIVE 
           NASA LOGO. A SEA of MEDIA from ALL OVER the GLOBE has 
           gathered before them... most of which look 
           unenthusiastic/indifferent.  

           Whispering to the rest of the panel - 

                                 DR. LOVELACE
                        Should I even say anything?

           Looking out at the unimpressed, press -

           LEGENDS hanging on the wall... WE CONTINUE TO PAN ACROSS 
           STOPPING ON...

           SALLY as she moves through the crowded room with the 34 other 
           AsCans (astronaut canidates). She’s sweating. She notices 
           everyone is in mildly formal attire, the men are in bell 
           bottomed suits... 

           Sally spots the five other women chosen... They’re in skirts 
           and blouses. Sally is in jeans, converse and a tee shirt. 
           They all glance over at her... Sally wipes her face, and 
           walks toward... RHEA SEDDON (40, blonde), ANNA L. FISHER 
           (30’s, brunette), JUDITH RESNIK (30’s, brunette), SHANNON 
           LUCID (40’s, doughy faced) and KATHERINE SULLIVAN (30’s)... 
           Rhea has clearly designated herself as pack leader... 
                                 RHEA 
                          (to the group, southern accent)
                        Well, she certainly looks 
                        comfortable...

           Approaching, lighthearted, but nervous -

                                 SALLY
                        It’s good to see some of my kind 
                        here... I wasn’t sure there would 
                        be any... I’m Sally-

                                 RHEA
                        And what kind is that?

                                 SALLY
                        Women... 

           Looking Sally over -

                                 RHEA
                        I’m Rhea. I’m a surgeon... and 
                        that’s Anna, she’s a chemist... and 
                        Judith...

                                 JUDITH
                        I’m an electrical engineer.

                                 SHANNON
                        I work in biochemistry... I’m 
                        Shannon.

                                 KATHRYN
                        Kathryn... I’m a geologist. 

           Sally has the least credentials out of the bunch. 

                                 RHEA
                        What do you do, Sally?

           Brushing her wild hair from her face, shrugging -

                                 SALLY
                        I play tennis mostly...

           The group looks confused. Sally straightens up -

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m working on my doctorate in 
                        astrophysics at Stanford...

           Unimpressed -
                                 RHEA
                        Oh... 

           INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - CONTINUOUS

           The press is chattering away. George taps the microphone and 
           begins...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Shall we get started?

           The room starts to quiet down. One reporter shouts jokingly -

                                 L.A. TIMES 
                        Why are we here!?

           The room laughs. George smirks.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        I understand all of your curiosity 
                        around this conference... and I’m 
                        here to tell you that what I’m 
                        about to share today is going to 
                        change the way you all perceive 
                        NASA and what it means to be a part 
                        of something bigger...

                                 NEW YORK TIMES 
                        Okay... so why are we here?

           The room laughs again. George glances over at Chris Kraft.

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        We’re announcing our next flight 
                        into space...

           Lots of CHATTER from the room. 

                                 WASHINGTON POST
                        The Columbia mission?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        It’s successor... The CHALLENGER. 

           THE PRESS BEGINS SPEAKING OVER EACH OTHER.

                                 NEW YORK TIMES
                        Shouldn’t NASA focus on one mission 
                        at a time?
                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        We’re fairly comfortable with the 
                        Columbia’s progress and it’s 
                        crew... 

                                 L.A. TIMES
                        How is the CHALLENGER going to be 
                        any different?

           George smiles and glances at Carolyn.

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON
                        The crew will be different. For the 
                        first time in history we’ve chosen 
                        thirty five Astronaut candidates... 
                        the largest NASA class to date. 
                            (beat)
                        Four of which are minority men and 
                        six are WOMEN...

           The room BURSTS into a FRENZY. PHOTOGRAPHERS begin to SNAP

                           (British accent)
                        So you’re telling us that women 
                        will be going into space?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        It’s a high possibility, yes... 

                                 L.A. TIMES
                        Would they be flying to assist the 
                        male astronauts? ...Making coffee, 
                        folding clothes?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        No. They’ll be equals.

                        Don’t you find it... well, 
                        inappropriate? What will the wives 
                        of our astronauts think?

           Speaking up -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Hopefully they’ll think and feel 
                        that they finally live in a country 
                        of equality...
           INT. DOWN THE HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Sally is standing in the corner with the other female AsCans. 
           They’re not really talking to her. They’re talking amongst 
           each other about which male AsCans are attractive. Staring 
           across the room at STEVEN HAWLEY (20’s, lanky, handsome, 
           dirty blonde). He’s the only guy in jeans and a tee shirt.

                                 RHEA
                        God, if I were ten years younger 
                        and single...

                                 ANNA
                        I hope those reporters don’t ask 
                        anything too personal...

           Sally sets her glass of water down -

                                 SALLY
                        Excuse me...

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ANGLE ON Sally SPLASHING her face with water. She looks up in 
           the mirror, stressed. She rubs her temples and exhales. The 
           door OPENS...

                                 STEVE
                        Ooops, sorry...

           Sally glances over -

                                 SALLY
                        It’s fine. I’m leaving...

                                 STEVE
                        They didn’t put a gender sign on 
                        the door... 

           The towel dispenser is empty. Sally wipes her hands on her 
           jeans, her face still wet -

                                 SALLY
                        That’s because usually there’s only 
                        men here...

           Steve smiles.

                                 STEVE
                        I’ll come back.

                                 SALLY
                        I’m done...
                                 STEVE
                        I think we’re going on pretty 
                        soon... I’m Steve.

           Shaking hands -

                                 SALLY
                        Sally. I’m not staying... 

                                 STEVE
                        Sorry, I thought you were an 
                        AsCan...

                                 SALLY
                        I am. Or was... 

                                 STEVE
                        Hey... don’t let the first day get 
                        in your head... We’re all nervous. 
                        We can’t expect to feel normal 
                        right now...

                                 SALLY
                        I’ve never felt normal...

                                 STEVE
                        Here...

           Steve pulls out a napkin from his pocket, hands it to her -

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll stay if you stay.

           INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - CONTINUOUS

           AS LIGHTBULBS FLASH -

                                 NEW YORK TIMES
                        And how will NASA handle the 
                        sleeping arrangements in space? Or 
                        menstruation for that matter?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        The male astronauts never slept in 
                        the same bed quarters and I don’t 
                        expect the women to...

           The media CHUCKLES. 

                                 L.A. TIMES
                        When do we get to meet them?

           George glances over at his colleagues. 
           INT. DOWN THE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           ON SALLY, her hair damp from splashing water in her face. A 
           NASA official ENTERS... 

                                 NASA OFFICIAL
                        Alright AsCans... I need everyone 
                        to line up... and grab your name 
                        tag...

           Sally GLANCES around for the nearest EXIT. She begins to work 
           against the crowd moving away from the line. She BUMPS into -

                                 STEVE
                        Hey... Wait whoa, wait... are you 
                        really leaving?

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah...

                                 STEVE
                        What are you so afraid of? 

           Sally can’t answer.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        All of that stuff out there... it 
                        has nothing to do with you... They 
                        just want a story... Give them one. 

           OFF SALLY.

           INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - MOMENTS LATER

           LIGHTBULBS FLASH. 

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (O.S.)
                        I want you to all welcome NASA’S 
                        class of 1978...

           Sally is walking out behind Steve as the group of 35 are 
           seated in a long panel on the stage. The MEDIA CLAPS. Sally 
           looks for an open seat... no one wants to sit directly in the 
           middle... it’s the only open seat left. Sally closes her eyes 
           and reluctantly sits. 

           The MEDIA quiets down. Standing on the stage with a 
           microphone like a proud father is George. Pointing to a 
           reporter -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (CONT’D)
                        We can start in the back...
                                 CHICAGO TRIBUNE
                        Hi... This question is for the 
                        female candidates. Do any of you 
                        feel pressure to make it in the 
                        very coemptive atmosphere that the 
                        Johnson Center creates?

           Rhea SMILES, leans forward, playing up her alpha attitude for 
           the press -

                                 RHEA
                        I can only speak for myself... I 
                        don’t feel any pressure. I think if 
                        I’m measured on brains and not 
                        brawn, I’ll be fine.

           MEDIA LAUGHS. 

                                 L.A. TIMES 
                        What about you, Sally? Feel 
                        pressure?

           Sally BLINKS. Swallows. GRABS the mic, it SCREECHES. She 
           clears her throat as she gathers courage.

                                 SALLY
                        Yeah, I... I do. 
                            (beat)
                        ...I think that’s what makes us 
                        human. If we didn’t feel pressure 
                        when we’re about to take on 
                        something bigger than ourselves, 
                        then when would we? It’s what 
                        unites humanity...

           THE MEDIA EATS THIS UP. LIGHTBULBS FLASH. George and Carolyn 
           SMILE. Rhea looks annoyed. THE PRESS CHATTERS over each other 
           to ask Sally more questions...

                                 NEW YORK TIMES
                        What do you hope to gain from all 
                        of this?

           With a nervous death grip on the microphone -

                                 SALLY
                        Are we here to gain something? 

                                 NEW YORK TIMES
                        As a woman...
                                 SALLY
                        Well... I’ve beaten every man that 
                        I’ve ever been put up against, in 
                        science and sports so... maybe 
                        you’re asking the wrong woman.

           Steve smirks. THE MEDIA GOES WILD AGAIN, shouting more 
           questions at Sally -

                                 CHICAGO TRIBUNE
                        Are you afraid that working in a 
                        man’s occupation will make you 
                        homosexual?

           Sally stares at the Chicago Tribune reporter. She’s caught 
           very off guard, looks uncomfortable. Like a deer in 
           headlights. 

           Noticing -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Okay, lets move on to some of the 
                        other candidates...

           Leaning over, whipsering -

                                 STEVE
                           (to Sally)
                        I’m glad you stayed...

           Sally forces a smile.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. COLUMBIA ORBITER - KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - MORNING

           ON MASSIVE PROPULSION EXHAUST PIPES that BLEED INTO 3 very 
           intricate engines... they’re DRIPPING FLUID. 

           WIDE: THE COLUMBIA ORBITER SHUTTLE is PARKED IN the MASSIVE 
           assembly building. It’s connected to various HUGE WIRES and 
           CORDS. 

           INT. COLUMBIA’S NITROGEN PURGED AFT ENGINE COMPARTMENT - SAME 
           TIME

           TIGHT ON AN ENGINEER WEARING A MOUNTED HELMET EQUIPPED WITH A 
           FLASHLIGHT... HE SWEATING PROFUSELY in the dark space. The 
           compartment is TIGHT. He’s wiring something together. WE HEAR 
           COUGHING... 
           WIDE: Three engineers are working tirelessly in the cramped 
           compartment, surrounded by cords and wires. Engineer 2 
           continues to cough. 

           Wiping his face -

                                 ENGINEER 1
                        Goddamn it’s hot... 

                                 ENGINEER 3
                        Sooner we finish the better, launch 
                        is just around the corner... 

           Engineer 2 can’t stop COUGHING. 

                                 ENGINEER 1
                            (to engineer 2)
                        You alright?

           Engineer 2 nods. Engineer 3 clears his throat... he’s trying 
           not to cough, but can’t help it... he starts COUGHING. 
           Drenched in sweat, engineer 1 wipes his face -

                                 ENGINEER 1 (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get it together, come on...

           EXT. COLUMBIA ORBITER - KENNEDY SPACE CENTER - AFTERNOON

           The second SHIFT of engineers ENTER the assembly facility... 
           They NOTICE ALL of the previous engineers stuff (lunch, 
           watch, hat etc) is still there. They glance at each other.

           INT. COLUMBIA’S NITROGEN PURGED AFT ENGINE COMPARTMENT - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           The NEW shift of engineers crawl into the SPACE... They shine 
           a FLASHLIGHT around the wires and FIND the 3 previous 
           engineers DEAD from asphyxiation. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. GEORGE ABBEY’S OFFICE - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MORNING

           ON GEORGE. He’s not blinking. WIDE: He’s staring at the white 
           wall across the room, deep in thought. After a LONG BEAT. He 
           EXHALES and covers his face. His secretary ENTERS.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Is John Young here yet?
                                 SECRETARY 
                        I don’t think so, sir... Want me to 
                        double check?

           George SHAKES his head. She EXITS as Chris Kraft ENTERS.

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        I’m sorry George... 

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        I’m not the one that needs 
                        apologizing to... 

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        Do you know what happened?

           Stressed -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        There were leaks in the main engine 
                        and the thermal protection 
                        system...

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        What about the launch date?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Non existent. Not until it’s fixed. 

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        Have you told John yet?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        No.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           WIDE: The AsCans are LINED up in a row. Sally is at the end, 
           closest to the GLASS RIG ROOM. A somber George is standing 
           before them, alongside Carolyn and Chris. 

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        Today is your first day of 
                        training. We’re going to split you 
                        off into groups...

           George NOTICES Astronaut John Young ENTER the RIG ROOM 
           through the glass. Sally glances over. Rhea and the others 
           notices John.
                                 RHEA
                           (low voice)
                        I heard they call him, 
                        Moonwalker...

                                 SHANNON
                        Why’s that?

           Sally listens in -

                                 RHEA
                        He was the last man to walk on the 
                        moon...

                                 JUDITH
                        The rig is the hardest machine at 
                        Nasa...

           Sally peers at the RIG as George CROSSES over to the GIMBAL 
           RIG ROOM and ENTERS. 

           THROUGH THE GLASS: John looks relaxed at first... Sally and 
           the other AsCans can’t help but WATCH. The glass room is 
           right beside them. George begins to speak to John... John’s 
           demeanor SHIFTS... He looks very ANGRY and UPSET, POINTING 
           and SHOUTING. George looks like he trying to calm him down. 
           Chris and Carolyn NOTICE. 

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON (O.S.)
                        Sally, Rhea, Shannon, Anna, Judith 
                        and Kathryn... If you can come with 
                        me... 

           John kicks the chair in the RIG ROOM across the floor and 
           STORMS OUT. George remains in the room. He picks the chair up 
           from the ground.

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ladies...

           Sally snaps out of her gaze as the women FOLLOW Carolyn out 
           of the GYM.

           INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally, Rhea, Shannon, Anna, Judith and Kathryn ENTER behind 
           Carolyn INTO a large facility with a 12 meter (40-foot) deep 
           tank. Coming to a HALT in front of the large water tank -

                                 JUDITH
                           (whispering to the other women)
                        Should we ask what happened?
                                 RHEA
                           (whispering)
                        ...No-

                                 SALLY
                           (to Carolyn)
                        What happened back there?

           Carolyn gathers her thoughts. 

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON
                        ...Three men died working on the 
                        Columbia. So now, the mission has 
                        been postponed. It’s a hard thing 
                        to hear sometimes and even harder 
                        when lives are on the line... 

           Sally takes this in with the other women. 

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON (CONT’D)
                        I started at NASA ten years ago. I 
                        would’ve given anything to be in 
                        the position you ladies are in... 
                        My job here in the beginning was to 
                        study how the human body adapts to 
                        space flight. ...The problem was, 
                        NASA didn’t want a woman to 
                        interact with the astronauts... so 
                        I’d have my male assistant take 
                        samples and bring them back to me. 
                            (trying not to get 
                              emotional)
                        You six have an opportunity to 
                        change the way we think as a 
                        society... It’s very important that 
                        you look at each other not as 
                        competitors, but as sisters... 

           Rhea glances at Sally remorsefully. Chris Kraft and George 
           ENTER...  

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                           (to Carolyn)
                        Did you go over the basics yet?

           Straightening up -

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON
                        Not yet.

           Getting right to business -
                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        Ladies, below the water is a 
                        replica of the objects and 
                        interiors and exteriors of a 
                        shuttle that one day you may be 
                        on... This simulates the conditions 
                        close to the weightlessness of 
                        space. We’re going to suit you up 
                        and you’ll have twenty minutes to 
                        work as a team to repair a 
                        telescope... We’ll give you ten 
                        minutes to look over the 
                        instructions...

                                 SHANNON
                          (low voice)
                        Oh, no... 

                                 SALLY
                        What?

                                 SHANNON
                           (low voice)
                        I can’t swim.

           Sally’s eyes sharpen on the water.

           INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           “HEY SISTER” by SIMIAN MOBILE DISCO PLAYS OVER:

           SALLY and the other women are being FITTED INTO BIG WHITE 
           SPACE SUITS. The last piece is the HELMET... Sally SLIDES her 
           on... The group is signalled to HEAD to the PLATFORM... The 
           women gather on it. The platform LOWERS DOWN INTO THE TANK.

           THE MUSIC STOPS. 

           BUOYANCY TANK:

           Sally can only HEAR the sound of her breath and her 
           heartbeat. The BOTTOM IS LIT UP. Her eyes DART around. The 
           others look LOST. The PLATFORM COMES to HALT at the BOTTOM. 
           Sally FORCES herself to SWIM off of it in the heavy suit. The 
           group FOLLOWS her. Shannon BEGINS to FREAK OUT, UNABLE to 
           MOVE. Sally NOTICES, she GRABS her ARM and GOADS her 
           across... Sally GRABS the PLASTIC LINED instructions: Looks 
           at the design. The women huddle around. Rhea heads toward the 
           satellite... EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE IT’S IN SLOW MOTION. Rhea 
           BEGINS wiring the main antenna.  Sally KNOWS she’s doing it 
           wrong... She shakes her head and POINTS to the opposite 
           end... 
           Shannon PANICS, she BACKS UP into something, knocking it 
           over... Sally GLANCES at the time they have 10 minutes left. 
           She heads to Shannon and hands her one of the tools to screw 
           in the bottom of the satellite... Sally FORCES Shannon back 
           over and directs her on how to use the tool. Sally turns and 
           begins re-wiring with the others... 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           THE PLATFORM RISES with the group on it, looking 
           disappointed. Sally and the others are weighed down and 
           waterlogged by the suit... Sally crawls on all fours, YANKING 
           her helmet OFF CATCHING her breath. Shannon is CRYING. Sally 
           helps Shannon with her helmet. Sally forces herself to sit 
           up, she looks angry. George and Carolyn NOTICE.

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON
                        Why are you upset?

                                 SALLY
                        We ran out of time.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        The point of today’s training was 
                        to see how well you’d work as a 
                        group... it was never about fixing 
                        the satellite.

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON
                           (to Sally)
                        You’re the only one that passed.

           Rhea and the others looks surprised.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Rule number one at NASA.. Not 
                        everything is what it seems.

           OFF SALLY.

           EXT. SATURN LANE/GEMINI AVENUE - EVENING

           ON the OUTSKIRTS of JOHNSON SPACE CENTER... two winding 
           streets known as SATURN LANE and GEMINI AVENUE that consist 
           of PERFECTLY manicured lawns with perfectly positioned single 
           family houses with white picket fences, can be found. This is 
           where all of the astronauts, engineers, technicians and 
           managers are accommodated. Every LEGEND (astronaut) who ever 
           work for NASA has lived on these two streets. 
           EXT. SALLY’S HOUSE - SATURN LANE - EVENING

           Sally is sitting outside in her backyard. She’s tossing a 
           tennis ball against the fence... A CAR with loud exhaust 
           PULLS IN ACROSS the street... Sally gets up, peeks over: John 
           Young gets out of his Corvette. His wife and two kids run out 
           of the house. He WARMLY greets them. He the polar opposite of 
           the person he was this morning. 

                                 STEVE (O.S.)
                        So you’re a spy, huh?

           Sally looses her footing, slips down from the fence. Steve 
           Hawley is her next door neighbor.

                                 SALLY
                        Looks like you are too...

           Steve shrugs. Leans over his fence, holding a beer -

                                 STEVE
                        This entire week’s been an out of 
                        body experience... It’s like life 
                        started over... I’m not in Kansas 
                        anymore.

                                 SALLY
                        Who were you in your past life?

                                 STEVE
                        I graduated top of my class at the 
                        University of Kansas... 

                                 SALLY
                        Oh, you’re literally from Kansas...

           Steve nods, swigs his beer.

                                 STEVE
                        A have two degrees in physics and 
                        astronomy... but here... it’s like 
                        I’m starting from the bottom all 
                        over again. It’s a psychological 
                        game. 
                            (beat)
                        If I didn’t know who I was I’d feel 
                        really lost right now...

           Sally glances up at the MOON. Tense. Does she know herself 
           yet? She picks up her tennis ball.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        You leaving? I know I talk too 
                        much...
           Heading across the lawn -

                                 SALLY
                        I have an early morning...

           Steve swigs his beer, watches her head inside.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EARLY MORNING

           ANGLE ON Sally’s orientation map of NASA and a manual on the 
           GIMBAL RIG. She GLANCES UP at the RIG ROOM through the 
           glass...

           INT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally ENTERS. She peers around the room, her eyes move up 
           looking at the RIG, extended in the AIR. She walks closer to 
           it... 

                                 JOHN YOUNG (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Sally TURNS. John is standing in the corner.

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        This machine isn’t for AsCans... 
                        Especially not women.

           Sally looks down at her map and booklet -

                                 SALLY
                        It doesn’t say anywhere that 
                        rookies can’t use the RIG.

           John grabs her book and tosses it into the trash across the 
           room.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Yeah, well... some things around 
                        here don’t need to be written down.

                                 SALLY
                        I want to try it.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        You’re not a pilot. 

                                 SALLY
                        Mission Specialists still have to 
                        do flight school...
                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        What are you trying to prove?

                                 SALLY
                        It’s the hardest machine, right? 

           John SHRUGS. He knows it is. Carolyn KNOCKS on the GLASS, 
           motions Sally to come on with the rest of the group.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Looks like mommy found you...

           Sally STARES John down, yanks her booklet from the garbage. 
           John WATCHES her storm out. 

           INT. NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally, Rhea, Shannon, Anna, Judith and Kathryn are getting 
           into their space suits. 

                                 RHEA
                           (jokingly)
                        Didn’t expect you to be the flirty 
                        type...

                                 SALLY
                        I wasn’t flirting.

                                 SHANNON
                        Who cares. He’s cute...

           Focused on getting the heavy space suit on right -

                                 SALLY
                        I wasn’t flirting.

                        They’re all cute... I wonder what 
                        their wives think of us?

           Sally want’s no part of the conversation. She grabs her 
           helmet and heads to the platform and SLIDES her helmet on. 
           She can only HEAR her breathing now. She looks down into the 
           water at her reflection as the rest head over. Carolyn 
           motions for the platform to LOWER DOWN INTO... 

           INT. WATER TANK - NEUTRAL BUOYANCY LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Rhea SWIMS OFF FIRST and GRABS the instructions, she READS 
           and then... FLOATS them over to Sally... Sally PEERS UP at a 
           large machine jutting from the bottom of the tank almost all 
           the way to the top... 
           Sally POINTS to the antenna on the instructions and then 
           points to the actual antenna on top of the large device... 
           Sally points to Shannon closest to the tools... Shannon nods 
           and grabs them... Sally motions for everyone to start scaling 
           the machine... Halfway up Shannon LOOSES her footing and 
           SLIPS... her helmet hits the side panel HARD... Sally GLANCES 
           back... and RELEASES her GRIP, FLOATING down to Shannon... 
           Shannon is KNOCKED OUT COLD. Sally wraps her arm around her 
           and BEGINS to SWIM to the surface...

           EXT. WATER TANK - MOMENTS LATER

           Shannon is helped out of the water, Sally right behind her. 
           Sally PULLS her helmet off to catch her breath. Carolyn, 
           George and Chris surround Shannon as she slowly comes to.

                        What happened?

                                 SALLY
                        She slipped...

           Sally starts putting her helmet back on...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Hey, you don’t need to go back down 
                        today...

                                 SALLY
                        I know. 
                            (smiling)
                        I want to...

           Sally TURNS and JUMPS IN FEET FIRST. Chris and Carolyn look 
           impressed. George is dumfounded. 

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON
                        How many of the men went back?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        None.

           WE PAN ACROSS a magazine rack... Sally and the AsCans are 
           gracing the cover of PEOPLE, NEWSWEEK, THE L.A. TIMES. WE 
           CONTINUE TO PAN and come to a HALT ON Sally shopping... She 
           reaches for a box of cereal and winces, sore from training, 
           she rubs her neck.  
                                 SHOPPER
                        Oh my god... Sally Ride?

           Sally looks surprised. The shopper’s daughter (9) rushes over 
           to her -

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Can I have your autograph?

                                 SALLY
                        You really want my autograph?

                                 SHOPPER
                        I can’t thank you enough for what 
                        you’re doing... 

           Sally glances around in disbelief.  

                                 SALLY
                        I haven’t done anything yet...

                                 SHOPPER
                        Yes you have... 
                            (to daughter)
                        Honey, tell Sally what you want to 
                        be when you grow up...

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        An astronaut just like you!

           She bends down, eye level with the girl, realizing that she’s 
           making an impact -

                                 SALLY
                        And you know what? ...You will be.

           Sally is washing lettuce in the sink. A small televison is on 
           playing the original Star Trek series. She glances up through 
           the kitchen window as...  John Young PULLS INTO THE DRIVEWAY 
           across the street. He HOPS out of his car, finishes his 
           cigarette and heads inside.

           OFF SALLY.

           The GYM is EMPTY... INTO FRAME: Sally ENTERS the GYM... walks 
           across to the WINDOW, PEERS IN the at RIG room... it’s EMPTY. 
           SHE OPENS the door...

                                 SECURITY 
                        Excuse me... Miss-

           INT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sally ENTERS. She BRUSHES her hair from her face and PULLS 
           the manual for the RIG from her back pocket. She slides UP a 
           stool and PEERS up at the MIGHTY MACHINE. 

                                 SALLY
                        Alright Gimbal... How do you work?

           She OPENS the manual... glances up again... She glances over 
           at the test engineer controls... then heads over to them. She 
           presses a series of buttons as she glances down at her book. 
           The RIG SLOWLY GLIDES DOWN to the floor. 

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        Well that’s a start...

           She presses another series of codes and the RIG LIFTS and 
           begins to ROTATE... Sally slowly smiles.

           Steve is pushing past fellow NASA employees trying to catch 
           up to someone... He STOPS. THINKS. And then continues... 
           until he catches up to... Sally, who is heading to medical 
           safety class. She’s holding the RIG manual, still reading up 
           on it.

                                 STEVE
                        Hey-

           Sally TURNS.

                                 SALLY
                        Hey.
           Nervous -

                                 STEVE
                        I normally wouldn’t be this 
                        straight forward... I mean, or... I 
                        guess... I’d put more thought into 
                        it-

                                 SALLY
                        Steve. Just say it. We’re 
                        neighbors.

                                 STEVE
                        Would you... would want to have 
                        dinner with me sometime?

           Unprepared -

                                 SALLY
                        ...Oh, okay, sure.

                                 STEVE
                        You don’t want to...

           Sally closes her book. 

                                 SALLY
                        I just-

                                 STEVE
                        No pressure. It’s not a date... I 
                        just figured since we’re neighbors 
                        and all...

           Sally brushes her hair from her face. She sees how much Steve 
           wants company. Stuffing the RIG manual in her back pocket -

                                 SALLY
                        ...I think it would be fun.

           Steve PULLS out a chair for Sally. Both are dressed upscale 
           1978/79 casual. Glancing around -

                                 SALLY
                        I haven’t really been out yet...

                            (nervous)
                        You look really nice. 

           Smiling -

                                 SALLY
                        You do too...

           The waiter arrives, hands them menus. 

                                 WAITER
                        Good evening. Is this your first 
                        time here?

                                 SALLY
                        We just moved here...

                                 WAITER
                        Well, welcome to APOLLO... home to 
                        the best astronaut themed food  in 
                        Houston... 

           Sally SMIRKS. Steve mirrors her expression. The waiter 
           doesn’t get it.

                                 WAITER (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to hear our 
                        specials? ...For starters we have, 
                        John Glenn squash soup and we also 
                        have-

                                 SALLY
                        I think we’re good...

           Steve BURSTS into laughter. 

           Offended -

                                 WAITER
                        Take your time.

           He walks off. 

                                 SALLY
                           (to Steve, jokingly)
                        I hope I make it to the menu one 
                        day...

           BEAT. Steve looks over at Sally as if he can see INTO her.
                                 STEVE
                        That day when we met... Why did you 
                        want to leave so bad?

           BEAT. 

                                 SALLY
                        ...I was afraid of the what the 
                        press may ask. 

                                 STEVE
                        What would have been so bad?

           She folds her arms protectively. 

                                 SALLY
                        I’m... I guess I’m not... I guess 
                        sometimes... I don’t feel like 
                        everyone else...

                                 STEVE
                        That’s why we’re here. We’re not 
                        normal. ...It’s a gift. Not a 
                        curse.

           Sally looks down. 

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Is it something else? 

           Grabbing the menu, forcing a smile -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m just hungry I think...

           Steve can tell there’s something else on her mind but doesn’t 
           push it. 

                                 STEVE
                        Flight school starts tomorrow. 

                                 SALLY
                        Who are you hoping to partner up 
                        with?

                                 STEVE
                        Out of the pilots? God, I don’t 
                        know. They all scare me... I heard 
                        John Young is the worst though... 
                        as long as I don’t get him, I’m 
                        happy. ...You?

                                 SALLY
                        He’s the worst pilot?
                                 STEVE
                        He’s the best. He’ll make you feel 
                        and look like the worst...

           Sally’s focuses on the menu... on it, the John Young fried 
           duck.

           EXT. TARMAC - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MORNING

           ON JOHN YOUNG chewing GUM as the STRONG WINDS BLOW his hair 
           around. WIDE: George is standing in front of a microphone. 
           Chris Kraft and Carolyn to his left and right. Along with 8 
           astronaut PILOTS the old guard in NASA’s blue G-suits. BEHIND 
           THEM are eight T-38 SUPER SONIC JETS. 

           REVERSE ANGLE: The 34 AsCans (also in blue NASA G-suits) 
           looking TERRIFIED. Sally is the only one that looks unafraid 
           among the group.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Today is your first flight at NASA. 
                        And although it may not be to the 
                        moon, it’s still an experience that 
                        will shape your future here moving 
                        forward... You’ll be partnering 
                        with one of our talented astronauts 
                        beside me who will introduce to 
                        your first twin jet flight...

           One of the AsCans is so nervous that he breaks from the line 
           and RUSHES OFF to puke in the grass. John Young shakes his 
           head, spits his gum out. Sally focuses on the jets just 
           beyond the pilots... 

           EXT. TARMAC - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally is getting fitted with a parachute. The pilot hands her 
           a helmet -

                                 PILOT
                        Scared?

           Sally SHAKES her head. John Young is two rows over with a 
           nervous rookie. He SEES Sally and her pilot... HEADS OVER:

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                           (to pilot)
                        Let me switch with you...
           The pilot pats the jet and glances over at Sally who looks 
           shocked -

                        She’s all yours Moonwalker...

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Thanks. 
                            (to Sally)
                        You still want to ride the rig? 

                                 SALLY
                        Ye-

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Don’t answer until after the 
                        flight...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. T-38 COCKPIT - MOMENTS LATER

           ON SALLY wearing on helmet and an oxygen mask with a built in 
           microphone. 

           FROM TOWER: “Clear for takeoff Moonwalker... Be safe up 
           there.”

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        This shouldn’t hurt too much...

           Sally GLARES at the back of John’s head, refusing to be 
           intimidated. John PULLS BACK ON the controls and THEY TAKE 
           OFF... FAST.... JUTTING INTO THE SKY... Sally GLANCES DOWN as 
           JOHNSON SPACE CENTER as it RAPIDLY gets smaller and smaller. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you apply?

                                 SALLY
                        Why did you?

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        I didn’t have to. They wanted me. 
                        ...NASA is something that you have 
                        to earn. I earned my place right 
                        here in this cockpit...

           Sally ROLLS her eyes. John ABRUPTLY TAKES the T-38 HIGHER... 
           Sally is taken off guard. He MAKES A HARD LEFT and GOES INTO 
           A BARREL ROLL. Sally CLOSES HER EYES. TRYING NOT TO GET SICK. 
           It FEELS LIKE FOREVER. John YELLS in EXHILARATION. 
           HE STRAIGHTENS OUT...

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        That RIG doesn’t feel much 
                        different than this...

                                 SALLY
                        Except that I’d be in control...

           John laughs. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        ...You’re never in control. First 
                        thing I learned in space... The 
                        elements on and around our world... 
                        Gravity... The sun... The 
                        atmosphere... It all wants to keep 
                        you in your place... but once 
                        you’re beyond it... you see 
                        everything through different 
                        eyes...

           JOHN PULLS UP and the T-38 LIFTS HIGHER... He JERKS it BACK 
           and does a 360 LOOP. Sally’s HEAD FLIES FORWARD. SHE BLINKS, 
           BREATHING HEAVILY. Laughing -

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        You always breath that loud?

           Sally DOESN’T ANSWER. JOHN MAKES A HARD RIGHT and GOES INTO A 
           SERIES OFF ROLLS. Sally BRACES herself trying to straddle her 
           arms on each side to the roof. John STRAIGHTENS OUT. 

           Catching her breath -

                                 SALLY
                        ...You’re scared. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        What?

                                 SALLY
                        You’re scared that someone like me 
                        could take your place...

           John SHAKES his head. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        I’ve seen a lot scarier things than 
                        you, honey... Including the RIG. 

                                 SALLY
                        Why would the RIG be scary if you 
                        know how to fly?
                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        The RIG brings all of your demons 
                        out onto the surface. You have to 
                        trust yourself enough in it - to 
                        make the right move...

           Sally GLANCES OUT of the window as Johnson Space center comes 
           into view...

           EXT. TARMAC - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           WE WATCH the T-38 LAND and come to a HALT. John SLIDES the 
           hatch OPEN and HOPS OUT, leaving Sally behind. Sally YANKS 
           her helmet off and pulls the oxygen down. Two crew members 
           HELP her OUT. APPLAUDING ENSUES. She GLANCES UP... all of the 
           AsCans are cheering her on for making it out alive. Steve 
           RUSHES OVER -

                                 STEVE
                        How was he?

           Watching John walk away, intrigued -

                                 SALLY
                        He’s an astronaut...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           TIGHT ON a CONTROL PANEL AS A SERIES OF BUTTONS ARE PRESSED. 
           WIDE: Sally is at the helm. The RIG is SLOWLY ROTATING in a 
           LOOP... She TYPES in a series of commands and the RIG LOWERS. 
           She takes a DEEP BREATH, EXHALES. She looks down, FEEDS the 
           panel a command and puts a timer on it... 20 SECONDS... A 
           BEEP for each SECOND.

           Sally crosses the room and takes a SEAT in the RIG. She puts 
           the helmet ON. BUCKLES UP and actually looks SCARED. The 
           BEEPS STOP. Sally’s EYES WIDEN. She swallows and PRESSES the 
           The OUTER AXIS ON. ...THE MACHINE BEGINS... Sally PRESSES the 
           nitrogen jet controller and the OTHER THREE AXIS (that she 
           controls) begin to SPIN... it STARTS SLOW... the momentum 
           BUILDS... THE SPINNING BECOMES FASTER. Her BODY BEING JOLTED 
           AROUND VIOLENTLY as SHE MOVES the hand controls around... 
           trying to find a RHYTHM... THE MOTIONS get FASTER... SHE’S 
           NOT IN CONTROL... HER HEAD HITS the CAGE. BOTH of her hands 
           uncontrollably leave the controls... She tries to TURN the 
           2nd AXIS in the opposite direction to slow it down... in a 
           PANIC, almost hyperventilating... The RIG BEEPS and BEGINS to 
           SLOW DOWN and comes to an abrupt STOP. 
           Sally YANKS her helmet off... and THROWS it... UPSET. She 
           touches her head... She’s BLEEDING.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - SALLY’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

           TIGHT ON a HUGE GOOSE EGG forming on Sally’s scalp... She 
           GROANS...

           WIDE: Steve is hovering over Sally as she bends her head over 
           the sink. She hands him a tube of Neosporin as he examines 
           her. He applies it to her lump. 

                                 STEVE
                        I think you’ll live...

           Standing up straight -

                                 SALLY
                        I’m sorry I called so late... I 
                        just didn’t know who else I could-

           Flattered -

                                 STEVE
                        I’m glad you did. ...Was that from 
                        the T-38?

           Sally shakes her head with a smile.

                                 SALLY
                        ...I rode the Gimbal Rig.

           Steve is stunned.

                                 STEVE
                        Tonight? ...But rookies can’t-

                                 SALLY
                        Rookies don’t know how...

           Steve smiles in disbelief, looking at Sally as if she’d just 
           stolen a million dollars. His mind is spinning -

                                 STEVE
                        Whoa... wait, wait... Did you 
                        succeed? 

           Sally shakes her head, disappointed. Steve takes her by the 
           shoulders, looks deeply into her eyes, thunderstruck -
                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re the most interesting woman 
                        I’ve ever met...

           Sally stares back at Steve. BEAT. He understands her. 
           Respects her. She leans in and pecks him on the mouth. Then 
           pulls away, embarrassed. 

                                 SALLY
                        I should probably get some sleep... 

           Steve is at a loss for words. He nods.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. FIELD - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY

           ALL OF NASA. THE MILITARY ELITE. POLITICIANS. AND THE MEDIA. 
           ARE IN FULL FORM for the catered event. A WELCOME BAND is 
           PLAYING various songs on the manicured lawn. 

           THE TWINS: COLUMBIA ORBITER (finished) and THE CHALLENGER 
           (unfinished) ARE PULLING UP to JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. Everyone 
           in attendance BEGINS to APPLAUD, impressed by the sheer might 
           and brilliance of the shuttles. 

           THE SHUTTLES come to a HALT in between the AsCans who are 
           lined up on one side (Sally and Steve next to each other) and 
           the veterans on the opposite side. Sally LOOKS across the 
           field at John as the rest of the rookies take in the 
           shuttles... John is looking up at the Columbia, knowing it’s 
           the end of the road. The COLUMBIA will carry the last of the 
           old guard into space. Sally looks up the CHALLENGER, the 
           orbiter that will usher in NASA’S future...

           John puts his sunglasses back on and walks off of the field. 
           Sally notices. Sally heads off behind him, Steve grabs her 
           arm -

                                 STEVE
                        Don’t you want to stay for this?

                                 SALLY
                        I’ll be right back...

           EXT. BEHIND BUILDING D - MOMENTS LATER

           A ROW of GOLF CARTS are parked behind the building. John gets 
           in one and drives off... Sally EMERGES from around the corner 
           of the building. She waits for John to get almost out of 
           sight before hopping in a cart to follow him.
           EXT. CATTLE RANGE - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           John parks and EXITS the cart. He walks over the wooden 
           cattle fence and climbs up, sitting on top, looking at the 50 
           cows and one bull. He lights a cigarette. Sally PULLS UP, 
           surprised to see John looking at COWS. He turns, see her, 
           doesn’t react, turns back around. Sally walks over and climbs 
           up the fence and takes a seat beside him.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        ...This is the last piece of this 
                        place that hasn’t changed.

           Sally takes her sunglasses off, peers out at the cattle. 

                                 SALLY
                        I didn’t know it existed. 

           John smirks. He butts out his cigarette. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        It’s the last trust exercise an 
                        astronaut takes before space...

           He HOPS down into the pin. Sally glances over at the BULL in 
           the corner as John walks toward it... She sits up, unsure if 
           she should stop him. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        Why did you follow me?

           Hanging on to the fence -

                                 SALLY
                        There’s something in you that I see 
                        in myself...

           John listens. No snarky remarks this time.

                                 SALLY (CONT’D)
                        I feel like you’re constantly 
                        searching for something... 

           John bends down, grabs a handful of dirt, he peers up at 
           Sally. It’s the truth. There’s a respect for one another. 
           They challenge each other.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        I hope you find it...

           Sally absorbs his words. John stands, and heads toward the 
           BULL with his arms OPEN, TRUSTING that he won’t HURT HIM. The 
           BULL GRINDS his hoof into ground, kicking up dirt... John 
           KEEPS walking toward him... The BULL MOVES CLOSER... 
           John closes his eyes... The BULL SMELLS HIM OVER... THEN, 
           WALKS AWAY. Sally EXHALES. John SMIRKS, heads back and SCALES 
           the fence. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        I have to get to the fireworks...

           Sally watches him get into the golf cart, he salutes her 
           sarcastically, lights another cigarette and PEELS OFF.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. BACKYARD - SALLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sally and Steve are PEERING UP at the STARS. They’re on a 
           blanket surrounded by take out cartons. Steve takes her hand, 
           opens her palm and runs his finger along the lines -

                                 SALLY
                        You going to read it?

                                 STEVE
                        I can’t imagine you ever wanting to 
                        play tennis...

                                 SALLY
                        It was in a different lifetime...

           Steve rolls over, staring at her, trying to figure her out.

                                 STEVE
                        Who are you?

           Does she even know?

                                 SALLY
                        I- 
                            (beat)
                        I’ve loved before...

                                 STEVE
                        We all have.

                                 SALLY
                        I ...I’ve loved women before.

           Steve sits up. Sally EXHALES in what feels like the first 
           time in her life. She’s said it out loud. 

                                 STEVE
                        You’re gay?
                                 SALLY
                        Am I? 

                                 STEVE
                        Is this a trick question?

           Tears of the truth begin to form in her eyes. She’s finally 
           allowing herself to be vulnerable and open. 

                                 SALLY
                        I don’t know. ...I don’t. ...I’ve 
                        never defined who I was by who I 
                        loved. Here... I felt like I had to 
                        hide... but I only learned that 
                        I’ve been hiding from myself I 
                        think my whole life...

           Steve’s eyes are watery. He wipes her face and grabs her 
           hand, PULLS her in, EMBRACING her. Sally closes her eyes. 
           HUGS him TIGHTER.

                                 STEVE
                        Just be you. 

                                 SALLY
                        And who’s that?

                                 STEVE
                        Sally Ride.

           On the stage, holding a mic -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Let’s start in the back...

                                 TIME MAGAZINE
                        John, is this your last flight?

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        I’m- I’m not sure. When I found out 
                        that these shuttles could launch 
                        like a rocket and land like a 
                        plane, I suddenly felt younger... 
           The MEDIA LAUGHS.

                                 NEW YORK TIMES
                        This question is for all of you, do 
                        you feel like NASA is changing for 
                        the better?

           All of the astronauts glance at each other. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Everything changes. Like anything, 
                        like this mission, the fact that 
                        we’re going up in a shuttle that 
                        can be re-used is unheard of and 
                        yet... Here we are...

                           (to John)
                        So then you have hope for the 
                        future of NASA...

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        ...Yes.

                                 L.A. TIMES
                        Do you feel that any of the women 
                        in the new class have any real 
                        chance at making it into space? 

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        I can’t speak for the women. And I 
                        know they wouldn’t want me to...

                                 L.A. TIMES
                        Is that a no, then?

           John doesn’t react. He stands up and puts his sunglasses back 
           on. Leaning over, talking into the mic -

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Thank you all for coming out...

           INT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ON SALLY SITTING IN THE RIG... IT’S BEEPING (counting) DOWN. 
           Her breaths become short as the BEEPS STOP and the RIG BEGINS 
           to SPIN... the ROTATIONS BUILD... THE PITCH TILTS BACK, and 
           the 3rd AXIS SPINS QUICKER... She HAS MORE CONTROL this 
           TIME... SHE’S RELAXING INTO the CHAOS of SPEED... USING her 
           body instead of her mind to REACT. 

           INT. GEORGE ABBEY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           ANGLE ON COLUMBIA’S MISSION/FLIGHT PAPER WORK... WE PULL BACK 
           ON George MULLING over every detail. He RUBS his eyes and 
           looks at the clock above his door. He gathers all of the 
           documents and puts them away.

           INT. STATISTICAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           An engineer ENTERS... he forgot his wallet, he GRABS it then 
           STOPS, LOOKS UP THROUGH the GLASS at SALLY RIDING on the RIG. 
           He PANICS and PICKS UP the PHONE.

           INT. GEORGE ABBEY’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           GEORGE grabs his briefcase and hat, he heads to the door... 
           turns off the light about to leave... WHEN... the PHONE 
           RINGS... He SIGHS. Considers not getting before FLICKING the 
           light back ON and answering -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        ...Yes? 

           George’s face washes over with concern. 

           EXT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           George STORMS toward the GIMBAL RIG ROOM door with two 
           security guards... He GLANCES IN... HE REALIZES it’s SALLY. 
           She’s MASTERED the RIG.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                           (flustered)
                        Open the door...

           INT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           George ENTERS and RUSHES to the controls, he STOPS the 
           MACHINE... the SPINNING SLOWS... 
           Sally SEES George STARING at her, impatiently. Sally 
           UNBUCKLES herself and removes her helmet.

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                           (pissed)
                        Are you crazy?

                                 SALLY
                        I-

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Don’t answer that. ...This room is 
                        for astronauts only... If one thing 
                        had gone wrong-

                                 SALLY
                        I know, I would’ve been hurt...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Or worse. We don’t take risks like 
                        that. 

           Sally swallows. 

                                 SALLY
                        ...I’m sorry.

           In disbelief -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        I have always been an advocate of 
                        yours, Sally. You know that... but 
                        after this... I need-
                        I need to consider your future here 
                        at NASA.

                                 SALLY
                        My future? I just mastered a 
                        machine it take years to learn...

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        You can’t make the rules up as you 
                        go... We need dependable 
                        astronauts. Not labilities. 

           There’s nothing she can say. She nods. 

                                 GEORGE ABBEY (CONT’D)
                        Go home...

                                 SALLY
                        Until when?

           Hurts to say -
                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Until you can make other 
                        arrangements.

           EXT. GIMBAL RIG ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           THROUGH THE GLASS WE WATCH GEORGE’S WORDS HIT SALLY LIKE A 
           TON OF BRICKS. She EXITS... AND WE FOLLOW her to the 
           hallway... She STOPS. TO PROCESS. STUNNED. George EXITS. 
           NOTICES Sally standing in the hall. He looks remorseful but 
           forces himself to continue walking.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           INT. PRE LAUNCH MEETING - BOARD ROOM - NASA - LATE MORNING

           ON JOHN and the COLUMBIA CREW. They’re being prepped for the 
           mission. WIDE: George looks as though he hasn’t slept all 
           night. Chris Kraft looks over, concerned. John is reclined 
           back in his chair, it’s not his first rodeo.   

                                 CAROLYN HUNTOON
                        John, have you thought about who 
                        you’d like to have at CapCom?

           John leans forward, he fiddles with a small toy model of the 
           shuttle, thinking. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Sally. 

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        Sally Ride?

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        She’s sharp. ...She’d be a welcome 
                        voice to hear in the capsule. 

           George sits up, glances at Chris, then clears his throat -

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        Sally’s not available.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Sure she is.

                                 CHRIS KRAFT
                        She’s not coming back to NASA.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        She’s what?
                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        We had to relieve her...

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Un-relieve her.

           George and Chris look concerned. Carolyn looks happy.

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        We caught her on the RIG.

           Compelled, John sits forward staring George down...

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Did she pass it?

                                 GEORGE ABBEY
                        ...She- She had mastered it, yes.

                                 JOHN YOUNG
                        Good god. A rookie passes the 
                        hardest machine at NASA and you let 
                        her go? What’s wrong you guys?

           George, Chris and the other men look dejected. 

                                 JOHN YOUNG (CONT’D)
                        Bring Sally back. Or you can find 
                        another Commander...

           DAVID BOWIE’S, “LIFE ON MARS” CONTINUES TO PLAY OVER:

           A puffy eyed Sally is PACKING UP. Steve is helping. She 
           GLANCES up through the window... TWO BLACK LINCOLN TOWNE CARS 
           PULL UP. She glances at Steve and THEN, STANDS UP... HEADS to 
           the door OPENING IT... George is reluctantly standing before 
           her. John gets out of the car, removing his glasses, he looks 
           at Sally reassuringly.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL CENTER - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - EARLY

           Sally WATCHES on the MONITORS as the COLUMBIA TAKES OFF. Her 
           hands are empathetically shaking... She folds her arms, 
           watching. IT GOES UP without a HITCH... EVERYONE CLAPS. Sally 
           closes her eyes relieved.

           SUPER: MAY 24th, 1983

           ANGLE ON AN ARM... IN BED... IT REACHES OVER... to the other 
           side... IT FEELS AROUND... IT’S EMPTY.

           WIDE: Steve sits up in bed. He’s wearing a wedding ring. He 
           glances over at the EMPTY spot... SMILES.

           EXT. CATTLE RANGE - JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Sally is sitting on the FENCE, her legs dangling over as she 
           looks at the cattle as the SUN BEGINS TO RISE. There’s a 
           maturity she carries with her now. A knowingness. She brushes 
           the hair from her eyes (she’s wearing a wedding ring) and 
           HOPS DOWN into the pin. She RUNS her hand along the cows as 
           she moves in toward the BULL... She SMILES as the BULL BEGINS 
           to kick up mud... She reaches out her hand, palm up, trusting 
           the BULL COMPLETELY... it WALKS OVER to her... She OPENS her 
           arms wide as he smells her. 

           A cart PULLS UP... Steve hops out. Sally turns, smiles... 
                                 STEVE
                        Ten bucks says he likes you...

           Sally raises her eyebrows, CLIMBS OVER the FENCE and HOPS 
           DOWN.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        You ready for today?

                                 SALLY
                        I think I can handle it.

           LIGHTBULBS FLASH as SALLY, ROBERT CRIPPEN, FREDRICK HAUCK,

           ALL EYES ARE ON THE SOON TO BE FIRST AMERICAN WOMAN TO GO TO

           Sally isn’t AFRAID to address the press this time. 

                                 TIME MAGAZINE
                        Sally, how do you react to 
                        stressful situations? Do you cry?

                        Why don’t you ask Fredrick or 
                        Norman those questions? 

           MEDIA LAUGHS.

                        Sally...
           Not backing down -

                                 SALLY
                           (to Time magazine)
                        I want to know... are you going to 
                        ask that same question to the men?

                                 TIME MAGAZINE
                        I just wanted to get the female 
                        perspective...

                                 SALLY
                        Think of it this way... We work the 
                        same, only women can use both sides 
                        of their brain simultaneously so we 
                        have a faster reaction time and can 
                        handle problems quicker...

           This SHUTS HIM UP.

                                 L.A. TIMES
                        Are you planning on wearing a bra 
                        in space?

           LAUGHS ENSUE. Sally doesn’t laugh. 

                                 SALLY
                        Since we’ll be in zero gravity I 
                        don’t really see the point... do 
                        you?

           THE MEDIA EATS THIS UP. George (in the corner) smirks. 

           DALE & CAROL’S HOUSE:

           Sally’s parents look PROUD. DALE RIDE: “That’s my little 
           girl!” CAROL RIDE: “Shhhh!”

           PANEL:

                                 NEW YORK TIMES
                        Are you excited to be the first 
                        American women in space?

                                 SALLY
                        I’m so excited to get the chance 
                        that I’m going to ignore the 
                        ignorant comments made by all of 
                        you this afternoon...

           CHATTER AMONG THE PRESS. Sally relaxes into her chair.
                                 WASHINGTON POST
                        If there’s any advice you can give 
                        to girls watching this all over the 
                        world... what would it be... 

           Sally LEANS FORWARD. 

                                 SALLY
                        I didn’t come to NASA to make 
                        history... or become a role 
                        model... but, that’s what I ended 
                        up becoming... And let me be the 
                        living proof that, women have the 
                        potential to go just as far or 
                        further than any man has ever 
                        gone... If you can trust in 
                        yourself and know, really know who 
                        you are... That’s a power that no 
                        stereotype or statistic can take 
                        away from you... You can do 
                        anything you want. You just have to 
                        believe that you can. 

           The NEW YORK TIMES begins to CLAP. The CLAPPING is MIRRORED 
           by ALL of the MEDIA in the room.

           THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS... 10, 9... 8, 7, 6... 5, 4... 3, 2, 

           THE CHALLENGER BEGINS TO SHAKE, VIOLENTLY. It JOSTLES Sally 
           and her crew members, from side to side. Sally holds onto her 
           straps/belt TIGHTLY. 

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD/CHALLENGER ORBITER - MOMENTS LATER

           THE THREE LAUNCH ENGINES QUICKLY BLAST THE SHUTTLE UP INTO

           INT. CHALLENGER - MOMENTS LATER

           Crew member, Fredrick nudges Sally... he motions toward the 
           window... She GLANCES UP, as the SUN DISAPPEARS BENEATH 
           THEM... THE SHUTTLE BURSTS THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE... IT FEELS 
           LIKE SLOW MOTION... AS THE DAY TURNS INTO SPACE/DARKNESS...

           Sally SLOWLY UNBUCKLES, she FLOATS UP... a look of AWE washes 
           over her face. She FLOATS OVER to the window and LOOKS AT 
           EARTH... THE REFLECTION of our PLANET on her helmet’s 
           VISOR... She touches the window, placing her finger tip on 
           the EARTH, wonderstruck.

           WE SEE THE REAL SALLY RIDE FOOTAGE OF HER ON THE CHALLENGER. 

           OVER SCENE:

           IN 1984 Sally made her second flight into space on the 
           CHALLENGER and helped create the robotic arm.

           After the CHALLENGER CRASH in 1986... Sally was instrumental 
           in finding the cause of the accident. 

           Sally retired from NASA in 1987. The year she and Steve 
           divorced.

           Sally never remarried, but found love in Tam O’Shaughnessy. 
           She would spend the rest of her life with her.

           Sally created the non profit group, Change the Equation to 
           improve education in science, technology, engineering, and 
           math (STEM) throughout communities in the United States.  

           Sally passed away July 23rd, 2012 from Pancreatic cancer.  

           In 2013, Tam O’Shaughnessy accepted the Presidential Medal of 
           Freedom from President Obama on Sally’s behalf.
