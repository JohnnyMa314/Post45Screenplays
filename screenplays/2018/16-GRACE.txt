           OVER BLACK:

           Sounds of a WOMAN CRYING.  

           Growing louder...  LOUDER...  

           Then...

           SMASH!!! 

           The sound of a LAMP CRASHING to the floor.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ECU ON A YOUNG GIRL’S EYES...

           ...shooting open with the sound of SHATTERING GLASS.

           INT. GRACE’S BEDROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - NIGHT

           GRACE BYRNES (9) sits up in bed, breathing heavy.  

           She listens carefully, hearing only the sound of WIND cutting 
           through the old house.  An uneasy silence.  

           Something is very wrong.  

           Grace scans her bedroom for clues.  Nothing.

           She wants to stay tucked in bed, but something pulls her out.

           Grace moves to her door, which CREAKS as she opens it.  

           She continues into the...

           HALLWAY

           ... where she finds her MOTHER curled up on the floor, crying 
           - catatonic.

           Through the open door of Grace’s parents’ bedroom we see a 
           broken lamp, toppled furniture.

           Next to Grace’s mother, an open WINDOW swings with the wind, 
           BANGING against its frame.

           SMACK!  SMACK!  SMACK!

           Grace steps forward, approaching the open window.  

           Closer...  Closer...

           Reaching the window, Grace looks out to see...
           A FIGURE standing on the roof on the opposite side of the L-
           shaped house: Grace’s FATHER dressed in a three-piece suit, 
           looking out into the pitch-black void.  

           On closer look, we see a NOOSE wrapped around his neck, 
           firmly affixed to the weather vane at the top of the house.

           Grace looks to her father, too horrified to scream.  

           Her father slowly turns toward her.  Turning...  Turning... 

           Finally, he locks eyes with Grace.  

           He lets out an enigmatic smile.

           Then...

           He JUMPS.

           ON THE ROPE, going deadly taught.

           ON GRACE, processing a visual she can never unsee.  

           She doesn’t cry, she doesn’t scream, but her expression 
           reflects the horror she is witnessing.

           We PUSH TIGHTER and TIGHTER until we’re ECU on Grace’s eyes.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           ECU ON A WOMAN’S EYES...

           More mature, more world weary, but unmistakably still the 
           eyes of GRACE BYRNES.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - KENNEDY LIBRARY - BOSTON, MA - NIGHT

           Black tie event - champagne, passed hors d'oeuvres, COASTAL 
           ELITES enjoying the company of fellow BLUE BLOODS.

           Grace is right in the thick of it.  

           Now 32, Grace has grown into an elegant woman, but the broken 
           girl inside remains.  

           Next to Grace is the man of the hour: her husband JAY CONNORS 
           (37), winner of the Democratic primary for Governor of 
           Massachusetts.  Jay is casual, confident, and he looks 
           fantastic in a tux.  

           In a series of SOUND BITES, we hear Jay hit all the right 
           talking points.  His speech carries almost no trace of the 
           Southie roots he’s worked hard to leave in the rear-view:
                                 JAY
                        Education is equality’s greatest 
                        ally... No one should have to take 
                        on debt to get a shot at the 
                        American dream... Women deserve 
                        fair pay, and fair pay means equal 
                        pay... 

           A group of POTENTIAL DONORS melts in the palm of Jay’s hand.

           Grace makes for a useful plus-one, but she’s largely ignored.

                                 DONOR #1
                        Be honest, just between friends - 
                        is this a stepping stone to get to 
                        Washington?

                                 JAY
                        I can assure you that this state 
                        has my undivided attention.

                                 DONOR #2
                        Come on... no Massachusetts 
                        politician can say with a straight 
                        face that he’s not looking toward 
                        the national stage.

                                 JAY
                        My work is here.  Our home is here.  
                        Plus, I think I’d miss all of you 
                        too much...

           Laughs from the group.

           An ACADEMIC TYPE, somewhat less charmed, tries to cut in:

                                 ACADEMIC TYPE
                        Excuse me...

           ... but another donor beats him to the punch.

                                 DONOR #3
                        Must be a lot of pressure on you 
                        two - the next first couple of 
                        Massachusetts. 

           Grace knows she could take this one, but she lets it pass to 
           Jay.

                                 JAY
                        It’s not always easy, but honestly 
                        the more things ramp up, the closer 
                        we get.

                        We’re both just taking it one day 
                        at a time and--

                                 ACADEMIC TYPE
                        Excuse me... Do you have a position 
                        on the opioid hearings?

                                 JAY
                        Come again?

                                 ACADEMIC TYPE
                        The opioid hearings?  I noticed you 
                        haven’t released a statement.

                                 JAY
                        Right.  As some of you know, our 
                        family was directly affected by 
                        this issue, as have many others in 
                        this state.  But my office is still 
                        reviewing the report.

                        Governor Hunt is still pushing for 
                        criminal charges even though he 
                        lost his whistleblower witness.  
                        Will you commit to doing the same 
                        if elected?

                                 JAY
                        Grace and I were both saddened to 
                        hear of Dr. Lerner’s passing.  
                        Look, it’s up to the Attorney 
                        General to decide if there’s enough 
                        evidence to pursue charges.  
                        Governor Hunt shouldn’t interfere 
                        just to score points in an election 
                        year.  

                                 ACADEMIC TYPE
                        Then what do you propose?

                                 JAY
                        I’m introducing legislation to the 
                        State Senate that’s focused on 
                        treatment and recovery.  We have to 
                        be careful not to attack the people 
                        we need to help solve the problem.  
                        Innovation is important.  My father 
                        died when I was young from a 
                        bacterial blood infection that is 
                        treatable today with a basic drug 
                        regimen.  
                                 ACADEMIC TYPE
                        Mrs. Connors, do you agree?  Your 
                        father was a critic of the 
                        pharmaceutical industry while he 
                        was in office.  

           The focus swings to Grace - an unwelcome spotlight.

                                 GRACE
                        I agree that innovation is 
                        important.

           She could just leave it there.  But she doesn’t...

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        ... But I’ve seen the dark side of 
                        these drugs.  My brother died last 
                        year from an overdose, which is why 
                        I’ve made the opioid crisis the 
                        focus of my family’s foundation.

                                 ACADEMIC TYPE
                        So you support the charges?

                                 GRACE
                        Mark Lerner, the whistleblower you 
                        referred to, gave me a firsthand 
                        look at the way opioid 
                        manufacturers manipulated data, 
                        targeted at-risk areas even as 
                        fatalities were rising...

                                 JAY
                        But we need to look forward - not 
                        just point fingers...  Once we--

                                 GRACE
                        We can look forward and hold people 
                        accountable at the same time.  The 
                        crimes that Mark uncovered need to 
                        be answered for, and the people 
                        responsible should be in jail.

           All eyes swing to Jay - a collective “Well...?”

                        Did you ever consider taking her 
                        last name?

           LAUGHS from the group as the conversation moves on.

           A FOCUS RACK reveals...

           A MAN across the room enjoying the free shrimp cocktail, 
           watching the exchange.  While the rest of the crowd hobnobs, 
           he is all business.  This is PAUL SHERIDAN (60s, ill-fitting 
           suit, a lifelong political operator) - more from him in a 
           minute.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay and Grace peel away, headed toward the next batch of 
           donors.  Grace is fried.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m sorry.  I need to keep my mouth 
                        shut.

                                 JAY
                        Remember, seen and not heard.

           Grace is taken aback.  Jay cracks a smile.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Come on...  That’s the last thing I 
                        want.  We’re a team, right?

           She smiles, but he sees she’s struggling.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You OK?

                                 GRACE
                        This weekend would be Jack’s 
                        birthday.  

           Jay offers a somber nod, then:

                                 JAY
                        Ready for the next batch of 
                        vultures...?

                                 GRACE
                        I need some air.  Come outside with 
                        me?  
                                 JAY
                        You know how it is...

                                 GRACE
                        Just for a minute?

           Jay looks to the expectant donors, conflicted.

                                 JAY
                        Can you tough it out?

           Grace’s look says ‘no’ - she’s spent.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You go and find me when you’re 
                        ready.  Take as long as you need.
                             (then...)
                        It won’t always be like this.

           Grace musters a smile, semi-convincing nod.  Jay kisses her 
           on the cheek.

                                 GRACE
                        Go get ‘em.

           Jay moves on to the next batch of donors, effortlessly glad-
           handing and greeting each donor by name.  

           EXT. TERRACE - MOMENTS LATER

           A good distance from the crowd inside, Grace looks out onto 
           the harbor, her breath visible in the February air.

           She checks that she’s alone, then pulls a CIGARETTE from her 
           purse.  She takes several cracks at lighting it, but the wind 
           and her shot nerves make it a tall order.

           Just when she’s about to get it lit...

           A HAND enters frame and pushes away the lighter.  Grace 
           JUMPS.  

           She WHIPS AROUND to see Paul Sheridan.  She smiles - a 
           familiar face.

                                 GRACE
                        Jesus...

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Sorry to sneak up on you, kiddo.  
                        ‘Best if you’re not seen smoking.  
                        Optics.
                                 GRACE
                        I didn’t know anyone was watching.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Someone’s always watching.

           Paul smiles, hands her a glass of water, senses her strained 
           state.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You holding up OK?

                                 GRACE
                        Just needed a breather.  
                             (covering...)
                        I saw the B.U.R. poll - looks like 
                        we’re off to a good start.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Favorability rating’s through the 
                        roof.  Everybody loves our Jay.  

           They look inside to Jay, who is effortlessly holding court.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        I never thought I’d see anyone work 
                        a room like that again after your 
                        father...
                             (beat)
                        I can’t tell you how proud he would 
                        have been to see you here tonight.  
                        Feels like just yesterday you were 
                        running around on that stage during 
                        his acceptance speech.  I’m the one 
                        who had to chase you down.

           Grace smiles, nods appreciatively.  

           She sees Jay talking to a PRETTY FEMALE SUPPORTER - standing 
           just a little too close, laughing just a little too hard.  

           Grace clocks the woman’s hand touching Jay’s arm.  

           Paul clocks Grace clocking.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t envy you - wife of a 
                        politician... not an easy job.  
                        Jay’s got a gift.  We gotta keep 
                        him sharp.  Keep him focused.  

           Grace considers this.  She takes a gulp from her drink, 
           trying to calm her nerves.
                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You sure you’re OK?

           She nods.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Alright, kiddo.  I’m proud of you.  
                        Let me know if I can get you 
                        anything else.  Almost time for the 
                        big speech...

           Paul heads back inside.  Grace remains on the balcony, 
           looking more strained than ever.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - LATER

           All eyes on stage.  Jay stands at the podium.  A banner above 
           him reads: “CONNORS FOR GOVERNOR: A VISION FOR THE FUTURE.”

                                 JAY
                        I couldn’t be more honored to be 
                        here tonight.  Believe it or not, 
                        my first job out of college was 
                        working here as a bartender, 
                        serving many of you.  Over-serving 
                        the rest of you.

           Good-natured LAUGHS from the crowd.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I want to thank Councilman Blake 
                        for his endorsement.
                             (to a man near the stage)
                        You put up a hell of a fight in the 
                        primary, and I’m sure glad to have 
                        your support going into the 
                        general.

           COUNCILMAN STEVE BLAKE nods to Jay, waves to the crowd.

           EXT. TERRACE - SAME

           Grace tries to make her way inside to catch Jay’s speech.  

           She looks queasy, struggling to stay upright.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Grace comes in from the terrace looking lost and dazed.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Tonight is a celebration, but we’re 
                        only at the beginning.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I challenge each and every one of 
                        you to join me in building a 
                        stronger future for Massachusetts.

           Pushing past members of the crowd, Grace knocks a GLASS out 
           of a woman’s hand.

           The jarring sound of the GLASS SHATTERING on the floor calls 
           back to the broken lamp from the opening.

           FLASH IMAGE: Grace’s father on the roof, noose around his 
           neck, looking right at us.  That haunting, baffling smile.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                             (spotting Grace)
                        There she is... I know she hates 
                        the attention, but I have to ask 
                        for a round of applause for the 
                        woman who has guided me, challenged 
                        me, pushed me through the primary 
                        campaign.  Ladies and gentleman, 
                        Mrs. Grace Byrnes Connors.

           APPLAUSE as Grace reaches the center of the room.  

           Grace starts to speak, fading fast.  The crowd quiets.

                                 GRACE
                        He looked at me before he jumped.

           With that, Grace goes CRASHING down, taking out a serving 
           table with her.

           GASPS from the crowd.  Grace lands with a THUMP.

           LIGHTS OUT.

           OVER BLACK:

           BEEP.  BEEP.  BEEP.  Medical equipment steadily monitoring.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           FLASH.  FLASH.  FLASH.  

           We’re looking up from a moving HOSPITAL BED, watching 
           FLORESCENT CEILING LIGHTS whip past. 

           Grace lies in the bed, half-asleep, being pushed backward 
           through a crowded hallway.  She groggily scans the area.

           GRACE’S POV: she spots Jay talking to Paul on the other end 
           of the hallway before she’s carted into a hospital room, 
           losing sight of them.
           Exhausted, Grace falls back under.

           INT. PSYCHAITRIC HOSPITAL - DAY [FLASHBACK]

           A buried memory pulled from Grace’s past: 

           Grace’s mother curled up on the tile floor of a psych ward.  
           She rocks back and forth, heavily medicated.  

           Over this disturbing visual, we begin to hear ODDLY 
           INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC.

                                 JAY (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
                        This country is built on the 
                        promise of opportunity.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Grace once again comes to, looking healthier and more rested.

           She’s greeted by a surreal sight: Jay looking directly into 
           camera on the TV in the corner.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                             (on TV)
                        Every child deserves the same 
                        opportunity I had: the chance to 
                        live the American dream.

           Jay stands inside the hospital room with his back to Grace, 
           closely watching his campaign ad run on the TV. 

           The ad shows a montage of campaign footage: Jay reading to 
           school kids, shaking hands with factory workers, giving a 
           speech to a crowd.  

           It’s carefully curated bullshit, but it’s largely effective.  
           Jay’s a star.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                             (on TV)
                        I’m asking you to give me the 
                        opportunity to serve the state that 
                        has given me so much.  

           The ad ends with a shot of Jay on a sailboat.  Title over 
           picture: “CONNORS FOR GOVERNOR: A VISION FOR THE FUTURE.”

           As the ad comes to a close, Grace sits up in bed.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                             (notices she’s awake)
                        Hey... there she is.  Welcome back, 
                        hon.
           Jay walks over, sits on Grace’s hospital bed.  

                                 GRACE
                        Did I...?  Oh god.

                                 JAY
                        How are you feeling?

                                 GRACE
                        In front of everyone... I must have 
                        ruined the entire night - your big 
                        night.

                                 JAY
                        You didn’t ruin anything.  All that 
                        matters is your health.  

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t know why this keeps 
                        happening.

                                 JAY
                        The doctors said there is nothing 
                        physically wrong with you... which 
                        is good.  

           Jay puts a comforting hand over Grace’s, smiles to her.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What’d you think of the new ad?  
                        ‘Sailboat too much?

                                 GRACE
                        No, it’s good.  Very JFK.

           Jay can’t help but smile at the comparison.

           The TV transitions to local news.  Headline: “TROUBLE IN 
           CAMELOT?”

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        Grace Byrnes Connors collapsed last 
                        night at a fundraising event where 
                        her husband Jay Connors was 
                        celebrating his primary victory.  
                        The Byrnes family, of course, has a 
                        well-documented history of health 
                        problems.  Earlier this month, Mrs. 
                        Connors had to leave a primary 
                        debate due to exhaustion.  Governor 
                        Hunt, who was at the State House 
                        this morning to attend the ongoing 
                        opioid hearings, expressed his 
                        concern.
           TV: A stuffy politician (GOVERNOR HUNT) answers questions as 
           he enters the state house.

                                 GOVERNOR HUNT
                        We all wish Grace the best.  At the 
                        same time, Governor is an important 
                        job, and the people of 
                        Massachusetts deserve undivided 
                        attention.  I hope she gets 
                        whatever help she--

           Jay switches off the TV.  

                                 JAY
                             (re: Hunt)
                        Prick...

           Grace’s expression says it all.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Hey... it’s ok.
                             (then...)
                        Dr. Harmon wants to see you.

                                 GRACE
                        Dr. Harmon?

                                 JAY
                        The psychiatrist on staff.

           Grace doesn’t like the sound of that.

           INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           Grace sits on a wax-paper covered examination table under 
           harsh florescent lighting.  

           DR. HARMON (70s, stuffy tweed jacket) stands over her with a 
           clipboard.  

                                 DR. HARMON
                        Grace, have you ever tried to hurt 
                        yourself?

                                 GRACE
                        No.

                                 DR. HARMON
                             (re: medical file)
                        It says here you were hospitalized 
                        after an overdose of prescription 
                        pills.

           Grace glares at Harmon, not happy to be fact-checked.
                                 GRACE
                        I went through a difficult stretch 
                        after my mother died.  I had dreams 
                        where I would see her--

                                 DR. HARMON
                        Dreams or hallucinations.

                                 GRACE
                        Vivid dreams.  I wanted them to 
                        stop.  It was a mistake.

           Harmon nods, takes a note.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Can I go home now?

                                 DR. HARMON
                        Have you been in contact with the 
                        police recently?

                                 GRACE
                        I’m guessing you know the answer to 
                        that question.

                                 DR. HARMON
                        Your husband mentioned you filed a 
                        report claiming you were being 
                        followed by an unidentified man.

                                 GRACE
                        That’s right.

                                 DR. HARMON
                        Were the police able to confirm

           Nothing from Grace.

                                 DR. HARMON (CONT’D)
                        Did your husband or anyone else 
                        ever see this man who was following 
                        you?

           Harmon’s implication does not sit well with Grace.

                                 DR. HARMON (CONT’D)
                        Have you considered seeing a 
                        psychiatrist to discuss these 
                        events?

                                 GRACE
                        No.
                                 DR. HARMON
                        And why not?

                                 GRACE
                        Because I don’t like psychiatrists.

           Dr. Harmon absorbs this barb, jots down a note.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Grace sits alone looking out into the cold.  We see Jay 
           through the door window, speaking with someone (we can’t see 
           whom).

           Grace looks over, watches as Jay listens.  Not looking good.

           After a beat, Jay enters the room, sits next to Grace.

                                 GRACE
                        What did he say?

                                 JAY
                        He said... there are some things we 
                        should keep an eye on.  We’ll get a 
                        second opinion.  
                             (off her look)
                        But not right away.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m not crazy.

                                 JAY
                        I know.
                             (beat)
                        There’s something I wanted to ask 
                        you about last night...

           Grace tenses before the question is even asked.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You said something: “He looked at 
                        me before he jumped.”  Do you know 
                        what that meant?

           Grace shakes her head ‘no,’ burying a secret she’s kept for 
           too long.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You know you can tell me anything, 
                        right?  We’re a team.

           Grace considers, possibly about to open up, when...
           The door swings open.  Paul Sheridan steps in carrying two 
           coffees, hands one to Jay.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Good to have you back, kiddo.  How 
                        are you feeling?

           Grace nods: better.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You gave us quite a scare.  

                                 GRACE
                        What’s the latest?

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Focus on your rest for now.

           Grace shoots him a look - she wants to know what’s up.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Our line is that all this is 
                        related to a bad cold - I’ve pulled 
                        some strings to convince the major 
                        outlets to run with that.  There is 
                        a story in the Arlington Advocate - 
                        whatever the hell that is - 
                        connecting last night’s fall with 
                        Grace’s previous... episodes.  
                        It’ll blow over.
                             (beat)
                        I do think we need to get a handle 
                        on this thing before the general 
                        election gets into full swing.  The 
                        spotlight is only going to get 
                        brighter and--

                                 JAY
                        Paul... 

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        This is the third time she’s 
                        collapsed, except this time it was 
                        in a room full of people.  We can’t 
                        just ignore--  

                                 JAY
                        Not now, Paul.

                                 GRACE
                             (re: Paul)
                        He’s right.  There’s too much at 
                        stake.
           Jay knows it’s true - an unfortunate reality.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Look, you’re gonna hate me for 
                        bringing it up again, but I think 
                        it’s time to consider the Gardner 
                        institute.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m not going to a psych ward.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        It’s a recovery center... and it’d 
                        only be temporary.

                                 GRACE
                        I’ll work something else out.  

           Grace looks to Jay, who stays out of it.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Just until we figure out what’s 
                        going on.  Trust me, I understand 
                        your concern, but you’re not going 
                        to get better unless--

                                 GRACE
                        I said no, Paul.  

           Grace shoots him a stern look - end of discussion.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Right.  Just a thought.  

                                 JAY
                        Paul, can you give us a minute?

           Paul holds a long look on Jay, then starts to leave.  He 
           turns back...

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        We all just want what’s best for 
                        you, Grace.

           ... then exits, leaving Jay and Grace alone together.

                                 JAY
                        You know, there are people who can 
                        help you, but you’ve got to keep an 
                        open mind.  

           Grace holds firm.  A somber silence.  Then, an idea:
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Hey - what do you say we get away 
                        for a week, just you and me?  Leave 
                        the campaign behind.

                                 GRACE
                             (surprised by the 
                              suggestion)
                        You could do that?

                                 JAY
                        I have some time now that the 
                        primary is wrapped up.  Besides, 
                        all that matters is that we get you 
                        better.

                                 GRACE
                        But the foundation - I have 
                        meetings scheduled.

                                 JAY
                        They can be rescheduled.  Ally can 
                        take care of the foundation.  It’s 
                        just a week.  

                                 GRACE
                             (considers, then...)
                        You sure you can do this?

           Jay smiles, nods.  Grace is sold.

           INT. SUV / EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Jay and Grace sit in the back of the chauffeured SUV.  Grace 
           looks out the window, watching winter trees whip by.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        I know a place off the coast where 
                        we won’t be bothered.

           EXT. MAINLAND DOCK - DAY

           Grace and Jay climb onto a small FISHING BOAT.  A grizzled 
           FISHERMAN and his STERNMAN load on their bags.

                                 JAY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ll make all of the arrangements.  
                        We can leave tomorrow.

           EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAY

           CLOSE ON GRACE, rough winter water passing behind her.
           We PULL BACK to reveal Jay sitting next to her on the back of 
           the boat, his arm wrapped around Grace to warm her.

           Something occurs to Grace.  She looks back in the direction 
           of the mainland, orienting herself.

                                 GRACE
                        Isn’t Nantucket South?

           She looks to Jay, who can only partially contain his smile.

                                 JAY
                        I had a better idea.

           Grace looks out ahead and spots something emerging through 
           the fog:

           CRANE ISLAND, isolated, a quarter mile long.  Elegant summer 
           homes look out over the water, vacant for the winter season.

           Grace immediately reacts to the sight.  Her body tenses.

           She knows this place.

                                 GRACE
                        Is that...?

           She spins back to Jay, who is beaming, proud of his surprise.

                                 JAY
                        When was the last time you were out 
                        here?

                                 GRACE
                        It’s been years.  Jack’s the only 
                        one who came out here.  I always 
                        wanted to sell it but he would 
                        never let me.  

           Grace looks out to the approaching island.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Jay, this--

                                 JAY
                        It’s perfect - no press, no one to 
                        bother us.  Nobody goes to their 
                        summer house in February.   I 
                        wanted you to be somewhere familiar 
                        - somewhere you’d feel at home.

           Grace does not share his enthusiasm.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m leaving everything behind, all 
                        week.  No internet, no cell service 
                        - I even told the staff we’re 
                        headed to the Bahamas so there’s no 
                        way we’ll be bothered.

                                 GRACE
                        Is that safe?

           Jay pulls out a beefy SATELLITE PHONE with a thick antenna.  

                                 JAY
                        Just in case.  
                             (re: fishermen)
                        Plus, these guys come out at dawn 
                        most mornings to collect their 
                        traps.  

           They creep closer to the island, which looks increasingly 
           menacing in the thick fog.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        This is exactly what you need.

           EXT. DOCK - CRANE ISLAND - DAY

           Grace stands on the dock as Jay unloads the bags, tips the 
           fishermen.  As the fishermen prepare to depart:

                                 JAY
                        See you guys in a week.

           Grace watches as the fishing boat takes off into the open 
           ocean, leaving her and Jay cut off from the world.

           EXT. ROAD - CRANE ISLAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay and Grace walk down the middle of the dirt road with 
           their bags.  Grace takes in the surroundings: 

           Barren trees, cold winds, empty homes.  It has the skeleton 
           of a vibrant summer island, but right now it’s a ghost town.

                                 GRACE
                        There’s no one else on the island?

                                 JAY
                        The estate manager said there’s a 
                        guy who looks after the properties, 
                        but I guess that’s it.  We’ve got 
                        the place to ourselves.
           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           They reach the Byrnes’ summer home, take it in from the road:

           An imposing structure in Gothic New England style.  The house 
           announces a legacy of both power and tragedy.  The weather 
           vane on the roof matches the one we saw in the opening.  

           This is the home where Grace’s father killed himself.

                                 JAY
                             (admiring)
                        I can’t believe you’ve never 
                        brought me here.

           Jay starts toward the house, but Grace calls him back.

                                 GRACE
                        I think it would be better if we 
                        went back to the city.

                                 JAY
                        What?

                                 GRACE
                        I think I’ll recover better if I’m 
                        around people.  If I’m working.

                                 JAY
                        Diving back into work isn’t going 
                        to help.  You need rest.  

                                 GRACE
                        I know I can get better if I--

           Jay places a hand on her arm.

                                 JAY
                        This week is our only chance to get 
                        you back from whatever it is you’re 
                        going through.  If you don’t get 
                        better now...  
                             (beat)
                        It’s just really important that we 
                        hit this thing head on.  

                                 GRACE
                        But does it have to be here?

                                 JAY
                        What’s wrong with this place?

           Grace can’t (or won’t) answer that.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        We’re already out here.  Just give 
                        it a shot.  Wait till you see what 
                        I have planned for dinner.  
                             (then)
                        We need this.  

           Grace gives in.  She nods, then follows Jay toward the house.

           INT. ENTRYWAY - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           We TRACK through the entryway, slowly revealing the house’s 
           contours:

           Exquisitely decorated, but hasn’t received attention in 
           years.  Antique furniture covered by blankets to protect from 
           dust.  The blinds are all drawn, leaving the space eerily 
           dark.

           Jay and Grace make their way inside.  

                                 JAY
                        Look at this.  It’s perfect.

           Grace hangs back, uncomfortable in this space.

           Jay opens the blinds, pulls off the dust coverings - bringing 
           some life back into the place.  

           Grace follows Jay into the...

           DRAWING ROOM

           Also dark.  Jay again opens the blinds.  The light reveals a 
           large PORTRAIT of GRACE’S FATHER.  Grace eyes the portrait.

           Jay pulls open cabinets, admires the FINE CHINA inside.  

           One cabinet won’t open.  He pulls, but it seems to be jammed.

                                 GRACE
                        Here...

           Grace presses against a foot pedal that releases the cabinet 
           doors - one of the house’s many tricks.

           Inside the cabinet are family photos.  Jay pulls out one 
           photo, blows dust off the frame.

           PHOTO: the picture-perfect family.  A very young Grace (7) 
           and her younger brother (Jack) positioned between their regal 
           parents.  Massachusetts royalty.
                                 JAY
                        Incredible.  How come you keep 
                        these locked up in here?

           Jay directs his focus to a portrait shot: GRACE’S MOTHER in 
           her early 20’s, gorgeous.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        This is your mother?  She was 
                        beautiful.  

                                 GRACE
                        I wish I could remember her like 
                        that.  She was never the same after 
                        my father died.

                                 JAY
                        Makes sense.  Husband dropping dead 
                        of a heart attack at 49.  All the 
                        media attention.  That’s got to 
                        take a toll.  Right?

           Grace doesn’t correct him, simply nods.  Grace has never told 
           Jay how her father really died.

           As Jay moves on, Grace hangs back.  She holds a long look on 
           the portrait of her father before following Jay into the...

           KITCHEN

           For such a pristinely decorated house, the kitchen is oddly 
           bland, presumably because it was intended for servants.  

           Against one wall, Jay finds an opening covered by a 2’x2’ 
           door.  He pulls open the door, revealing an odd platform.

                                 GRACE
                        It’s a dumbwaiter.

           Grace pushes a button and the platform rises.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Dining room’s upstairs.

                                 JAY
                        This place is full of surprises.  
                        We didn’t have dumbwaiters growing 
                        up in Dorchester.  

           Jay smiles to her, moves on to the...
           PANTRY

           Practically pitch black.  Jay pushes into the dark, tries to 
           open the window - it’s boarded up.

           Grace cautiously makes her way in, not enjoying the vibe.  

           As Jay pulls against the plank board covering the window... 

           A RATTLING NOISE comes from within the darkness.

           Jay freezes.  What was that?

           Silence.  Then, another RATTLE.

           Grace peers into the darkness.  Something pulls her closer.  

           Is someone back there?

           When Grace is only a few feet away...

           A CREATURE LAUNCHES out from within the dark, striking Grace.  
           She SCREAMS.

           Jay JUMPS back, also terrified.  

           Who’s there?

           Jay RIPS back the boards covering the window.  Light floods 
           in.  On the counter, we see...

           A scraggly CAT - the source of the commotion.  The cat 
           scurries off to another room.

           Both Jay and Grace breath heavy, shaken.  Then, Jay BURSTS 
           OUT LAUGHING.  

           Grace eventually joins him laughing.  

           Jay moves to his wife and gives her a meaningful kiss - 
           nothing to be afraid of.

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

           POV down the hallway looking toward Grace’s parents’ bedroom - 
           we’ve seen this visual before.

           Grace stands in the hallway, taking in the sight.  Unwelcome 
           memories flooding back.

           She creeps forward, tracing the familiar path.  She lands at 
           the window looking out onto the roof.
           GRACE’S POV: The rooftop is empty, but the visual carries 
           heavy baggage.  Outside, cold wind blows through barren 
           trees.

           ON GRACE, looking out onto the roof, into her past.

           INT. SHOWER - LATER

           Grace enjoys a much needed shower.

           As she cuts off the water and towels off, she hears a muffled 
           VOICE outside.  She looks out the window to the yard, sees...

           POV: Jay on his satellite phone, pacing as he speaks.  We can 
           just make out pieces of his conversation.

                                 JAY
                        See if you can get him to stall the 
                        hearings until after the debate...  
                        Tell him our administration will 
                        have his back once--

           Grace closes the window, blocking out the noise.

           As she does, something in the distance catches her attention:

           POV: A FIGURE Grace can hardly make out, seemingly looking 
           right at the Byrnes’ house.  

           Grace startles.  Is that the caretaker Jay mentioned?

           The figure walks off, disappearing behind the trees.

           Spooked, Grace closes the blinds.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Candle lit dinner.  The dining room could easily hold a dozen 
           people, but right now it’s an intimate space for two.  Jay 
           has prepared a delicious spread.

           Grace enjoys a particularly tasty bite, shakes her head.

                                 JAY
                        No good?

                                 GRACE
                        You’re the worst.

                                 JAY
                        What...?
                                 GRACE
                        You know I’m a sucker for 
                        Bolognese.  

                                 JAY
                        I just wanted to make my wife a 
                        delicious meal on our first night 
                        alone together.  Is that so wrong?

                                 GRACE
                        You’re a smooth operator, Mr. 
                        Connors.

           They share a loving, flirty smile.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        That phone call today... in the 
                        back yard...?

           Jay winces, caught.

                                 JAY
                        You heard that, huh?

           She nods, mock scolding.

                                 GRACE
                        I thought no work.  Leaving it all 
                        behind...

                                 JAY
                        Hunt is trying to drag drug execs 
                        in for a hearing right before the 
                        first debate, but--

           Jay realizes he’s going down the rabbit hole.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  You’re married to a 
                        liar.

           Jay gives her a puppy-dog look, begging forgiveness.  

                                 GRACE
                        I’m married to a politician... 
                        which means I’m married to a liar.

           She smiles to him - he’s forgiven.

           Jay takes her hand, locks in on her eyes - a nice moment.
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

           Grace stands at the dresser in her parents’ bedroom, slipping 
           into a nightgown.  As she removes her jewelry, she studies 
           herself in the mirror.  

           Jay walks up behind her, wraps his arms around her.  She 
           soaks in his touch.  He kisses her neck.  Gentle at first, 
           slowly becoming sexual.

           He runs his hand from her stomach, up toward her chest, 
           passion building.

           Grace tries to run with it, but she abruptly pulls away.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m sorry...

                                 JAY
                        It’s OK.

           Jay gently moves back in, kisses her again.  Grace tries to 
           run with it, but then pulls away, this time forcefully.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m sorry.  I need time.

           Jay gives her space, quickly swallows the sting of being 
           rebuffed.

                                 JAY
                        I understand.  We’ve got time.

           He gives her a kiss on the forehead, then hands her a glass 
           of water.  He guides her toward the bed.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get some rest.

           Grace downs her water.  She and Jay climb into bed. 

           INT. PSYCHAITRIC HOSPITAL - DAY [FLASHBACK]

           Once again, we see the image of Grace’s mother curled up on 
           the tile.  

           A haunting visual.

           We PUSH closer, closer, until...

           On a FLASH, the face of the woman switches from Grace’s 
           mother to Grace herself.
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Grace SHOOTS AWAKE in a cold sweat, rattled by her nightmare.

           She looks to the other side of the bed - no Jay.  She scans 
           the room - no sign of him.

           Grace climbs out of bed, moves to the...

           HALLWAY

           Dark.  Empty.  

                                 GRACE
                        Jay...

           No answer.  

           As Grace moves deeper into the hallway, she notices something 
           odd: an open window swinging with the wind - the same window 
           that was open the night of her father’s suicide.

           Grace flips on the hallway light, illuminating the space.  A 
           beat later...

           The bulb BLOWS, leaving the hallway dark again.

           Now thoroughly disturbed, Grace creeps closer to the window.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        JAY...

           A NOISE behind Grace causes her to turn.  As she does...

           A FIGURE crosses the door frame behind Grace.  The figure 
           disappears just before Grace turns back.

           The wind coming in from the window picks up.  

           Grace reaches the window and looks out onto the roof - the 
           same visual as the last time she saw her father alive.

           Suddenly...

           BANG!!!

           The door to the master bedroom SLAMS SHUT.  

           Grace JUMPS at the noise.  She RUSHES to the door, tries to 
           open it.  It won’t budge.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Jay!
           She puts all of her weight against the door - nothing.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        JAY!!!!

           Giving up on the door, Grace turns to RUN the opposite 
           direction, when...

           BAM!

           She CRASHES into a MAN standing in the hallway.  She SCREAMS!

                                 JAY
                        Grace... it’s OK.  It’s me.  It’s 
                        me.

           Grace looks up to see Jay’s comforting face.  He holds her 
           close, trying to bring her back from the episode.

           She shakes in his arms.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Grace and Jay sit at the kitchen table.

                                 JAY
                        It was just a cross-wind.  That’s 
                        all.  Doors close on their own all 
                        the time.

                                 GRACE
                        Why would that window be open?  And 
                        what about the light bulb blowing?

                                 JAY
                        This is an old house.  

                                 GRACE
                        Where were you?

           Jay looks away, ashamed to admit...

                                 JAY
                        I had to take a call.  There’s a 
                        lot going on right now.  But I’m 
                        here for you.  There’s a reasonable 
                        explanation for everything that 
                        happened last night.

                                 GRACE
                        You think I’m crazy.
                                 JAY
                        No.  No.  I just think your mind is 
                        playing tricks on you.

                                 GRACE
                        That’s the definition of crazy.

                                 JAY
                        That’s not what I meant.

                                 GRACE
                        I just want to feel safe in my own 
                        head.

                                 JAY
                        We’ll get there.  We’ve got all 
                        week.

           Grace scans the house.

                                 GRACE
                        We should leave this place.

                                 JAY
                        Be patient.

           EXT. ROAD / INT. COTTAGE - DAY

           In a WIDE SHOT, we see Jay and Grace out for a stroll by the 
           water.  They’re bundled up, braving the cold, but it’s worth 
           it for the view.

           We slowly PULL BACK, revealing that we are watching them 
           through a four-pane window inside a rundown cottage home.  

           Is someone watching them?

           A scruffy CAT (our friend from before) lurks past on a nearby 
           countertop.

           EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

           They reach the lighthouse on the far point of the island, 
           surrounded by ocean views.  

                                 JAY
                        Beautiful.

                                 GRACE
                             (re: lighthouse)
                        I used to hide up there.

                                 JAY
                        You can go up?
                                 GRACE
                        I’m sure it’s locked this time of 
                        year.

                                 JAY
                        How sure...?

           Jay flashes a mischievous smile, takes off toward the 
           lighthouse.  Grace follows.

           Jay reaches the door, pushes against it.  It doesn’t budge.

                                 GRACE
                        Told you.

           Jay PLOWS against the door with his shoulder - it blows open.

                                 JAY
                        Just a little elbow grease.  Come 
                        on...

           Jay leads the way inside.

           INT. LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The light from the door reveals cobwebs and a rusted 
           staircase.

           Jay leads Grace up the stairs to the...

           SECOND STORY

           A hanging ladder leads to an opening to the top floor.

                                 JAY
                        We don’t have to go up if you don’t 
                        want.

           Grace is game.  She cuts past Jay, scales the ladder.

           THIRD STORY

           Grace pushes back the covering above the ladder, moves into 
           the top floor.  As she climbs up we see...

           A breathtaking view of the open ocean.  Jay joins her on the 
           top floor, soaks it in.  

           Jay studies the massive light in the center of the room: a 
           Fresnel bulb on a rotating platform, dormant for the day.  

           As Jay pushes aside a wooden beam behind the light...
           A BAT FLIES OUT.  Jay JUMPS back.  The bat manically 
           flutters, taking off through the opening in the floor.

                                 JAY
                        Jesus.

           Grace is oddly calm.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Friend of yours?

           She smiles.  

                                 GRACE
                        I spent a whole night up here once, 
                        hiding.  My parents were fighting.  
                        I doubt they noticed I was gone.  
                        At night, the light flashes every 
                        three seconds - blinding white 
                        light.  For weeks, I’d see that 
                        flash when I’d close my eyes.  
                        FLASH.... FLASH.... FLASH....  But 
                        I liked it up here.  I felt safe.

           Jay wraps his arms around Grace.  They take in the view of 
           the ocean together.  

           They kiss.

           Something pulls Grace’s attention away.  She looks down to 
           see...

           A MAN staring up at them from the ground below - the same man 
           she saw the night before.  Grace jumps back.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Someone’s there.

                                 JAY
                        What...?

           Jay sees the MAN looking up at them - an intimidating sight.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        That must be the caretaker.  Guess 
                        we should introduce ourselves.

           Jay leads the way down.

           EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay walks out, approaches the caretaker.  Grace follows.  
           Dressed in paint-stained working clothes, caretaker BILL 
           MCCABE (50s) has the unkempt appearance of a man who hasn’t 
           had human contact in months. 

                                 JAY
                        You must be Mr. McCabe.

           Jay extends his hand for a shake.  McCabe leaves him hanging.

                                 MCCABE
                        You’re not supposed to be up there.

                                 JAY
                        The door was open.  We just wanted 
                        to take a look around.

           Uncomfortable beat.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Right, I’m Jay Connors.  This is my 
                        wife, Grace Byrnes Connors.

                                 MCCABE
                             (to Grace)
                        I knew your father.

                                 JAY
                        Oh?  I never got to meet the 
                        Senator - I’m jealous.

                                 MCCABE
                        You shouldn’t be.  

           Another awkward beat.  

                                 GRACE
                        We should go, Jay.

           A scraggly CAT wanders over - the same cat we met at the 
           Byrnes’ house.  McCabe picks up the cat, pets it.

                                 JAY
                        That’s your cat, huh?

           McCabe nods.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        OK, well, we’ll be on the island 
                        for the week, but we’ll stay out of 
                        your hair.  It’ll be like we’re not 
                        even here.  Speaking of which, you 
                        might recognize me from the 
                        campaign ads.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        We’re trying to stay under the 
                        radar, so I’d appreciate it if you 
                        didn’t spread the word.  You can 
                        keep a secret, right?

           Nothing from McCabe.

                                 GRACE
                        Jay, let’s go...

                                 JAY
                             (ignoring Grace)
                        I guess there isn’t anyone to tell 
                        out here, but still...

           Jay fishes through his pocket, pulls out a few bills.  McCabe 
           indifferently looks at the money.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        For your discretion...  

           Jay places the cash in McCabe’s chest pocket.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Good.  Well, like I said, it’ll be 
                        like we’re not even here.

           Jay and Grace walk off.  

           As they continue down the road, Grace looks back to see... 

           McCabe standing in the same spot, watching them.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Coming down the stairs, Grace hears Jay talking on his 
           satellite phone. 

           She listens from the drawing room doorway.

           He paces with his back to her.

                                 JAY
                             (into phone)
                        Yeah, I’ll be there....  Next 
                        Tuesday?  Sure, I can make that 
                        work...  No, that won’t be a 
                        problem.  Call my office - they’ll 
                        handle everything.

           Jay turns, sees Grace - caught in the act.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I gotta run.
                             (hangs up, to Grace:)
                        I thought you were asleep.

                                 GRACE
                        We have the symposium next Tuesday. 

                                 JAY
                        Remind me...

                                 GRACE
                        The Byrnes Foundation... 
                        Conversation between doctors and 
                        addicts...  You said you’d be 
                        there.

                                 JAY
                        Right, right.  We’ll work out the 
                        scheduling.

                                 GRACE
                        We set the date months ago.  It’s 
                        important to me.

                                 JAY
                        Of course.  You’re right.  I’ll be 
                        there - I promise.  But try not to 
                        think about work right now.  We’re 
                        here to help you rest, right?

           Grace nods.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Lunch is ready.

           INT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - SUN ROOM - DAY

           Grace sits by the window, looking out into the back yard.  

           Dense fog coming in from the water fills the surrounding 
           trees.

           Jay comes in carrying a lunch tray - sandwiches for two.  

                                 JAY
                        Bon appetit.

           Jay dives into his sandwich, notices Grace vacantly looking 
           out into the fog.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Eat.  You gotta stay healthy...  
           Grace obliges, eats.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        That McCabe fellow is interesting.  
                        I guess that’s to be expected, out 
                        here all alone six months a year.

                                 GRACE
                        I didn’t like what he said about my 
                        father - it made me uncomfortable.

                                 JAY
                        A lot of people knew your father - 
                        met him at least.

                                 GRACE
                        He made it pretty clear he didn’t 
                        like him.

                                 JAY
                        Goes with the job.  You can’t work 
                        in politics and not be disliked.   
                        ‘Something I’m still getting used 
                        to.  Being told you’re a villain 
                        starts to take its toll.

                                 GRACE
                        So does being told you’re a saint.

           Jay picks up her meaning.  She smiles - playful ribbing.

                                 JAY
                        I’m lucky I have you to keep me 
                        grounded, remind me who I really 
                        am.

           Grace continues eating.  Looking out into the trees, she 
           spots something in the fog.  She can just make out:

           A FIGURE in the distance, obscured by the trees...  

           It appears to be A MAN IN A THREE PIECE SUIT.

           FLASH IMAGE: Grace’s father on the roof wearing a three-piece 
           suit.

           Grace looks at the man, trying to make sense of what she’s 
           seeing. 

                                 GRACE
                        Do you...?

           She looks to Jay, who follows Grace’s look into the yard, 
           then looks back to her.  He seems to see nothing.
                                 JAY
                        What is it?

           Grace stands, walks through the glass door outside.

           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - CONTINUOUS

           As Grace starts toward the man, he calmly walks off, 
           disappearing into the trees.

           Grace begins to RUN, hoping to track him.  Jay exits the 
           house, follows.

                                 JAY
                        Grace...?

           Grace cuts into the trees, moving through barren branches.

           She reaches the area where the man was standing, looks - no 
           sign of him.  The fog and dense trees limit her view.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 GRACE
                        Did you...?  There was a...?

           Grace looks to Jay - he has no idea what she’s talking about.  

           Did she imagine the whole thing?

                                 JAY
                        What?  What is it?

                                 GRACE
                        Nothing.  I saw the branches moving 
                        in the wind and thought maybe... it 
                        was stupid.

           Jay studies her, trying to get a read on what’s going on.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        It’s nothing, really.  

                                 JAY
                        You sure?

                                 GRACE
                        Yes.  Could we go to the beach?  
                        I’d like to be by the water.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Grace sits on a dried-out log, looking out toward the ocean.
           Jay stands near the water, skipping rocks.  He’s got a 
           natural, effortless throwing delivery.

                                 GRACE
                        Sometimes I think you’d be happier 
                        leaving politics behind and 
                        coaching college baseball for the 
                        rest of your life?

                                 JAY
                        Sometimes I think the same thing.
                             (smiles to her)
                        No, baseball was just a way out.  I 
                        wouldn’t have politics without 
                        baseball.

                                 GRACE
                        How do you figure?

                                 JAY
                        No way I could’ve afforded to go to 
                        BC without the scholarship.  And 
                        the only reason I got my foot in 
                        the door with the blue-blood 
                        gatekeepers was because they 
                        remembered my no-hitter against 
                        Harvard.  Not all of us can be born 
                        into the Byrnes family.  

           She throws a small rock at him, harmlessly hitting him in the 
           ass.  He laughs.  

           Jay looks out into the calm ocean.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I think I can do a lot of good for 
                        kids like me.  If I can just get 
                        through this election... I think I 
                        can really do some good.

           Grace looks to her husband, believing in him.

           EXT. BEACH - LATER

           Jay and Grace sit huddled together on the log, looking out at 
           a breathtaking sunset.

           INT. ENTRYWAY - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - EVENING

           Jay and Grace enter, climb out of their winter gear.

                                 JAY
                        Want to get a fire going while I 
                        get dinner started?
                                 GRACE
                        Sure.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll be in the servant quarters, 
                        preparing the evening meal.

           Jay gives her a playful kiss, heads off toward the kitchen.

           Grace continues inside to the...

           DRAWING ROOM

           She makes her way to the fireplace, begins to prep a fire.

           After a beat, she feels a slight RATTLE.  

           She uncomfortably scans the room, landing on the PORTRAIT OF 
           HER FATHER.  She holds a long look, then...

           THE PORTRAIT INEXPLICABLY FALLS FROM IT’S MOUNT, CRASHES TO 
           THE FLOOR.

           Grace JUMPS back, stunned.  

           She walks to the painting, looking into her father’s eyes.  

           An eerie connection.

           Suddenly...

           THE DOORS TO THE SURROUNDING CABINETS SWING OPEN.  

           THE STACKS OF FINE CHINA SLIDE OFF THE SHELVES, CRASH TO THE 
           FLOOR.  

           Grace SCREAMS, surrounded by breaking glass.  

           The glass settles.  

           Everything goes still.  

           Quiet.

           Jay rushes in.  He looks around, takes in the wreckage.

                                 JAY
                        What happened?

           Grace faces Jay’s accusatory look, doesn’t have an answer.  
           Surrounded by shattered glass, Grace buries her face in her 
           hands.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON YOUNG GRACE...

           ... her face buried in her hands.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOUSE - DAY [FLASHBACK]

           Young Grace sits alone on the sofa, hiding from the world.  

           Outside, PARAMEDICS load a stretcher into the back of an 
           AMBULANCE.  A sheet covers a corpse on the stretcher.

           Grace’s brother JACK (6) plays with his toys in the corner of 
           the room, too young to understand what’s going on.

           As Grace looks to her brother, we hear a familiar VOICE:

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You don’t have to be afraid.  
                        Everything will be all right.  
                        Eventually, this will all be all 
                        right.

           We PULL BACK, slowly revealing PAUL SHERIDAN, twenty years 
           younger, sitting next to Grace on the couch.  

           Grace looks to Paul.  Her expression reveals not so much pain 
           as the burden of a trauma she will never shake.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Your father was a great man - one 
                        of the greatest I’ve ever known.  
                        But he had his demons.  
                             (rueful)
                        He would have been president.

           Grace watches as a PARAMEDIC pushes her mother out of the 
           house in a wheelchair.  Grace’s mother’s eyes are glossed 
           over - permanently paralyzed by the experience.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Your mother needs to go away for a 
                        while, to get healthy.  You and 
                        Jack are going to live with your 
                        cousins while...  

           Paul’s words fade into a distant echo as Grace watches her 
           mother disappear out the door - out of her life.
           We PAN WITH Grace’s POV to Jack, who is playing innocently.

           Grace studies her brother, sensing the troubled future that 
           awaits him.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Grace...

           Grace snaps back, looks to Paul.  His tone becomes deadly 
           serious.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Grace, you can never tell anyone 
                        what you saw last night.  Do you 
                        understand?

           Grace holds a long look on Paul, then nods.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s very important.  All we can do 
                        for your father now is remember the 
                        man that he was, and let the people 
                        that loved him do the same.  
                             (beat)
                        Eventually, this will all be all 
                        right.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. DINING ROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jay and Grace eat together in silence.  The romantic vibe of 
           their previous dinner is gone - a dark cloud hangs over.  

                                 JAY
                        Is there something you’re not 
                        telling me?

           Grace just looks away.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing I wouldn’t do to 
                        help you get past this.  But you 
                        need to let me in.  

                                 GRACE
                        I want to leave this house.

                                 JAY
                        Why?  

           Grace doesn’t answer.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You think it’s haunted?  Grace, 
                        that’s insane.
                             (off her reaction)
                        I’m not saying you’re insane, I’m 
                        saying...  Look, it’s not the 
                        house.  Something is going on with 
                        you.  If you won’t take medication, 
                        and if you can’t be open with me, 
                        then maybe we need to get you to a 
                        place where--

           Grace’s look silences him.  She projects resolve, not ready 
           to be put away like her mother.

                                 GRACE
                        Do you believe the things I’m 
                        experiencing are real?

           Jay considers this question, then:

                                 JAY
                        I believe they are real to you.

           This answer both saddens and terrifies her.  Is she losing 
           her mind?

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Grace sits in front of the vanity, holding a long look on 
           herself.  She downs a glass of water, then joins Jay in bed.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Grace wakes up to soft morning light coming in through the 
           window.  She’s alone.

           HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dressed in her nightgown, Grace enters the hallway, rubbing 
           the sleep from her eyes.

           She barely notices the shadow of a FIGURE headed downstairs.

                                 GRACE
                        Jay...

           Grace follows the figure down the stairs.

           KITCHEN

           Reaching the bottom of the stairs, Grace sees Jay in the 
           kitchen making breakfast with his back to her.
           Grace is comforted seeing Jay, but a beat later...

           A FIGURE crosses behind her through the drawing room.

           Who the hell was that?

           Sensing the movement, Grace whips around, moves into the...

           DRAWING ROOM

           The door in the back of the room is open to the back yard.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Scrambled eggs sound OK to you?

           Grace creeps toward the door.  Looking outside, she can just 
           make out the figure disappearing into the trees.

           She moves outside to follow.

           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS

           Grace moves through the empty yard - eerily quiet.

           Grace looks through the woods for a trace of the figure.  As 
           she spins back toward the house...

           She freezes.  Shocked horror.

           In front of her...

           A NOOSE hangs from the roof - the exact spot where her father 
           died.  

           Grace stares at the dangling rope, which innocently sways 
           with the wind.

           Grace races toward the trees, looking for whoever did this.

           The dense wooded area offers no clues.

           Her search is quickly interrupted...

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Grace?  What’s going on?

           Grace whips around to see Jay standing by the house.  

           The noose is now gone.

           Did she imagine it?

           Jay walks to Grace.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Everything all right?

                                 GRACE
                             (covering)
                        Yeah - fine.  Just looking at the 
                        birds.  Scrambled eggs sound 
                        delicious.

                                 JAY
                        Great.  Let’s eat.

           Grace follows Jay inside, eying the roof on her way in.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Grace and Jay eat in silence.  Grace’s wheels are turning.

           Jay’s SATELLITE PHONE BUZZES.  He looks at it for a beat.

                                 GRACE
                        Take it.

                                 JAY
                        Whatever it is, it can wait.

                                 GRACE
                        No, really.  I’d like to take a 
                        walk anyway, clear my head.  

                                 JAY
                        You sure?

           Jay gives her an “is this a trap?” look.  Grace presses the 
           answer button, hands the phone to Jay.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        This is Jay...

           Grace leaves him to it.

           EXT. MCCABE’S COTTAGE - DAY

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  

           Grace raps against the door to the caretaker’s run down 
           cottage on the far end of the island.

           McCabe opens the door and emerges from the cavernous 
           interior, his scraggly cat scurrying out.  Grace glances 
           inside: overrun by grime and decay - like looking into the 
           abyss.
                                 MCCABE
                        Can I help you?

                                 GRACE
                        Just waking up?

                                 MCCABE
                        Not much use getting up early out 
                        here.

                                 GRACE
                        How long have you been working on 
                        the island?

                                 MCCABE
                             (considers)
                        Over thirty years now.

                                 GRACE
                        And you knew my father?

                                 MCCABE
                        That’s right.

                                 GRACE
                        What do you know about the day he 
                        died?

           McCabe checks the area to see that they are alone.

                                 MCCABE
                        I know enough to not talk about it.  

                                 GRACE
                        Good.  

                                 MCCABE
                        I always wondered what became of 
                        you.  The little girl...

           Grace takes a beat to size him up - a charged beat.

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t want to see you near my 
                        family’s property.  Do you 
                        understand?

           McCabe eyes her, doesn't answer.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand me?

                                 MCCABE
                        Yes, Mrs. Connors.
                                 GRACE
                        That’s all I came to say.  

           Grace walks away, starts back toward her side of the island.  

           McCabe stands in his doorway, watching her walk off.

           INT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

           Grace and Jay sit in front of the fireplace.  Jay has pages 
           scattered, reviewing campaign documents.  

           Grace stares vacantly into the flames.

           As Grace gets lost in the fire, she begins to nod off.

           INT. PSYCHAITRIC HOSPITAL - DAY [FLASHBACK]

           Young Grace and her brother Jack make their way through the 
           psych ward guided by an ORDERLY.  

           Loud steps on grimy tile, cutting past glaring, unhinged 
           patients - visuals no child should have to see.

                                 ORDERLY
                        Do you want to say hello to your 
                        mother?

           Grace gathers the courage to start toward their mother, who 
           is curled up in the corner.  

           Getting closer and closer.  As Grace’s mother lifts her 
           head...

           We see her eyes are vacant, soulless.  A living ghost.  Too 
           flooded with antipsychotics to even recognize her children.

           We PUSH TIGHTER and TIGHTER on those terrifying, vacant eyes 
           until we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Grace’s eyes SPRING OPEN, coming out of the horrific vision.

           Grace groggily scans the room: pitch black.  Middle of the 
           night.  Jay lies asleep next to her in bed.

           We pan with GRACE’S POV, taking in the empty room.  Then...

           Holy Shit!
           There’s a MAN standing inside the room, his frame a 
           silhouette against the moonlit window.

           Grace startles.  Too shocked to scream.  She lies frozen.

           The figure steps forward into the light.  He is wearing the 
           same three-piece suit her father wore the night he jumped.

           Is this the man she saw in the yard?  

           Is this Grace’s father?

           The man slowly moves toward the bed...

                                 GRACE
                             (sotto)
                        Jay... Jay...

           Jay remains asleep.  Grace is dazed, unable to move - locked 
           into some form of sleep paralysis.

           As the man approaches, we see his face: 60s.  Similar 
           features to Grace’s father, although significantly aged.  
           Ghostly deep-set eyes.

           The man continues to inch closer... closer...  

           He’s now mere feet away from Grace.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Jay...
                             (screams)
                        JAY!!

           Jay doesn’t even stir.  Can he not hear her?

           The man places his hand on Grace’s knee.  As Grace tries to 
           recoil...

                                 SUITED MAN
                        It’s OK, Grace.  I’m here for you.

           The man runs his hand from her knee toward her inner thigh.  
           He pushes his hand up, up...

           Frozen in place, Grace SCREAMS.  

           As she closes her eyes, we...

           CUT TO BLACK.  GRACE’S SCREAMING plays over.  Then...

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Grace!!  It’s OK, Grace.  GRACE!!!
           Without looking, Grace grabs a LAMP off the bedside table.

           She SWINGS it wildly.  

           THE LAMP SMASHES AGAINST A MAN’S HEAD.  

           Grace opens her eyes to see...

           Jay above her.  He’s dazed.  

           After a beat, a line of blood streams from his forehead.  

           Grace looks to Jay, completely disoriented.  

                                 GRACE
                        I’m losing my mind...

           GRACE’S POV: The image of Jay above her BLURS into a haze.

           EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAY

           CLOSE ON A WOMAN we have not seen before.  Professional 
           attire with a sympathetic face.  This is DR. NICOLE ERNST 
           (50s, intelligent, nurturing, almost maternal presence).  She 
           rides on the back of the boat through choppy water.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        She can help you - or at least try 
                        to get to the bottom of what’s 
                        going on in your head.  

                                 GRACE (V.O.)
                        Can’t we just go home?

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        We can’t run from this.  We came 
                        here to fix this thing.  She’s one 
                        of the best psychologists in the 
                        country.  

           Dr. Ernst looks out toward the approaching island.

           Also on the back of the boat are two campaign AIDES - large 
           men in suits and trench coats.  We’ll call them AIDE #1 and 
           AIDE #2.

           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - DAY

           The campaign aides lead Dr. Ernst toward the house.  

           Jay swings open the door to greet them.  He now has a bandage 
           covering the wound on his forehead.  
           Jay and Dr. Ernst shake hands, exchange introductions.  Jay 
           leads the group inside.

           INT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - SUN ROOM - DAY

           Grace sits alone, staring out into the back yard.  She looks 
           frail and exhausted.

           The door slides open, revealing Jay and Dr. Ernst.  

                                 JAY
                        Grace, this is Dr. Ernst.  She 
                        works with the Gardner Institute.

           Ernst walks to Grace, shakes her hand.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Nice to meet you, Grace.

                                 JAY
                        I thought this would be a good 
                        place to talk, but we can set up 
                        another room if you prefer.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        This works fine.

           Ernst takes off her coat, sits in a chair opposite Grace.

                                 JAY
                        Good.  Well, I’m not sure where you 
                        want to begin.  I assume Paul 
                        filled you in.  Grace has been 
                        experiencing--

                                 DR. ERNST
                        It might be best for me to hear 
                        from Grace directly.

                                 JAY
                        Right.
                             (hovers, then gets the 
                              hint)
                        I’ll leave you to it.  If you need 
                        me, I’ll just be... around.

           Jay exits the room, closing the door behind him.

           Ernst lets the silence sit, allowing Grace to make the 
           opening move. 

                                 GRACE
                        Did you get anything to eat? 
                                 DR. ERNST
                        I had lunch in town.

                                 GRACE
                        What’d you get?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Lobster roll.

                                 GRACE
                        How was it?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Delicious.

           Grace smiles, fidgets for a beat. 

                                 GRACE
                        So... how much do you know?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        I don’t know anything.  Your 
                        husband’s associates told me a 
                        little about what you’ve been going 
                        through, but like I said, I’d 
                        prefer to hear from you.

                                 GRACE
                        What’d they tell you?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        That you’ve been experiencing 
                        exhaustion and dizziness.  That you 
                        were hospitalized after a fall.

                                 GRACE
                        But that’s not all...

                                 DR. ERNST
                        That you may have experienced 
                        hallucinations. 

                                 GRACE
                        I just want to know what’s real.

           Grace’s fried nerves begin to show.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        I understand.  What did you see?

                                 GRACE
                        My father.
                                 DR. ERNST
                        Is your father still alive?

                                 GRACE
                             (shakes her head ‘no’)
                        ... When I was young.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        How did he die?

           Grace takes a beat, considers answering, then:

                                 GRACE
                        Is this conversation...

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Confidential?  100%.  Not even your 
                        husband has to know.

                                 GRACE
                        No, I mean, is this conversation... 
                        real?  Is it really happening.

           Dr. Ernst considers, giving the question surprising weight.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        What do you think?

                                 GRACE
                        I don’t know.  I don’t know.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Me neither.  It feels real to me.

                                 GRACE
                        Me too.  
                             (beat)
                        I don’t want to be crazy.  My whole 
                        life, I’ve worried I’d be crazy.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Why is that?

                                 GRACE
                        My mother spent the last decade of 
                        her life in a mental institution.  
                        She died two days before my 18th 
                        birthday.
                             (beat)
                        Sometimes I think my family is 
                        cursed.

           Dr. Ernst takes this in.  The two women sit in silence for a 
           beat then...
                                 DR. ERNST
                        Tell you what: why don’t you show 
                        me around.

                                 GRACE
                        What do you mean?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Let’s take a walk around the 
                        island.

           Grace is surprised by the suggestion, but not opposed to it.

                                 GRACE
                        OK.

           INT. ENTRYWAY - SAME

           The campaign aides sit in the entryway, still in their coats.  
           They don’t talk, they don’t exchange looks - they just sit.  

           We hold on this visual just long enough that somebody in the 
           audience thinks to herself “who are these guys and why the 
           hell are they here?”

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Jay speaks on his satellite phone while reviewing campaign 
           documents.  He uses a metal LETTER OPENER to open envelopes.  

                                 CAMPAIGN ADVISOR #1 (V.O.)
                             (through phone)
                        We can get some volunteers out to 
                        Marlborough this spring, just to 
                        gauge the temperature.

           Jay spots something outside: Dr. Ernst and Grace walking 
           through the yard, taking a leisurely stroll.

           Jay moves to the window, watches them walk.

                                 CAMPAIGN ADVISOR #2 (V.O.)
                        Didn’t you have a college friend 
                        who was a selectman out there?

           Jay misses the question, busy studying Grace and Ernst.

                                 CAMPAIGN ADVISOR #1 (V.O.)
                        Jay?

                                 JAY
                        Hmmm...?  Oh, yeah, Bill Thorne.  
                        Shortstop.  
           Jay returns his attention outside.

                                 CAMPAIGN ADVISOR #1 (V.O.)
                        Right, well, let’s connect him with 
                        our people, set up the ground game.

                        Mmhmm.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Grace and Dr. Ernst walk on the shore near the Byrnes’ house.  
           Ernst takes in the coast.

                                 GRACE
                        Nantucket’s about 8 miles that 
                        direction.  You can see it on a 
                        clear day.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 GRACE
                        Do you do this type of work often?  
                        Traveling to see crazy people?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        I’m mostly at my office at the 
                        clinic.  I do some political 
                        advocacy, which is how I know Paul.  
                        A day at the beach is a nice change 
                        of pace, even if it is freezing.  
                             (marveling)
                        What a view...

           Grace nods unconvincingly.

                                 DR. ERNST (CONT’D)
                        You don’t like it out here very 
                        much, do you?

           Grace’s look says ‘no.’

                                 GRACE
                        ... ‘Lot of memories.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Think you’re ready to tell me about 
                        them?

           INT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - SUN ROOM - DAY

           Grace and Ernst are back in their seats, now in a full on 
           therapy session.
                                 GRACE
                        My father could be very charming, 
                        but he had a temper - not many 
                        people knew that side of him.  I 
                        could hear him scream at my mother 
                        through the walls.  Sometimes he’d 
                        hit her.  

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Do you and Jay fight?

                                 GRACE
                        No.  Never like that.  Jay has 
                        always been... gentle with me.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        How did you meet?

                                 GRACE
                        Volunteering.  Jay was a community 
                        organizer, helping at-risk kids - 
                        kids like him.  I’d never believed 
                        in anyone so much.  I still believe 
                        in him.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        So it’s a good relationship?

           Grace nods. 

                                 DR. ERNST (CONT’D)
                        You said you saw your father here 
                        on the island?

                                 GRACE
                        I imagined I saw...  He was dressed 
                        like my father, similar features, 
                        but older.  It seemed so real.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Your parents fought in this house?

                                 GRACE
                        Every night.  He was at his worst 
                        on the island.  Something about 
                        this place...  I used to sneak into 
                        my little brother’s room to cover 
                        his ears.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Your brother passed away recently?
                                 GRACE
                             (nods)
                        Last year.  I tried to leave all 
                        this in the past.  Jack never 
                        could...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           CLOSE ON a photo of the Byrnes family.  

           The conversation plays over as we PUSH TIGHTER and TIGHTER on 
           young Jack.

                                 GRACE (V.O.)
                        ...He used pills to numb the pain.  
                        By the time he realized what they 
                        were doing to him, it was too late.  
                        I should have done more to save 
                        him.

                                 DR. ERNST (V.O.)
                        Were you two close?

                                 GRACE (V.O.)
                        I was all he had.  And he was all I 
                        had... until Jay.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. SUN ROOM - SAME

                                 DR. ERNST
                        You started experiencing these 
                        episodes not long after your 
                        brother’s death...?

                                 GRACE
                        Maybe.  I couldn’t say.

           Ernst takes in this information for a beat, then...

                                 DR. ERNST
                        You know, you never did tell me how 
                        your father died.

           ON GRACE, finally crumbling under the weight of her secret.

           She can’t hold onto it any longer.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - LATER

           Jay sits on the couch on the phone.
                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (V.O.)
                        We won’t make any statements until 
                        after the hearings.  If Hunt keeps 
                        pushing the charges, we’ll--

           Dr. Ernst enters the room.

                                 JAY
                             (into phone)
                        Hold on...
                             (to Ernst)
                        How’s everything going?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Good.  Very good.  This might be a 
                        good time for you to join us.

                                 JAY
                        Sure.
                             (into phone)
                        Gotta go.

           Jay hangs up, follows Ernst toward the sun room.

           INT. SUN ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay sits on the couch next to Grace, facing Dr. Ernst.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Go ahead, Grace.  

           Jay looks to Grace expectantly.  Grace hesitates.

                                 GRACE
                        This can’t leave this room.

                                 JAY
                             (to Dr. Ernst)
                        This is all confidential, right?

           Grace holds a look on Jay: that’s not what I meant.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I won’t tell anyone.  I promise.

           Grace gathers her strength, then dives in.

                                 GRACE
                        When I was nine years old, I woke 
                        up to the sound of my parents 
                        fighting.  I’d heard it hundreds of 
                        times before, but somehow I knew 
                        this was different.  I walked from 
                        my room...
                                 (MORE)
                                 GRACE (CONT'D)
                             (points to her room 
                              upstairs)
                        ... toward my parents’ room...
                             (traces the path)
                        ... where I found my mother curled 
                        up on the floor and the window 
                        swinging open - the same window 
                        that was open the other night.  
                        When I got to the window, I saw my 
                        dad standing on the roof in a suit, 
                        with a noose around his neck.  He 
                        looked right at me... and jumped.

           Jay is floored by this revelation.

                                 JAY
                             (recalling Grace’s words)
                        ‘He looked at me before he jumped.’  
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 GRACE
                        Paul made sure the heart attack 
                        story played in the press, told me 
                        to never tell anyone what I saw.  I 
                        almost made myself forget.  If you 
                        tell a lie long enough, you start 
                        to believe it.  

                                 JAY
                        Grace, if I had known, I never 
                        would have taken you out here.  I 
                        am so sorry I put you through this.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        It’s good that she’s here.  This 
                        type of trauma was bound to surface 
                        at some point.

                                 GRACE
                        But why now?  It’s been twenty 
                        years. 

                                 DR. ERNST
                        I’m sure your brother’s death 
                        reopened these wounds, triggered 
                        feelings of abandonment.  Add on 
                        the stresses of the campaign, 
                        you’ve got a ticking time-bomb.

                                 JAY
                        What can we do?  How can we make 
                        Grace better?
                                 DR. ERNST
                        I’ll be honest, this is only going 
                        to get harder as the campaign 
                        intensifies.  Grace, what you do 
                        now is completely up to you, but 
                        you can’t run from this.  It will 
                        only get worse.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll leave the campaign.  I’ll drop 
                        out if that’s what it takes.

                                 GRACE
                        I won’t let you do that.  You’ve 
                        come too far to stop now.  
                             (to Ernst)
                        What can I do?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Come with me to the clinic.  You’d 
                        be under my personal care, and we 
                        can tailor a program that will get 
                        you back out into the world.  

                                 GRACE
                        I can’t end up like her, rotting 
                        away in an asylum.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        I won’t let that happen - I 
                        promise.  I’m going to look after 
                        you.  It’s an intensive program and 
                        it will take time, but there is a 
                        light at the end of this tunnel.  
                        We can get you better.

                                 JAY
                        There has to be another way.  Can’t 
                        we--

                                 GRACE
                        It’s OK.

           Jay looks to Grace, surprised.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        I need to do this.  I need to get 
                        better.

                                 JAY
                        Are you sure?  I mean, is this what 
                        you want?

           Grace looks to Ernst, knowing the weight of this decision.
                                 DR. ERNST
                        This has to be your decision.  It 
                        has to come from you.

           Then...

                                 GRACE
                        I’m sure.

           Jay places a hand over Grace’s, supporting her.

                                 JAY
                        So what happens now?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Grace signs a few forms and I get 
                        started on the paperwork.  We can 
                        have a space ready by Friday.  

                                 GRACE
                        Can I go back to Boston until then?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.  
                        In fact, I’d like you to do me a 
                        favor: stay here for the next 
                        couple days.  Track everything you 
                        feel, everything you see.

                                 JAY
                        Is that really necessary?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        The more we can identify what it is 
                        she’s experiencing, the more we can 
                        tackle the problem.
                             (off Grace’s hesitation)
                        Just two more nights.  You’ve made 
                        progress today, and I don’t want to 
                        lose that.

           Grace processes this, then nods.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Grace stands over the table with Jay next to her.  Ernst 
           walks her through paperwork, indicating places to sign.  

           ECU ON PAPERWORK: At 60 FPS, we see Grace’s signature filled 
           in beneath a chunk of legalese: GRACE BYRNES CONNORS.
           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - DAY

           Dr. Ernst says goodbye to Grace and Jay.  Aide #2 waits with 
           Ernst’s bag.  Aide #1 looks on from nearby.  

                                 DR. ERNST
                        Remember: the things inside your 
                        head can’t hurt you.

           Grace nods.  Ernst takes off toward the docks with Aide #2.

                                 JAY
                             (to Grace)
                        Come inside.

           Grace looks toward Aide #1, who is hovering nearby. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        These guys are gonna stay on the 
                        island till Friday to help us out.  
                        They’re renting a house nearby.

           Jay picks up on her discomfort, calls out to Aide #1.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        We’re all set here, thanks.

           Aide #1 nods, heads off.  Jay leads Grace inside.

           As Grace follows Jay, she sees something in the attic window: 
           the man in the suit looking directly at Grace.

           Grace quickly looks to the others, checking if anyone else 
           has seen.  They’ve all taken off - nobody is looking toward 
           the attic.  By the time Grace looks back up...

           The man in the attic is gone.  Grace stares at the empty 
           window.  

           It seemed so real.

           Grace gathers herself, musters the courage to head inside.

           EXT. DOCK - EVENING

           Dr. Ernst climbs onto the fishing boat.  Aide #2 loads on her 
           bag and gives the send-off to the fisherman at the wheel.  

           The boat pulls away, taking off into the open ocean.

           INT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

           Flames dance inside the fireplace.
           Grace sits on the couch, lost in the spell of the flames.  
           She’s exhausted, but comfortably resigned.

           Jay enters, hands Grace a glass of water.

                                 JAY
                        Drink this.

           Grace drinks the water.  Jay places a blanket on top of her.

           Grace stares into the flames, starting to nod off.

           We begin a slow FADE from GRACE’S FACE to the FLAMES.  

           ON THE DANCING FLAMES, a mesmerizing visual.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - LATER

           Jay collects Grace off the couch, carries her to the stairs.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay gently lays Grace into bed, pulls the covers over her.

           INT. PSYCHAITRIC HOSPITAL - DAY [FLASHBACK / DREAM]

           We PUSH IN on Grace’s mother curled up in the corner, looking 
           as terrifying as ever.

           Then...

           Grace’s mother picks up her head, looks right into camera.  

                                 GRACE’S MOTHER
                        Don’t let them take you.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOUSE

           Grace’s eyes SHOOT OPEN, coming out of the dream.

           She looks around: no sign of Jay.

                                 GRACE
                        Jay...?

           Nothing.  

           Groggy, even a little woozy, Grace sits up.

           She grabs the glass of water off her bedside table, ready to 
           down it, but something stops her.  She puts down the glass.

           Grace stands, walks out into the...
           HALLWAY

           She listens for cues, gets none.  It’s dark, quiet.

                                 GRACE
                        Jay...?

           Grace is about to turn back into the room, but stops.

           She looks up, studies the ceiling above her.  

           What (or who) is in that attic?  

           Grace presses against the seemingly flush wall, revealing a 
           staircase that leads up to the attic.

           Grace looks up into the pitch black.

           INT. ATTIC - MOMENTS LATER

           Complete darkness.  Then...

           A FLICKERING LIGHT coming from the stairs.  Grace makes her 
           way into the attic holding a flashlight.

           She scans the space looking for... something.  Anything.  

           The flashlight only reveals so much, but the attic appears to 
           be empty.

           The light on the floorboards shows something in the dust: 
           fresh footprints from a man’s shoe. 

           Grace kneels to examine the dust, studies the prints.  

           What does it mean?

           Grace digs through some old boxes.  She’s about to give up 
           when something catches her eye: a ROPE, tucked away behind 
           the boxes.

           Grace pulls at the rope until she sees that it’s been tied 
           into a noose.

           Grace studies the noose, trying to make sense of it.  

           A NOISE from outside snaps her back.  

           Looking out the window, she spots Jay and a MAN carrying a 
           BRIEFCASE walking through the lawn, approaching the house.

           The MUFFLED SOUNDS of their voices echo up to the attic.

           Grace moves through a winding passageway toward the sound.
           DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Jay enters and takes off his coat, warming by the fire.

           We PUSH IN on a vent above him, where we see Grace peaking 
           out into the room.

           As the other MAN steps inside...  

           We see that it’s PAUL SHERIDAN.

           ON GRACE, surprised to see Paul.  She silently listens in.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Jesus, it’s cold.  Sorry you had to 
                        be stranded out here all week.

           Paul nods to the open hallway door.  Jay gives a quick scan 
           off the hallway, then closes the door.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        She was asleep when you left?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        And you gave her the sodium 
                        pentothal?  The full dose?

                                 JAY
                        I gave her enough.

           Paul holds a look on Jay: are you sure?

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        So what happens now?

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Everyone stays on the island until 
                        Friday, then Grace goes away.

                                 JAY
                        For how long?

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        At least through the election. 

           Grace leans closer to the vent to track Paul’s movements.  As 
           she does, the wall CREAKS.

           Jay and Paul immediately react to the sound.  They go 
           completely still, listening.
           Paul silently approaches the door to the hallway, WHIPS it 
           open, looking for a sign of Grace.

           Above, Grace controls her breathing as best she can.

           Satisfied, Paul returns from the hallway, closes the door.

                                 JAY
                        Old house...

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I put together a press release for 
                        Friday.  We’ll be way ahead of the 
                        news cycle.  If Hunt tries to use 
                        it as dirt, which I hope he’ll be 
                        dumb enough to do, you hit back 
                        hard: invasion of privacy, my 
                        wife’s health is all that matters, 
                        et cetera, et cetera.  

                                 JAY
                        Was all this really necessary?

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        You’ve seen what’s been happening - 
                        collapsing in the middle of the 
                        fucking Kennedy Center...  It’s 
                        only been getting worse.  

                                 JAY
                        But bringing her out here, the 
                        theatrics, staging all these... 
                        ‘episodes.’  Was it necessary to 
                        make her feel insane?

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        It had to come from her.  Once 
                        she’s inside, my people can hold 
                        her as long as I tell them to, but 
                        it had to be her idea to be 
                        institutionalized in the first 
                        place.  

                                 JAY
                        It doesn’t feel right.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        This is the best thing for her, and 
                        for you.  Trust me, this is not 
                        what I had in mind when I 
                        introduced you two.

           Listening from above, Grace tries to wrap her head around 
           what she’s hearing.
           Jay squares up to Paul, asserting himself.

                                 JAY
                        It doesn’t feel right.

           Paul’s tone suddenly hardens.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Jay, that’s not your call to make.  
                        There are other ways to handle 
                        things, but I can guarantee you 
                        won’t like them.  You can ask 
                        Grace’s whistleblower friend about 
                        that.

                                 JAY
                        You mean he was...?

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Don’t ask questions that you don’t 
                        want to know the answer to.  Point 
                        is, the Malta board isn’t taking 
                        any chances.  If we don’t handle 
                        this, they will.

                                 JAY
                        Oh my God.

           His knees seeming to weaken, Jay sits down.

           Paul softens his tone.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        This is all just until we kill the 
                        charges.  After that you can solve 
                        world hunger, save the crack 
                        babies, whatever the fuck you want.  
                        She’ll be away eight months, a year 
                        tops.  

                                 JAY
                        Promise me she’ll be released once 
                        the investigation is dropped.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        That’s the plan.

                                 JAY
                        Promise me.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I promise.

           Paul reaches into his briefcase, pulls out a SYRINGE.
                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        In case of emergency.  It’ll knock 
                        her out for about four hours.  

           Paul replaces the syringe, hands the briefcase to Jay.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re doing good.  Get some rest.

           Paul gives Jay a paternal head rub, then heads out the door.

           Jay stands for a contemplative beat, then kills the light, 
           heads upstairs with the briefcase. 

           Above, Grace has to scramble to get back.  She bolts away 
           from the vent.

           ATTIC

           Grace darts through the attic, continues toward the stairs.

           HALLWAY - SAME

           Jay reaches the top of the stairs, moves through the hallway.  

           Is Grace too late?

           Jay opens the door to the bedroom, revealing...

           Grace lying in bed with her back to Jay, seemingly asleep.  

           ON GRACE, one eye open, waiting for the next move.

           Jay looks back into the hall, where he notices something: 

           The wall seam is not quite flush, leading to the stairs.

           Jay opens the door, looks up into the attic: no sign of any 
           activity.

           Jay quietly closes the door, continues into the...

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Jay slides the briefcase under the bed, then undresses and 
           climbs into bed.  

           He wraps an arm around Grace, holding her.  

           Grace has no choice but to lie in his arms.

           EXT. OCEAN - PRE-DAWN

           WIDE ON Crane Island from the open water.  
           The lighthouse BLASTS out light in methodical intervals, 
           illuminating choppy water.  

           FLASH...

           FLASH...

           FLASH...

           On the horizon, we can see the faintest hint of daylight.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOUSE - SAME

           Grace lies in bed - she hasn’t slept a wink.  Jay is fast 
           asleep, his arm draped over her.

           Grace notices the pre-dawn light coming through the window - 
           her cue to move.

           She gently slides out from under Jay’s arm, gets out of bed.

           Jay stirs.  Grace freezes, holding for a tense beat.

           Jay settles, resumes his deep sleep.

           Grace carries her shoes out of the room.

           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - PRE-DAWN

           Wearing a coat over her nightgown, Grace silently exits the 
           house.  She creeps off the property, headed toward the dock.

           EXT. DOCK - DAWN

           Two LOBSTER BOATS collect their traps a half-mile off shore 
           as the sun is just beginning to rise.

           Grace reaches the docks, looks out to the vast distance 
           between her and the boats.

           Not wanting to wake Jay or Paul, Grace jumps up and down, 
           hoping to catch the attention of the boats.

           She flails, but gets no recognition from the boats.

           Desperate, she cautiously calls out.

                                 GRACE
                        Hey!

           No reaction.  Grace looks around to make sure no one on the 
           island has heard.  
                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Hey!!

           EXT. OCEAN - SAME

           The fishermen are hard at work.  Grace’s calls don’t have a 
           shot over the sounds of SEAGULLS and HAULING TRAPS.

           EXT. DOCK - SAME

                                 GRACE
                        HEY!!

           She jumps up and down, but it’s no use.

           Finished with their haul, the boats pull away.  Grace’s 
           window has closed.

           She watches the boats drift away, deflated.  

           Then... an idea.  

           Grace takes off toward the far end of the island.

           EXT. HOUSE - SAME

           Paul stands on the balcony of a summer house further down the 
           island.  From here, he has a clear view of the docks.

           He watches as Grace leaves the dock, having seen everything.  

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOUSE - MORNING

           Jay wakes up to sunlight coming through the window.  He looks 
           around, surprised to see that Grace isn’t there.  

                                 JAY
                        Grace...

           EXT. MCCABE’S COTTAGE - MORNING

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.  

           Grace waits impatiently by the door.

           She KNOCKS again.  

           The door swings open - a groggy McCabe steps forward.

                                 MCCABE
                        What time is it?

                                 GRACE
                        I need your help.  I’m not safe. 
                                 MCCABE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 GRACE
                        I need to get off the island as 
                        soon as possible.  The men here are 
                        trying to hurt me.  Do you 
                        understand?

                                 MCCABE
                        Well, no.  What’s going on?

                                 GRACE
                        I can’t explain.  I’m asking you to 
                        trust me, to help me.  

                                 MCCABE
                        I thought I was supposed to stay 
                        away from you.

                                 GRACE
                        I made a stupid mistake.  I thought 
                        you were... It doesn’t matter what 
                        I thought.  The point is I was 
                        wrong and I’m sorry.

           McCabe looks at her, not revealing much.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not safe.  I need to get off 
                        the island right away.

                                 MCCABE
                        There’s no boats.  Everything’s 
                        stored up for the winter.

                                 GRACE
                        Can you radio to someone?

                                 MCCABE
                        The only radio on the island is at 
                        the lighthouse.

                                 GRACE
                        OK, let’s--

           Grace cuts off as a CALL echoes across the island.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Grace!  Grace!!

           Grace reacts to the call.
                                 GRACE
                        Listen, I don’t have much time.  
                        Can you radio for a boat?  

                                 MCCABE
                        Sure.

                                 GRACE
                        How soon can it be here?

                                 MCCABE
                        Depends.  Could be a few hours.

                                 GRACE
                             (checks her watch)
                        Tell them to be at the dock at 1pm - 
                        1pm sharp.  I’ll be there.  Promise 
                        me you won’t let the men I’m with 
                        know I came to you.  

                                 MCCABE
                        I promise.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Grace!!

                                 GRACE
                        1pm.

                                 MCCABE
                        1pm.

                                 GRACE
                        Thank you... and I’m sorry.

           Grace takes off as Jay’s calls continue.

           EXT. ROAD - SAME

           Jay walks down the middle of the road, calling out.

                                 JAY
                        GRACE!!

           He searches frantically for signs.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        GRACE!!!

                                 GRACE (O.S.)
                        Over here.

           Jay turns to see Grace casually walking on the beach.
                                 JAY
                        Where were you?  I was worried 
                        sick.

                                 GRACE
                        I woke up early and decided to get 
                        some air.

                                 JAY
                        You can’t run off like that.  Not 
                        in your condition.

                                 GRACE
                        Right, right.  I thought a walk 
                        might do me some good.  But you’re 
                        right.  

           Jay touches Grace’s rosy cheek.

                                 JAY
                        You’re freezing.

                                 GRACE
                        It’s not so bad.  I kind of like 
                        the cold air.

                                 JAY
                        Let’s get you home.

           Jay puts an arm around Grace.  She allows him to guide her 
           back to the house.

           INT. DINING ROOM - BYRNES’ SUMMER HOUSE - DAY

           Grace and Jay eat breakfast.  Grace studies Jay, working out 
           her plan.

                                 JAY
                        How’d you sleep?

                                 GRACE
                        I woke up in the middle of the 
                        night.  One of my ‘episodes.’

           Jay nods understandingly.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        But, you know, what Dr. Ernst said 
                        really helped.  I reminded myself 
                        that it was all in my head, that I 
                        was safe, that there was nothing to 
                        worry about, and I was able to go 
                        back to bed.
                                 JAY
                        That’s great.

                                 GRACE
                        I think maybe I’ve had a 
                        breakthrough, you know?

           Jay knows where this is headed, doesn't like it.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking we could push back 
                        going to the clinic for a week.  
                        Now that I see things differently, 
                        I’m interested to find out what I 
                        can accomplish on my own - see if I 
                        can get back on track.

                                 JAY
                        Dr. Ernst was pretty clear that you 
                        should hit this thing head on.

                                 GRACE
                        Right, but just a week.

                                 JAY
                        Grace, the arrangements have 
                        already been made.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m sure there’s some flexibility, 
                        right?  If I could just get back to 
                        Boston, maybe--

                                 JAY
                             (raising his tone)
                        Grace, everyone has been very 
                        patient with you, but that patience 
                        has limits!

           Grace is startled by the sudden reprimand.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve gone through... I’ve gone 
                        through a lot for you, trying to 
                        accommodate your needs, but the 
                        time has come to do what needs to 
                        be done.  You signed the papers.

           The two share a long look.  Grace sees that she’s not going 
           to talk her way clear.  

                                 GRACE
                        You’re right.  You’re right.  It’s 
                        time.
                                 JAY
                        Good.  Good.  Trust me - this is 
                        for the best.

                                 GRACE
                        You’re right.  I trust you.

           Grace stands, approaches Jay.  Standing only inches from him:

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for being so 
                        understanding.

           She gives him a long, sensuous kiss, then collects his plate.

           ON JAY watching Grace walk out of the room, her kiss having 
           ignited a spark.

           INT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAY

           McCabe makes a call over the radio.

                                 MCCABE

                                 MCCABE
                        How soon can you reach the island?  
                        We have a woman in distress, over.

                                 FISHERMAN (V.O.)

                        Over.

           McCabe hangs up the radio.  As he exits the lighthouse...

           He’s cut off by Aide #1, standing in the doorway.  

           Shit.
           McCabe is cornered.  Nowhere to run.  

           INT. SHOWER - LATER

           Jay stands under the shower.  

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

           Grace moves through the room, keeping close tabs on the 
           bathroom.  

           She checks her watch: 12:40.  Not much time.  

           Grace pulls the BRIEFCASE out from under the bed, opens it.  
           Inside, she finds a collection of black and white PRINTS.  

           She studies them.

           PHOTOS: forensic shots from the day of Grace’s father’s 
           death.  They show GRACE’S FATHER HANGING FROM THE ROOF.  

           Grace is horrified by the visuals, memories flooding back.

           As Grace flips through the shots, she finds one showing YOUNG 
           GRACE being ushered away by paramedics.

           Grace studies her young self - a broken girl, never to be 
           whole again.

           Next, she finds stacks of papers in Jay’s bag - all of them 
           watermarked “MALTA GROUP.”  

           FLASHES OF TEXT: “PRESCRIPTION DATA ANALYSIS,” “RESPONSE TO 
           REGULATION INITIATIVE,” “KEY RESEARCH FROM THE GARDNER 
           INSTITUTE.”

           Replacing the papers, Grace digs into Jay’s bag and finds the 
           SYRINGE Paul gave Jay the night before.

           The SHOWER CUTS OUT.  Jay will be out soon.

           Grace repositions the bag.  She looks herself in the mirror.

           Doing a quick touch-up, she fixes her hair, polishes her lip 
           gloss, presents a flash of cleavage.  

           As Jay emerges with a towel around his waist, Grace conceals 
           the syringe.  

           She squares up to him with a piercing look - she looks damn 
           good.  

           Jay is taken aback, but noticeably intrigued.
                                 JAY
                        What’s going on?

                                 GRACE
                        I’m sorry for what I’ve put you 
                        through these last few months.  I 
                        know how understanding you’ve been.

                                 JAY
                        Of course.  I just want to help.

           Grace slowly steps toward him.

                                 GRACE
                        I’m going to be away for a while.  
                        I don’t know how long it will be 
                        until we’re alone together again.

           Now only a few inches away...

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Before I go, I want to make sure to 
                        show my appreciation.  

           Grace gently pulls on Jay’s towel.  It unravels, falls to the 
           floor.  Jay is frozen, thoroughly seduced.

           They kiss.  

           Grace slowly lowers, kisses his neck, his chest, his stomach.  

           ON JAY, about to get exactly what he’s been waiting for.  

           Suddenly, Jay’s face contorts in a swirl of pain and ecstacy - 
           a bizarre ‘O face.’ 

           Jay falls backward like a stiff board, CRASHES to the floor.  
           As he lands, we see the syringe protruding from his hip.

           Grace eyes him on the floor, then checks her watch: 12:56.  
           She snaps into gear.

           She retrieves the papers and the photos from Jay’s bag, then 
           looks out the window and sees:

           A FISHING BOAT in the distance approaching the dock.  Perfect 
           timing.

           Grace bolts out of the room, into the...

           HALLWAY

           Grace SPRINTS down the hallway, rounds the corner to race 
           down the stairs, then...
           She freezes.

           At the bottom of the stairs is Paul Sheridan, waiting 
           patiently. 

           Shit.

           Grace stands frozen, halfway down the stairway.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Hey, kiddo.

                                 GRACE
                             (playing dumb)
                        Paul, what are you doing here?

           Nothing from Paul.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Jay’s taking a nap.  I thought I’d 
                        go for a walk.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Is that right?

           Grace nods - he knows she knows, and she knows he knows.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re sick, Grace.

                                 GRACE
                        I know what I heard.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        You don’t know anything.  Nobody 
                        knows anything.

           A NOISE from the top of the stairs causes Grace to whip 
           around, where she sees...

           Aide #2 moving into place at the top of the stairwell.  Grace 
           is blocked in from both sides.

           Paul starts up the steps toward Grace.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You need to rest.

                                 GRACE
                        You won’t get away with this.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Your mind is playing tricks on you.
           Paul gently takes the papers, photos from her.   

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for bringing these to my 
                        attention, Grace.

           He takes a step closer.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Scared little girl.

           Paul is now only inches away from Grace.  She tenses, unsure 
           what comes next.  Then...

           A hand wraps around Grace from behind.  Aide #2 presses a 
           white cloth over her mouth.  Within seconds, she’s out cold.  

           EXT. FISHING BOAT - DAY

           A LOBSTERMAN and his STERNMAN approach Crane Island.  Up 
           ahead, they see Aide #1 waiting for them on the dock.

           EXT. DOCK - MOMENTS LATER

           The boat reaches the dock.  Aide #1 greets them.

                                 LOBSTERMAN
                        We got a call about a pick-up.  
                        Something about a woman in 
                        distress.

                                 AIDE #1
                        Right, that was for my boss’s wife.  
                        She woke up real sick this morning.  
                        Turns out it was just some bad cod.

                                 LOBSTERMAN
                        She around?

                                 AIDE #1
                        She’s sleeping it off.  Big false 
                        alarm.  

           The lobsterman looks to his sternman, then:

                                 LOBSTERMAN
                        Maybe I should talk to her.  We’re 
                        the only boat in the area.  Don’t 
                        want her stuck out here if she’s 
                        getting worse...

                                 AIDE #1
                        It’s mostly cleared up at this 
                        point.  Just needs her rest.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 AIDE #1 (CONT'D)
                        Our pick-up is scheduled for 
                        tomorrow morning anyway, so won’t 
                        be long before she’s back on the 
                        mainland.  

           The lobsterman considers, unsure of what to do.  

                                 AIDE #1 (CONT’D)
                        Between you and me, she’s a bit of 
                        a pill.  Lotta drama.  This sorta 
                        thing happens all the time.

           The lobsterman smiles politely, but he’s not sold yet.

           Aide #1 fishes in his pocket, produces a stack of bills.

                                 AIDE #1 (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate your making the trip 
                        out.  So does my boss.

           The aide places the bills in the lobsterman’s shirt pocket.

                                 AIDE #1 (CONT’D)
                        For your time...

           The lobsterman hangs for a beat, then returns to the 
           controls.

           Aide #1 gives them a gentle push off the dock, waves as they 
           take off into the open ocean.

           OVER BLACK:

           We hear DUCT TAPE STRIPS being pulled, aggressively wrapped.

           INT. BASEMENT - DAY

           CLOSE ON Grace’s hands, duct tape being wrapped around them.

           The damp basement is almost pitch black, save for the cracks 
           of daylight seeping through.  Grace sits in a chair in the 
           middle of the space.

           Aide #2 finishes securing her hands, moves in front of her.

                                 GRACE
                        Please, don’t, don’t--

           Aide #2 slaps a piece of tape over her mouth, silencing her.  

           Grace tries to scream but can only manage MUFFLED GRUNTS.

           Aide #2 heads up the stairs to exit the basement, closing the 
           door behind him.  Grace is left alone in the dark.
           EXT. OCEAN - EVENING

           A view of isolated Crane Island as the last light of day 
           disappears over the horizon.  

           Night is rapidly approaching.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ON JAY, lying naked on the floor.  He’s been out for hours.  
           Slowly, he comes to.

           Groggily scanning the room, Jay is surprised to see Paul 
           sitting on the bed.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        For a second I thought she killed 
                        you.

                                 JAY
                        Where is she?

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        That’s what I need to talk to you 
                        about.  Drink this.

           Paul hands him a glass.  Jay eyes it suspiciously.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s just water.

           Jay drinks.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You know, when you got Blake’s 
                        concession call last week, I 
                        thought about the day we met.  You 
                        came into my office - no 
                        experience, got out of BC with 
                        what, 2.6 GPA?  But I could tell  
                        right away that you were a 
                        survivor.  Pulled yourself up from 
                        nothing.  I knew you’d do whatever 
                        it’d take to claw out of the shit-
                        hole you came from.  That’s what 
                        all successful politicians have in 
                        common.  Not policy, not charisma, 
                        not even money.  Survival.  That’s 
                        what I saw in you.

                                 JAY
                        What’s going to happen to Grace?
                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I’m getting to that.

           Jay’s eyes gloss over, starting to tear up.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re still in a good spot here, 
                        Jay.  You've got the backing of the 
                        most powerful lobbying group in the 
                        nation.  You wouldn’t believe how 
                        cleanly they can make all this 
                        disappear.  But I gotta be able to 
                        assure them that you're still our 
                        guy.  What happens next can go very 
                        quickly, very painlessly - well, 
                        relatively painlessly.  Point is, 
                        this can all wrap up nice and neat, 
                        but it has to come from you.

           Jay is now openly crying, knowing what’s being asked of him.

           INT. BASEMENT - SAME

           Paul and Jay’s conversation plays over the image of Grace 
           tied to the chair, trying in vain to pull free.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (V.O.)
                        Hermit caretaker alone on the 
                        island six months out of the year. 
                        Couldn’t ask for a better fall man.

                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        I can’t do this.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (V.O.)
                        This is what survival means for 
                        you, right here, in this moment.  
                        Path number one: you and Grace die 
                        on this island tonight in one of 
                        the most infamous murder-suicides 
                        in American history.  Path number 
                        two: Grace is the tragic victim of 
                        a violent attack from a deranged 
                        stranger who had a grudge against 
                        her family.  You go on to have a 
                        long, distinguished career, 
                        dedicating your public service to 
                        your lost love.  A man driven by 
                        tragedy to build a better world.
                             (reflects)
                        Hell, that’s good.  That man could 
                        be president one day, story like 
                        that.
                                 JAY (V.O.)
                        She never was losing her mind, was 
                        she?  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (V.O.)
                        She’s got some pretty fucked up 
                        daddy issues.  I just pushed her 
                        along...

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. KENNEDY LIBRARY - TERRACE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

           Paul and Grace’s conversation on the terrace.  Paul hands her 
           the GLASS OF WATER.

           FLASH TO moments later as Grace downs the water.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Malta’s put tens of millions of 
                        dollars into this election.  Did 
                        you really think they were going to 
                        let her go on her opioid crusade 
                        while they’re looking at possible 
                        jail time?  She became a liability 
                        the second her brother OD’d.

                                 JAY
                        You were never going to let her 
                        out, were you?  You were going to 
                        put her away forever.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I was trying to protect her.  If 
                        we’d gotten her to the institute, 
                        everything would have been taken 
                        care of, but that ship has sailed.  
                        Local P.D. on our payroll has been 
                        briefed on the situation.  They’ll 
                        be out first thing in the morning 
                        to tie everything up, but this next 
                        part has to be you.  

                                 JAY
                        Politicians don’t kill people.

           Paul holds a look on Jay crying, then... 

           SLAPS him across the face.
                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        You can bitch and cry if you want, 
                        but do not insult my intelligence.  
                        We’re ten miles from 
                        Chappaquiddick.  You tell Mary Jo 
                        Kopechne that politicians don’t 
                        kill people.  Ted Kennedy was a 
                        Senator for forty years after that, 
                        would have been president if he 
                        hadn’t botched the cover-up.  
                        ‘Politicians don’t kill people’ - 
                        give me a fucking break.

           Paul takes a moment to come down from the rant.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        I really wanted it to be you.  I 
                        wanted to see how far you could 
                        take this thing.  But don’t think 
                        for one second that you’re the only 
                        one that’s come into my office.  
                        Don’t think you can’t be replaced 
                        the instant you stop being a 
                        survivor.  Malta’s got too much at 
                        stake to only bet one horse.  

           Paul stands over Jay, extends his hand.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        The Byrnes legacy ends here tonight 
                        with Grace, one way or another.  
                        But the Connors legacy...

           Jay looks Paul’s extended hand for a long beat, then reaches 
           out, accepts Paul’s help getting up.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Come with me.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

           Paul leads Jay (now wearing a bathrobe) down the stairs.  

           Paul’s aides wait by the foot of the stairs.  Aide #1 holds a 
           gun by his side.

           Jay slows as he sees the gun.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Come on, Jay.  This will all be 
                        over soon.

           Aide #1 holds out the gun.  Jay stares at it, then grabs it.  
           He studies the gun, feels the weight of it in his hand.
                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Atta boy.

                                 JAY
                        Where is she?

           Paul points downward, indicating the basement.

           Jay moves to a door by the foot of the stairs, swings it open 
           to reveal the stairs to the basement.  

           Jay stands in the open doorway.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Need me to go down there with you?

           Jay gives him a glare - that’s a ‘no.’

           INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Grace sits in darkness.

           TAP, TAP, TAP - each step echoes as Jay makes his way down 
           the hardwood stairs.

           When Jay appears and Grace sees the gun in his hand, she 
           begins to cry.

           Jay looks at her, his eyes glossed.

                                 JAY
                        It was never supposed to go this 
                        way.  I never wanted to hurt you.  

           With her mouth taped, Grace can only listen.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure you think it was all a 
                        lie.  I really did care for you.  I 
                        thought we could be together.  I 
                        was wrong.  

           Jay steps closer and closer, now only a foot away.  

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I need you to know that I’m sorry.  
                        I am sorry. 

           Grace stares at the gun in Jay’s hand.  Slowly, he raises it.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Grace.

           Grace closes her eyes, prepared for the end.
           OVER BLACK:

           BOOOOOOM!

           Silence.  Then...

           A surprising sound: GRACE’S BREATHING.

           She’s still alive.

           Grace opens her eyes and sees...

           Jay holding the gun, smoke coming from the barrel.  He holds 
           a finger to his mouth, directing Grace to be quiet.  

           He reaches behind her and unbinds her hands.  

           Grace sits frozen in the chair, unsure of what the hell is 
           going on.

           Jay nods to a 2’x2’ siding door in the wall - the entrance to 
           the dumbwaiter.  

           Grace stands, looks her husband in the eye - their look says 
           all that can be said.

           Jay holds out the gun.  It takes Grace a beat to realize he 
           is handing it to her.  

           She accepts the gun, then moves to the dumbwaiter entrance.  
           She quietly climbs inside.  

           Jay stands alone in darkness, then heads to the stairs.

           DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Jay reaches the top of the stairs.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Is it done?

           Jay nods.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the gun?

                                 JAY
                        I left it down there.

           Paul looks at him suspiciously, then gives a nod to his men.  
           They take off down the stairs.  

           ON PAUL, studying Jay.
           ON JAY, eyes locked in on Paul.

           The two men stand together in silence.  They wait.

           It feels like an eternity.

           Then...

                                 AIDE #1 (O.S.)
                        SHE’S GONE!!!

           In a flash, PAUL PULLS A GUN FROM HIS POCKET.  

           Jay SHOOTS forward, blocks Paul from raising the gun.  

           The two men struggle to gain leverage, eyes locked on each 
           other.  

           Then...

           Paul is able to swing the gun into position over Jay’s knee.  

           BANG!!!!

           Jay SCREAMS in pain as the bullet tears through his kneecap.  
           He goes crashing to the floor.

           Paul stands over him, collecting his breath.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        What a fucking mess.  You would 
                        have been president.

           Just as Paul raises the gun to blow Jay away... 

           JAY GRABS THE METAL LETTER OPENER OFF THE DRAWING ROOM TABLE, 
           THRUSTS IT INTO PAUL’S GUT.

           Paul CRIES OUT, the letter opener lodged deep in his stomach.  

           He BLASTS OFF three shots into Jay’s torso.

           BASEMENT - SAME

           Paul’s aides whip their FLASHLIGHTS around the darkened 
           basement, guns drawn. 

           They listen to the GUNSHOTS coming from above.  They exchange 
           looks, then resume their search.
           DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Both Jay and Paul are hobbled, but Jay is significantly worse 
           off.  He tries to crawl away, but he can barely drag himself 
           across the floor.

           Paul, in great pain, composes himself, steps forward.  

           He presses the barrel against the back of Jay’s head.

           Jay holds still, knowing he is finished.  

           BANG!!!!

           PAUL BLASTS A BULLET THROUGH JAY’S SKULL.  

           Goodbye, Jay.

           BASEMENT - SAME

           Aide #1 scans his flashlight over the open dumbwaiter.   

                                 AIDE #1
                             (cueing Aide #2)
                        Go...

           Aide #2 moves to the dumbwaiter entrance.  He looks up to see 
           Grace two stories up, climbing through the narrow corridor.  

           As he takes aim, Grace tumbles through the upstairs opening.  

           BANG!  He fires a beat late.  She’s gone.

                                 AIDE #2
                        Missed her.

           Both men take off for the stairs.  

           DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Paul stands over Jay’s lifeless body as the aides reach the 
           top of the stairs.  

           The aides take in the visual of Jay’s corpse and Paul’s blood- 
           soaked shirt, the letter opener still lodged in his stomach.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Well...?

                                 AIDE #1
                        She’s upstairs.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Go get her.
           The men take off for the stairs.  Paul gingerly sits on the 
           couch, examines his wound. 

           He takes hold of the letter opener and in one motion YANKS it 
           out, GRUNTING in pain as he does.

           HALLWAY - SAME

           Reaching the upstairs hallway, the men hold for a beat.  Aide 
           #1 gives a “you go this way, I go that way,” nod.  

           The men separate, guns drawn.

           GRACE’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Grace lies on the floor under her childhood bed.  

           She listens to the CREAKING FLOORBOARDS as Paul’s aides move 
           through the hallway.

           HALLWAY

           As Aide #1 disappears into the master bedroom, Aide #2 
           continues down the hall in the direction of Grace’s room.  

           We TRACK with him as he opens a hallway closet, sees it’s 
           empty.  He continues on, reaches Grace’s room.

           Aide #2 pushes the door open and scans the room.  

           GRACE’S BEDROOM

           CLOSE ON GRACE, hidden under the bed.  She does her best to 
           control her heavy breathing, holding tight to the gun Jay 
           gave her.

           GRACE’S POV: she watches as Aide #2’s feet enter the bedroom.  
           The feet approach the bed, landing inches from Grace.

           Aide #2 looks around the seemingly empty room.  Eying the 
           bed, he kneels down to check underneath.

           GRACE’S POV: Aide #2’s knee touches down on the ground. 

           This is coming, and there’s nothing Grace can do to stop it.

           Grace steadies the gun in her hand, points it straight ahead.

           GRACE’S POV: Aide #2’s hand reaches down, pulls up the bed 
           skirt.

           Grace waits patiently, steady.

           GRACE’S POV: Aide #2 bends down to peer under the bed.  
           Not yet...  

           Not yet...

           Just as Aide #2’s face comes into sight...

           BANG!!!!

           Grace blasts him right between the eyes.  He crumples onto 
           the floor, lifeless.

           DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Paul, sitting on the couch bleeding heavily, listens to the 
           deafening silence.  He scans the ceiling for an indication of 
           what’s going on.

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Aide #1 stands frozen, also listening.

                                 AIDE #1
                        Hank...?  HANK...?

           Nothing.  Aide #1 races into the...

           HALLWAY

           He reaches the entrance to Grace’s bedroom, sees Aide #2’s 
           body on the floor.

                                 AIDE #1
                        Shit...

           Moving into the room, he WHIPS his gun around the door in 
           search of Grace - nothing.  

           In the back of the room, he spots an open closet. 

           ATTIC - SAME

           Grace scrambles up the ladder staircase that runs from the 
           closet of her bedroom to the attic.  

           Reaching the attic, Grace spins franticly, unsure of her next 
           move.

           She darts toward the window and looks out - too high to jump.

           GRACE’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Aide #1 pulls open the closet door, sees the ladder leading 
           upstairs.
           ATTIC - SAME

           Grace hears Aide #1 making his way up the ladder.  

           She slides open the window.  She begins to climb onto the 
           roof, then remembers something.

           She turns back, collects the noose rope she found earlier, 
           and carries it out onto the roof.

           A beat later, Aide #1 reaches the attic.

           EXT. ROOF - SAME

           Grace scales the slanted roof, struggling to keep her 
           balance.

           The weathered shingles slide underneath her feet.  

           Suddenly, she SLIPS.  

           She’s barely able to hang on to avoid the thirty foot drop to 
           the ground below.  

           The gun falls from her hand, sliding down and off the roof.

           Shit.

           Grace pulls herself up.  She ties the base of the rope around 
           the large weather vane, preparing to scale down.

           Just as she gets the rope tied...

           Aide #1 leans out the open window.  He draws his gun and 
           FIRES.

           Grace dives behind the roof gable.  She’s a beat late - the 
           bullet grazes her arm.  

           She CRIES OUT in pain.

           Aide #1 climbs out onto the roof.  

           Grace keeps her back pressed against the gable, hiding.  With 
           no gun, she’s a sitting duck.

           Aide #1 creeps closer and closer, reaches the corner of the 
           gable.  

           He gathers himself then...

           WHIPS AROUND the corner.  To his surprise, Grace isn’t there.  
           Grace silently creeps up behind him, having circled the 
           gable.  Aide #1 is oblivious.  

           IN ONE MOTION, GRACE TOSSES THE NOOSE AROUND HIS NECK AND 
           PUSHES HIM OFF THE LEDGE.

           Aide #1 goes FLYING toward the ground below.  

           Before he can even figure out what’s going on...

           The rope goes taught, snapping his neck - his body goes limp.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM - SAME

           Paul sits on the couch, completely spent.  Suddenly...

           Aide #1 comes CRASHING through the window, sending glass 
           everywhere.

           Paul JUMPS up, stunned.  

           He takes in Aide #1’s lifeless body swinging with the wind.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        What the fuck.

           Paul looks toward the upstairs, knowing he has to handle this 
           himself.  

           EXT. ROOF - SAME

           Grace looks down at the body hanging below her, working out 
           her next move.  

           She eyes the open window, considering returning inside.  She 
           thinks better of it.

           She takes hold of the rope, begins to scale down.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Paul reaches the upstairs, hobbled by his injury.  

           Limping through the hall, he arrives at Grace’s bedroom, 
           where he sees Aide #2 lying dead on the floor.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Jesus Christ.

           He spots the open closet door leading to the attic.
           EXT. ROOF - SAME

           Grace slides down the rope, her movement limited by the 
           injury to her arm.

           She hovers above Aide #1’s body.  Still a good height off the 
           ground, she has no choice but to scale the body on the way 
           down.

           INT. ATTIC

           Paul reaches the empty attic.  He scans the space, notices 
           the open window.

           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME

           Grace lets go of Aide #1’s body, lands on the ground below 
           with a THUMP.

           She looks into the house and sees... 

           JAY’S BODY on the floor.  

           She takes in the sight - a swirl of complicated emotions.  
           Then...

           She runs off the property at full speed.  

           INT. ATTIC

           Paul reaches the window and sees Grace racing off the 
           property, about to disappear behind a cluster of trees.  

           He patiently lines up a shot then...

           FIRES.

           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME

           The bullet CUTS through Grace’s hip.  

           She CRIES OUT in pain.

           It’s not a kill shot, but it’s sure to slow her down.

           INT. ATTIC

           Paul watches as Grace disappears behind the trees.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I got ya.
           EXT. BYRNES’ SUMMER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul makes his way to the spot where Grace disappeared.  He 
           uses a FLASHLIGHT to survey the ground below him.  

           He finds a SPLATTER OF BLOOD just past where Grace was hit.  
           Scanning the ground ahead, Paul spots a dribble of blood, 
           then another.

           He has his trail.

           EXT. ROAD - SAME

           Grace runs as fast as she can in the direction of the 
           lighthouse, the shot to her hip slowing her down.  

           She looks back for a sign of Paul, but sees nothing.  

           EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The swirling, rhythmic light illuminates the otherwise pitch-
           black sky.  

           Grace arrives at the lighthouse visibly weakened, her shirt 
           soaked through with blood.

           She pulls open the door to the lighthouse.

           INT. LIGHTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Grace spills inside, darts toward the radio.  Before she 
           makes the call, she notes something below the radio deck.  

           She bends down to check what it is, only to be greeted by...

           The stone-dead face of Bill McCabe.

           Grace jumps back in terror.  She takes a beat to gather her 
           breath, then moves to the radio to make a call.

                                 GRACE
                        Anyone, anyone out there, please 
                        help me.  They’re trying to kill 
                        me.  I’m on Crane Island and 
                        they’re trying to kill me.  

           Silence.  Is no one out there?

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        Please!!  Anybody!!!  I’ve been 
                        shot.  A man with a gun is trying 
                        to kill me!!!
           Still nothing.  Grace backs away from the radio to check 
           outside for signs of Paul.  

           Then...

                                 FISHERMAN (V.O.)
                        Is this a crank, over?

           Grace dives back to the radio.

                                 GRACE
                        No!  No, this is real.  My name is 
                        Grace Byrnes Connors.  There are 
                        men on the island who are trying to 
                        kill me.  My husband is dead.  
                        Please - you need to come right 
                        away.  

                                 FISHERMAN (V.O.)
                        I’m on the mainland, but I can be 
                        there in one hour.  I’ll notify the 
                        police and head out right away.

                                 GRACE
                        Thank you!  Thank you, thank you.  
                        Please hurry.

                                 FISHERMAN (V.O.)
                        Yes, ma’am.  Over and out.

           Grace looks outside, this time seeing Paul’s flashlight 
           cutting through the trees, headed toward the lighthouse.  

           Shit.

           It’s too late for Grace to run.  Her only option is to go up.

           Grace pulls McCabe’s body out from under the radio deck and 
           pushes it up against the lighthouse door - the best she can 
           do to lock it shut.

           Grace climbs the stairs to the second floor.

           EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - SAME

           Paul limps his way across the grass.  Grace’s blood trail 
           leads the way to the lighthouse.  

           Paul switches off the flashlight, continues ahead.  

           PAUL’S POV: Between swirls of light from the lighthouse, Paul 
           spots Grace arriving on the second floor.  
           INT. LIGHTHOUSE - SECOND STORY - SAME

           Grace peeks through the window, sees Paul approaching.

           EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - SAME

           Reaching the lighthouse, Paul pushes against the door.  It 
           doesn’t budge. 

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                             (calling out)
                        So you’re going to make me huff and 
                        puff, Grace?

           INT. LIGHTHOUSE - SECOND STORY - SAME

           INTERCUT

                                 GRACE
                             (calling back)
                        It’s all over.  I called it in over 
                        the radio.  The police are on their 
                        way.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        That’s a shame.  But I still have 
                        to come in there and kill you.  I 
                        promised some very powerful people 
                        I’d clean this up and that's a 
                        promise I have to keep.

           A tear falls down Grace’s cheek - it just won’t end.  

                                 GRACE
                        But there’s no point.  Jay is dead 
                        and... and you’re going to prison.  
                        The police know everything.

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        Nobody knows everything.  Nobody 
                        knows anything - it’s all just 
                        stories, like your father’s heart 
                        attack.  It’s not personal, Grace - 
                        it was never personal.  

                                 GRACE
                        I have a gun.  If you come in, I’ll 
                        shoot you.  

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I don’t think so, Grace.  If you 
                        had a gun, you would have shot me 
                        already.  I think you’re all alone 
                        in there - a scared little girl.  
           Grace remains silent - she knows he’s coming, and there’s 
           nothing she can do.

           Grace uses her good arm to pull herself up the ladder toward 
           the third floor. 

           Outside, Paul hauls back and THROWS his weight against the 
           door.  He GROANS in pain.  The door budges open slightly.  

           Again.  It budges a little more.  

           One more time - the door SWINGS OPEN enough for Paul to get 
           inside.

           Paul enters, sees the stairs heading to the second story.  He 
           holds for a beat, calls up:

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        Your father took something from me 
                        the day he off’d himself.  
                        Something that was owed to me.  I 
                        spent twenty years clawing to get 
                        it back.  Jay was my last chance.  

           Paul starts limping up the stairs, blood dripping from his 
           soaked shirt.  On his way:

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN (CONT’D)
                        I always looked after you, Grace.  
                        I had such hopes for you two...  
                        The next great American family. 
                        Then your brother went and fucked 
                        everything up, just like he always 
                        did.

           Paul reaches the...

           SECOND STORY

           Locked and loaded, Paul SPINS around looking for signs of 
           Grace - nothing.  

           THIRD STORY - SAME

           The space is filled by intervals of blinding white FLASHES 
           from the rotating Fresnel light, followed by total darkness.  

           Every three seconds: 

           FLASH... 

           FLASH... 

           FLASH...
           In between flashes, we can just make out... 

           Grace in the back of the space, curled up in a ball.  Her 
           eyes are closed, her breath steady - oddly calm.  

           This is a safe space for her.  

           SECOND STORY - SAME

           Paul spots the ladder to the third floor, which now has 
           splotches of Grace’s blood.  He calls up:

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I tried to get you somewhere safe, 
                        somewhere you would be protected.  
                        But you wouldn’t listen.  I tried 
                        to protect you!  Look where it got 
                        me...

           THIRD STORY - SAME

           ON GRACE, taking this in, waiting...

           SECOND STORY - SAME

                                 PAUL SHERIDAN
                        I take no joy in this, Grace.  I 
                        wish I could go back to that little 
                        girl, to protect her.  But you were 
                        born into tragedy, right from the 
                        start.  It was always going to end 
                        like this for you... one way or 
                        another.

           With that, Paul begins to climb.

           THIRD STORY - CONTINUOUS

           Paul emerges on his way up the ladder.  He’s ready to blow 
           Grace away, but he’s immediately blinded by a FLASH of light.  

           Paul tries to reset his eyes during the dark lull, but 
           another BLAST OF LIGHT throws him again.  

           On the next FLASH, Paul spots Grace across the space.  

           Then, darkness.

           Paul FIRES into the pitch black.  

           The following FLASH reveals that she’s no longer there.  

           Paul spins around in the dark.  
           Where is she?

           Paul tries to peer into the darkness, but he’s again blinded 
           by a piercing FLASH.  It’s a relentless barrage of light: 

           FLASH... 

           FLASH... 

           FLASH...  

           Then...

           Paul spots Grace’s silhouette moving behind the light.  

           He FIRES, but it’s like shooting at a ghost.  

           He FIRES AGAIN...

           And AGAIN...

           Frantically searching...  

           As he spins around, a FLASH illuminates...

           GRACE, only a foot away.  Before Paul can even register...

           GRACE CRACKS HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH A 2X4 BOARD!

           PAUL GOES DOWN.  

           His gun flies out of his hand.  

           Recovering, Paul claws in the dark for his gun.  Before he 
           can find it...

           THWACK!!  

           GRACE BASHES HIM IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BOARD.

           Paul is now totally dazed, almost knocked out.  

           The next FLASH reveals Paul’s gun on the floor.

           Grace DIVES for the gun.  Just as she collects it... 

           PAUL RIPS HER DOWN TO THE FLOOR!

           For a moment, we lose them in darkness.

           Then...

           FLASH: GRACE SQUIRMS UNDERNEATH PAUL AS HE TRIES TO PIN HER 
           DOWN. 
           FLASH: CLOSE ON THEIR HANDS AS THEY WRESTLE FOR CONTROL OF 
           THE GUN.

           FLASH: PAUL PRESSES HIS HAND AGAINST HER THROAT.

           FLASH: PAUL APPLIES HIS FULL FORCE INTO GRACE’S THROAT AS SHE 
           DESPERATELY GASPS FOR AIR.

           She’s overwhelmed by his force, powerless underneath him.

           Then...

           BAM, BAM, BAM!!!

           Three SHOTS ring out in the darkness.

           Silence.  

           FLASH: Paul lies on top of Grace, both perfectly still.  

           One of them must be done for, but who?

           Then...

           FLASH: Paul opens his mouth and blood pours out, spilling 
           onto Grace’s face.  

           Grace musters the last of her strength to push him off.

           OVERHEAD on Grace and Paul... 

           Lying peacefully side by side, illuminated by the methodical 
           FLASHES...

           Grace catching her breath and Paul done breathing for good.

           EXT. LIGHTHOUSE - DAWN

           The very beginnings of sunrise.  Beautiful morning light cast 
           out over the peaceful ocean water.

           We TRACK BACKWARD to reveal...

           Grace sitting on the rocks by the lighthouse, drenched in 
           blood and sweat.  She’s exhausted and freezing in the winter 
           air, but there’s a surprising strength to her.

           On the horizon, she spots TWO POLICE BOATS racing toward the 
           island - they’ll reach her soon.

           Reaching into her pocket, she finds something unexpected: a 
           LIGHTER and a few blood-soaked CIGARETTES.  She eyes the 
           cigarettes, then moves to light one.
           The cigarette is too drenched with blood to light.  Grace 
           tosses it, tries another - same problem.  She tries the last 
           cigarette, but it won’t take.  

           Shit.  

           Grace tosses the lighter and cigarette to the ground, lies 
           back onto the rocks to pass out.

           The police boats reach the shore, sirens blaring.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           OVER BLACK:

                                 DR. ERNST (V.O.)
                        Grace’s mind constructed an 
                        alternate reality, and when that 
                        reality became threatening, she 
                        reacted violently.  

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY

           Dr. Ernst speaks from a witness stand, addressing the 
           courtroom.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        She believed, in fact still 
                        believes, that she was acting in 
                        self-defense.  

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        Killing five people in their sleep?  

           STILL IMAGES: Crime scene photos of the deceased.  MCCABE, 
           the two AIDES, PAUL, and JAY - all shot dead execution style, 
           tucked into their beds.

                                 PROSECUTOR (V.O.)(CONT’D)
                        Her prints were on the murder 
                        weapon and she was the only person 
                        left alive on the island.  It’s 
                        hard to see how that could be an 
                        act of self defense.  

                                 DR. ERNST (V.O.)
                        I didn’t say it was self-defense - 
                        I said she saw it that way.  Her 
                        mind convinced her it was. 

                                 PROSECUTOR (V.O.)
                        Her mind convinced her...?

           Back in the courtroom, Ernst struggles to clarify her point.
                                 DR. ERNST
                        Is this real?

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        Excuse me?

                                 DR. ERNST
                        This conversation - are we really 
                        having it.

                                 PROSECUTOR
                             (going along with it)
                        Yes.

                                 DR. ERNST
                        How do you know?
                             (not waiting for an 
                              answer)
                        Because you perceive it - because 
                        your mind tells you it’s real.  
                        Even though Grace imagined that she 
                        was in danger, it was real to her.  
                        That’s mental illness.  

                                 PROSECUTOR
                        So what are you advocating?

           EXT. BAKER'S ISLAND - DAY

           AERIAL VIEW - a straight down overhead shot of a remote 
           island with imposing concrete structures and expansive lawns.

                                 DR. ERNST (V.O.)
                        It is my opinion that Grace is 
                        criminally insane - that she needs 
                        to be institutionalized 
                        indefinitely, possibly for the rest 
                        of her life.  

           We’re looking at the BAKER'S ISLAND ASYLUM FOR THE CRIMINALLY 
           INSANE.  

           We PUSH IN to see PATIENTS (inmates) roaming the lawns under 
           strict supervision.  

                                 DR. ERNST (V.O.)
                        My hope is that under my 
                        supervision, we can treat her.  We 
                        can make her better.
           INT. BAKER'S ISLAND INSANE ASSYLUM - DAY

           INMATES (heavily drugged) roam the hall, shackled.  It’s 
           dark, damp, depressing, much like the assylum Grace’s mother 
           was in.  

           We TRACK DOWN THE HALLWAY before PANNING TO...

           A vacant administrative desk.  A tube TV behind the desk 
           plays local news.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...Governor-Elect Steve Blake 
                        dedicated the monument today in 
                        Connor’s home town of Dorchester.

           TV: STEVE BLAKE (Jay’s primary competitor we saw at the 
           Kennedy Center) addresses a small crowd.

                                 GOVERNOR-ELECT BLAKE
                        Jay Connors was a great politician, 
                        and an even better man.  The tragic 
                        circumstances of Jay’s death only 
                        reinforce the importance of an 
                        issue that Jay cared deeply about: 
                        the advancement of the 
                        pharmaceutical industry in this 
                        state.  If our mental health 
                        professionals had the 
                        infrastructure and freedom to 
                        diagnose Grace Byrnes Connor’s 
                        mental illness in time and get her 
                        the medication she so desperately 
                        needed, Jay and the other victims 
                        would be with us today.  That’s why 
                        my first act as Governor will be 
                        providing research and development 
                        funds to find new treatments 
                        through the Prescription Access and 
                        Medical Innovation act, which I 
                        will be calling “Jay’s Bill.”

           TV: Applause from the crowd.  

           PUSHING PAST the desk, we see a familiar face outside...

           EXT. BAKER'S ISLAND INSANE ASSYLUM - SAME

           Grace sits on a bench in the lawn, looking much like RP 
           McMurphy post-lobotomy.  

           She’s chained to the bench, but appears to be in no shape to 
           make a run for it. 
           Nearby inmates roam the grounds - some RANT about government 
           conspiracies, brainwashing, Armageddon, etc.

           Grace reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of CIGARETTES 
           and a LIGHTER.  She tries to light the cigarette, but her 
           motor skills are shot.  

           After several failed attempts...

           A hand enters frame with a lit match, lighting the cigarette.

           Grace takes a long, satisfying drag.

                                 GRACE
                        Thank you.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        You’re welcome, Grace.

           We know that voice... but where have we heard it?

           Grace looks up and sees a MAN standing over her.  

           We recognize those ghostly deep-set eyes.

           It’s the man she saw wearing the three-piece suit on the 
           island, now wearing an orderly’s uniform.

           The man blows out the match and walks away.

           Grace watches him, her mind racing (to the extent it can race 
           in her state).

                                 GRACE
                        I know him...
                             (louder)
                        I know him!  That’s the man from 
                        the island!  He was dressed as my 
                        father...

           Grace stands, trying to get someone, anyone’s attention.  She 
           pulls against her chains, but doesn’t get far.

                                 GRACE (CONT’D)
                        I know him!!!  That man!  He’s the 
                        man from the island!!!  HE WAS 
                        THERE!!!  HE WAS THERE!!!!

           The man casually continues on, joining a group of orderlies - 
           nobody notices or cares.  

           Grace’s words are drowned out by similar cries from fellow 
           inmates...
           Lost in the insanity.

           As Grace continues to CALL OUT in vain...

           We PULL UP AND OUT...

           Higher and higher...

           Showing the isolated island from above. 

           Grace’s personal hell.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
