                                    Greg Kalleres
           INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT. EVENING.

           We hear the SHOWER as we MOVE through a warm, stylish 
           apartment in some newly gentrified area of Brooklyn.  

           We PASS an artfully designed Star Trek poster in French...

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        So, do you think we say something?!

           Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves...hip vintage lamps...A New Yorker...

                                 LIZ (O.C.)
                        About what? 

           A glass-framed poster of the movie Vertigo...a desk, laptop... 
           ..a stack of DVD screeners.

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        Tonight! I mean! Do we mention it 
                        or just sort of...take their cue?! 

           An iPad charging next to an iPhone charging next to an iPod...

                                 LIZ (O.C.)
                        Well, we have to say something! We 
                        barely saw them at the funeral. 

           The SHOWER stops as we PASS an award from the National 
           Critics Association to “James R. Roe” to land on –

           JAMES ROE in the flesh, 40, entering from the bathroom in a 
           towel. He’s intelligent and likeable but insecure about both 
           of those things. A sort of self-hating hipster. 

                                 JAMES
                        No, I know, it’s just...maybe they 
                        don’t wanna talk about it.  

           LIZ ROE, 40, sharp and self-possessed with an approachable 
           beauty and ironic smile, contemplates her outfit in the mirror. 

                                 LIZ
                        You’re leaking. 

           James steps back into the bathroom to dry off. 

                                 JAMES
                        It’s just – you and Christina 
                        aren’t really that close anymore. 

           We hear the automated voice of “ALEXA,” their AMAZON ECHO.
                                 ALEXA
                        “I’m sorry, I did not understand 
                        the question --” 

                                 JAMES
                         -- Alexa! No!

                                 LIZ
                        Well, we can’t not mention it. 
                        We'll just ask how they’re doing, 
                        say “we're here for you” and...you 
                        know.

                                 JAMES
                        Can I say that? 

                                 LIZ
                        What? 

                                 JAMES
                        “We’re here for you.” Can I use 
                        that? 

           She looks at him, not sure if he’s serious. He is. 

                                 LIZ
                        Sure. 

           Satisfied, he heads back into the bathroom.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BROOKLYN WINE STORE. LATER. 

           James and Liz exit the wine store with a bottle.

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t think I’d say that. “We're 
                        here for you.” I mean, it sounds 
                        good when you say it but from me it 
                        sounds forced.
                             (he tries it)
                        “We’re here for you.” “We’re here 
                        for you.” “We are both here f --”

                                 LIZ
                        Please stop doing that. 

                                 JAMES
                        Sorry. I’m just really bad at this 
                        kinda thing. Always feels like I’m 
                        talking to a celebrity.  
                                 LIZ
                             (chuckling)
                        What? 

                                 JAMES
                        You know, it’s like they have this 
                        big important thing and I'm just a 
                        babbling idiot who doesn't get it.   

                                 LIZ
                        You were great when my Dad died.  

                                 JAMES
                        That's because my brother’s wife  
                        died the year before. I still had 
                        “celebrity” status. But this? 
                        Losing a child? The way they did? I 
                        mean, Jesus, what do you say to 
                        that? “I know what you're feeling?” 
                        I don't know what they're feeling!  

                                 LIZ
                        No, you say...“we can't possibly 
                        understand what you’re going 
                        through.”

                                 JAMES
                        That’s good. Are you gonna use that? 

           She looks at him as if she’s never seen this side of him. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM. LATER. 

           James and Liz sit waiting for the train. Eyes glued to their 
           phones. A WOMAN sleeps beside them. A silent moment passes. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        So, what are you gonna say?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t know. 

           James looks back at his phone a moment. But then -- 

                                 JAMES
                        Are you gonna bring it up right 
                        away or wait?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t know! 
                                 JAMES
                        I think maybe we do it right away. 
                        You know, just nip it in the bud. 

                                 LIZ
                             (sarcastic)
                        So, what, we walk in and 
                        immediately say: ”Hi guys, we can’t 
                        possibly know what you’re going 
                        through?!”

                                 JAMES
                        I thought that was my line.

                                 LIZ
                        Why are you being all Woody Alleny 
                        about this? 

                                 JAMES
                        I’m not being Woody Alleny -- ! 

                                 LIZ
                        Look, they called us. They 
                        obviously need to reconnect with 
                        old friends right now. So just -- 
                        be normal.

                                 JAMES
                             (nods, then...)
                        Does my shirt smell weird? 

                                 LIZ
                             (sniffs)
                        No. Wait. Yes. What is that? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY. LATER.

           James and Liz stand on a crowded subway. 

                                 JAMES
                        How’s that a comfort? “I can't 
                        possibly understand what you're 
                        going through?” You're basically 
                        saying they're completely alone. 

                                 LIZ
                        People like to feel that their pain 
                        is unique. 

                                 JAMES
                        I thought people like to feel like 
                        you understand. 
                                 LIZ
                        They like to feel like you 
                        understand that they’re dealing 
                        with something you can’t possibly 
                        relate to.

           James nods, confused. Then sees a WEIRD GUY staring at him. 

                                 JAMES
                        Mike doesn’t even like me. 

                                 LIZ
                        That’s not true. 

                                 JAMES
                        No, because, remember? I made that 
                        joke about Desert Storm and now he 
                        thinks I’m like some liberal elite 
                        prick. 

                                 LIZ
                        He was a Navy Seal. I promise he 
                        doesn’t think you’re “elite” in any 
                        way. 

           WEIRD GUY chuckles. James looks at him and he stops. Then -- 

                                 JAMES
                        Have you read his book yet?

                                 LIZ
                        No. Shit. Have you? 

           James gives a “You’re kidding, right?” look. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING. LATER.

           James and Liz wait for the elevator in a fancy midtown 
           doorman apartment building. 

                                 JAMES
                        What if I say that we know someone 
                        this happened to?

                                 LIZ
                        Who? 

           DING. They get on the -- 

           ELEVATOR. CONTINUOUS. 
                                 JAMES
                        No one. Just seems more comforting. 

                                 LIZ
                        You wanna lie to them!?

           The doors close.

                                 JAMES
                        Well, I need some footing here! 
                        Everything I say is gonna sound 
                        stupid! “Hey, you have Boggle, 
                        that’s cool.” “Yeah, well, my 
                        daughter was hit by a drunk driver 
                        and died 2 days later! Now what do 
                        you think of your fucking Boggle!?” 

                                 LIZ
                        Jesus, James, then talk about work!

                                 JAMES
                        Great, why don’t I ask Mike what it 
                        was like to kill people in Iraq; 
                        that should lighten the mood.    

                                 LIZ
                        Then talk about your work!   

                                 JAMES
                        Film reviews? They don’t even go to 
                        the movies!

                                 LIZ
                        It’s Mike and Christina for God sake 
                        -- talk about your dick! Who cares! 

           Suddenly they both begin laughing like idiots. This is the 
           essence of them. This moment. And we can’t help but like it.   

                                 JAMES
                        Fine; I’ll talk about my dick, but 
                        you bring it up this time.  

           Doors OPEN. They step into the -- 

           HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS.  

           James gently grabs her arm to stop her.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. What are you gonna say?

           Liz sighs, relenting. 
                                 LIZ
                        I don’t know, probably just...I’m 
                        sorry for your loss. And...I know 
                        we’re not as close as we used to be 
                        but we still consider you our good 
                        friends. I wish I had the words to 
                        take this pain away but I don’t. I 
                        know that what you’re going through 
                        is difficult, I can’t imagine how 
                        much, but I just wanna say, I’m here. 
                        To talk about it, or not talk about 
                        it or not talk about anything.   

           He stares at her, incredulously. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 JAMES
                        You totally fucked me  

           She chuckles as they walk to the door.

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        No wonder you want me to say my 
                        stupid thing about being “here   
                        for you.”

           Liz BUZZES the doorbell. They wait. And wait. They begin to 
           wonder, do we have the right place?  Suddenly -- 

           The door opens! They smile. Their smiles die when they see --

           MIKE KRILL, 39, black, ruggedly attractive and very sincere -- 
           with a thin scar over his eye. He’s panicked, streaming sweat; 
           shirt unbuttoned.    

                                 MIKE
                        It’s Chris! She’s got a knife! I 
                        think she’s gonna hurt herself! 

           He rushes back in and leaves the door open for them. 

           REVERSE ANGLE ON: James and Liz -- frozen stiff. Speechless. 

           INT. BEDROOM. SECONDS LATER. 

           Liz and James enter, nervously. It’s a wreck. Clothes, a       
           smashed vase, picture frames broken on the floor. 

                                 MIKE (O.C.)
                        Baby? Chris, please, Honey, open 
                        the door!    
           Mike sits on the floor speaking to his wife through the 
           bathroom door. The tension is thick and real. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Open the door, baby. C’mon. It’s me. 
                        Please, honey. 

           Liz and James look totally uncomfortable.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Christina! Damnit, baby, talk to me! 

           Then, through the door we hear...

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        I... can’t do this...

                                 MIKE
                        Hey! Hey! Yes you can! You hear me?  
                        And I’m right here. Okay? And I 
                        know what you’re feeling and I’m 
                        not gonna let you do this alone. 
                        You understand? Chris?  
                             (silence, concern)
                        Christina?!

           James musters some courage and leans toward the door -- 

                                 JAMES
                        You can do it, Chris! 

                                 MIKE
                        ‘The fuck are you doing, man?!! 

           Mike glares at James, who recoils, terrified. 

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        Who was that?! 

                                 MIKE
                        It was just James, Honey. James and 
                        Liz are here, remember? 

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        Oh, God! Oh God, they’re here? 

                                 JAMES
                             (whispers to Mike)
                        I’m sorry -- 

                                 MIKE
                        It's okay; they just wanna help! 
                                 JAMES
                        We just wanna help, Chris! 

                                 MIKE
                        Will you SHUT the FUCK UP!!

                                 JAMES
                             (totally stressed)
                        Should we go? We should go. 

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        Liz?! Liz are you there? 

           James and Mike turn to Liz who is still speechless; paralyzed.  

                                 JAMES
                        Hon? 

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                             (through tears)
                        Oh God, Liz, I want her back. I 
                        want her back so bad... 

           Liz is paralyzed by the enormity of the pain in front of her.

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR) (CONT’D)
                        Liz? Are you there? 

           Panicked, James finally blurts out --

                                 JAMES
                        She went to the bathroom!

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        She what? 

                                 MIKE
                        Listen, honey, whatever you're 
                        thinking about doing...

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        ...Did you say she went to the 
                        bathroom? 

                                 MIKE
                        She'll be back -- 

                                 JAMES
                         -- Yeah she just really had to go! 

                                 LIZ
                             (not thinking)
                        It was something she ate! 
           Mike and James shoot her a bewildered look.

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        Liz?? 

           Liz suddenly realizes what she just did. 

                                 LIZ
                        Y-yes?

                                 JAMES
                             (whispers to Mike)
                        Maybe we should call the police?

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        DON'T YOU FUCKING CALL THE FUCKING 
                        COPS YOU SONOFABITCH!!

                                 JAMES
                             (tense as hell)
                        She’s got great hearing. 

                                 MIKE
                        Christina, baby, come out. Will 
                        you? Please? Just -- come out. 

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        Liz?

                                 LIZ
                             (nervous)
                        I’m here.  

                                 CHRISTINA (THROUGH DOOR)
                        Why Katie?  Why my little girl?  

           Liz looks at James and Mike, terrified to say the wrong thing. 

                                 LIZ
                        I don't know. 
                             (awkward beat)
                        I...maybe...maybe sometimes there 
                        are no answers. 
                             (another)
                        Maybe sometimes we ask questions 
                        and...we don't even know what we're 
                        really asking. You know? Are we 
                        asking...if there’s a God? 

           James looks at her, concerned. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Or for someone to blame? Or, or -- 
                        to punish? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        And if we got an answer, some 
                        concrete...explanation -- would it 
                        even help? Or would it just 
                        trivialize the enormity of your 
                        loss? Some...idiotic reason up 
                        against all this real...stuff. Your 
                        pain is your own. And no one answer 
                        can satisfy that. There’s only the 
                        knowledge that...you still have 
                        someone to share it with. Someone 
                        who loves you. And needs you. 

           Mike watches Liz, transfixed.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        And every day that special, unique 
                        pain of yours will become duller. 
                        And the strength you’ve gained from 
                        each other...will be answer enough.  

           James watches his wife, impressed.  Then we hear – 

           The door unlock.  Mike stands. The door opens and CHRISTINA  
           KRILL, 40, white, stands tear-streaked in her robe, knife at her 
           side. She’s small, compact with a young face and deeply sad eyes.   

           Mike slowly removes the knife from her grip. And hugs her. 

           They hold each other with everything they are. It's beautiful 
           and sad and real and bigger than anything. And then -- 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Where's Liz? 

           James realizes he’s standing alone. No Liz beside him. 

                                 JAMES
                        She went to the bathroom. Again.
                             (beat)
                        But she said to tell you...“we’re 
                        here for you.” 

           He smiles awkwardly. He knows he said it wrong. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                             “Our Condolences”
           SUPER:        “What is important pain?”

           INT. SUBWAY CAR. LATER THAT NIGHT.

           James and Liz sit on the subway. Silent. Liz still shaken up. 

                                 JAMES
                             (Tries a joke)
                        Well, next time I think we should 
                        have them over to our place.  

           She doesn’t react. He considers trying again. But wisely passes. 

           INT. JAMES AND LIZ'S APARTMENT. LATER. 

           Liz enters and rushes into the bedroom. James follows. 

                                 JAMES
                        Hey -- wait -- Liz --?! 

           He follows her into the -- 

           BEDROOM -- 

           Where Liz, highly agitated, struggles to change her clothes. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Okay; I understand you’re upset. 
                        They’re going through a tough... 
                        you know! But you were incredible 
                        tonight! All those things you said? 
                        I mean, you saved the day! 

           She turns to him, tears in her eyes. 

                                 LIZ
                        I bullshitted! 

                                 JAMES
                             (confused beat)
                        You mean...? What do you mean?

                                 LIZ
                        I mean, it was a lie! All of it. I 
                        don’t know what she’s feeling; how 
                        could I? I’ve never felt anything 
                        like that! 

                                 JAMES
                             (still confused)
                        Okay.
                                 LIZ
                        They lost their child, James! Do 
                        you understand? Their daughter is 
                        dead! And we’re standing there with 
                        a stupid bottle of wine and she’s 
                        got a knife! And she’s hurting so 
                        much and it’s so – real! And, and 
                        big! And I’m just a, a, a -- dwarf 
                        next to it!  

                                 JAMES
                        And a mute. For a while. 
                             (Bad joke)
                        Sorry, that was -- 

           She storms past him. He follows her back into the -- 

           LIVING ROOM

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Honey, I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about. You’ve felt pain 
                        before. 

                                 LIZ
                        Not important pain!

                                 JAMES
                        “Important pain --”?

                                 LIZ
                        Important pain! Real pain, like 
                        that!

                                 JAMES
                        What about when your Dad died? That 
                        was...”important.”

                                 LIZ
                        It was my Dad! Dad’s die! 

                                 JAMES
                        Okay, well, what about your cousin? 
                        Sarah? That really fucked you up. 

                                 LIZ
                        Not really! I never even liked her!

           James is totally stopped by this. 

                                 JAMES
                        But you seemed so upset.

                                 LIZ
                        Point is, you were right! I’m just 
                        a babbling idiot who doesn’t get 
                        it. And that’s the thing with this! 
                        You know, we have these jobs, 
                        right? And our smart friends, and 
                        we read these, these...

           She picks up a New Yorker magazine -- 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        ...smart things! “Oh, we’re so 
                        smart!” And we talk about books 
                        and, and movies but we’re just... 
                        selfish...idiots!

                                 JAMES
                        Wait, why am I a selfish idiot? 

                                 LIZ
                        And -- this! See this!? 

           She points to the designer Star Trek poster. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Why do we have a Star Trek poster 
                        in French!? Do you speak French? I 
                        don’t! It’s supposed to seem clever 
                        or ironic but it’s just bullshit! 

                                 JAMES
                        Okay; I think you’re having a panic 
                        attack. 

                                 LIZ
                        Yes! Good! We should all be having 
                        panic attacks! You especially! 

                                 JAMES
                        Me!? 

                                 LIZ
                        Yes! You! With your whole neurotic 
                        Ben Stiller act!
                                 JAMES
                        Ben Still -- ??! I thought I was 
                        Woody Allen. 

                                 LIZ
                        “Oh, I’m so bad at this, I feel 
                        like I’m talking to a celebrity!” 
                        It’s all a fucking act! 

                                 JAMES
                        No, it’s not; I’m actually that 
                        neurotic! 

           She gives up and turns to the bedroom -- 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Well, what do you want then!?!

           She turns back to him, like a child; lost, confused. 

                                 LIZ
                        I wanna tell Christina ”I don’t 
                        understand.”

                                 JAMES
                        You did. You said her pain was 
                        unique. Like you said.  

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah, but I was just saying that! 
                             (off his bewildered look)
                        I need her to know: I don’t get it! 
                        That we are less than them because 
                        we’ve never been where they are!  

                                 JAMES
                        We’re not less than them.

                                 LIZ
                        Yes we are!! 

                                 JAMES
                        Well, speak for yourself. I’ve had 
                        important pain.

                                 LIZ
                        What!? When?

                                 JAMES
                             (obviously)
                        Karen.

                                 LIZ
                        Kar -- ? That doesn’t count! 
                                 JAMES
                        What are you talking about?  

                                 LIZ
                        It’s your brother’s wife! It’s his 
                        pain! 

                                 JAMES
                        So? I can’t feel pain for my 
                        brother’s wife??  

                                 LIZ
                        No! You can’t! 

                                 JAMES
                        Look, just because you didn’t give 
                        a shit about your dad --  ! 

                                 LIZ
                        I gave a shit about my dad --!

                                 JAMES
                        Well, obviously not as much as I 
                        did about Karen!

                                 LIZ
                        I’m not even sure how much Edward 
                        cared about her! 

                                 JAMES
                        He wrote a book about her death!

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah, a comedy! It was a four part 
                        comic essay! The Times called it 
                        the “funniest book ever written 
                        about bone cancer!”

                                 JAMES
                        Well, that’s how he deals with pain!

                                 LIZ
                        THEN IT’S NOT THAT IMPORTANT!

                                 JAMES
                        WELL, IT'S FUCKING IMPORTANT TO ME!

           He turns away -- but then turns back to add -- 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        And let me just say! I like our 
                        French Star Trek poster! Okay?! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Because it says “I like Star Trek 
                        but I also like art and yet I have 
                        a sense of humor about it!!”  

           He goes into the bedroom -- slams the door!

                                                  JAMES (THROUGH DOOR)
           Alexa no!
                                              Shut the fuck up, Alexa!! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR. MORNING. 

           CLOSE ON: Liz’s face. Tense. Lips tight. Eyes focused. DING! 
           Doors Open. She takes a nervous breath and enters the --  

           HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS. 

           She walks slowly down the same hallway from last night. Her 
           lips move, almost imperceptibly, as if rehearsing. 

           She stops at the door.  Breathes.  BUZZES.  Suddenly -- BAM!  

                                 LIZ
                        Ah! FUCK!  

           Her focus is broken when a LITTLE BOY riding his BIG WHEEL, 
           nails her in the shin!  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        What the --? You little shit!

           She grabs her leg in pain, as he speeds off down the hall, 
           oblivious.  Just then, the door opens -- 

            -- It’s Mike. Considerably more put together than last 
           night. Nice shirt, jacket. He sees her grabbing her leg.  

                                 MIKE
                        Liz? 

           Liz straightens up; a little discombobulated.  

                                 LIZ
                        Oh, hey! Hi. 

                                 MIKE
                        You okay? 
                                 LIZ
                        Yeah, I just...got clipped by the 
                        kid from The Shining.   

           An awkward beat, as Mike doesn’t catch the reference. 

                                 MIKE
                        Come on in. 

           She smiles, awkwardly, and follows him in.

           INT. KITCHEN. MOMENTS LATER.

           CLOSE ON: The book, “LEADER OF MEN - A Seal’s Story” By 
           Michael Krill. An impressive photo of Mike on the cover in 
           his Navy Seal uniform. 

           CUT WIDE: to Liz staring guiltily at the book, as Mike makes 
           coffee.  She’s restless and the silence is uncomfortable. 

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t think I’ve heard you curse 
                        before. 

                                 LIZ
                        Curse? Did I? I’m sorry. 

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t apologize.

                                 LIZ
                        I do that. 

                                 MIKE
                        Apologize?

                                 LIZ
                        Curse. I mean, it’s bad. I should 
                        probably stop. My Dad always said, 
                        “women who curse...”  Shit, I can’t 
                        remember. 
                             (then)
                        Is Christina here?

           Mike turns to her. He’s a rock on the surface but there’s a  
           sense he’s stemming the floodgates by pure physical strength.    

                                 MIKE
                        No. She’s uh...she’s out right now.

                                 LIZ
                        Oh. Well...I just came to...
                                 MIKE
                        Actually, I’m glad you’re here. 
                        I...wanted to apologize for last 
                        night.  

                                 LIZ
                        Apologize? No. God. Me! I came to 
                        apologize.   

                                 MIKE
                        You? For what? 

                                 LIZ
                             (struggles)
                        I, I just --

                                 MIKE
                        No, hey. What you said. The way 
                        you...Honestly, I don’t know what 
                        woulda happened if you weren’t here. 

                                 LIZ
                        I just said what you would have.

                                 MIKE
                        No. No; you understood what she 
                        needed to hear. And I didn’t. I 
                        haven’t. For while.  

           Liz is discomfited by the praise.

                                 LIZ
                        Well, I shouldn’t’ve run off...

                                 MIKE
                        No; please. It was my idea for her 
                        to call you. It was obviously too 
                        soon. 
                             (Off her look)
                        You guys used to be so close. She 
                        always talked about the two of you 
                        in college, how much you used to 
                        laugh, I thought...I don’t know 
                        what I thought. 

           This hangs in the air for a bit. 

                                 LIZ
                        Did something happen last night? 
                        You know, to cause her to...?

                                 MIKE
                        No. Sometimes she just...has “bad 
                        nights.” 
           Liz accepts this but can tell there’s probably more to it. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Truth is, this wasn’t the first 
                        time.  There’ve been a couple of 
                        close calls over the last year. 
                        Pills, mostly. One time was...

           Mike stops; fighting back emotion. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, I didn’t mean to put this on 
                        you...

                                 LIZ
                        ...no, please...!

                                 MIKE
                        ...it’s just...I feel like you 
                        understand. You know?   

           Liz stares, awkwardly.  “I understand?”

                                 LIZ
                        Well, my dad died recently, so...

           She offers a strained smiled. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER BOX OFFICE. DAY. 

           A PIMPLY-PFACED TEENAGER hands a ticket and 3-D glasses 
           through the box office glass to -- James, who takes them and 
           walks into -- 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY. MOMENTS LATER.

           James stands at concessions. He’s done this many times. 

                                 JAMES
                        Medium popcorn, large water and 
                        Peanut M&Ms. And no I don’t want a 
                        large for only 50 cents more. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER. DAY. 

           James sits alone in his personal church: a dark, virtually 
           empty movie theater wearing 3-D glasses.  It’s a big budget 
           action movie.  Loud music.  Loud Sounds. Loud everything.  
           He ritualistically dumps his Peanut M&Ms into his popcorn, 
           and mixes it up until it’s perfect.  

           He then notices something a few rows up. Wait, is that...?    

           It’s Christina! Two rows up watching the same bombastic 
           spectacle. Or is she? Since she’s the only one in the theater 
           not wearing 3-D glasses. 

           James watches, curiously, as she stares off at seemingly nothing.  

           INT. MIKE AND CHRISTINA’S APARTMENT. DAY.

           Liz sits on the couch, feeling a little out of her depth. 
           Mike hands her a coffee and sits beside her. 

                                 MIKE
                        ...If I’d been paying attention I 
                        woulda seen that she’d stopped 
                        taking her medication months ago. 
                        Anyway. That’s where she is now. 
                        Her therapist.  

                                 LIZ
                             (A tried and true cliche)
                        “You can’t blame yourself.”

           Discomfited by this comment, Mike changes the subject.  

                                 MIKE
                        So, Chris said you guys don’t want 
                        kids -- is that right? 

                                 LIZ
                             (taken off guard)
                        Us? No! I mean. We’re not really 
                        “kid people.” Not that we don’t 
                        like other peoples’ kids, we just 
                        know we’d hate our own.

           She laughs. But then stops when she sees that doesn’t. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I should’ve called more. I 
                        should’ve done more after...

                                 MIKE
                        There’s nothing you could’ve done. 
                        Trust me. This is what she wants.  

                                 LIZ
                        What do you mean? 
           Mike takes a moment before answering.  

                                 MIKE
                        Ever since the accident, it’s like 
                        ... she wants to be sad. You know?

           Liz doesn’t know. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t fight it. She doesn’t 
                        ...fight.  
                             (beat)
                        Those two days in the hospital,  
                        while we waited to see if Katie was 
                        gonna make it. After the second 
                        surgery, Chris was so hopeful. The 
                        moment the doctor told us she was 
                        gone, I saw it in her face. It was 
                        like...she just let it wash over 
                        her.  Like she was drinking it in. 
                        And the worse she felt...the better 
                        she felt.  

           Liz can’t help but be struck by the vulnerability of this 
           strong, capable man.  She puts her hand on his.    

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen friends killed right in 
                        front of me. Their blood in my 
                        mouth. Good friends. Family. You’ve 
                        read my book, you know.  

                                 LIZ
                             (lying)
                        Of course.  

                                 MIKE
                        But you have to move on. Bury it. 
                        You have to finish the mission. You 
                        can’t quit just because...! 
                             (he stops himself)
                        I didn’t love our daughter any less 
                        because I won’t make her death my 
                        identity. 

           Mike unconsciously grips her hand. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t seen my wife in a year. I 
                        haven’t touched her in... I miss 
                        her too. But now I feel like I’ve 
                        lost them both.

           She puts her other hand on his, as his eyes glass over. 
                                 LIZ
                             (more confident)
                        I understand.

           He looks at her. His heart aching for something. Anything. He 
           strokes her hand. She smiles. Then raises his hand to her cheek.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                             (startled, awkward)
                        Oh...

           He touches her lips, as if involuntarily. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s -- okay.

           She pulls back, confused.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 LIZ
                        It’s okay. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m so sorry...

           He leans in and kisses her on the lips. She pulls away...

                                 LIZ
                        Mike...um...

                                 MIKE
                        Please just....please.

           He leans in and kisses her again. Gently. She lets him 
           because she doesn’t know what else to do.  Frozen. 

           He closes his eyes and drinks it in like water in the desert. 
           It’s not about sex -- but intimacy. Feeling something that 
           isn’t pain. He strokes her hair. Liz lets him. And for a 
           moment she feels it too. And it’s nice. Then suddenly --  

           Liz pulls away -- CRASH! Her head hits a lamp, knocks it over --! 

                                 LIZ
                        Oh! Shit! Sorry! 

           She stands up -- 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry -- 
                                 LIZ
                             (nervous rambling)
                        No, I’m sorry -- I broke your lamp!

           She picks up the lamp.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s okay; leave it. 

                                 LIZ
                        I’ll pay for this -- is this West 
                        Elm -- ?? Seems like West Elm. 

                                 MIKE
                        Liz, please...

                                 LIZ
                        Tell Chris I came -- or don’t --! 
                        or -- Okay! I have to go! I! okay! 

           She walks out of the apartment. Slams the door. 

           INT. HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS.

           Liz stands outside the door, shaking. She turns, startled, to see -

           The KID with the BIG WHEEL staring at her from the end of the 
           hall, ala “The Shining”.  Freaked out, she runs off.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER. DAY.

           As the end credits roll on screen, James watches Christina 
           get up from her seat, and turn up the aisle, rather quickly. 

           James pretends to reach for something so she won’t see him. 

           INT. MOVIE LOBBY. MOMENTS LATER. 

           James exits the theater. He tosses his popcorn in the trash 
           and his 3-D glasses in the dispenser. Then looks up to see –  

           Christina! She looks anxious, almost panicked to run into him. 

                                 JAMES
                             (feigning surprise)
                        Oh! Hey! 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        James...?  
                                 JAMES
                        Are you --? Did you see this too? 
                        That’s so funny! 
                             (awkward beat)
                        So, how are you? 

           James quickly realizes this is a dumbest question ever. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (anxiously)
                        I should go; you’re probably 
                        working.   

                                 JAMES
                        Work-- ? Oh. Yes. I mean, no, 
                        actually. I trashed this movie two 
                        weeks ago. It’s a horrible piece of 
                        shit but I’m sort of compelled by 
                        it. (then) Don’t tell anyone.       

           He chuckles. But stops when he sees the look on her face -- 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Chris? You okay? 

           She looks lost, desperate, on the verge. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I don’t know what I’m doing! 

                                 JAMES
                             (panicked)
                        Oh. Okay, okay, uh...!
                             (beat, absurdly)
                        You wanna...see it again? 

           She looks at him like it’s the dumbest... most perfect idea. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Okay...?

                                 JAMES
                        Okay! Actually, there’s an even 
                        shittier Superhero movie playing 
                        upstairs. 

           He puts a protective arm around her...

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I eviscerated it last week. You’ll 
                        love it. 

           ...and guides her upstairs.
           INT. CAFE. EVENING.

           James watches Christina stare into her coffee. She’s calmer 
           but still vulnerable.  He wants to say something...but what?

                                 JAMES
                        You know, my brother’s wife died. 

           Christina looks up at him, blankly.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Karen. Two years ago. Bone cancer. 
                        It was pretty horrible. 
                             (awkward beat)
                        She was in a lot of pain. For 
                        months. Doctors said they’d never 
                        seen someone in so much pain. It 
                        was like...non stop...pain. 

           Christina continues to stare, as if not sure how to react.   

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Edward was right beside her through 
                        the whole thing. It was very hard 
                        for him. For all of us. You know? 
                        To see her -- and him -- both of 
                        them! In so much.....pain. (then) I 
                        mean, obviously, it’s nothing like 
                        what you’re going through with, you 
                        know, but -- I guess I’m just 
                        saying if you wanna talk about it, 
                        I’m here. (Liz’s line:) “To talk 
                        about it. Or not talk about it. Or 
                        not talk about anything.” 

           He smiles, awkwardly. Suddenly Christina -- bursts out laughing!  

           James is totally thrown as she laughs harder and louder.  
           Like a release.  Streaming tears.  James smiles, embarrassed, 
           at all the people watching. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Did I say something funn -- ? 

           She snorts! 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Oh - that’s - okay. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (still laughing!)
                        My husband thinks you’re ridiculous!

           James is stunned. This was not what he expected. 
                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (tears of laughter)
                        He calls you the “Liberal Elitist 
                        Dick Fuck!” 

                                 JAMES
                             (offended)
                        A “dick fuck -- ?” That’s... he 
                        learn that in Fallujah? 

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (calming)
                        Oh, God. I’m sorry. I needed that.

                                 JAMES
                             (getting up to leave)
                        Glad I could help.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Wait, you’re going? 

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah; sorry, I have something 
                        “ridiculous” to attend to. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Oh, don’t go! 

                                 JAMES
                        Enjoy the coffee.  

           He walks irritably to the door. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I wanna hear more about your 
                        brother’s wife’s cancer! 

           James exits to the sound of her laughter starting again...

           EXT. STREET. CONTINUOUS.  

           James storms from the café. He stops. “Should I go back and 
           say something?” Instead he pulls out his phone. Dials.  

                                 MAN’S VOICE (ON PHONE) 
                        “You’ve reached Edward Roe, leave a 
                        message and we’ll see what happens.”  

           James hangs up. Looks back at the cafe. And then walks on. 
           INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 

           James and Liz silently get undressed for bed. Both struggling 
           separately with their day’s experiences.  Finally -- 

                                 JAMES
                        I saw Christina today. 

           Liz tenses at the name. But continues her nightly routine.    

                                 LIZ
                        Oh yeah? Where? 

                                 JAMES
                        We were at the same movie. 

           She turns, slightly at this. 

                                 LIZ
                        You saw Christina at the movies? 
                        Today?  

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t think she was actually 
                        watching. She wasn’t even wearing 
                        the 3-D glasses. 

                                 LIZ
                             (cautiously)
                        Did you talk to her? 

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, of course. I mean, I went 
                        right up to her afterwards. She was 
                        still sort of freaked out from last 
                        night so I took her to see that new 
                        Aaron Paul film to calm her down.  

                                 LIZ
                        The one you called a “Pooperhero 
                        movie?”

                                 JAMES
                        Because of how Hollywood shits them 
                        out, not because it’s shitty. 
                        Actually. It’s both. Anyway. 
                             (takes off his pants)
                        After the movie I took her out for 
                        coffee, to see if she wanted to 
                        talk or whatever, and she told me 
                        that Mike thinks I’m “ridiculous” 
                        and a “liberal elitist dick fuck.”  

           Liz turns to him fully for the first time. 
                                 LIZ
                        What? 

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah. Told you that guy hated me.  

           James slips into bed. 

                                 LIZ
                        She just said that? Like out of the 
                        blue? Why would she tell you that? 

                                 JAMES
                        Who knows. But now I kinda see why 
                        you stopped calling her. 

                                 LIZ
                        Jesus!

                                 JAMES
                        What? 

                                 LIZ
                        You know, it might be nice if you 
                        just tried thinking about someone 
                        other than yourself for a change.  

                                 JAMES
                        What are you talking about? I took 
                        her out for a movie and coffee and 
                        she tells me I’m a “dick fuck!”

                                 LIZ
                        Their child died, James!

                                 JAMES
                        Honestly, honey, he probably called 
                        me a “dick fuck” before she died.   

           She stares at him, stunned by his callousness. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        What? 

           She shakes her head and walks into the bathroom.

                                 LIZ (O.C.)
                        We have to pick up a gift before we 
                        leave tomorrow!  

                                 JAMES
                        How do we still get invited to these 
                        things? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAMES (CONT'D)
                        I thought part of the benefit of not 
                        having kids would be not having to go 
                        all of their birthday parties. Kinda 
                        feels like we’re getting screwed.  

           No reaction. James then turns to see: “LEADER OF MEN” by 
           Michael Krill on Liz’s bedside table.  He bristles.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BACKYARD. DAY. 

           KIDS running and screaming. It’s sugar-fueled chaos. A sign 
           hangs in the backyard of a Brownstone: “HAPPY BIRTHDAY!” as 
           PARENTS mill about, talking to one another.

           James and Liz are both in their own worlds, as they half-
           listen to a few parents chat: HALLIE, 38, healthy and bright, 
           her husband, FIN, 40, holding a proud gut and WENDIE, 37, 
           pregnant and loving it. PATCH, 3, dangles from FIN’s leg. 

                                 FIN
                        Just wait! You thought one was 
                        hard?

                                 WENDIE
                        Everyone says that! 

                                 HALLIE
                        It’s true! We look back at when we  
                        just had this one here and ...

                                 FIN
                        We had it sooooo good!

           Everyone laughs. Parent humor. James and Liz force laughs. 

                                 FIN (CONT’D)
                        Patch! Stop! 

           James looks at Patch, who doesn’t stop.  Liz’s phone BUZZES. 

                                 HALLIE 
                        Do you have a name yet?

                                 WENDIE
                        Heath.

           Liz looks at her cell to see: “Mike Krill calling…” -- and 
           anxiously puts it away. 

                                 JAMES
                        Heaf?? What’s a Heaf?  
                                 WENDIE
                        Heath! With a T.H. 

                                 JAMES
                        You mean like the candy bar? 

                                 WENDIE
                        It’s after my mother. 

                                 JAMES
                        Your mother’s name was Heef?

                                 WENDIE
                             (annoyed)
                        No, Hefer! I mean Heather! 

                                 HALLIE
                             (changing the subject)
                        So, Liz, you guys still anti-kids?

                                 LIZ
                             (waking from her daze)
                        What? Oh, no! We’re just not really 
                        “kid people.” 

                                 HALLIE
                        Well, no one is until they are!

           SQUIRT! SQUIRT! Patch shoots his water gun in James’ face!  

                                 FIN
                        Patch! No! 

                                 JAMES
                             (wiping face)
                        You don’t say. 

                                 WENDIE
                        Liz, I heard you saw Christina and 
                        Mike. How are they? 

           James watches Liz struggle for an answer.   

                                 LIZ
                        They’re, you know, still going 
                        through a tough time. 

                                 WENDIE
                        I’ve been thinking about her so 
                        much lately. 

                                 HALLIE
                        God, I can’t even imagine. 
                                 FIN
                        Holy shit! Have you read Mike’s 
                        book? It’s insane. What those Seal 
                        guys do? It’s actually a really 
                        great read. I was impressed.  

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, well, it’s not like he wrote it. 

           Everyone turns to James, who realizes he said this out loud. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        No; I’m just saying. Books like 
                        that are usually written by 
                        ghostwriters. 

           Liz glares at him, bothered by this comment. 

                                 FIN
                        Well, whatever. The stuff he did 
                        over there; it’s pretty incredible.   

                                 WENDIE
                        And then to come home and lose your 
                        only child -- 

                                 JAMES
                        Actually, kinda funny: Friend of 
                        mine told me the book’s become like 
                        a bible for Wall Street douchebags.

                                 HALLIE
                             (offended)
                        You know Fin works on Wall Street. 

                                 JAMES
                        Right, I just mean the douchebags. 

                                 LIZ
                             (annoyed)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JAMES
                        Check his website. Apparently, he 
                        gets like six figures just to speak 
                        to rich assholes about how to make 
                        more money. Using the skills of 
                        “leadership in battle.”  

                                 HALLIE
                        Really? 
                                 LIZ
                        Well, I think he’s earned it, don’t 
                        you? 

                                 FIN
                        You know he got that scar from 
                        saving a kid in Iraq from a suicide 
                        bomb? Lost three of his own men! 

                                 JAMES
                        Three huh? Hell of a leader.

                                 LIZ
                             (fed up)
                        I’m sorry, I forgot; how many Iraqi 
                        kids have you saved? 

                                 JAMES
                        How many Iraqi kids have I saved?? 

                                 LIZ
                        Yes! How many Iraqi kids have you 
                        saved?! 

           Everyone tries to keep their smiles - but it’s awkward.  

                                 JAMES
                        Uh. None. But then I haven’t killed 
                        any innocent civilians either. 

                                 LIZ
                        What makes you think he’s killed 
                        any innocent civilians?!

                                 JAMES
                        Well, he wasn’t just jumping on 
                        Iraqi kids all day! I mean, you’re 
                        reading the book, you tell me. Did 
                        he kill innocent civilians?  

                                 LIZ
                        You know, he’s right! You are a 
                        liberal elitist dick fuck!  

                                 FIN
                        Whoa! Okay!!

                                 JAMES
                        Why?! Because I didn’t train to 
                        kill people? 

                                 LIZ
                        Because everything’s a joke to you!
                                 HALLIE
                        Okay, why don’t we  --

                                 JAMES
                        That’s not true! I just don’t see 
                        how I’m the elitist when he’s the 
                        one getting rich training mini 
                        Madoffs! 

                                 LIZ
                        At least he did something! He 
                        sacrificed something! He doesn’t 
                        just go to stupid movies all day! 

                                 JAMES
                        That’s my job!

                                 LIZ
                        Well, it’s very admirable. 

                                 FIN
                        Hey, maybe it’s time for the cake -- 

                                 JAMES
                        Well, I’m sorry I didn’t save 
                        enough Iraqi kids to earn your 
                        respect! Guess I should’ve joined 
                        the fucking army. 

                                 LIZ
                        They wouldn’t let you in the 
                        fucking army? 

                                 JAMES
                        Why, too smart? 

                                 LIZ
                        Too gay!

                                 JAMES
                        Ha! Read a headline! They let gays 
                        in the military now!!

           Before they can acknowledge the stupidity of this, they  
           realize -- 

           Everyone’s staring. PARENTS eyeing them angrily as they cover 
           their KIDS’ ears.  Definitely not “kid people.” 

                                 LIZ
                             (embarrassed)
                        Sorry.
                                 JAMES
                        Sorry. 
                             (awkward pause)
                        Patch, I hope you liked your gift.

                                 HALLIE
                        It’s not his birthday.

                                 JAMES
                        Oh.

           INT. CAB. MOMENTS LATER. 

           Liz and James sit in silence. Stewing. Finally...

                                 JAMES
                        They’re assholes. 

                                 LIZ
                        Why? Because they’re grown ups? 

                                 JAMES
                        No; because they think they’re 
                        better than us. 

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah, they’re way off. Excuse me, 
                        could you pull over! 

           The DRIVER pulls the cab over. 

                                 JAMES
                        What are you doing?  

                                 LIZ
                        I need some air. 

           She gets out and slams the door!

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           SUPER:      “I have a hole where a hole should be” 

           CLOSE ON -- 

           TV MONITOR SHOWING A LIVE STREAM OF A GROCERY STORE. We see 
           SHOPPERS casually shopping with numbers on their chests. 

                                 LIZ (O.C.)
                        There. See that? Number two?
                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1 (O.C.)
                        She walked past the aisle. 

           We GO WIDE to reveal that we are in --  

           INT. MONITOR ROOM. DAY.

           MONITORS display different angles of the grocery store. 

           Liz watches with two MALE and one FEMALE EXECUTIVE from 
           Crackles Potato Chips.   

                                 LIZ
                        She didn’t just walk past it, she 
                        avoided it. So did number six. 

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                        That’s to be expected. Health 
                        conscious shoppers.

                                 LIZ
                        We’re all health conscious. What we 
                        need is permission to indulge. 
                        You’re not asking these people to 
                        eat your potato chips, you’re just 
                        asking them to buy them. They’re 
                        not going to do that if they avoid 
                        the aisle all together. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1
                        So, what are you suggesting?

                                 LIZ
                        Potatoes are vegetables, right? 

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                             (chuckling)
                        You wanna put them in the vegetable 
                        aisle? 

                                 LIZ
                        I want people to feel okay about 
                        170 calories an ounce. And they’ll 
                        feel a lot better about it with a 
                        head of lettuce and a few carrots 
                        in the cart. 

           Two of the Executives exchange a look, considering. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        It could be a nice compliment to 
                        “The Big Chip.” 
                                 LIZ
                        “The Big Chip?”

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE 
                        As part of our new campaign we’re 
                        installing 80 ft Potato Chips in 
                        four major parks around the city!  

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                             (no irony)
                        They’ll be the largest Potato Chips 
                        ever constructed.  

           Liz nods, letting the absurdity wash over her.  

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1
                             (re: Liz’s idea:)
                        I like it. I think it aligns with 
                        the strategy.

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                             (pointing at monitor)
                        Who’s the beefcake? 

           Liz turns to the monitor to see -- Mike in the store!  

           CLOSE ON -- Liz’s face.  Oh shit...

                                 LIZ
                        I’ll be right back. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE. MOMENT’S LATER. 

           Liz walks quickly through the store we saw on the monitors, 
           past all the numbered Shoppers, until she sees -- 

           Mike helping a WOMAN get something down from a high shelf. 

                                 LIZ
                        Mike?

           He turns to see Liz -- he smiles. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                             (tense smile)
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 MIKE
                        You weren’t answering my calls. 

                                 LIZ
                        Sorry, I know, I’ve been...
           She looks up at the camera, insecurely. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        ...why don’t we go outside. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING LOT. MOMENTS LATER. 

           Liz and Mike stand outside in front of the “store”, which we now 
           see is a warehouse. A fake “test store” used for market research. 

                                 LIZ
                        How did you know where I was? 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sort of a Navy Seal.  
                             (She stares blankly)
                        Your assistant told me. 

                                 LIZ
                        Oh. Ha! 
                             (awkward pause)
                        Look, Mike -- 

                                 MIKE
                        No, wait, before you say anything. 
                        The other day -- 

                                 LIZ
                        Please, really, it’s fine, it was 
                        an accident -- !

                                 MIKE
                         -- No, it wasn’t. 
                             (beat, off her reaction)
                        Or it was but...I don’t regret it. 

           Liz looks flustered. She wasn’t expecting this. Suddenly -- 

           A LARGE MAN wearing #16 appears with an open box of cookies. 

                                 LARGE MAN
                        We get to take the food home, right? 

           Liz looks at him, first distracted - and then concerned.      

                                 LIZ
                        It’s not real. 

                                 LARGE MAN
                        Shit, really? 
           He looks at the box, nervously, and walks back into the “store.”    

                                 MIKE
                        I need to see you again. 

                                 LIZ
                             (flustered)
                        Mike...I don’t think -- 

                                 MIKE
                        Tell me you didn’t feel anything the 
                        other day. Tell me you kissed me back  
                        out of pity and I’ll leave right now.    
                             (before she can speak)
                        You know what? I don’t care if it 
                        was pity -- 

                                 LIZ
                        Mike --

                                 MIKE
                        Liz. Being with you was the first 
                        time I’ve felt anything but grief 
                        in a year. 

           She sees the desperation in his eyes. He hands her a card. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Look: I’ll be here until 2. I have 
                        a speaking engagement but after 
                        that we can go where ever you want. 
                        Just to talk. (then) Please. 

           Liz struggles with what to say. Then finally blurts: 

                                 LIZ
                        Okay, well! I have to get back to 
                        work! Sorry; I’m in the middle of a 
                        thing -- but we’ll keep talking!    

           She grimaces at this stupid comment as she walks back in -- 

           INT. GROCERY STORE. CONTINUOUS. 

           Liz closes the door, breathing anxiously. She looks out to    
           see Mike leave.  Then at the card he gave her.  Suddenly --

                                 LARGE MAN
                        The chips aren’t fake though, right?  

           Liz looks at him, existentially, as he eats from a CRACKLES bag.  
           INT. JAMES AND LIZ’S APARTMENT. DAY.  

           James tries to fix ALEXA. Thinking he’s got it, he plugs it in 
           the wall behind the bookshelf and -- MUSIC BLARES!    

                                 JAMES
                        Alexa stop! Stop Alexa! No! Bad 
                        Alexa! 

           It sounds just like: “No, Patch! Patch, no!”  He unplugs it.  
           Then notices something on the bookshelf...

           “CYSTYPHEAN MYTHS” by Edward Roe. He pulls it out. The blurb 
           reads:  “Funniest book ever written about bone cancer.” – NY Times 

           He then sees “LEADER OF MEN” by Michael Krill. He pulls it out. 
           The blurb reads: “A brilliant meditation on courage under 
           pressure.” - Boston Globe 

           James chuckles, dismissively. Then, a look of defiance. 

           He grabs his keys and rushes out of the apartment! 

           EXT. MIDTOWN STREET. LATER. 

           James marches down the street, on a mission.  To do what?  Talk 
           to Mike?  Christina?  He stops abruptly when he sees –  

           Christina exiting her building wearing big, dark sunglasses, a 
           head scarf and her collar turned up.  A disguise?  She carries a 
           large bag. She looks around, cautiously, as if making sure no one 
           sees her.  And then heads toward the subway.        

           Curiosity taking the place of umbrage...James follows her. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUBWAY CAR. DAY.

           An ad stretches the length of the car with the line:  
           “CRACKLES POTATO CHIPS: “BIG CRUNCH. BIGGER FLAVOR.” 

           Below the ad, James stealthily watches Christina from the far 
           side of the train. She checks her watch, anxiously. She turns 
           to toward James – and he quickly hides behind --

           A LARGE MALE PASSENGER! The PASSENGER looks down at James 
           like he’s a fucking weirdo.  James smiles, apologetically.    

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. WEST VILLAGE STREET. DAY. 

           Christina walks briskly down the street. We PAN BACK to see...

           James following from a safe distance. He stops when he sees -- 

           Christina stop across the street from a plain looking building. 
           She looks back toward James -- and he quickly ducks into -- 

           A BOOKSTORE!

           James continues to watch Christina through the store window.  
           She sits on a bench and watches the building, closely. 

           An OLDER MAN with a French Bulldog and a thick NY accent 
           approaches James in the store. 

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Hey, you the movie guy from the 
                        paper? 

                                 JAMES
                             (still watching)
                        Uh, yeah. One of them. Sorry, I’m 
                        sorta in the middle of -- 

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Why didn’t you like Sully? 

                                 JAMES
                        Excuse me?

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Sully. With Tom Hanks. Why didn’t 
                        you like it?

           James sees a few PEOPLE exit the building Christina’s watching. 
           A MAN in a Red Sox Cap, A GUY WITH GLASSES and a Captain 
           America T-shirt and a TEENAGE GIRL with a lip ring. 

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        I was telling my wife we should rent 
                        Sully and she remembered you didn’t 
                        like it. But we watched it and I 
                        thought it was really good. Strong 
                        performances. Hanks is always good. 
                        But the other guy was good too we 
                        thought. 

           The three PEOPLE walk off together, chatting. Christina 
           stands up and follows them. 
                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        You know it was directed by Clint 
                        Eastwood -- 

                                 JAMES
                        I didn’t review Sully. That was 
                        someone else. 

           James quickly moves past the OLDER MAN and exits the store --  

           EXT. STREET. CONTINUOUS.

           James looks around for her. He sees the MAN in the RED SOX 
           CAP and the TEENAGE GIRL -- but no Christina. 

           Wait, there she is!  

           She’s walking about ten feet back from the GUY WITH GLASSES. 
           Is she following him?  

           James’ phone BUZZES. He look to see: “Eddie Calling...” He 
           hits “Dismiss”.   And follows Christina. 

                                 MIKE (O.C.)
                        Fear. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LARGE SEMINAR ROOM. DAY. 

           Liz enters quietly and sits in the back of a packed seminar, 
           as we continue to hear Mike’s voice:  

                                 MIKE (O.C.)
                        Okay, of what? Failure? 
                        Humiliation? Rejection? Death? 

           We see Mike speaking confidently to an audience of YOUNG 
           BUSINESS ASSOCIATES. A poster of his book in the corner. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s close your eyes and think 
                        about fear. Go on. 

           Everyone, in rapt attention, closes their eyes. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. Feel it.  Taste it. 
                        Good. Now, say goodbye to it. 
                        Because that feeling has no place 
                        on the battlefield. Fear is what 
                        gets you killed. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s a bullet in the head. An IED 
                        in the middle of your unit. Because 
                        the moment your team sees it, the 
                        moment the enemy sees it, the 
                        moment you see it – it’s over.

           Liz can see a hint of shame in Mike’s eyes. Is he faking it? 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Now, you’re gonna say, what, fear is 
                        a survival instinct. Keeps you 
                        sharp. And for housewives and couch 
                        potatoes, that’s probably true. But 
                        when you willingly put yourself in 
                        front of the front lines -- you’ve 
                        already contradicted that instinct.  
                        You’re a different animal. Instinct 
                        doesn’t even apply to you. Because 
                        this isn’t about survival -- it’s 
                        about being the best. Doing what the 
                        other guy won’t -- and can’t. It’s 
                        about leading a team into battle and 
                        saying: “Fear? Fuck fear. I chose 
                        this. This is who I am.” 

           Liz squirms in a sea of pumped-up business dudes. Mike sees her. 
           A tiny smile crosses his lips. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DARK BAR. AFTERNOON. 

           Liz and Mike sit in the back of a dark bar. Liz wears sunglasses. 

                                 MIKE
                        Thanks for coming. I know you’re 
                        nervous to be seen with me.  

                                 LIZ
                        I’m not nervous. Why, do I look 
                        nervous? 

                                 MIKE
                        No. But. We’re in a gay bar.

           WE GO WIDE: to reveal an unapologetically gay bar. ONLY MEN 
           hanging out. A Corona ad on the wall of two naked dudes on a 
           beach. A clock with Penis second hand.   

                                 LIZ
                        Look, Mike: what happened the other 
                        day...I think we were both just 
                        feeling emotional.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        And with everything you’re going 
                        through, what you’ve experienced 
                        over the last year -- I mean, God, 
                        I can’t even imagine. And I think 
                        what happened was you were talking, 
                        you know, about all of that stuff, 
                        and I was, you know, listening... 

                                 MIKE
                             (re: her rambling)
                        Liz...

                                 LIZ
                        My point is, I think what you’re 
                        feeling for me -- and I’m not saying 
                        you are feeling something -- but if 
                        you are, you know, feeling something 
                        -- I think that’s more about – 
                        probably -- what it’s about.  

                                 MIKE
                        I agree. 

                                 LIZ
                             (thrown)
                        You do? 

                                 MIKE
                        Liz: my 6 year old daughter was 
                        killed by a drunk driver and I can’t 
                        mourn her because if I do my wife 
                        will go to pieces. Meanwhile, the 
                        book I wrote about my experience in 
                        the war has been appropriated as a 
                        tool for one percent wannabees. And 
                        now I get paid to give M.B.A. pre-
                        pubes spank material about the perils 
                        of fear, where I make the battlefield 
                        a metaphor for the trading floor. And 
                        they have no idea it’s all bullshit. 
                        That I’m terrified. Of who I am. What 
                        I’ve become. What my wife has become. 
                        So, yeah. I think it’s possible my 
                        feelings for you might have something 
                        to do with that. 

                                 LIZ
                             (awkward beat)
                        Good. Well. As long as we’ve 
                        established that’s what it is.  

           Mike reaches into his bag. He comes back with some opened 
           letters, still in their envelopes.  
                                 MIKE
                        You asked me if something happened 
                        that night to upset Chris.  
                             (hesitates a moment)
                        Guess you could say it was him.  

           He hands her the letters. She looks at them.  

                                 LIZ
                        Ryan Caster? Who is that? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WEST VILLAGE STREET. DAY. 

           James hides behind the steps of a brownstone watching 
           Christina standing on street corner watching –      

           The GUY WITH GLASSES in the window of a cafe, drinking a 
           coffee and reading, Twilight. He’s slight, about 32, but 
           looks younger. Sweet faced. He seems restless, as he keeps 
           looking at his phone for the time. 

           TWO KIDS make silly faces at James from the ground floor 
           window of the brownstone.  He smiles, awkwardly. Then sees -- 

           Christina crossing the street, trance-like, toward the café. 

           Oh shit! There’s a CAR headed straight for her! 

           He runs over to her and pulls her back on to the curb -- 
           HOOOONK!!  

           Did she do that on purpose?

           The GUY WITH GLASSES looks out the window – but sees only James. 

           Christina, disoriented, turns around to see --  

                                 CHRISTINA 
                        James!? What are you doing here? 

                                 JAMES
                             (panting)
                        You’re welcome. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (nervously)
                        Have you’ve been following me?

                                 JAMES
                        What? No! I mean. Yes. A little.  
                                 CHRISTINA
                        Did Mike ask you to do that?

                                 JAMES
                        Mike?  

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Does he know I’m here?! 

                                 JAMES
                        No! I mean, I don’t know -- 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 JAMES
                        Okay look: I went over to your 
                        place because I wanted to talk 
                        about our conversation the other 
                        day. Or, not really “conversation,” 
                        more just you laughing at me and my 
                        brother’s wife’s horrible cancer... 

           She turns back to the GUY WITH GLASSES as James talks.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        ...but then I see you dressed like 
                        Greta Garbo and you’re following some 
                        hipster Marvel fan.      

           She turns back to James...“oh God, you know?” 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Who is he?

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (beat)
                        No one. 

           She turns and walks away. James follows. 

                                 JAMES
                        Look, I’m not gonna tell Mike! Is 
                        he like an office crush? 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Please, stop -- 

                                 JAMES
                        An ex boyfriend? A current 
                        boyfriend? Is he Mike’s boyfriend?! 

           She stops, abruptly.  
                                 CHRISTINA
                        He killed my daughter!! 

           James goes completely white. 

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                             (desperate)
                        Please don’t tell Mike. 

           He looks toward the café, realizing...it’s the drunk driver!

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        It’s not what you think. I’m just. I 
                        wanted to see, I wanted to...please don’t 
                        tell Mike — 

                                 JAMES
                         -- He’s leaving. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What? 

           James points to the GUY WITH GLASSES exiting the cafe.  

                                 JAMES
                        C’mon, we’re gonna lose him.

           Christina looks thrown, as James grabs her hand -- and they 
           follow him!   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DARK BAR. AFTERNOON.

           Liz finishes reading the letters. She doesn’t know what to say. 

                                 LIZ
                        Chris has read these? 

                                 MIKE
                        No. 

                                 LIZ
                        No? I mean, don’t you think she -- 

                                 MIKE
                        Why? So she can forgive him? See 
                        that he’s “sorry”?  That he’s just 
                        a, a  normal guy? Her rage is the 
                        only thing keeping her alive; I’m 
                        not gonna take that away. No.  
                        Those letters are my burden. 
                                 LIZ
                        Why are you showing them to me?

                                 MIKE
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know.

           THE BARTENDER, muscle bound, appears at the table wearing a 
           Diana Ross T-shirt that says: “Original Diva.”

                                 BARTENDER
                        One Bud light and one happy hour 
                        cocktail. 

           He hands Liz a PENIS SHAPED drink. She’s confused at first 
           but then, getting the joke... 

                                 LIZ
                        It’s a “cock” tail. 

           She smiles awkwardly as she sips from the straw. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PLAYGROUND. DAY.

           FROM A DISTANCE we see the GUY WITH GLASSES, aka RYAN CASTER, 
           playing with his son, NILES, 5, as his MOTHER watches on. 

           James and Christina watch from across the street, silently. 
           Neither know what to say to the other.  Finally --  

                                 JAMES
                        What’s his name? 

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (Pause)
                        Ryan. Ryan Caster. 

           James struggles to think of something else to say. 

                                 JAMES
                        That’s his kid? 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Niles. He should be five by now. 
                        He’s been seeing him once a day.

           James takes this in. He’s about to try something else when -- 

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        You think I’m crazy, don’t you? 
                           (before he can answer)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.  Mike does.  He thinks 
                        I’m weak.  Which, for Mike, is 
                        worse. He knew he’d been released 
                        from prison for weeks and didn’t 
                        even tell me. Guess he was scared 
                        of how I’d react. 

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, what was he thinking? 

           James smiles, but then immediately regrets the joke. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure he’s just trying to... 
                        protect you. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (bitterly)
                        “Protect” me. He won’t talk about 
                        Katie. Won’t say her name or even 
                        visit her grave. All because he’s 
                        protecting me.  
                             (beat)
                        I found out about his release the 
                        night you two came over.

           James realizes...that’s what happened that night! 

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        He was only in for nine months. 
                        Nine. Seems appropriate, I guess.  
                        Considering what he took from me. 

           They watch RYAN plead with the MOTHER for more time with NILES.

                                 JAMES
                             (discovery)
                        He was at the movie the other day. 
                        That’s why you were there.  

                                 CHRISTINA
                        He goes to A.A. every day as a 
                        condition of his release. So I stand 
                        outside and wait for him to come out. 
                        I don’t know why. Maybe just to...see 
                        him. Maybe I think I’ll get the 
                        courage to say something or...maybe I 
                        am crazy. 
                             (beat, anger)
                        But someone has to remember.  
                        Someone has to say her name. 

           James watches Christina stare darkly at RYAN, as he waves 
           goodbye to NILES, who walks off with his MOTHER.
                                 JAMES
                        What would you say to him? 

           We CLOSE IN on Christina as she stares at her mark.  

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I’d tell him about how I still see 
                        her.  How I hear her playing in her 
                        room sometimes when the apartment is 
                        quiet.  About that sudden rush of 
                        exhilaration I feel when I do and 
                        that...sickness when I remember.   
                        I’d tell him that I have the same 
                        dream every night. Reaching into the 
                        car; trying to save her.  Struggling 
                        to unhook her seat belt. How I try to 
                        talk to her, keep her calm as I 
                        stretch my hands out as far as they 
                        can go through the broken windshield. 
                        But it’s never far enough.    

           James is transfixed. Humbled, perhaps?  

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        I’d tell him how my husband and I 
                        don’t talk to each other anymore 
                        because there’s only one thing to 
                        talk about.  And we don’t know how.

           He turns to RYAN who sits alone in the park, sad.  

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t think you’re crazy. Or 
                        weak. 

           She might be touched by this but doesn’t know how to show it.  

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Please don’t tell Liz about...

                                 JAMES
                        No. Of course not. (then) Frankly, 
                        I don’t think she’d understand.

           OTS of James and Christina watching Ryan like a movie. James 
           offers her gum.  She takes a stick.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DARK BAR. AFTERNOON. 

           Liz SLURPS her PENIS SHAPED drink. An empty one next to her.  
                                 LIZ
                        These are actually delicious. 

                                 MIKE
                        You haven’t answered my question.

                                 LIZ
                        Mike...Christina is -- 

                                 MIKE
                        Christina hasn’t been in love with 
                        me since Katie died. 

                                 LIZ
                        You don’t know that. 

                                 MIKE
                        Did you feel something or not? 

                                 LIZ
                        I’m married. 

                                 MIKE
                        To a ridiculous man. 

                                 LIZ
                        He’s not...that ridiculous. 

           She slurps again. 

                                 MIKE
                        He mocks people like us because he’s 
                        scared to put himself on the line. 

                                 LIZ
                             (flattered)
                        “People like us?” 

           He grabs her hand.

                                 MIKE
                        I watched you the other night. What 
                        you said to Chris, how you handled 
                        the situation...

           Liz then shakes from her flattery, and removes her hand.  

                                 LIZ
                        Look, Mike, if you knew my life; I 
                        mean, compared to yours...?

                                 MIKE
                        That’s not true...  
                                 LIZ
                        Do you know what I do all day? I 
                        predict how and why people will buy 
                        things they don’t need. That’s my 
                        job! My biggest clients are 
                        installing 80 foot potato chips all 
                        over the city. I have a membership to 
                        the MoMA and the Whitney and I’ve 
                        never been to either. We order in 
                        three times a week because we don’t 
                        like cooking. I have a subscription 
                        to US Weekly -- and I read it! And 
                        the deepest conversation James and I 
                        had in the last 6 months was about 
                        the season finale of Game of Thrones.
                             (beat)
                        The things you’ve seen and done... 
                        what you and Chris have been through? 
                             (coming clean)
                        I can’t understand it. 

                                 MIKE
                             (smiling)
                        I know. 

                                 LIZ
                             (offended)
                        What? 

                                 MIKE
                             (confused)
                        What? 

                                 LIZ
                        Well, I mean...the other day you 
                        said that I did understand.

                                 MIKE
                        You do. You understand how to not let 
                        it all in. How to move on with your 
                        life. Shut your ears to it all. 

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t shut my ears...

                                 MIKE
                        It’s okay; it’s survival. 

                                 LIZ
                             (defensive)
                        You don’t even know me.
                                 MIKE
                        I know the deepest conversation you 
                        had in the last year was about Game 
                        of Thrones. 

                                 LIZ
                        You can’t use that example; that’s 
                        my example! You know what? I -- I 
                        have to go. 

           She stands up to leave -- 

                                 MIKE
                        Wait, Liz --! 

           She trips over a chair! 

                                 LIZ
                        Ow! Shit! 

           She exits, as Mike stuffs the letters in his bag and follows her 
           into the --  

           EXT. STREET. CONTINUOUS.

           Mike chases Liz as she shouts back -- 

                                 LIZ
                        My dad died okay?! And my cousin, 
                        Sarah? You don’t know this -- but 
                        it really fucked me up! 

           He grabs her by the arm.  She avoids eye contact. 

                                 MIKE
                        Look, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to 
                        offend you! I just meant that when 
                        I look at you I don’t see...scars! 
                        Or pain or death. I see -- life! I 
                        see strength and courage and 
                        passion. I don’t want pain anymore. 
                        I’m sick of pain.        

                                 LIZ
                        You think I’m ridiculous. 

                                 MIKE
                        I think kissing you the other day 
                        was the first time I’ve been alive 
                        in over a year. I think you’re 
                        strong. I think you’re fearless and 
                        smart. I think you’re the least 
                        ridiculous person I’ve ever known.  
           This gets her. Their eyes lock. She’s hypnotized by the 
           moment, the weight, honesty.  We wonder, will the kiss...?

                        Dude! Look who it is! 

           The spell is broken as a group of MALE ASSOCIATES from the 
           seminar approach -- drunk.  

                                 ASSOCIATE 1
                        Hey! Seal guy! Get a drink with us!

                        Your speech was fucking dope, man. 
                        I was pumped!

                        I should go...

                                 MIKE
                        Wait...

                                 ASSOCIATE 2
                        Did you really know the guys from 
                        Seal Team six? 

                                 MIKE
                             (irritated)
                        I’m with someone right now. 

           She begins to walk away. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Liz...

                        Holy shit, yeah! Did you see Bin 
                        Laden’s body? C’mon man, one drink! 

           Associate 1 puts his hand on Mike’s shoulder and -- WAP!! 
           Mike hits him -- hard! He goes down! 

                                 ALL ASSOCIATES
                        Whoa! / hey! / Shit! 

           Liz turns back around -- 

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my God!
           Mike jumps on top of him. Hits him again! 

                                 MIKE
                        Touch me again! 

           And again!

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Touch me again you ivy league 
                        motherfucker! PLEASE! 

           BAM! 

                                 ALL ASSOCIATES
                        Hey! /Stop! / You’re gonna kill em!

           He cocks his arm back again  -- 

                                 LIZ
                        MIKE!! 

           Mike stops, as if waking from a dream. My God, what have I done? 
           He gets up; lost. The Associates run to their friend. 

                                 ASSOCIATE 3 
                        Dude, what the fuck! 

           He turns to Liz, shaken. He grabs his bag and walks away. 

                                 ASSOCIATE 3 (CONT’D)
                        Dude! Lady! The fuck’s his problem?! 

                                 ASSOCIATE 2
                        Yeah! Tim went to Ohio State!  

           Liz watches Mike walk off, a look of profound sympathy; her 
           heart aching for him.  She then sees -- 

           The letters from Ryan Caster on the ground. She picks them 
           up.  We CLOSE IN on Liz’ conflicted expression.  

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           Liz’s face. Same expression. Except now she’s --

           IN BED.

           Staring at the ceiling. Wide awake. She turns over to see – 

           James’ face. 

           Dead asleep. Mouth breathing. Drooling.  A ridiculous man? 
           She closes his mouth. But it pops back open.  She tries 
           again.  It pops back open. Then she pulls his lip, curiously, 
           like it’s rubber.  Moving it around.  Repelled and fascinated 
           by its elasticity.  Its inhumanity.  

           She hears SOMETHING in the other room and turns to the door -- 

                                 JAMES
                        What are you doing?

           She turns back to see that she’s still holding his lip. She    
           lets go. 

                                 LIZ
                             (whispers)
                        I think there’s someone in the 
                        apartment? 

           Another SOUND! James heard that one. What the...?? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN. MOMENT’S LATER.

           A MAN rummages through the fridge. He closes the door and -- 

                                 MAN
                             (Startled)
                        Jesus!

           James and Liz stand holding “weapons”, James wields scissors 
           and Liz a hole puncher.  

                                 JAMES
                        Edward? 

           Meet EDWARD ROE, 44, with dark, tired eyes, an unkempt beard 
           and a cast on his left hand. There’s something about Edward 
           that makes it never quite clear if he’s joking or not.    

                                 EDWARD
                        You scared the hell out of me.

                                 LIZ
                        We scared you? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Is that a hole puncher? 

           Liz looks at her weapon, embarrassed. 
                                 JAMES
                        What are you are you doing? How did 
                        you get in here? 

                                 EDWARD
                             (holds up a key)
                        I used this key you gave me.

                                 JAMES
                        I never gave you a key. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh. Weird. Is this milk still good? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           KITCHEN TABLE. MOMENTS LATER

           James watches Edward eat cereal at his kitchen table. His 
           cast, his tired eyes, scraggly beard. 

                                 JAMES
                        So is everything okay, or..? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah, why? 

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t know; you break into my 
                        apartment at 2 am, you have a cast on 
                        your hand and you look like Jeff 
                        Bridges.  

                                 EDWARD
                        Which movie?

                                 JAMES
                        His last five. What’s going on?

                                 EDWARD
                        Nothing. You called me. 

                                 JAMES
                        So, you break in to my apartment?

                                 EDWARD
                        Well, you never call, so. 

           Before James can respond to this, Liz comes in with blankets.

                                 LIZ
                        Here you go, Eddie. Let me know if 
                        you need anything else. 
                                 EDWARD
                        Thanks, Liz. 

                                 LIZ
                        What happened to your hand? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Which one? 

           She stares at him, blankly. I’m too tired for this. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Cool poster. 

           They both look at the Star Trek poster he’s referring to. 

                                 LIZ
                        I’m going to bed. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Good night! 

           Liz shuffles off the bedroom. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        You guys fighting? 

                                 JAMES
                        No. Wait. Why? 

                                 EDWARD
                        I think she hates me. 

                                 JAMES
                        She doesn’t hate you. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Feel like she hates me. 

                                 JAMES
                        It’s not you. (then) We’re fighting. 

                                 EDWARD
                        What about? 

                                 JAMES
                        I have no idea. What happened to 
                        your hand? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Actually, it’s a funny story...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE. NIGHT. 

           Edward is walking the Williamsburg Bridge, innocently. 

                                 EDWARD (V.O.)
                        So, I’m walking across the 
                        Williamsburg Bridge. And I think I 
                        hear someone down below. 

           Edward stops, hearing something, and climbs the railing. 

                                 EDWARD (V.O.)
                        So I climb the railing to look 
                        down. Just then I hear something 
                        behind me. I look over and there’s 
                        this little Asian girl taking a 
                        selfie with me in the background.

           We see a 25 YEAR OLD GIRL taking a selfie with her phone.

                                 EDWARD (V.O.)
                        And I realize, holy shit, she 
                        thinks I’m gonna jump and wants to 
                        like Tweet it or some shit! So I’m 
                        like:

           Edward mouths his own V.O.: 

                                 EDWARD (V.O.)
                        “Hey! Are you taking a selfie of my 
                        fucking suicide?” And she’s like -- 

           The Girl mouths: 

                                 EDWARD (V.O.)
                        “Fuck you, mother fucker.” And she 
                        just - bolts! 

           The Girl runs!

                                 EDWARD (V.O.)
                        I’m like, “Hey! Hey! Come back 
                        here!” So I chase her, and --

           He chases her off camera until we hear a HONK! SCREECH! BANG! 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. KITCHEN. CONTINUOUS. 

           James stares blankly, not sure if this is a real story or not. 
                                 EDWARD
                        So, why did you call? 

                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 EDWARD
                        The other day. You didn’t leave a 
                        message.  

                                 JAMES
                        Oh. Uh...actually... I was thinking 
                        about Karen.  

                                 EDWARD
                        You know she’s dead right? 

                                 JAMES
                             (annoyed)
                        Yeah, I think I remember. 
                             (beat)
                        Some friends of ours lost their 
                        daughter last year to a drunk 
                        driver. The mother’s going through 
                        a really tough time and I’m sort of 
                        helping her through it. 

           Edward laughs. James looks offended.  More laughing? 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Why is that funny? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Because other peoples’ suffering 
                        makes you uncomfortable. 

                                 JAMES
                        This from the guy who wrote a 
                        comedy about his wife’s death. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Dark comedy. 

           Edward gets up to get more cereal, as James considers this.  

                                 JAMES
                        Well. I mean. I was helpful to you? 
                        Wasn’t I?  With Karen? 

           Edward pours more cereal in his bowl. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Uh. Yeah. Sure. 
                                 JAMES
                             (dubious)
                        You went high.

                                 EDWARD
                        I didn’t go high. 

                                 JAMES
                        You went high.

                                 EDWARD
                        You were great, you know. I mean, 
                        sure, what do you mean? 

           He sits back at the table. 

                                 JAMES
                        Wait, so...what, you’re saying I 
                        wasn’t there for you? 

                                 EDWARD
                             (mouth full)
                        Define “there for me?” 

                                 JAMES
                        I -- what do you mean? I came to 
                        the hospital, I called, I...that 
                        night after the funeral, I stayed 
                        at your place, remember? We talked.   

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah. That was nice. 

           James looks stunned. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Look, it’s not a big deal. I didn’t 
                        expect you to like drop everything 
                        and call me every day. Or come over 
                        once week with soup and a movie. I 
                        mean, I don’t even like soup. Why 
                        do people think soup is good for 
                        people who are grieving?

                                 JAMES
                        It’s warm and comforting. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Mom made me gazpacho. It was 
                        freezing. Do you have any juice?

           Edward gets up and goes into the fridge. 
                                 JAMES
                        Well, Jesus, Eddie. Why didn’t you 
                        say anything?   

                                 EDWARD
                        Because other peoples’ suffering 
                        makes you uncomfortable. What’s this? 

           He holds a Orange Pellegrino.  

                                 JAMES
                        It’s like bubbly orange juice. 
                        You’ll like it. 

           Edward opens it and drinks, as James continues to stew.  

                                 EDWARD
                        Look, don’t get upset. I still love  
                        you. 

                                 JAMES
                        I just...I feel bad. I wish you would 
                        of said something, that’s all.  

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m sorry. Next time I totally will. 

           James nods. And then realizes...wait a second? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KITCHEN. MORNING. 

           Liz sits at the kitchen table staring at the Ryan Caster 
           letters. Conflicted. She then slips them into a larger 
           envelope, and seals it. She writes: “To Christina Krill” . 

                                 EDWARD (O.C.)
                        You’re out of cereal. 

                                 LIZ
                             (startled)
                        Ah! Jesus! 

           Edward stands in his boxers, hair standing up.  

                                 EDWARD
                        And milk. 

                                 LIZ
                        Thought you were asleep.  
                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t really sleep that much. 
                        Speaking of which, I hope I didn’t 
                        keep you guys up last night. I can 
                        be kind of loud.  

                                 LIZ
                        Doing what? 

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh. Nothing. Forget it then. 

           She looks wierded out. She puts the envelope in her bag.  

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        James said you guys are in fight. 

                                 LIZ
                        He said that? 

                                 EDWARD
                        No. 

                                 LIZ
                        We’re not “in a fight.”

                                 EDWARD
                        Good. 

           She looks at him, as if trying to interpret.

                                 LIZ
                        I have to go work. I’ll pick up 
                        some cereal on the way home. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Oh, don’t worry about it. But 
                        something with oats in it. 

           Liz walks to the door and then stops. There’s something on 
           her mind.  Finally, she turns to Edward --    

                                 LIZ
                        Why a comedy? The book about  
                        Karen’s illness? Why did you make  
                        it a comedy? 

                                 EDWARD
                             (beat)
                        I don’t know. It was just so... 
                        horrible. 

           She looks even more confounded. 
                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        How do you accept something so 
                        horrible? So much pain. False hope. 
                        Every day? With the Chemo and the 
                        vomiting, the tubes and wires and 
                        weight loss. The constant assault 
                        on your humanity. You just can’t. 
                        It’s absurd. It’s just not possible 
                        to...not laugh.  

           He says this not laughing. Liz has no response. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           SUPER:          “Grief has been done to death”

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES OFFICES. DAY. 

           James sits at his desk clicking through something on his 
           computer.  On the screen we see -- 

           Photos of: 1. James, Liz, Edward (clean shaven) and KAREN who  
           looks healthy, lovely, silly.  2. Edward and Karen in the 
           hospital, early in her illness. She’s laughing, as he lifts 
           her hospital gown to look at her ass. 3. Karen bald and sick, 
           as Edward wears a Santa hat and a stethoscope, both smiling.  

           James closes out to reveal his desktop is a big photo of -- 

           James and Liz smiling happily on a rooftop in New York.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BREAK ROOM. DAY.

           James pours himself a coffee. Another reporter, NICHOLAS, 
           30s, black, intellectual, walks in. 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Hey. 

                                 JAMES
                        Nicholas. How it’s going? 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Oh, you know. 
           He refills his coffee. 

                                 NICHOLAS (CONT’D)
                        What are you working on these days? 

                                 JAMES
                        Wong Kar-Wai’s latest and Mission 
                        Impossible 8. 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        And?

                                 JAMES
                        See the first, rent the second. 
                        What about you? 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        I just got back from Aleppo. Doing 
                        this cheery piece on how ISIS uses 
                        children as human shields. 

                                 JAMES
                             (floored)
                        Jesus. 

                                 NICHOLAS
                        Yeah. Another day, another dollar. 
                        Right? See ya later. 

           Nick pats him on the shoulder and exits with his coffee.  

                                 JAMES
                        Later.

           James looks deflated. Then an idea! He looks at his watch. 

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           HIS DESK. 

           James searches through drawers until he finds -- aha! --  
           Binoculars! He heads toward the door, swipes a Knicks hat and 
           sunglasses off a random desk -- and exits!  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY. DAY. 

           Liz stands outside of Mike and Christina’s door. She leans 
           down to slip the envelope under the door when -- 

           The door opens! 
           Startled, Liz stands with the envelope as Christina comes 
           out, wearing her dark glasses, head scarf.  

                                 LIZ
                        Hey! Chris!

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (off guard)
                        Liz. Hi. How are you? 

           Christina takes off her sunglasses. 

                                 LIZ
                        Sorry, did I catch you at bad time?

                                 CHRISTINA
                        No, I was just...headed to work.

                                 LIZ
                        I can come back! 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        No, it’s -- did you want something?  

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah, I just, I...

           Liz grips the envelope. It’s time to come clean. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Actually, I came by to -- 

           Suddenly, the KID ON THE BIG WHEEL whizzes by again! Before 
           Liz can even react –  

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Hey! Hey!! Come back here!! 

           Christina goes after him -- and grabs the handle bars! 

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                        What did I tell you about riding 
                        that thing in the hall!? Huh? You 
                        could hurt someone!! This is not a 
                        playground! There are other people 
                        in this world!! NOT JUST YOU! Do 
                        you understand that!? 

           Liz is taken aback. Was this the “rage” Mike referred to?

                                 MOTHER (O.C.)
                        Hey! What are you doing?? 

           She turns to see the Kid’s MOTHER in her door. 
                                 CHRISTINA
                        Your son almost hit my friend with 
                        his bike! 

                                 LIZ
                        No, I’m fine, really!

                                 MOTHER
                        You have a problem, you come to me, 
                        you don’t talk my son like that! 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Well, someone has to! He’s been 
                        riding that goddamn thing up and 
                        down the halls! He’s gonna hurt 
                        someone!    

           The Mother wants to say more but stops when she realizes the 
           situation... a grieving mother. 

                                 MOTHER
                        Nathan come inside. Now. 

           NATHAN walks in, dragging the Big Wheel. Door closes. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Sorry about that. 

                                 LIZ
                             (awkward)
                        No, God, that kid totally sucks! 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What did you want to talk about?  

           Changing her mind, Liz hides the envelope behind her back.  

                                 LIZ
                        Oh, I just wanted to tell you...
                             (her line:)
                        ...”how sorry I am. For everything 
                        you’re going through. I know we’re 
                        not as close as we used to be but I 
                        still consider you a close friend. 
                        And I wish I knew the words to take 
                        your pain away but I don’t. All I 
                        can say is: I’m here. To talk about 
                        it, or not talk about it or not 
                        talk about anything.”

           Hearing this last part again, Christina offers a plastic 
           smile that could maim. 
                                 CHRISTINA
                        Well. I have to go --  

                                 LIZ
                         -- Yeah, no --  

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What’s that? 

           Liz realizes she’s referring to the envelope in her hand. 

                                 LIZ
                             (flustered)
                        Oh! It’s -- it was outside your 
                        door. I saw it and...here. 

           She hands it to Christina.

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Thanks. 

           Liz watches nervously as Christina puts it in her purse.  

                                 LIZ
                        Sure. Well. It was good to see you. 

           Liz turns and walks awkwardly ahead of her down the hall.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GROCERY STORE. DAY.

           A WOMAN with a #8 on her chest pushes a shopping cart slowly 
           through the vegetable aisle. She grabs some cucumbers. 
           Tomatoes. Lettuce. Then, awkwardly shoe-horned between all 
           the vegetables is a big blue display of: 

           CRACKLES: “BIG CRUNCH. BIGGER FLAVOR.”

           The WOMAN pauses -- but only for a moment -- then takes a bag.  

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1 (O.C.)
                        Yes!

           INT. MONITOR ROOM. CONTINUOUS.

           The same three Crackles EXECS watch the monitor.    

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                        She did it! 
                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        That’s three shoppers we didn’t 
                        have yesterday. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1
                        Incredible. 

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE 
                        Well, now I know how to get my son 
                        to eat his vegetables. 

           Everyone laughs, except Liz, who sits in the corner, still 
           shaken up from her run in with Christina.  

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 3
                        Great work, Liz; really. It’s  
                        little freaky how well you 
                        understand human nature. 

           CLOSE IN on Liz as she considers this.

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET. MOMENTS LATER. 

           Liz stands in front of a Newsstand talking on her cell. 

                                 LIZ
                        Hi. It’s me. I think I did 
                        something really stupid and I kinda 
                        need to talk to you.  

                                                               CUT TO: 

           INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM. DAY.

           A large CRACKLES AD: “BIG CRUNCH. BIGGER FLAVOR.” 

           In front of the ad sits -- James, wearing dark sunglasses, a 
           Knicks cap and binoculars around his neck. He looks down the 
           platform to see....

           Mike! He’s sitting 20 feet away, staring off, pensively. 

           James’ first instinct is to avoid him but then...fuck it. 

           He walks over. But Mike doesn’t notice. 

                                 JAMES
                        Hey, Mike!

           Mike looks up. Takes a moment to process. 
                                 MIKE
                        James. 

                                 JAMES
                        How’s it going? 

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. You? 

                                 JAMES
                        Good; yeah.   

           Mike sees the binoculars. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        How’s the book doing? 

                                 MIKE
                        It’s okay. How’s your, uh.....? 

           James lets him struggle a moment. 

                                 JAMES
                        Film reviews. I’m a critic for the 
                        New York Times...  

                                 MIKE
                        Right.

                                 JAMES
                        ...I also teach at NYU and 
                        Columbia. And I’m a member of the 
                        New York and Los Angeles Film 
                        Societies.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry...

                                 JAMES
                             (then humble)
                        No, it’s, whatever; it’s all kinda 
                        ridiculous, right?  

           An awkward pause. Did he get the “ridiculous” reference? 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        How’s Christina doing? 

                                 MIKE
                             (taken aback)
                        Christina?  
                                 JAMES
                        Yeah. I’ve been thinking about her 
                        a lot since the other night. 

                                 MIKE
                        Right. Sorry about that. She’s 
                        good. Thanks.    

                                 JAMES
                        Really? 

                                 MIKE
                             (defensive)
                        Yeah. Why? 

                                 JAMES
                        No, she just didn’t seem so “good” 
                        the other night, I’m surprised -- 

                                 MIKE
                             (stopping him cold)
                        She’s fine. 

                                 JAMES
                        Great. Well, you would know. I’m 
                        just glad she has you. You know? 
                        That you’re so...in sync.  

                                 MIKE
                             (pointed)
                        You mean like you and Liz? 

           James looks thrown. What’s that supposed to mean?  The subway 
           arrives.  It’s very loud.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        YOU TAKING THIS?

                                 JAMES
                        NO, LOCAL.

           Mike gets on and James watches him, a bit shaken.     

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET. DAY.

           Liz walks anxiously down the street until she sees...      

           Mike standing at a gate, gazing into the park. 

           She walks over and stands beside him. They stare out 
           together.  No words.  Sounds of the park.  Then --    
                                 LIZ
                        Yeah. It’s a potato chip. 

           REVERSE ANGLE: reveals that what they’ve been staring at is a 
           crane lifting a gigantic 80 FOOT POTATO CHIP! It looks like a 
           giant post modern art installation. 

                                 MIKE
                        I thought you were kidding. 

                                 LIZ
                             (Self loathing)
                        Nope.  No, I was not.  

           They continue to watch the giant POTATO CHIP being installed, 
           as TOURISTS and NATIVES alike point and snap photos. The 
           line: “CRACKLES: BIG CRUNCH. BIGGER FLAVOR.” is slowly 
           revealed on the front of this monumental absurdity.  

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry about yesterday. I guess 
                        I sorta lost control. 

                                 LIZ
                        No, it’s -- understandable. 

                                 MIKE
                        Is it? 

                                 LIZ
                             (nervous beat)
                        Mike, I need to tell you something. 
                        I...I gave Christina the letters. 
                        From Ryan Caster? You dropped them 
                        and I took them; I shouldn’t have 
                        done it. It’s none of my business 
                        and I guess I thought --  

           Mike kisses her! It’s emotional and passionate and sweet -- 
           and she doesn’t stop it.  In the background we hear: 

                                 BULLHORN VOICE (O.C.)
                        Please, for your own safety, stand 
                        away from the potato chip!

           Mike pulls away.  Holy shit.  Liz looks around, self-
           consciously, realizing they’re in public.  

                                                           HARD CUT TO:
           INT. MIKE AND CHRISTINA’S APARTMENT. DAY.

           Mike and Liz enter, kissing, groping like teenagers; bumping 
           into furniture! It’s not about sex but something they both 
           need from the other. 

           They kiss against the kitchen counter! The fridge! The wall! 

                                 LIZ
                             (out of breath)
                        Wait! Wait! 
                             (then curiously)
                        Did you use a ghostwriter for your 
                        book? 

                                 MIKE
                        What? Hell no! 

           She kisses him again! He lifts her up and moves her to the 
           other side of the room. She grabs a door handle, turns it, 
           and leads them both into --   

           A BEDROOM. 

           They shuffle in, still kissing. Until Liz realizes he’s gone 
           cold.  She opens her eyes. 

           WE CUT WIDE to reveal that we are in:  

           KATIE’S BEDROOM. 

           Pink and perfectly preserved, like a time capsule. Stuffed 
           animals on the bed, clothes in the closet, a poster of Rey 
           from Star Wars. A colorful drawing on the wall of Christina, 
           Mike and herself all holding hands. 

           A gut punch. 

           Liz turns back to Mike -- but he’s already left the room. She 
           stands alone, shaking...what the hell am I doing? 

           EXT. STREET. DAY. 

           Christina sits on a bench staring intensely at the plain 
           looking building from before. Next to her is her large bag, 
           the envelope sticking out, unopened.  

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        Coffee?

           Christina looks up to see James holding two coffees.
                                 CHRISTINA
                             (Flustered)
                        James?! What are you doing here?

                                 JAMES
                        What do you mean? We’re on 
                        stakeout, aren’t we? 

           She forces a smile but she clearly doesn’t want him there. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        You really don’t have to do this. 

                                 JAMES
                        I know. But we’re partners. Here.    

           He hands her a coffee and sits beside her. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        James, really, I appreciate it but--

                                 JAMES
                        I even brought these. 
                             (The binoculars)
                        Huh?  And these. 
                             (Some Peanut M&Ms)
                        That might just be my thing. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        James -- 

                                 JAMES
                        Look, Chris, the thing is...I don’t 
                        know what you’re going through. I 
                        can’t know.  But...I know it can’t be 
                        any worse than doing it alone.    

           Christina is moved by the sentiment, but still -- 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        There he is. 

           Ryan exits the building with a few OTHER PEOPLE.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Should we roll?

           He holds out his hand. Christina reluctantly takes it. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           MIKE AND CHRISTINA’S APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS.  

           Liz enters from Katie’s room, her hands shaking. She sees 
           Mike facing the wall, his back to her.  What is there to say? 

                                 LIZ
                        I should go. 

           SMASH! Mike SLAMS his fist into the wall! Liz jumps, startled. 

                                 MIKE
                             (pause)
                        You know what it was? What really 
                        sent Christina into the bathroom 
                        with a knife that night?  
                             (turns to her)
                        She asked me to kill him. Ryan 
                        Caster.
                             (beat)
                        “You can murder men half way around 
                        the world that you’ve never met but 
                        you won’t lift a finger to avenge 
                        your own daughter?” 
                             (beat)
                        She’s right. 

           Liz wants to speak, but has no words. Then suddenly -- 

           BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! More fists into the wall!  Liz cringes in 
           fear and helplessness. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARK. DAY. 

           POV THROUGH BINOCULARS --

           A close up of RYAN CASTER on a park bench, reading Twilight.  

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        You think he’s Team Jacob? 

           REVERSE ANGLE reveals James and Christina watching from a 
           distance. Her eyes focused on Ryan as James watches through 
           the binoculars. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                             (seeing something)
                        What the...?

           POV THROUGH BINOCULARS --  
           A close up view of An 80 ft POTATO CHIP! People taking photos, 
           kids playing near it. But before James can say anything -- 

                                 CHRISTINA (O.C.)
                        You know what no one tells you 
                        about grief? 

           James puts down the binoculars, and turns to her. 

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                             (eyes focused on Ryan)
                        There’s nothing original about it.  
                        And I don’t just mean people who 
                        don’t know what to say and so they 
                        all say the same stupid things. I 
                        mean, even me. It’s like... every 
                        thought or feeling I have seems 
                        somehow... cliché.  Like I saw it 
                        in a movie once.  Or a TV show.  
                        Sometimes I’ll even catch myself 
                        wondering if it’s real.  Are these 
                        even my feelings?  Is this my 
                        anger?  My self pity?  Or did I 
                        steal it from a magazine?

           James watches her, laser focused on Ryan. In her own world. 

                                 JAMES
                        What was it Liz said to you that 
                        night? That made you come out?

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (beat)
                        I just remember wanting her to stop 
                        talking. 

           Suddenly, SOMEONE accidentally BUMPS into Christina -- 
           knocking her bag down! 

                                 JAMES
                        Hey! Asshole! 
                             (to Christina)
                        Jesus, you okay. 

           He bends down to help her gather her things -- 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I got it! I GOT IT!! 

           James backs off, as she anxiously put things back in her bag. 
           Just then James catches a glimpse of -- a gun inside! 

           Holy shit. Was that what I thought it was? 
           She gets back up, tense, wondering if James saw what he saw. 

           James’ mind races.  Putting it all together.  He looks back 
           at Ryan just as the MOTHER arrives with Niles.  Oh shit...

                                 JAMES
                        You know, hey! I’m hungry! Are you 
                        hungry? Let’s go get a nice lunch. 
                        My treat!   

                                 CHRISTINA
                        I’m fine. But you should go. 

           Christina takes off as Ryan and Niles leave the park together. 
           And James runs to catch up. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MIKE AND CHRISTINA’S APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS. 

           Liz stares at Mike’s bloody hand as he paces. 

                                 LIZ
                        Mike? 

           She walks to him, cautiously. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Mike, it’s not your fault. 

                                 MIKE
                             (explodes)
                        What the are you even talking 
                        about?! Huh?! Do you even know?! 
                        Why the fuck are you even here!

           Liz is completely taken aback. 

                                 LIZ
                        What do you...?  I wanted to help, 
                        to, to understand --  

                                 MIKE
                        Why?! What exactly is it you want 
                        to understand?!

           He approaches her, menacingly. She backs away. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hm? What are you hoping to see!?  

                                 LIZ
                        Nothing, I...
                                 MIKE
                        I mean, is this some charity box 
                        you’re checking off? Or are you 
                        just rubbernecking!?  

                                 LIZ
                        No! No, I was just -- 

                                 MIKE
                        Did you know I was driving the car? 
                        Hm? That it’s my fault she’s dead! 
                        Do you understand that?!

                                 LIZ
                        No, Mike, he was drunk -- 

                                 MIKE
                        WRONG!! I wasn’t paying attention! 
                        I always pay attention! I always 
                        know my surroundings. I was trained 
                        for it! But this time I was... 
                        distracted!
                             (beat)
                        I was thinking about my book.  
                             (beat)
                        I was driving and...I was thinking 
                        about my fucking book. 
                             (beat)
                        Next thing I know, we’re upside 
                        down, and there’s glass everywhere, 
                        and Katie’s hanging from her seat 
                        belt, and she’s bleeding from her 
                        neck. And she’s looking at me and 
                        she’s so scared. She’s in shock and 
                        she’s so... scared.

           Mike’s breath begins to catch in his throat. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        He was.. drunk but...it was my 
                        fault. It was...my...fault. 
                        Oh...God. My chest, it’s...!
                             (Grabbing his chest!)
                        I can’t breath, I...I can’t...

           Liz goes to him!

                                 LIZ
                        Okay! It’s okay. Just calm down...  

                                 MIKE
                             (frightened)
                        I can’t...! What’s wrong with me? 
           He goes to his knees. She gets down with him. 

                                 LIZ
                        Shhh. Just breathe. Okay? You’re 
                        having a panic attack! 

                                 MIKE
                        I can’t...

                                 LIZ
                        Yes you can!  Slow. That’s it. 
                        In...out. Good. Breathe.  Slow. 

           He begins to get his breath.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Good, that’s it. 

           Mike begins weeping. Lightly at first but then more.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Shhh. It’s okay. 

           He wraps his arms around her and begins sobbing in her arms.  
           The floodgates bursting open; everything he’s held back. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. I’m here. It’s okay. 

           She hold him, strong, like a mother to a son. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET. DAY.

           Christina walks quickly, as James tries to keep up, staring 
           nervously at her bag. 

                                 JAMES
                        You know, the new Transformers 
                        movie is out! It’s a colossal piece 
                        of shit. We should go check it out!
                             (nothing)
                        Actually, you know, we should call 
                        Mike! He’s a Navy Seal, this is 
                        right up his alley -- 

           She quickly turns to him, eyes aflame. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        Don’t you fucking call him! Do you 
                        understand me? 
           James is frightened into silence. In the distance they see 
           Ryan and Niles walk into a movie theater. Christina follows.  
           And James follows Christina. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOVIE THEATER. DAY.

           Ryan and Niles sit in the 3rd row staring up at the screen with 
           3-D glasses. It’s a loud blockbuster and Niles is spellbound.  

           The auditorium is sparsely attended, a few others in 3-D 
           glasses behind them.  Five rows back we see – 

           James and Christina. Not wearing the 3-D glasses.  

           Christina is focused on Ryan.  James is focused on her bag, 
           which sits on the seat beside her. 

           A GUNSHOT FIRES on screen! James jumps, startled. Christina 
           stands up. 

                                 JAMES
                        Whoa, wait! Where you going??

                                 CHRISTINA
                        The restroom. 

           She takes her bag and heads up the aisle. James watches her 
           exit the theater.  

           He then gets up and walks down the middle aisle, making his 
           way down to the front of the theater. We wonder, is he 
           leaving?  Until he stops and bends down next to -- 

           Ryan Caster, who sits on the aisle beside Niles. James taps 
           him on the arm. Ryan turns to him, confused. 

                                 JAMES
                        Hi, sorry. This gonna sound strange 
                        but I think you should probably --  

                                 RYAN
                             (can’t hear)
                        Huh? 

                                 JAMES
                        I think you should probably leave! 

                                 RYAN
                        What?? 
                                 JAMES
                        I can’t really explain it right now 
                        but you and your son need to leave 
                        the theater.

                                 RYAN
                        The hell are you talking about, 
                        man?!  We haven’t done anything! 

           Ryan turns back to the movie. 

                                 JAMES
                        No, I know – I don’t work here.  
                        Look: your life might be in danger.  

           He turns back to James, his 3-D glasses over his actual ones.  

                                 RYAN
                        What? 

                                 JAMES
                        There’s someone here who may want 
                        to hurt you and I think you should 
                        leave.

           Ryan looks over at Niles, protectively. 

                                 RYAN
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        Hey, shut the fuck up down there! 

                                 JAMES
                        It’s hard to explain but...

           James checks to see if Christina’s returned.  

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        It has to do with -- the accident. 

                                 RYAN
                        What accident? 

                                 JAMES
                        Katie Krill? 

           Ryan’s face turns to stone. 

                                 RYAN
                        What did you say?

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THEATER BATHROOM STALL. CONTINUOUS. 

           Christina sits in the bathroom stall. She staring at the gun 
           in her lap as if trying to muster the courage to use it – or 
           the courage not to.   

           She then catches a glimpse of the envelope sticking out of 
           her bag.  Looking for any distraction, she takes it out. 

           She opens it. Pull out the letters.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOVIE THEATER. CONTINUOUS. 

           Ryan, still in his 3-D glasses, gets up from his seat -- 

                                 RYAN
                        Who the fuck are you?! 

           He pushes James! 

                                 JAMES
                        No one! I’m just trying to help!

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
                        Hey! C’mon! Sit down! 

                                 RYAN
                        I’m with my son, man! You come here 
                        and threaten me – 

                                 JAMES
                        No, I’m not – 

                                 RYAN
                        I’m with my son! 

           He pushes him again!

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER 3
                        I’m with my son too, asshole!

                                 NILES
                        Dad?!

                                 JAMES
                        I’m tying to help you --

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
                        Sit the fuck down, yo!
                                 RYAN
                        I paid my dues, man, okay?! I did 
                        my time! You got something to say, 
                        you come to me! Not when I’m with 
                        my kid!!

           He pushes him again! James reacts by pushing him back! Ryan 
           pushes harder!  And James swings blindly --  !

           WAP!  Right in the face!

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER 4
                        Whoa, fuck, man!

           James is shocked. Did not expect that blow to land. 

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, shit, I’m sorry, I -- 

           Ryan swings -- WAP!  

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER 5
                        Boom, motherfucker!

           James flies back – hard -- against one of seats!  Ryan goes 
           after him.  Wailing on him!  James grabs him by the waist –  

                                 JAMES
                        ARRRGG!!!

           He pushes him back with all of his might. They fly awkwardly --

           -- into the seats of the theater! 

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBERS
                        Whoa! / Shit! / DUDE! / White boys!

           James WAILS back on him, on the ground!  

                                 JAMES
                             (hitting him!)
                        I’M TRYING TO HELP YOU! DO YOU 
                        UNDERSTAND?! I’M FUCKING HELPING 
                        YOU! 

           Suddenly -- he’s YANKED off by two LARGER AUDIENCE MEMBERS! 

                                 LARGE AUDIENCE MEMBER 1
                        Alright, man, it’s over! Chill!

           James, panting, pulls himself away. 

                                 LARGE AUDIENCE MEMBER 2
                        Dude, is he alright? 
           James looks down at Ryan. It’s dark, he can’t see.  But he’s 
           not moving.  Oh no...

                                 JAMES
                        Hey. Hey, shit, are you alright? 

           James goes down to him.  He hears something. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you okay -- ?

           He stops when he realizes that what he hears is...

           Ryan crying softly on the floor. His actual glasses broken.  

           He then looks up to see -- 

           Niles watching his father, still in his 3-D glasses. 

                                 RYAN
                             (tears, to himself)
                        I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to...I 
                        didn’t mean to hit her...I’m so 
                        sorry...I didn’t...

           A look of profound shame on James’ face as he watches tears 
           stream down his Ryan’s pitiful cheeks. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM STALL. CONTINUOUS.

           Christina sits reading Ryan’s letters of contrition. Tears in 
           her eyes.  She finishes.  Puts them down.  Wipes her tears. 

           INT. BATHROOM. CONTINUOUS.

           She steps out of the stall.  Stops to look at herself in the 
           mirror a moment. Perhaps she sees someone she recognizes?

           She turns and exits. As she does, we can see in the reflection...

           ...the gun sitting on the toilet seat.  

           INT. LOBBY. CONTINUOUS. 

           A TEENAGE THEATER MANAGER passes by the restroom with two 
           POLICE OFFICERS, one OLDER, one YOUNGER.  
                                 THEATER MANAGER
                        Yeah, they’re in the theater 4. 
                        They just started like fighting! 

           The POLICE OFFICERS rush toward the theater, as --

           Christina steps out of the bathroom, missing them completely. 
           Or not noticing them?  She turns the opposite direction...and 
           walks calmly out of the theater. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOVIE THEATER. CONTINUOUS.

           James watches guiltily as Ryan is helped off the floor by a 
           Large Audience Member.    

                                 JAMES
                        I’m sorry, I...I didn’t mean to --  

           The OLDER OFFICER grabs James by the arm. 

                                 OLDER OFFICER
                        Alright, buddy, let’s go. 

                                 JAMES
                        Officer, it was my fault. 

                                 OLDER OFFICER
                        Alright, that’s fine, c’mon. 

           The OLDER OFFICER leads James up the aisle. He looks back to 
           see Niles hugging his Dad, who talks to the YOUNGER OFFICER.   

           As James and the OLDER OFFICER pass by his original seat, he 
           notices that Christina never came back. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER. MOMENTS LATER. 

           The TWO POLICE OFFICERS escort him out. 

                                 OLDER OFFICER
                        Alright Mr. Roe, maybe don’t come 
                        back here.  

                                 JAMES
                        Wait. That’s it?
                                 OLDER OFFICER
                        Well, he’s not pressing charges. 
                        Did you want to? 

                                 JAMES
                        No. 

                                 OLDER OFFICER
                        Then get the hell out of here.  

           James turns to go home, dazed. 

                                 YOUNGER OFFICER
                        Hey!

           James turns back to the Younger Officer. 

                                 YOUNGER OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you hate on the last Fast and 
                        the Furious movie? I thought that 
                        shit was dope!  

                                 JAMES
                        I know. I saw it three times. 

           The YOUNGER OFFICER looks confused, as James walks away. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MIKE AND CHRISTINA’S KITCHEN. DAY. 

           Liz gently washes the blood from Mike’s hand in the sink. He 
           watches as it swirls into the drain. 

           She then dries it with a towel.  And wraps it with a bandage. 

                                 LIZ
                        You need to talk to Christina.  
                        She needs to know she’s not alone. 

                                 MIKE
                        I know. 
                             (beat)
                        Part of me wonders if maybe I 
                        showed you those letters because... 
                             (beat)
                        Look, Liz, I’m sorry for -- 

                                 LIZ
                        No. You were right. I don’t know 
                        what the hell I’m doing. 
                                 MIKE
                             (beat)
                        Makes two of us. 

           Liz smiles as she finishes wrapping his hand. A tender moment 
           passes between them. Then Liz turns to see – 

                                 LIZ
                        Chris! 

           Christina stands surveying the situation as Mike and Liz 
           instinctively move away from each other. 

                                 MIKE
                        Baby. I didn’t hear you come in. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What’s going on?

                                 MIKE
                        Nothing. Liz came by to see you and --

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What happened to your hand? 

                                 MIKE
                        Oh. I just...hit it on a stupid -- 

                                 LIZ
                        I should probably go.

           Christina pulls out the envelope.  

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (to Liz)
                        Where did you get these? 

           Liz stops, frozen, like that first night.  Finally, Mike        
           steps in -- 

                                 MIKE
                        From me.  She got ‘em from me. 

           Christina turns to Mike, a look of confusion; betrayal. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        What?

                                 LIZ
                        No, it’s my fault. I just, the 
                        other night, you were hurting so 
                        much and I just - I wanted to help. 

           Chris looks at her, icily.
                                 CHRISTINA
                        You wanted to help.

                                 LIZ
                        Yes. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                             (pointed)
                        And did she help you, Mike? 

                                 MIKE
                        Chris -- 

                                 LIZ
                        No, it’s not like that -- 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        No, what was it like? Helping my 
                        husband? 

                                 MIKE
                        Honey -- 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        No! Liz? I’d like to know. Because, 
                        see, he doesn’t talk to me. He 
                        doesn’t think he can. Did he tell 
                        you that? While you were “helping” 
                        him? How weak and sad and broken 
                        his wife is? I mean, it’s a good 
                        thing he has you. 

                                 LIZ
                        Chris...

           We CLOSE IN on Liz, as she stops herself, not sure what to 
           say.  We wonder, will she freeze again?  But then, a look 
           comes over her, as if she knows exactly what she needs to do. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        The truth is, after that night, I 
                        was ashamed. And I wanted to do 
                        something. Something good. 
                        Something to...I thought if I 
                        could, in some way, make Mike open 
                        up. About Katie. To listen. 
                        Understand what he was going 
                        through. That it would help the two 
                        of you. That I would help the two 
                        of you. And it would feel good to 
                        help. Like I did something. 
                             (re: his hand)
                        But he made it very clear that I 
                        only came here to help myself.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                             (then)
                        And that you’re the only person who 
                        could ever possibly understand him.  

           This hits Christina hard. She looks at Mike. This is all she 
           ever wanted to hear.  

           Liz, seeing her self-sacrifice take effect, turns to leave. 

                                 CHRISTINA
                        You selfish cunt.  

           Liz stops; her back to Christina, who looks stronger than ever.  

                                 CHRISTINA (CONT’D)
                             (calm, plain)
                        You’ll never know what it is to 
                        lose something you love. Because 
                        you’ll never love anything more 
                        than yourself. 

           Liz nods, accepting her punishment. Then continues to the 
           door.  Just before she leaves, turns back to see...

           Christina and Mike talking, quietly, close together. He hugs 
           her. Lovingly. 

           INT. HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS.

           We follow Liz as she walks slowly down the hallway.  She 
           stops at the elevator.  Calmly pushes the button.  And waits.  

           DING!  

           The doors open. She gets on the -- 

           ELEVATOR. CONTINUOUS.

           Doors close. 

           And she crumbles to the ground; sobbing uncontrollably.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAMES AND LIZ’S APARTMENT. DAY.

           James walks in. Back eye. Limping. He looks like shit and 
           feels worse.  He shuffles into -- 
           THE KITCHEN

           He reaches into the freezer and pulls out some frozen shrimp 
           and places it on his face. 

           He walks over to the infamous Star Trek poster. Stares at his 
           reflection in it.  Behind him he sees – 

           The couch.  Blankets all folded up.  Edward gone.  Except...

           ...his lap top.  James sighs. Pulls out his phone, and texts: 

           “You left your laptop here.” 

           DING! James see Edwards’ cell on the floor. He left that too? 

           He flips open the lap top.  It’s flooded with pictures –

           -- of Karen. Some with Edward, some without. Some when she’s 
           sick, some healthy. 

           James limps over to the bookshelf.  Picks up: CYSTYPHEAN 
           MYTHS by Edward Roe.  Opens it.  And begins reading. 

           He sits on the couch and continues reading, curiously, as 
           though he had never read it before...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MONITOR ROOM. DAY. 

           The Three Crackles EXECS stand talking by the monitors. 

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                        ...I think we start rolling this  
                        out next week in major markets.. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        Right, we can loop the Chicago 
                        office in in the morning...

           In the background we see -- Liz on the monitor tearing apart 
           the CRACKLES DISPLAY in the store. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1 
                        I’d love for Liz to be on that call 
                        if possible...

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        Definitely, I think she has to be. 
                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                        Also, we might want to consider if 
                        there’s a way to connect this more 
                        directly with the big chip. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        Hey - what the -- what is that?  

           They all turn to see, Liz -- tearing apart the display on screen! 

           INT. GROCERY STORE. CONTINUOUS.

           The Shoppers watch, riveted, as Liz wildly takes apart the 
           Crackle display!  

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                        Liz! What are you doing? 

                                 LIZ
                        This is fucking stupid! You don’t 
                        put shitty snack food next to 
                        produce! It doesn’t make sense! 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        It was your idea! 

                                 LIZ
                        Well, I was wrong! It’s stupid and 
                        it’s dumb! 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        But – it’s working. 

                                 LIZ
                        How do you know? Huh? We’re in a 
                        fake store! This is all fake! These 
                        oranges?! They’re plastic! This 
                        lettuce? I don’t even know it’s 
                        made of! It tells us nothing about 
                        how people act when you surround 
                        them with rubber fucking potatoes!!

           She throws a potato! It bounces! 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1
                        Liz, calm down – 

           STORE ENTRANCE. CONTINUOUS. 

           James walks into the “store” looking for Liz. He hears the 
           commotion.  And walks over to see the Shoppers watching -- 
           Liz holding the line “BIG CRUNCH” over her head! 

                                 JAMES 
                        Liz?

           Liz turns to James. Lost, child-like.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GROCERY STORE, CEREAL AISLE. MOMENTS LATER. 

           James holds Liz’s hands to calm her down. 

                                 JAMES
                        You okay?  

                                 LIZ
                        No. I’m not okay. I don’t like 
                        myself lately and I don’t like us 
                        and --   

                                 JAMES
                        No, you’re right. I’ve been an 
                        asshole. And you were right about me--  

                                 LIZ
                        No, you were right! 

                                 JAMES
                        And I got insecure and I started 
                        looking for something I thought I 
                        needed and then I realized I don’t 
                        need to look because it’s -- 

                                 LIZ
                         -- I kissed Mike.

           James’ expression freezes on his face.  For, like, a while. 

                                 JAMES
                        What?

                                 LIZ
                        I kissed him. It was an accident. 

                                 JAMES
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 LIZ
                        After that night, I went back to 
                        see Christina. But Mike was there. 
                        And he was in so much pain and --  
                                 JAMES
                        So, sorry -- you kissed him?

                                 LIZ
                        Well, no! Actually. He kissed me. 

                                 JAMES
                        He kissed you?

                                 LIZ
                        Yes. I mean, I stopped him! 
                        Obviously. But then he did it again 
                        and I...sort of let him. (Then) But 
                        just for a little --!

                                 JAMES
                        Wait, wait -- 

                                 LIZ
                         -- Like ten seconds! 

                                 JAMES
                        Ten - ?! You kissed Mike for ten --

                                 LIZ
                         -- He kissed me for ten seconds! I 
                        let him for like four.  

                                 JAMES
                             (cold, beat)
                        What were you doing for the other 
                        six?

                                 LIZ
                        It was stupid and I’m so sorry.    

           James takes a moment to let this sink in. 

                                 JAMES
                        So, what, that was it?

                                 LIZ
                        Yes! And then I left! 

           James looks relieved. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        But then...

           He tenses again. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        He kissed me again. More. Later. 
                        And I let him. More. 
           James stands speechless against a sea of fake cereal boxes.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to tell you. I was just -- 
                        so confused. All the different 
                        emotions, and then seeing him in so 
                        much pain! If you had been there, 
                        if you had seen him...

                                 JAMES
                        ...I would have kissed him too?

                                 LIZ
                        No, I mean --! He was -- crying! 

                                 JAMES
                        Crying, huh?

                                 LIZ
                        And I didn’t know what to do, I, I -
                        - I mean, his daughter had died!  

                                 JAMES
                        And what does he get if Christina 
                        dies? A rim job? 

           Liz suddenly goes from guilt to anger. 

                                 LIZ
                        Fuck you! 

                                 JAMES
                        Fu - ? Fuck me? Why fuck me? 

           The LARGE MAN from before mows on potato chips as he watches 
           this with a few other Shoppers -- like it’s a movie. 

                                 LIZ
                        Because you understand and you’re 
                        pretending not to!

                                 JAMES
                        No, you’re wrong! I don’t 
                        understand!

                                 LIZ
                        Yes you do! But all you hear is, 
                        is, is – sex! When it wasn’t even 
                        about that! 

                                 JAMES
                        No? What was it? His book review?  

           A SHOPPER laughs. Then looks embarrassed. 
                                 LIZ
                        I didn’t have to tell you! 

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, I agree! Why the fuck are you 
                        telling me?!

                                 LIZ
                        Because! What do you mean? We tell 
                        each other everything! That’s our 
                        thing!

                                 JAMES
                        That’s not our thing! Our thing is 
                        that we don’t let work get in the 
                        way of our relationship!

                                 LIZ
                        We have more than one fucking 
                        thing!  

                                 JAMES
                        Well, I don’t remember your thing! 
                        I think you’re telling me because 
                        you feel guilty! Because you 
                        fucking enjoyed it! 

                                 LIZ
                        Yes! Yes! Okay! I did fucking enjoy 
                        it! Because I felt fucking important!  
                        Like I mattered! Like this was a real 
                        situation with real human emotions 
                        and it wasn’t a joke or ridiculous 
                        or, or -- ironic! And I don’t know if 
                        I feel like that ever! 

           James feels the sting of this one. 

                                 JAMES
                        Well. I’m sorry our marriage has 
                        been such a “joke” to you.

           He turns to leave – 

                                 LIZ
                        James, don’t!

                                 JAMES
                             (confused)
                        Don’t what?

                                 LIZ
                        Don’t go and fight him. 
                                 JAMES
                             (incredulous)
                        Fight him?!? Is that what --? He’s 
                        a fucking Navy Seal, Liz! I’m not 
                        gonna fucking fight him! Who do you 
                        think I -- ? 

           The Crackles EXECS rush into the aisle, excitedly. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        Liz! Liz! 

                                 LIZ
                        WHAT!??!

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1
                        You’re a genius! Why didn’t you 
                        tell us? 

                                 LIZ
                        Tell you what? 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 1
                        Your brother-in-law? The comedy 
                        writer? 

                                 JAMES
                             (concerned)
                        What about him?

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                        He’s standing on top of one of our 
                        chips in Tomkins Square!

           We CLOSE IN on James’ face.  Holy shit. 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2
                        Press is there, people taking 
                        pictures – it’s brilliant! 

           James looks at Liz – they both realize. James runs out! 

                                 MALE EXECUTIVE 2 (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 LIZ
                        He’s gonna kill himself.

           The Crackles EXECS look at each other.

                                 FEMALE EXECUTIVE
                        That would not be good. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. TOMKINS SQUARE PARK. DAY. 

           James pushes through a crowd of PEOPLE looking up at the 80    
           Foot Potato Chip. Pointing, taking pictures. James follows 
           their gaze to see...

           Edward sitting on the top. Just above the infamous tag line.  

                                 JAMES
                        Jesus Christ.

           He runs over to the base of the giant snack food. In the back 
           are two light alloy support structures that run up the sides. 

           He takes a deep breath. And begins to climb.  

           Meanwhile, a few feet over...

           Liz and the Crackles EXECS make their way through the crowd 
           of GAWKERS, staring up at Edward. 

                                 LIZ
                        Oh my God. 

           EXT. THE TOP OF THE CHIP. CONTINUOUS.  

           Edward sits on the highest point of the chip, which is about 
           three feet wide. He eats Peanut M&Ms and drinks an Orange 
           Pellegrino. He looks down at all the PEOPLE taking photos.

                                 JAMES (O.C.)
                        Ah, God...!

           He turns to see -- James struggling to reach the top. 

                                 EDWARD
                        You see this? With the selfies?

           James struggles to lift his leg over the lip of the Chip. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I’m killing myself and they wanna 
                        Instagram it.

           James finally reaches the top, exhausted. 

                                 JAMES
                             (panting)
                        Yeah, well...you are on a giant... 
                        fucking potato chip.  

                                 EDWARD
                        Here. 
           Edward hands him the Pellegrino. James takes it. 

                                 JAMES
                             (re: the climb)
                        Jesus, that sucked. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah. Ruffles would’ve been easier.  

           James looks down, nervously, a few feet from Edward. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        What happened to your face? 

                                 JAMES
                        Edward, what are you doing up here? 

           Eddie looks down at the crowd below, existentially. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        Eddie -- ?

                                 EDWARD
                        You know what pain is? It’s like an 
                        early warning system.  To keep us 
                        alive. “Hey, that’s hot, stop 
                        touching it.” Right? And we listen.  
                        We stop touching it, we learn and we 
                        live longer. But what happens when 
                        you ignore the warning? You call its 
                        bluff and you keep touching it. And 
                        you don’t die? Then what?  I mean, 
                        you felt more agony than you thought 
                        possible and you’re still here so 
                        what’s the point of pain?  

           James watches his brother vulnerable for the first time. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        So one day you go numb. You don’t 
                        feel pain, you don’t feel anything.  
                        And it’s terrifying. And it becomes 
                        clear to you that the only way to 
                        fix what’s broken is to honor the 
                        original agreement yourself. To do 
                        what your body failed to do...  

                                 JAMES
                        Eddie -- 
                                 EDWARD
                        So you go to the Wiliamsburg Bridge.
                        Look down like George Bailey and 
                        think “okay, this seems alright.”  
                        But then something stops you.  

                                 JAMES
                        The girl taking the selfie.

                                 EDWARD
                        No. You. 

                                 JAMES
                        Me? 

                                 EDWARD
                        You called me. And, well, you don’t 
                        call much, so.  And suddenly it 
                        just felt silly. Jumping off a 
                        bridge? I mean, it’s just so...

                                 JAMES
                             (Christina’s line:)
                        Cliche.

           Edward turns to him, yes, exactly. 

                                 EDWARD
                        But then I realized, that’s because 
                        my death isn’t enough to make it 
                        right. 

                                 JAMES
                        Make what right? What are you 
                        talking about? 

           Edward looks at him, a tear escapes his eye. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I turned her into joke, Jimmy.

                                 JAMES
                        No...

                                 EDWARD
                        All of her suffering and her pain 
                        and her fight and I turned it into 
                        the “funniest book ever written 
                        about bone cancer.” 

                                 JAMES
                        Eddie -- 
                                 EDWARD
                        But then I’m walking down Avenue A 
                        and there it is. The answer. A 
                        colossal fucking potato chip. Truly 
                        the dumbest, most absurd thing I’ve 
                        ever seen. And it’s perfect. 
                        Because now I can be the joke. 

           Edward leans over, as if drawn by the distance below.

                                 JAMES
                        Eddie...I read it again today. Your 
                        book? And...I didn’t understand it 
                        before but now...I think it’s the 
                        most beautiful thing I’ve ever read. 

           Edward turns to him, stopped by this. 

                                 JAMES (CONT’D)
                        But then I know how you used to 
                        talk to each other. All those weird 
                        little inside jokes, that twisted, 
                        dark sense of humor she had? That’s 
                        the book. It’s hilarious. But it’s 
                        not a joke. It’s a love letter to 
                        that strange...indecipherable 
                        language you guys shared. And I 
                        didn’t understand until today how 
                        much you loved her.  
                             (beat, realizing)
                        Or how lucky I am. 

           Edward is struck by this admission. So is James. They both 
           look out at the city. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I miss her, Jimmy. 

                                 JAMES
                        I know. 
                             (beat)
                        Why don’t you come and stay with us 
                        for a while? Just until you...until 
                        you want to leave.  

                                 EDWARD
                        I don’t wanna get in the way of 
                        your life or --

                                 JAMES
                        Jesus, Eddie. You’re my big 
                        brother. You’re part of my life. 

           Edward is sincerely moved. 
                                 EDWARD
                        You are lucky. You know that. 

                                 JAMES
                        I do now. Yeah. 

                                 LIZ (O.C.)
                        Help...!

           They turn to see -- Liz climbing up to the lip of the chip!

                                 EDWARD
                             (like it’s normal)
                        Hey, Liz. 

                                 JAMES
                        Jesus, what are you doing?! 

           James goes to help her. He pulls her up on the lip.  

                                 LIZ
                             (panting)
                        Oh my God...that was harder than it 
                        looked.

                                 EDWARD
                        Yeah, they should make their chips 
                        with ridges?

                                 LIZ
                             (still panting)
                        They can’t. They’re Kettle cooked. 

           James stares at Liz, warmly.  He can’t believe she came up.  

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Whoa...it’s beautiful up here. 

                                 JAMES
                             (smiling at her)
                        It is.  

           Liz looks at James, who’s still staring at her, lovingly. 

           No words needed. Forgiveness, understanding, stupidity, 
           embarrassment - all in one wordless moment. 

           He takes her hand. And they look at view together. 

                                 LIZ
                        Hey, you can see the Queensboro 
                        Bridge! God, it’s so...
                                 JAMES
                        Ugly.

                                 LIZ
                        It’s so ugly. 

           REVERSE ANGLE from behind all of them, as they stare out at New 
           York City. The song “KEEP ON SMILING” by Wet Willie plays softly.  

                                 EDWARD
                        Liz, what did you think of my book?

                                 LIZ
                        Your book?  Oh.  Um.  It was....  

                                 EDWARD
                        Wait, you read it, right?  

                                 LIZ
                             (admission)
                        I’m like half way through.

                                 EDWARD
                        You’re shitting me. 

           CUT TO A WIDE SHOT: of the three of them on top of the potato 
           chip with the sign: “BIG CRUNCH. BIGGER FLAVOR.”  

                                 JAMES
                        She’s been really busy.

                                 EDWARD
                        It’s about the death of my wife!

                                 LIZ
                        I know, I’m so sorry. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Well, maybe you’ll finish it now 
                        that we’re living together.

           The song continues as we pull back wider seeing the park, 
           People taking pictures...the Press...

                                 LIZ
                        What?

                                 JAMES
                        Yeah, hope it’s okay. Eddie’s gonna 
                        sorta stay with us for a while. 

                                 LIZ
                             (why not?)
                        Okay. 
                                 EDWARD
                        Which reminds me...did you pick up 
                        any cereal?

                                 LIZ
                             (sardonic)
                        Yeah, Eddie, I brought it up here 
                        with me. 

           ...then wider...the neighborhood...the city...

                                 JAMES
                        Jesus. This thing is really fucking 
                        ridiculous. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:
