          Adam Riback
          Echo Lake Entertainment
           OPEN ON: 

           A DOORWAY. Total blackness beyond it. Everything’s still. 

           After several seconds A YOUNG MAN (20s) emerges from the 
           dark. He’s STUNNING. The grace of a dancer. The body of 
           adonis. The package of a porn star. 

           We know this because he’s NAKED.

           He takes a step inside and stops in his tracks.

           A YOUNG WOMAN (20s), just as beautiful and just as naked, 
           stands in the center of the room. 

           They lock eyes. 

           CUT TO BLACK. 

           The green acid burn of an AFTERIMAGE hangs in the air. 
           Pulsing before our eyes. Strange and beautiful. 

           BACK TO THE SCENE. 

           The COUPLE have closed the distance. Standing before one 
           another with perfect posture. 

           CUT TO BLACK.  

           Another AFTERIMAGE somersaults in the empty space. Their 
           outlines popping and fizzing before the ghost recedes. 

           BACK TO THE SCENE. 

           The woman slowly extends her hand, taking him by the wrist. 

           AFTERIMAGE

           She never breaks eye contact as she lifts his hand to her 
           mouth. We hear the slick pop of saliva with INTENSE CLARITY 
           AND VOLUME as she rolls his fingers in her mouth. 

           AFTERIMAGE

           She guides his hand downwards. Slowly passing her breasts. 
           Her perfect abdomen. Descending towards her pubic hair which 
           rises up from the bottom of the frame. 

           AFTERIMAGE

           A small exhale escapes her lips, yet we experience it like 
           the RUSH OF A SUBWAY CAR. Her eyes bulge as she SLIDES HIS 
           FINGERS INSIDE HER. 
           AFTERIMAGE

           We’re on the young man’s eyes as they slowly rim closed. 
           Surrendering to it. The shiver down his spine. The frisson. 

           THIS IS UNLIKE ANY SEX YOU’VE EVER HAD. 

           And as she covers his eyes with a BLINDFOLD, we-- 

           CUT TO BLACK.

           AFTERIMAGE. Her outline floats in the dark like an ink blot 
           test. Then from the black, our title slowly resolves:   

                                    b  l  u  R 

           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

           We find ourselves in the mundanity of an apartment. No rock 
           hard bodies, or phantom imagery. We’re in the REAL WORLD now. 
           Filled with compromise, strange smells and imperfect people. 

           Like LIAM (29). 

           He’s hunched over, glasses slipping as he impotently clicks 
           at a long-reach BBQ lighter. He’s got a nervous demeanor 
           about him. Real tight in the shoulders. 

           As he struggles--

                                 VOICE (O.S.) 
                        What are you doing? 

           AMY (29), his girlfriend, appears in the cramped kitchenette. 

                                 AMY 
                        You seriously want to light 
                        candles? You’re a freak.
                             (kisses him on the cheek)
                        Relax. 

           She gently takes the lighter, puts it in a drawer and crosses 
           off. Liam calls out after her--

                                 LIAM
                        You almost ready? 
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Amy does her makeup in the mirror. She’s exceedingly cute. 
           That wholesome look that emboldens shy guys in bars. 

           She puts down her brush. Stretching out a small tangle of 
           wrinkles by her eyes. Miniscule to us. Not so to her. She 
           lets out a dissatisfied sigh. PRELAP the BZZZZ of a DOORBELL.

           INT. DINING ROOM / KITCHENETTE - NIGHT

           The front door swings open revealing BOBBY (29), smiling big, 
           standing with his arms wide open. 

                                 BOBBY
                        This fucking guy.

           Bobby yanks Liam in for a hug. He’s a fun guy. A great hang. 
           But beneath the boyish grin there’s a restlessness about him. 
           Like he’s always looking for a better party to go to.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes. 
                        Lemme just drink you in for sec--

                                 LIAM
                             (laughing, untangling)
                        Alright. Alright. It’s good to see 
                        you too. And this must be Lydia. 

           From the doorway emerges LYDIA (29), Bobby’s girlfriend. 

                                 LYDIA 
                        Liam. Great to finally meet you. 

           Liam doesn’t nail the greeting, fumbling through an awkward 
           half-hug. As they release we get our first good look at her:

           She’s stunning. Graceful. Sleek. Radiating easy confidence. 
           Like someone who’s used to business lunches and shaking 
           hands. Liam’s practically stunned. Then, recovering--

                                 LIAM
                        Lemme grab your coat. 

           INT. DINING ROOM / KITCHENETTE - NIGHT 

           Bobby searches for music on Liam’s LAPTOP. Clicking through  
           tab after tab on his messy internet browser. Meanwhile, Liam 
           shuttles food to the kitchen table, where the ladies now sit. 
           Their apartment’s been decorated with care. Pinterest 
           stylings classing up cheap Ikea staples. An attempt to pull 
           off an aesthetic they can’t quite afford. 

           Lydia speaks. Recounting their story for the umpteenth time.  

                                 LYDIA
                        We had been on-again, off-again 
                        while I was in grad school in San 
                        Francisco, and when he moved back 
                        here, I think we both figured that 
                        was the end of it. But then this 
                        transfer opportunity came up at 
                        work, and we figured why not give 
                        it a shot? 

                                 BOBBY
                        You shoulda seen these texts I was 
                        sending her. They belong in a 
                        museum. 

                                 LIAM
                        The Museum of Desperate Men? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Exactly. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Dude, they would fill the walls. 

           They all laugh. Relaxing now. Opening nerves fading away.  

           INT. DINING ROOM / KITCHENETTE - NIGHT

           MINUTES LATER. Twelve dollar RED WINE pools in mismatched 
           wine stems. Bobby holds court, pouring for the table. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I wanna propose a toast. To all my 
                        people finally in the same place. 
                        For me, this is a dream come true. 

           Before he can pour the last stem, Amy blocks her glass. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        What? You don’t want? 

                                 AMY
                        No, I’m good. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You sure? You don’t want a beer or 
                        something for the toast?
           A hint of panic flashes across Amy’s face as Bobby pushes. 
           Lydia bounces a look off Bobby’s forehead. Amy notices it. 
           Before things get awkward--

                                 AMY
                        I’m fine. Really. It’s nothing. 
                        Nothing bad, I’m just trying this 
                        thing out. Like a sober month type 
                        of deal. But please, go, go, go--

                                 LYDIA
                        That’s awesome. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s interesting to think about. 
                        Like, if I didn’t drink, would I 
                        have abs? Would that be a thing?  

                                 LIAM
                             (laughing)
                        No. Definitely not. 

                                 BOBBY
                        No dude, I think I probably would--

                                 LYDIA
                             (to Amy)
                        Well I think that’s awesome, Amy. 
                        Like kickass. And brave. I’m 
                        already proud of you.

                                 AMY
                        Well it’s only been a few days so 
                        don’t celebrate me too hard.

                                 LYDIA
                             (raising her glass)
                        Oh come on. To Amy!

           They all cheers. Good vibes flowing in the warm atmosphere. 
           From here we JUMPCUT between several SNAPSHOTS OF THE NIGHT: 

           [Empty wine bottles and purple teeth accumulating throughout]

                                 BOBBY
                        It was our first week in the dorms. 
                        I come home one night, and I catch 
                        Liam, hunched over like this, pubes 
                        everywhere. I almost transferred. 

           Liam winces, embarrassed, as we CUT TO another snapshot-- 
           Liam and Amy’s fingers are interlaced. Liam’s mid-story--

                                 LIAM
                        Sophomore year was “Wild Amy.” 
                             (to Bobby)
                        You remember wild Amy? When she was 
                        on the dance floor no man, woman, 
                        or child was safe. If you were in 
                        the vicinity, you were getting 
                        grinded. 

           Amy laughs. Grinding in her chair. She’s still got it.  

           CUT TO another snapshot--

                                 LYDIA
                        Honestly. We could’ve just eaten a 
                        four course meal. Apps. Mains. 
                        Lobster. Whatever. But if there’s 
                        like anything left on my plate -- 
                        the second I turn my head -- he 
                        pops it in his mouth. Gone. 
                             (she shakes her head, 
                              exasperated)
                        What’s wrong with you? 

           Bobby shrugs. Popping food into his mouth. Lydia eye-rolls. 

           CUT TO another snapshot-- 

           Bobby is hunched over LIAM’S LAPTOP. Clicking away at it. 

                                 BOBBY
                             (drunk)
                        Jesus man, how many tabs do you 
                        have open?? Okay -- here it is --

           Bobby opens YOUTUBE. A hip-hop instructional video plays. 
           Liam, Amy, and Bobby crowd around the screen. Trying to learn 
           this dance. Bobby makes the first attempt. Drunk and clumsy. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Is it like this? Am I doing it? 

           Lydia covers her face. Ashamed. Amy laughs, hugging Lydia. 
           Then, Bobby trips and FALLS. The room erupts in laughter.

           PRELAP the high-pitched wheeze of an AEROBED MOTOR.

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        You’re sure this isn’t weird? 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

           Liam blows up an inflatable mattress on the living room 
           floor. Bobby’s already laying on top of it. Half passed out.

                                 LIAM
                        Are you kidding? Not at all. You’re 
                        not gonna drag him all the way 
                        across town like this.  

                                 BOBBY
                             (groaning)
                        I can’t go in a car right now...

                                 LIAM
                        It’s fine. We’ll get food in the 
                        morning. It’ll be fun.
                             (then)
                        You got everything you need? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Yes. Thank you guys. For 
                        everything. This was great. 

                                 LIAM
                        Our pleasure. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Liam enters and closes the door behind him. Amy is getting 
           ready for bed, rubbing lotion on her arms. She whispers, so 
           as not to be heard through paper-thin walls. 

                                 AMY
                        How is he? 

                                 LIAM
                        He’ll be fine. 

                                 AMY
                        Is he gonna barf?

                                 LIAM
                        Fifty-fifty.
                             (off her look)
                        Kidding. Kidding.

           Liam climbs into bed next to her. Pulling her into his arms.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Did you have fun tonight? 
                                 AMY
                        Yeah. It was great. We did such a 
                        good job. 
                             (then)
                        I really like her. 

                                 LIAM
                        Yeah she’s great. She seems to have 
                        her shit together. 

                                 AMY
                        Unlike the last girl. Or the girl 
                        before that. 

                                 LIAM
                        Or the girl before that.
                             (cuddling closer, then)
                        God, I’m so lucky. 

           She turns, touching his cheek. Looking him in the eyes.  

                                 AMY
                        Me too. 

           They kiss. We feel the warmth of their connection in the 
           shallow glow of the bedside lamp. Then she CLICKS IT OFF. 

           COMPLETE BLACKNESS for a beat before giggling, whispers and 
           clumsy plastic fumbling spill in through the thin walls. 

                                 LIAM 
                        No...

                                 AMY 
                        They wouldn’t, would they? 

                                 LIAM 
                             (after a beat)
                        Are you fucking kidding me...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           THE NEXT MORNING. The place is a wreck. Our characters look 
           even worse. Bobby and Lydia sleep on the floor. Clammy skin. 
           Puffy faces. Today already sucks and it isn’t even 10 AM.  

           Amy appears, shaking Bobby awake.

                                 AMY
                        Hey. Wake up.
           INT. DELI - DAY

           A disgusting amount of CREAM CHEESE slides across the counter 
           top. Bobby stares at it like a heroin addict. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh fuck yeah. 

           Bobby stuffs the containers in a bag with napkins, Splenda. 
           Over his shoulder, a TV plays a MORNING TALK SHOW on mute. 
           Professional hosts laugh and shmooze. Fake tans. Big smiles. 

           Bobby glances up at it. 

           The crawl on the bottom reads: TRYST VR SET FOR U.S. RELEASE. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        You ready? 

           Amy appears from behind him. She snaps up the sweating bag of 
           bagels, and makes for the door. 

           After they exit, we linger on the TV. The host dons VR 
           headgear, reacting wildly, swatting at the air. As her 
           cohosts howl with laughter we PRELAP: 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        What’s it been now? Six years? 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           Amy and Bobby walk home, breath steaming in the morning cold. 

                                 AMY
                        Seven. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Wow. 

                                 AMY
                        Yep.  

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s crazy.  

                                 AMY
                        I know. We’re getting older. 

                                 BOBBY
                        No. 

                                 AMY
                        What do you mean, ‘no’? 
                                 BOBBY
                        I mean no. Not really. 

                                 AMY
                        It’s how time works, Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Ehh. You’re not as old as you think 
                        you are, Aim. 

           A pause. We realize they’re walking slowly. Body geography 
           suggesting a closeness we may not have picked up on before. 
           Bobby cracks a smile. Amy side-eyes him.   

                                 AMY
                        What? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Nothing. 

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 BOBBY
                        If it’s been seven years with you 
                        and Liam, that means that our 
                        little thing was--
                             (mental math)
                        Seven and a couple months ago? 

                                 AMY
                        Oh God, Bobby. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                        To call that a ‘thing’ is a gross 
                        mischaracterization. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What would you call it? 

                                 AMY
                        College. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Okay fine. But whatever it was -- I 
                        remember it being fun. You remember 
                        different? 
                             (off her silence)
                        Must be that old lady memory of 
                        yours. Maybe you are as old as you 
                        say.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        Anyway -- I’m happy we ended when 
                        we did. You and Liam are perfect 
                        together. I’m so happy for you two. 

           Amy glances up, searching his face, finding sincerity. She 
           nods ‘thanks.’ They continue on for a couple steps before--

                                 AMY
                             (re: Lydia)
                        You know she’s great, right?  

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, I know. 

                                 AMY
                        Don’t fuck it up, okay? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Right. 

           A beat. He throws his arm around her. She leans into him. 
           They walk like this in comfortable quiet. Sharing a moment.

           INT. DINING ROOM / KITCHENETTE - DAY

           Liam exits the bedroom to find Lydia tidying up. She looks 
           out of place and overdressed in last night’s clothes. 

                                 LIAM
                        Morning. How we feeling? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Like I need to shower. Would it be--

                                 LIAM
                        It wouldn’t be weird. You can 
                        borrow whatever from Amy. She won’t 
                        care. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Thanks. Again. 

           Liam waves her off, as she crosses over to her purse. Digging 
           around in it. Liam notices her phone on the kitchen table. 

                                 LIAM
                        You mind if I use your phone?  I 
                        need to call mine. Can’t find it. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Yeah of course. 
           Liam unlocks the phone and reacts, seeing himself in the 
           REVERSED CAMERA. He subtly shakes his head. Eyebrows arching. 
           Lydia clocks the reaction from across the room.  

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 LIAM
                        Camera’s in selfie mode. 

                                 LYDIA
                        And? 

           Caught, Liam tries to play off his reaction. Acting casual. 
           This only makes him look more condescending. Lydia considers 
           him for a beat.  

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t take a lot of selfies, Liam? 

                                 LIAM
                        Just not my thing, I guess. 

                                 LYDIA
                        No? Why’s that you think? Lemme ask 
                        you: do you dance much at parties? 
                        Sing karaoke at the bar?  
                             (intuiting)
                        No? 

           Liam shifts, uncomfortable. 

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        Just cause you can’t, doesn’t mean 
                        I shouldn’t.

           Liam’s DUMBFOUNDED. He looks like a Middle-schooler who just 
           got pantsed. Lydia collects the last couple things from her 
           purse and approaches the table. 

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        Towels?  

                                 LIAM
                        They’re in there. 

           Lydia walks off. The sound of feet disappearing down the 
           hallway. Moments later a door shuts and the shower hisses on.

           Liam stays seated. Collecting himself. Watching as steam 
           whispers out from underneath the bathroom door. 

           CUT TO BLACK. 
           INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

           Liam’s in the dark. Blue light reflected in his glasses as he 
           sits in front of a LARGE MONITOR. Images jitter past as he 
           scrubs through the timeline of his EDITING SOFTWARE. 

           His face is slack. He looks totally under-stimulated. He 
           takes off his glasses, pinching the strain they left behind.

           INT. POST PRODUCTION FACILITY - DAY  

           Liam exits his editing bay into the common area of a POST 
           HOUSE. Coworkers mill about, chatting. Liam mumbles hello as 
           he walks past them towards the water cooler. 

           As he fills his Nalgene, Liam notices a DELIVERY MAN wheeling 
           in a hand truck filled with electronics. Boxing reads TRYST. 

                                 LIAM
                        What’s that? 

                                 COWORKER
                        New VR. Lab got some demos. 

                                 LIAM
                        Is it that teleporter thing? 

                                 COWORKER
                        Nah. It’s the sexy kind... 

           The coworkers giggle. Liam clearly has no idea what they’re 
           talking about. But before he can ask-- 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Liam. 

           Liam’s boss MARTIN (30s) appears impatiently in the doorway. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Can I talk to you? 

           INT. EDITING BAY - DAY 

           On a monitor we see footage of some reality TV show. REAL 
           HOUSEWIVES of Wherever-the-fuck. Two pinched-up socialites 
           clink their drinks before the image abruptly FREEZES.  

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        What’s that? 

           Martin jabs a finger towards the corner of the screen. 
                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        That right there. What’s that? 

                                 LIAM
                        A solarization effect. 

                                 MARTIN
                             (heavy sigh)
                        Why? You can go to an interview. 
                        Cut to b-roll. Lose the scene 
                        altogether. But this? Pretend like 
                        someone opened the fucking blinds?! 
                             (beat)
                        It’s just lazy, Liam. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Liam walks home. Bundled up. Clutching himself in the cold. 
           In front of him, STREET KIDS loiter on a stoop. Getting high. 

           As he passes, the Street Kids bust up laughing. Probably not 
           at Liam. But somehow that’s not how it feels. As Liam reacts 
           we PRELAP the sound of heavy breathing. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Liam and Amy are in the middle of having sex. Slow. Quiet. 
           Well-intentioned. We’re witnessing their pattern play out. 
           This same position. Same pace. 

           Liam rolls off her. 

           They hold hands. Happy. And slightly sad. 

           After a beat-- 

                                 LIAM
                        I love you. 

                                 AMY
                        I love you too. 

           INT. BATHROOM - LYDIA’S PLACE - DAY

           A fogged mirror wipes clean revealing LYDIA, bare-faced, 
           still in her shower cap. 

           Lydia uses a makeup wipe. Then she applies a FIRMING CREAM to 
           the bags beneath her eyes. Next she rubs a GEL MOISTURIZER 
           into her cheeks.  
           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Lydia sits cross-legged on the floor of her room in front of 
           a tiny smudged-up vanity. She grabs a hair brush and works 
           through the morning knots. We JUMPCUT through the remainder 
           of her routine: 

           She dabs on FOUNDATION. Then CONCEALER.  She traces her 
           cheekbone with BRONZER. She blots EYE SHADOW along the inner 
           crease. She applies MASCARA, eyelashes fluttering. 

           Finally she does her lips, rolling out a deep rich RED.  

           She tilts her head. Taking stock of the finished product. Her 
           phone vibrates on the floor next to her. We see the screen. A 
           text message from Bobby. 

                                 TEXT (BOBBY) 
                        Cook dinner tonight? 

           INT. LYDIA’S WORK - DAY

           Lydia leafs through color coded note-cards. Preparing.  

           The office decor is the new corporate America. Glass and 
           natural light. Standing desks. Selfies of diverse young 
           people hung as art. Posing in exotic locales. 

           Lydia’s focus is interrupted by the BZZZZ of her phone. 

           A string of texts from BOBBY appear on her screen. He’s sent  
           over the funny meme of the day. She stares at it. Not quite 
           laughing. We consider her strained expression as we PRELAP:

                        The goal of this research was to 
                        better understand our quote-unquote 
                        ‘Millenial’ users. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Lydia’s mid-presentation. Just then we hear the BZZZZ of her 
           cell phone. No one else can hear it. But the distraction 
           throws her. She takes the slightest pause before continuing:  

                                 LYDIA
                        Specifically, we wanted to take a 
                        look at the way our 18-24 year old 
                        affinity groups make travel plans. 
                        Where these actions take place 
                        across the platform, and--
           Another BZZZZ. Her smile tweaks. She forces herself along.     

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        And whether or not these actions 
                        were shared with friends.  

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           RUSH HOUR. A crush of people. A cacophony of sound. Lydia 
           maneuvers through the crowd, twisting her EARBUDS into place. 
           The soothing voice of a PODCAST host filters in. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Sex. Have I got your attention? 
                        While sex is one of the more 
                        complicated and vexing parts of the 
                        human experience, the definition of 
                        it -- mechanically speaking -- has 
                        always been relatively simple.

           EXT. SUBWAY STAIRS

           Lydia arrives at her station. Descends the stairs. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        Two individuals coming together in 
                        physical space. It’s contact. 
                        Proximity. Closeness. 
                             (then)
                        Not so anymore.

           INT. PLATFORM - NIGHT

           Lydia waits for her train. The monologue relaxing her.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        This week marks the release of the 
                        Tryst VR headset. An exponential 
                        leap forward in VR technology, 
                        Tryst matches users in digital 
                        space, providing a totally 
                        immersive erotic experience. 
                        Virtual sex between real people. 

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

           Lydia gazes out the window, watching the city smear by.
                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        There are hundreds of questions we 
                        could ask about the application of 
                        such technology, but perhaps the 
                        most pressing discussion is a 
                        philosophical one. 

           Lydia’s eyes drift across the subway car. The collage of 
           faces. Expressions. People from all different walks of life. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        How will separating the experience 
                        of sex from the physical act change 
                        our reality? How will it affect our 
                        desire to meet new people? Connect 
                        with the ones we love? 

           Just then Lydia’s face drops -- suddenly on high alert. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Where does escapism stop, and 
                        something else begin? Today we’ll 
                        discuss with futurist Marc F--

           The sound abruptly cuts out. She’s paused it. Across the 
           train a CREEP (40’s) stares at her with strange intensity. 

           Bodies pass in the foreground, but the man’s gaze stays 
           constant. Shameless. Predatory.   

           Lydia shifts her focus. Forcing herself to look elsewhere.

           Just then the train pulls into a station. The seat next to 
           Lydia OPENS UP. Lydia glances back towards the Creep.  

           He’s standing up now. Approaching her. Walking towards that 
           empty chair.

           Lydia shimmies out of the seat and moves down the aisle 
           towards the other side of the train. She grabs the pole. 
           Fixes her eyes forward. Praying for her stop to come.  

           Then she feels the brush of someone else’s hand on the pole. 
           THE CREEP IS DIRECTLY BEHIND HER NOW. Lydia anguishes as we  
           hear his warm, unhealthy breathing. A torturous beat passes. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LYDIA’S PLACE

           A flame prickles a pot as we hear the sound of SIMMERING. 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        The funny thing was, dude wasn’t 
                        even aware of it! 
           Bobby and Lydia eat dinner. Lydia’s only half listening, 
           still shaken by her encounter. Oblivious, Bobby prattles on.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        It was happening right under his 
                        nose. Couldn’t even see it. 

           Lydia stands, stopping the pot from boiling over. While she’s 
           up, Bobby steals a piece of food and pops it in his mouth. 
           Lydia returns, sits, and notices the missing piece. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Some people, you know? 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lydia climbs into bed with Bobby and grabs a TABLET from the 
           end table. A program plays quietly, illuminating their faces 
           in cold sterile light.   

           Lydia’s intent on paying attention. But Bobby squirms and 
           shifts. Pressing into her. That loaded, thrusting cuddle 
           women are all too familiar with. 

           Lydia tries to ride it out, but he keeps pushing. Trying to 
           advance his position. 

           His hand begins to slide down her thigh beneath the blanket.  
           He buries his face into the back of her neck.

           We watch as her face TIGHTENS. 

           And as his fingers walk further down her leg--

           She bolts upright, throws the covers off and hops out of bed.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Where are you going? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Bathroom. 

           She marches off. We hear a door slam. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Lydia stands alone. Eyes closed. Clinging to this one fucking 
           second of air. We watch as she slowly breathes in and out.

           CUT TO BLACK
                                 VOICE (OVER BLACK)
                        So this is what’s called a 
                        solitaire mounting. Most are plain 
                        and simple all the way around. 

           INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

           Liam looks light-headed, staring down at a glass display 
           filled with ENGAGEMENT RINGS. A JEWELER indicates one in 
           particular.   

                                 JEWELER
                        But what I love about this one is 
                        the detailing on the side right 
                        here. That’s milgrain. It’s a very 
                        pretty look. Do you like it?  

                                 LIAM
                             (nods dumbly, at a loss)
                        So how would it work? Like sizing-
                        wise?

                                 JEWELER
                        Well most women are a size six, 
                        size seven. A lot of times guys 
                        will ask a mother, or a friend to 
                        help them figure it out. Or you can 
                        always borrow a ring of hers and we 
                        can use that. Would you like to 
                        hold it? 

           She offers the ring to Liam. He plucks it delicately. As he 
           holds it, not looking super sure of himself, we PRELAP:

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) 
                        I dunno man. 

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Bobby and Liam sit at a coffee spot, waiting for their order. 
           In the b.g. steamed milk hisses. Chrome machines whir. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Honestly. I don’t know. I don’t 
                        know what you want me to say.
                        Amy’s a great girl obviously but--

                                 LIAM
                        But. 
                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah. But. 
                             (then)
                        My question is why? Why now? 

                                 LIAM
                        Because this is how it goes. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Lemme ask you -- how many women 
                        have you slept with? Honestly. 

                                 LIAM
                        Seriously? 
                             (looks around sheepishly)
                        Three.

           Bobby reacts. He was expecting a low number. But that’s like 
           really low. Off Bobby’s silence: 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Bobby, we started dating when 
                        I was twenty two. 

                                 BOBBY
                        And you were a loser then too -- 
                        but fine -- three it is. Is that a 
                        number you’re gonna be happy with 
                        on your deathbed? Or when your dick 
                        stops working? 
                             (off Liam’s dismissive 
                              gesture)
                        You’re laughing. But I’m serious. 

                                 LIAM
                        Bobby -- I love her. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, but that’s not what we’re 
                        talking about.

           As Bobby rises to retrieve their drinks we PRELAP:  

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Does she do all the sex stuff you 
                        want? 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           They’re walking now. Liam shoots Bobby a look. Seriously? 

                                 LIAM
                        Dude...
                                 BOBBY
                        Alright. Clearly that’s a ‘no.’
                             (off Liam’s look)
                        You know what: let’s take the sex 
                        part out of it. Let’s pretend for a 
                        moment that it’s not important at 
                        all. By doing this you’re 
                        essentially saying: I’m totally 
                        ready to never be surprised, in my 
                        life, ever again. 

                                 LIAM
                        That’s stupid. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s true. 

                                 LIAM
                        No it’s a stupid premise. Surprise 
                        equals being single? So that means 
                        being in a relationship equals 
                        what? Boredom? Why would anyone be 
                        in a relationship if that were 
                        true?  

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s not what I’m saying. I’m 
                        talking about a feeling bro. 
                        Like... 
                             (thinking)
                        Being in love -- it’s like getting 
                        drunk in a jacuzzi. Sliding deeper 
                        into this warm, comfortable stupor. 
                        But that first look? First touch? 
                        That’s electricity. That’s cold 
                        water in the face. And if you’re 
                        telling me I gotta choose one of 
                        those feelings for the rest of my 
                        life? I dunno. It’s a tough call. 

           As they cross the street towards a park we PRELAP: 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Do you even want a kid right now? 

                                 LIAM (O.S.) 
                        Of course not. 

           EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

           They’re sitting on a park bench overlooking the central lawn. 
                                 LIAM
                        I can’t even afford a new 
                        comforter. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Then why do this? Why even 
                        entertain this? Until you’re ready. 

                                 LIAM
                        Because we’re building something. 
                        It’s like building a house. You 
                        gotta lay the foundation first. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah? I always thought renting made 
                        more sense.  

           Liam shakes his head. Genuinely surprised by Bobby’s 
           reaction. The two of them sit quietly, watching the languid 
           weekend activity. After a beat: 

                                 LIAM
                        So a wife, kid, dog. It’s all 
                        bullshit to you? You don’t believe 
                        in any of it? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Do I believe in it?
                             (beat)
                        I believe it sounds good.

           They sit in silence. We favor Liam, looking less and less 
           confident by the moment. 

           INT. BEDROOM - LIAM AND AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Amy is packing a GYM BAG when her phone buzzes on the 
           dresser. A string of texts come in from her MOTHER. 

                                 TEXT (MOM) 
                        Did you hear the news?!?
                             (...)
                        Your little cousin is PREGNANT!
                             (...)
                        Can you believe it?
                             (...)
                        So EXCITING. 

           Amy stares at the texts. After a beat she begins to formulate 
           a response. But midway through she stops, her expression 
           straining. She locks the phone and shoves it in her bag.

           As she collects her things and exits the room we PRELAP: 
                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        Heyyy! 

                                 AMY (O.S.) 
                        Hey!

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Amy approaches Lydia who stands outside of a trendy CYCLING 
           STUDIO. The two of them hug. 

                                 AMY
                        Thanks so much for the invite. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Yeah girl. So happy you came. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m like really nervous. 

                                 LYDIA 
                             (escorting her in)
                        Oh stop. You’ll be fine. 

                                 AMY 
                        I’m like already sweating. 

           INT. CYCLING STUDIO - NIGHT

           Dim lights. Hot, muggy air. Sixty people crammed in a tiny 
           brick space, pumping inclines like their lives depended on 
           it. A beautiful male INSTRUCTOR peppers the workout with 
           words of encouragement. Platitudes. 

           We find AMY struggling to keep pace with the uber fit crowd.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Amy slowly pulls a sweater on over her drenched top. 

           Across the way two COLLEGE STUDENTS pack up. Perfect outfits. 
           Better bodies. One effortlessly touches her toes while the 
           other complains about finals, college drama, how old they’re 
           getting. 

           Amy watches them from behind. Affected by the inane chatter. 
           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           MEANWHILE. Lydia waits for Amy outside the locker room. She’s 
           tapping at her phone when the gorgeous INSTRUCTOR approaches. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Hey. Good job in there. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Thanks. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        I’m Corey. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Lydia. 

                                 INSTRUCTOR
                        Great. Hope to see you around. 

           Is he flirting? Just being polite? He smiles at her before 
           turning and walking off. Lydia’s eyes wander over his body as 
           he disappears down the corridor. The moment CHARGED. 

           She blinks away the thought of him as we PRELAP: 

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        Honestly it’s a little hard right 
                        now. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Lydia and Amy walk together, huddling close in the cold.

                                 LYDIA
                        I work a lot. And I like to work a 
                        lot. It makes me feel like me. And 
                        in that way, I’m very focused. And 
                        he’s... not. He’s a little more all 
                        over place, like -- ‘what if we try 
                        this?’ And, ’ooh what about that?” 
                        And honestly I love that about him. 
                        Cause he makes me try things. And 
                        surprises me. But like on a Tuesday 
                        night...  

           She trails off. Feeling self-conscious.

                                 AMY
                        No. Go on. 
                                 LYDIA
                        I just wish there was something 
                        waiting for him on Wednesday that 
                        he gave a shit about. Instead of 
                        just me. 
                             (then)
                        Is that like the meanest thing 
                        anyone’s ever said? 

                                 AMY 
                        No. Not at all.

                                 LYDIA
                        I get home and he’s like a puppy 
                        who’s been cooped up all day. And I 
                        get it. That’s tough. But just 
                        because you’ve been waiting around 
                        all day doesn’t mean I have to 
                        cater to you every second we’re 
                        together. You know?  

                                 AMY
                        It’s not equitable. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Right! Like I’ve had a day too. 
                        Uch, it’s just frustrating.
                             (then)
                        You and Liam deal with shit like 
                        this? 

                                 AMY
                        We have the opposite problem. He 
                        works too much. They’re actually 
                        making him come in tonight. I don’t 
                        think he stands up for himself 
                        enough.  

           Just then Lydia’s phone buzzes. She fishes it out. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        That Bobby? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Speak of the devil. 

           Lydia reads the text. And immediately her face softens. 

                                 AMY
                        What? 
                                 LYDIA
                             (reading)
                        “Dunno if you’re free tonight, but 
                        if you are I would love to cook you 
                        dinner. You’ve been working your 
                        butt off, and I want to pamper you. 
                        I was thinking I’d try and cook 
                        lamb? Lemme know. Kissy face.”  

                                 AMY
                             (stops walking)
                        That’s cute as shit. 

                                 LYDIA
                        I know. 

                                 AMY
                             (teasing)
                        You’re such a bitch

                                 LYDIA
                        I know! God what’s wrong with me. 

                                 AMY
                        You should totally go. 

                                 LYDIA
                        No. Really? 

                                 AMY
                        It’s fine. 

                                 LYDIA
                        What are you gonna do? 

                                 AMY
                        Girl, I don’t need you to watch 
                        Netflix. It sounds like a perfect 
                        evening. Go enjoy it. 

           Lydia’s touched. She hugs Amy. Brimming with appreciation. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Thank you. Seriously. 

           INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

           Liam works quietly in the dark. A COWORKER pokes her head in. 

                                 COWORKER
                        How much longer you got? 
                                 LIAM
                        A ways. 

                                 COWORKER
                        Alright. Don’t forget to lock up. 

           The coworker closes the door, throwing Liam back into 
           darkness. Liam sighs, then resumes clicking away at his work. 

           INT. BATHROOM - LYDIA’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Lydia luxuriates in the shower.  

           She wipes the mirror clean and begins her familiar routine. 
           Applying FIRMING CREAM. Rubbing in GEL MOISTURIZER. 

           INT. EDITING BAY - NIGHT

           Liam’s face hovers inches from his monitor. 

           On the screen one of the HOUSEWIVES raises her glass,  
           winking at camera. Another HOUSEWIFE cackles hysterically. 

           Liam toggles between the images. 

           Somehow it feels like they’re MOCKING him. Flipping the bird 
           with their mimosas. Their perfect lives. 

           Liam’s face sours.  

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lydia’s LIPS fill the frame as she rolls out RED LIPSTICK.  

           INT. POST PRODUCTION FACILITY - NIGHT 

           Liam shoves his Nalgene into the water cooler but it’s empty. 
           He shakes the jug. His frustration echoing in the empty room. 

           Liam massages his stiff neck. Trying to relax. 

           Just then he notices a stack of unopened electronics half-
           hidden in shadow. The TRYST boxes from earlier. 

           Liam considers them for a beat. 
           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 

           Lydia walks down the street. The whisper of a smile grazing 
           her lips. She pulls out her phone and texts Bobby. 

                                 TEXT (LYDIA) 
                        On my way to yours. Be there in 10. 

           The three dot bubble immediately appears before: 

                                 TEXT (BOBBY) (CONT’D)
                        Shit. I got stuck uptown at my 
                        buddy’s thing.
                             (...)
                        I won’t be home for another 45. 
                             (...)
                        Prolly too late for the lamb.
                             (...)
                        Might just grab us Thai on the way 
                        home? 

           Lydia stops. Staring down at her phone with naked disbelief. 
           She stands there a beat. Furious. Breath clouding in the 
           freezing cold. And in this moment something catches her eye:   

           A SEX SHOP across the street. 

           Lurid neons bathe mannequins in volcanic light. They stand in 
           the display window, gesturing towards the store’s new item:  

           The TRYST VR HEADSET. 

           Lydia approaches. Her skin turning red as she stands in front 
           of the display case. She stares at it. Then up at her 
           reflection in the glass. 

           INT. EDITING BAY - NIGHT

           Hands rip open a box revealing the TRYST VR HEADSET. 

           Liam peers down at it. Marveling at its clean lines. Jet 
           black body. The design slick and sexy. 

           He pulls a pair of GLOVES from the box. Scaled with haptic 
           sensors, they glisten like snakeskin. 

           Liam picks up the headset, pressing the power button. The 
           GLOVES wriggle to life. A BLUE LIGHT breathes in and out on 
           the headset. 

           Liam contemplates it. The soft light pulsing across his face.  

           CUT TO BLACK 
           INSERT: TEXT on a BLACK SCREEN.

                                         Welcome

           4. Forgiveness has never been your strong suit 
           [Agree O O X O O Disagree]

           The questions fly at us with INCREASING SPEED. We no longer 
           see Liam’s answers, barely keeping pace with STROBING TEXT: 

           6. You secretly desire a surprise birthday party

           8. People in wheelchairs make you uncomfortable

           9. Righting injustice is the responsibility of the collective

           149. Above all else, you yearn for control 

           Abruptly, the questions stop. We hold here in the dark until--

                                  You’ve been matched. 
           INT. HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT [VR SCAPE] 

           A DOORWAY. Total blackness beyond it. Everything still. 

           After a beat, the YOUNG MAN from our opening scene emerges. 
           This is Liam’s AVATAR. We will refer to him as ADAM. 

           His bare feet leave shadows on black marble as he walks into 
           the entry of a BOUTIQUE HOTEL. 

           Starkly decorated. A minimal aesthetic. It’s striking, yet it 
           somehow feels INCOMPLETE. An architect’s unfinished sketch. 

           Adam walks slowly. Unsettled. 

           The place throbs with DREAM STRANGENESS. Like at any moment 
           something might jump out at us. Or creep in at the edges.

           CUT TO:

           An AFTERIMAGE flickers in the empty space. 

           INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT  [VR SCAPE] 

           Adam floats past a deserted FRONT DESK. A bank of ELEVATORS. 

           He passes a MIRROR and stops. Shocked by his nakedness. His 
           perfect face. Perfect body. Perfect everything. 

           Then MOVEMENT tugs at his peripheral vision. He turns slowly.

           Another AFTERIMAGE drifts like smoke.

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT [VR SCAPE] 

           The YOUNG WOMAN from our opening scene stands in the lobby. 
           Even more beautiful than we remember. We’ll call her EVE. 

           We watch Adam’s expression CHANGE. It’s like he’s under a 
           spell. The sight of her’s like a needle in his arm. 

           He approaches her. Unable to believe it.   

           He raises his hand, delicately TRACING an “X” on her clavicle 
           with his fingertip. Her skin responds. Goosebumps prickling. 

           He looks up at her. Eyes wide open now. Because in this 
           moment, the real world has fallen away... 

           NOTHING ELSE MATTERS BUT THIS.... 
           They kiss. Slowly at first. But quickly things intensify. 
           Inhibitions melting away... tongues tumbling passionately...    

           AFTERIMAGE

           Her hands slide over his ribs. Her fingertips practically 
           sizzling as they glide over his lower abdomen. Moving down...

           AFTERIMAGE

           Her head arches backward. Her knuckles going white as she 
           grips his hair. His face buried into her crotch... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           They’re on top of the front desk now. Coiled and heaving... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           The imagery speeds up. Their legs intertwining...

           AFTERIMAGE

           Hips thrusting... Muscles tightening... Teeth gnashing... 
           We’re bombarded by the stimuli. Practically drowning in it.

           AFTERIMAGE

           And as their screams rise to a FEVER PITCH we--

           CUT TO:

           INT. EDITING BAY - NIGHT

           Liam RIPS the headset off his face. Gasping for air. His eyes 
           flutter, struggling to readjust to their surroundings. 

           Slowly he turns the headset around in his hands, looking at 
           it like, ‘what the fuck was that?’

           He presses the headset back to his face. The screen is BLACK 
           save for the small white text in the bottom corner: 

                                Matched with: [4BLUEYEZ88] 

                             Would you like to meet again ?  

           Liam lowers the goggles. Trying to wrap his head around what 
           just happened. That’s when he looks down and notices: 

           A CUM STAIN on his jeans. As he stares at it we PRELAP: 
                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        So how does it work? 

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Liam stares out the window. Bobby leans across the aisle, 
           hanging on every word.

                                 LIAM
                        The first time they ‘match’ you 
                        with another user. But from there 
                        you schedule your own rendezvous. 
                        You can either stay with your 
                        match. Or choose a ‘random hookup.’ 

                                 BOBBY
                        Are you gonna see her again? 

                                 LIAM
                        That’s the catch: you both have to 
                        choose to see each other again. 

           We PRELAP: 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) 
                        So what? You’re just jerking off 
                        with that thing on your face? 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           They walk together. Bobby’s holding a SOCCER BALL. 

                                 LIAM
                        No man. It’s like -- you’re not 
                        pulling yourself off when you’re 
                        having a wet dream, right? Your 
                        mind convinces your body it’s real. 
                        That’s how this works. Except in 
                        this -- it’s not a dream. 

           Liam continues walking. Bobby stops. Confusion on his face. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Wait. Are you sure that’s how wet 
                        dreams work? 

           As Bobby hurries to catch up we PRELAP: 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What I don’t get--
           EXT. PARK LAWN - DAY

           Liam and Bobby kick the soccer ball back and forth. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Why go through the trouble of 
                        matching real-life people? Why not 
                        just sim the whole thing?  

                                 LIAM
                        I dunno. Why do politicians sext 
                        random girls they’ve never met?  
                        They do it for the danger. Not in 
                        spite of it. I think not knowing 
                        who’s on the other end -- that’s 
                        sexy to a lot of people.

                                 BOBBY
                        But not to you? 

                                 LIAM
                        I dunno man. I don’t know what to 
                        think. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Do you feel guilty? 

                                 LIAM
                        Wouldn’t you? 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s not like you’re buying digital 
                        dinner beforehand. You’re playing a 
                        video game. You just play this one 
                        with your dick.

                                 LIAM
                        It doesn’t feel like a game when 
                        you’re in it, Bobby.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Hey man -- nobody forced you to 
                        pick up the headset. Maybe that 
                        means something? 
                             (then)
                        Maybe this is what you need right 
                        now? 

           Liam kicks the ball over Bobby’s head. Bobby chases after it. 
           We stay with Liam for a beat -- considering what Bobby said. 
           INT. KITCHENETTE - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Amy is doing dishes when Liam returns. He pecks her on the 
           cheek, takes position next to her, hand-drying the glasses. 

                                 AMY
                        How was it? How’s Bobby? 

                                 LIAM
                        He’s good. 

                                 AMY
                        Anything new going on with him?  

                                 LIAM
                        Uhhh. Not really. 
                             (then)
                        We did talk a little about this new 
                        Tryst VR thing.

                                 AMY
                        Oh God. He’s not thinking about 
                        getting one is he? 

                                 LIAM
                        I dunno. Maybe. Would that be the 
                        worst thing in the world? 

                                 AMY
                        I mean it definitely sends a 
                        message. I know I’d feel hurt if 
                        you got one. What’d you tell him? 

                                 LIAM
                             (beat)
                        Just what you said. 

           Amy smiles. Liam reciprocates. Then he returns his attention 
           to the sink. Staring at dishes. Nervously chewing his lip.

           INT. LYDIA’S WORK - DAY

           Lydia types with her earbuds in. ROD (a coworker) approaches. 
           Lydia ignores him a beat before reluctantly glancing up. 

           He stands expectantly, motioning: ‘take your earbuds out.’ 

                                 LYDIA
                             (taking one out)
                        Yes Rod. 
                                 ROD
                        I had an idea for our presentation. 
                        Just a phrasing thing. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Great. I’m just trying to finish 
                        this up. 

                                 ROD
                        Okay. Sure. 

           He stands there like, ‘I’ll wait.’ Smiling polite. Oblivious. 
           Lydia sighs, summoning composure as she pulls out her earbud.  

                                 LYDIA
                        So what’s the idea? 

                                 ROD
                        What if it’s less about the old 
                        flow and more about customizing 
                        experience?
                             (off her blank look)
                        I know it’s a little different but, 
                        just think on it for a little. 

           Rod exits. Lydia watches him go. 

           On his way out he stops off at a MALE PEER’s desk. He’s about 
           to engage him when he notices the Male Peer has earbuds in. 
           Rod stops himself, waves instead, and walks off. 

           As he exits we PRELAP: 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        Where it gets really complicated, 
                        and perhaps problematic is--

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Lydia wades through the crash of people, lost in a podcast. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Sex is never just sex. It’s 
                        conquest. Control. Power. Pain 
                        relief. It doesn’t mean the same 
                        thing to any two people. 
                        So predicting how this will affect 
                        us? It’s impossible to know.   

           She crosses the street. Eyes sweeping across the cars. The 
           drivers. Their features obscured behind the windshield glass. 
                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        How will it affect the addicts? The 
                        abstinent? The trauma survivors, or 
                        those who have sexual violence 
                        lurking in them somewhere? The 
                        question’s not, ‘how will it affect 
                        us?’ Because surely, it will. 

           She hits the sidewalk and rounds a corner...

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        The real mystery is -- what does 
                        sex mean to me? 

           Lydia stops abruptly when she sees BOBBY waiting outside of 
           her building. She stops the podcast, taking a second before 
           approaching. Bobby straightens upon seeing her.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Sorry to show up like this.

                                 LYDIA
                             (brushing past him)
                        You should be. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Jesus, Lydia. You’re really this 
                        upset? Being mad is one thing, but 
                        I’m losing sleep worrying about 
                        you. 

                                 LYDIA
                        You wake up at eleven everyday, 
                        Bobby. I think you could stand to 
                        lose a little sleep. 

           She slides inside her building--

           INT. LYDIA’S BUILDING - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Lydia makes for her mailbox. Bobby squeezes in after her. 
           Lydia roots around in her purse, trying to find her keys. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m a shmuck. I’m under-employed. 
                        And I’m sorry. That most of all. 

                                 LYDIA
                        You’re an asshole. 
                                 BOBBY
                        Yes. See I knew I forgot one.
                             (re: purse)
                        Can I give you a hand or something? 

           Irritated, she gives up. Retrieving a HIDE-A-KEY from beneath 
           the mailboxes. She pops the cover, removing the spare key.

           INT. LYDIA’S BUILDING - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Bobby trails after Lydia down the hall.  

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re seriously not even gonna let 
                        me explain? 

                                 LYDIA
                        How many chances do you think you 
                        deserve Bobby? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Babe. I’m worried about you. I care 
                        about you. 

                                 LYDIA
                             (arriving at her door)
                        Uh-huh. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re new in the city. You’re by 
                        yourself in this big apartment. Who 
                        you gonna talk to? Huh? Who’s gonna 
                        keep you warm at night? 

           Lydia stops behind the half-opened door -- scoffing at this. 

                                 LYDIA
                        You really think I need you for 
                        that? 

           Bobby blinks. Only half understanding. Lydia shakes her head, 
           neatly shutting the door in his face. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well can I at least see you this 
                        weekend?! 

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           MOMENTS LATER. Lydia opens her closet, retrieving a vintage 
           HAT BOX from a high shelf. She pops the lid revealing a TRYST 
           VR headset. She looks down on it. Considering her options. 
           INT. DINING ROOM - LIAM AND AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Liam and Amy eat dinner. Silverware clinks in the stuffy 
           room. It’s quiet. Lifeless. Just another beige weeknight. 
           Liam glances at Amy, scrolling absentmindedly on her phone. 

                                 LIAM
                        How was your day? 

                                 AMY
                        You know. Pretty normal. 

                                 LIAM
                        Anything fun happen? 

                                 AMY
                        No. Not really. 

           Amy forks in more food. Never looking up. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Liam sinks into the couch. Post-dinner autopilot kicking in. 
           The TV’s blue glow washes over him. Amy clicks the remote. 

                                 AMY
                        What are you in the mood for? 

                                 LIAM
                        Whatever. 

           Dutifully she scrolls through the endless options. Liam’s 
           eyes drift. Watching her furtively. Sadness in his eyes. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Liam lays awake. Brow furrowed. Unable to sleep. 

           He glances over at Amy, her shoulders rising and falling. 
           Liam lets out a long sigh. Chewing his lip. Conflicted.  

           Carefully he slides out of the covers. Tiptoeing to the door. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           From behind we see Liam hunching over something in the dark. 

           We see Liam’s PHONE SCREEN as he downloads the “TRYST APP.” 
           He looks over his shoulder, checking to see if the coast is 
           still clear. He “HIDES” the app in a folder marked “WORK.” 
           He sets down the phone. Picking up the TRYST VR HEADGEAR--

                                     Welcome Back...

                             You’ve selected: RANDOM ENCOUNTER

                                          Enjoy!

           INT. HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           ADAM’s eyes open. Awakening on an overstuffed leather sofa. 

           He stands, surveying the hotel. It looks just like last time. 
           Yet somehow, the mood feels different. Even more unsettling. 
           On cue, a noise wafts in from the lobby -- HEAVY BREATHING. 

           Adam walks towards it. 

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Across the way, a FIGURE sits in a high-back chair. We can 
           only see a piece of her, but what we see is JARRING. 

           Her arm and shoulder pump vigorously, as MOANING sounds echo 
           in the empty hall. Adam reacts. Is this lady masturbating??

           He takes a step forward, bumping into an end table. The 
           furniture THUDS. Just then, the heavy breathing STOPS. 

           From behind the chair -- a GLISTENING CANDLE lands on a 
           nearby coffee table. It rolls in a circle, trailing residue. 
           Eventually it comes to a stop next to a pair of CANDLESTICKS. 

           One of them is missing its candle... 

                                 VOICE (O.S.) 
                        You’re late. I had to get started 
                        without you. 

           Adam’s eyes BULGE as the figure rises from her chair. This 
           AVATAR looks different than Eve. Much different.

           Where Eve was elegant. This woman’s hot and damaged. Sneering 
           a smile as she stalks closer. Adam backs up instinctively.  

                                 RANDOM AVATAR
                        Lemme ask you. And be honest.
                             (arriving now)
                        Ever had your asshole eaten, baby? 
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Liam GASPS, ripping off the headset, scuttling away from it. 
           He catches his breath. Pupils normalizing. Looking at the 
           HEADGEAR with renewed respect. Just then, his phone BUZZES. 

           He looks down. On screen we see a TRYST PUSH NOTIFICATION: 

                              *Match Request: Still Pending*

           Liam stares at it. Looking like a ghost in the gauzy light of 
           the screen. He locks his phone, falling away into darkness. 
           Still unable to catch his breath. 

           CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. TAXI CAB - NIGHT

           An empty cab. Amy and Liam pile in. Dressed for a night out. 

                                 LIAM
                        43rd and Lex, please.  

                                 AMY
                        I’m excited to see her place. She 
                        has good taste. You excited? 

                                 LIAM 
                        Yeah. Should be fun. 

           They smile at each other then glance out their respective 
           windows. We stay with Liam, his smile fading a bit. PRELAP:

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        Heyyy! 

                                 AMY (O.S.) 
                        Hey!

           INT. LYDIA’S PLACE - NIGHT  

           Lydia stands in the doorway, pulling Amy in for a big hug. 
           She wears a sexy backless dress. Liam’s eyes dart away from 
           it, not allowing himself to linger on her bare skin.

                                 LYDIA
                        Great to see you. Come in. 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           MID-CONVERSATION. The doorbell rings. Lydia excuses herself.
           INT. DOORWAY - NIGHT

           Lydia opens the door, revealing BOBBY. He flashes his big 
           smile, holding up a nice bottle of wine. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s your favorite. 
                             (then)
                        The wine, not me.
                             (sheepishly)
                        May I enter? 

           Lydia stands behind the door -- a slow smile creeping as she 
           finally allows him in. He takes a step inside.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Hey you. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Hey yourself. 

           As they kiss in the doorway, we PRELAP:

                                 LYDIA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        So this guy shows up outside my 
                        place. Uninvited. Wearing a black 
                        fucking hoodie of all things. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           They sit around the room. Lounging. Laughing. Getting drunk. 

                                 AMY
                        The official stalker uniform.  
                        That’s the word for that behavior, 
                        by the way. 

                                 LIAM
                        Which is a felony, I think. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Right. Well thank you, detective. 
                        Mr. Law Professor. 

                                 LYDIA
                        I’m just hoping this is a one-time 
                        thing and not like a continued 
                        pattern of behavior.
                             (to Liam)
                        It is an isolated incident, right? 

                                 LIAM
                        Yeah... Mostly. 
                                 AMY
                        Except for that one girl with the 
                        nose ring. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well -- as much fun as this is for 
                        me, we should probably start 
                        heading to the bar. 

                                 LYDIA
                        I need to do a quick touch-up. 
                             (to Amy)
                        Drunk makeup party?

                                 AMY
                        Duh. 

           The girls hop up and exit down the hall. Bobby calls out: 

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m gonna call the uber in five 
                        minutes. 

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        Ten minutes.

                                 BOBBY
                        I’m gonna call the uber in ten 
                        minutes.
                             (to Liam, re: cocktail)
                        You want another one? 

                                 LIAM
                        Sure. 

           Bobby grabs the empties and exits. Liam pulls out his phone. 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        You know the password to the wifi? 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) 
                        Should be in that box on the coffee 
                        table. 

           Liam sorts through a mess of remotes and tangled technology, 
           pulling out an index card. The password’s written in pen. 

                                       4BLUEYEZ88

           We hold on Liam’s face. Gears backfiring. Something’s not 
           computing. Then his face DROPS as it finally dawns on him. 

           It’s her. 
           Just then--

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It was her cat. Blue Eyes. 

           Dazed, Liam looks up. Bobby stands over him. A cold drink 
           sweats in his outstretched arm. After a beat, Liam grabs it. 
           Nodding a dumb thank you.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Cheers. 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Liam sits in the front seat -- still as a statue. The rest of 
           the group is in the back. Being loud. Enjoying themselves. 

           Liam’s eyes flick between the road and the rearview. Stealing 
           glimpses of her red lips. Perfect teeth. That big wild smile. 

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           MUSIC THUMPS. Strobes flash over the sweaty basement party. 

           Liam stands at the bar, a detached observer. He watches:

           LYDIA dancing in the throng. Hair tousled, her features 
           disappear and reappear in the 1-2 rhythm of the strobe. And 
           in those downbeats, it’s like she could be ANYBODY.

           We hold on Liam. His expression darkening. 

           CUT TO BLACK

           INT. BEDROOM - LIAM AND AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Amy wakes in the morning. She turns over. Liam isn’t there. 
           She reacts, considering the empty space. Sinking a bit. 

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Amy reads a TRASH MAGAZINE. Headlines designed to make you 
           feel inadequate. Buy shit you don’t need. The cover reads: 
           MONOGAMISH: How VR saved our marriage.  

           As she reads, we PRELAP: Squealing. Activity. COMMOTION. 
           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 

           We’re in a 1st GRADE CLASSROOM during break. It’s like the 
           invasion of Normandy as kids buzz by in every direction. 

                                 AMY (O.S.) 
                        Farmer Brown has a problem. His 
                        cows love to type. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - LATER

           Amy sits in front of her class, reading from a COLORFUL BOOK.

                                 AMY 
                        All day long he hears: click, 
                        clack, MOO. Click, clack moo. 
                        Clickety, clackety moooo. 

           We move across the kids’ faces. Some sleepy. Some bored. 
           Others wonderstruck. Imaginations soaring. Lost in daydreams. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        At first, he couldn’t believe his 
                        ears. Cows that type? Impossible! 
                        Click, clack, MOO. Click, clack 
                        MOO. Clickety, clackety MOOOO.

           We land on one kid in particular. The most adorable smile, 
           goofy and toothless. Amy notices him and practically melts. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Amy and Lydia grocery shop. LYDIA holds out a tub of hummus. 

                                 LYDIA 
                        Is this the one?

                                 AMY
                        No. The one we want has a little 
                        Middle Eastern guy on the lid. 

           Lydia grunts. Walking off. Just then, Amy’s phone buzzes:

                                 TEXT (MOM) 
                        I talked to your cousin today. 
                             (...)
                        She REALLY wants baby to be a girl.
                             (...)
                        I think she just wants to play with 
                        dolls again. LOL. 

           Amy smirks, despite herself. Replying: 
                                 TEXT (AMY) (CONT’D)
                        Lol. Good one, Mom. 

           The typing bubble quickly reappears before:

                                 TEXT (MOM) (CONT’D)
                        Me on the other hand, I’m not 
                        picky. 
                             (...)
                        I’ll take what I can get. 
                             (...)
                        [Winky Face Emoji] 

           Amy looks down at this. Unsure how to respond. Just then, she 
           rounds a corner and her face DROPS. Nearby a YOUNG WOMAN 
           (20s) sorts through produce.  

           Amy reacts. A look of TOTAL PANIC on her face. Just then, 
           Lydia returns, holding the correct item. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Found it. He’s cute, this guy.
                             (then)
                        Jesus, Amy. Are you alright? You’re 
                        white as sheet. 

                                 AMY
                             (unconvincing)
                        Yeah, no, I’m fine. Let’s just get 
                        out of here. 

           Amy ushers Lydia away from the produce section. Lydia looks 
           back over her shoulder, confused. Clocking the mysterious 
           WOMAN. As they hurry off we can hear Lydia ask--

                                 LYDIA
                        Who was that? 

           INT. SUPPLY CLOSET - POST PRODUCTION FACILITY - DAY

           Liam opens and shuts drawers. Rifles through closets. Finally 
           he finds what he’s looking for -- a TAPE GUN. PRELAP: the 
           STICKY RIP of the tape dispenser. 

           INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

           Liam rips long pieces of tape, resting them on his desk. He 
           pulls out the TRYST VR HEADSET from behind a couch. Stuffing 
           the goggles and gloves back into the box. 
           INT. POST PRODUCTION FACILITY - DAY

           The taped-up box lands atop the stack in the break room. Liam 
           checks to see if he’s been seen before quickly retreating. We 
           stay with him as he walks away -- his face one of RESOLVE. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - LIAM AND AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Amy enters, confused to find the table set for a nice dinner. 
           Champagne flutes filled with bubbles. Liam greets her. 

                                 LIAM
                        Hey. Surprise.

                                 AMY
                        What’s all this? I thought you had 
                        to work late? 

                                 LIAM
                        I did but... Fuck ‘em, right? 

           Amy smiles. Gawking at the thoughtful spread. 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. It’s sparkling apple 
                        juice.

           Liam grins, kisses her forehead, and walks off into the 
           kitchen. Amy stands there quietly. Just about moved to tears. 

           CUT TO BLACK 

                                 AMY (OVER BLACK) (O.S.)
                        What’s her name again? 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           We’re at a swanky HOLIDAY PARTY. String-lights. An open bar. 
           Everyone’s got fresh hair cuts. Half the dudes wear the exact 
           same jacket. Liam and Amy stand in line, surveying the crowd:  

                                 LIAM
                        That’s Jillian. And that’s Micah.  

                                 AMY
                        I don’t think I met him before. 

                                 LIAM
                        I’m not sure. I don’t even know 
                        half these people.
                                 AMY
                             (handing him her purse)
                        I’m gonna run to the bathroom. You 
                        okay? 

                                 LIAM
                        Yeah. 

           Amy walks off. Liam exhales, scanning the sea of strange 
           faces. Shoulders tightening just a little. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER

           A group of people chat in a small circle. Liam approaches. 
           But he doesn’t really say hello. Just hovers tentatively on 
           the edge of the conversation. 

           A COWORKER glances over at Liam but says nothing, quickly 
           returning her attention to the center of the group. Liam 
           fidgets. Lost and floating on the outer rim.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER

           Liam and Amy approach MARTIN. His face flushed with alcohol 
           as he stands in front of a portable heater, holding court. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Liam! I didn’t think you’d come. 

                                 LIAM
                        Martin, you remember Amy? 

           Ignoring her, Martin turns to the MAN (30s) at his side.   

                                 MARTIN
                        Liam here is one of my in-house 
                        editors. Liam -- this is Kendrick 
                        Mead. You familiar with his work? 

                                 LIAM
                        Of course. I’ve seen everything. 

                                 KENDRICK
                        Cool man. Thanks. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Liam’s cutting our Real Housewives 
                        show right now. 

                                 KENDRICK
                             (eyebrows arching)
                        Oh? 
                                 MARTIN
                        Nobody cuts a better cat-fight than 
                        Liam. Isn’t that right? 

                                 LIAM
                             (insecure)
                        I don’t know about that... 

                                 KENDRICK
                        Well I’m sure it’s great. 

                                 LIAM
                        Clearly you’re not caught up on 
                        season six. 

           It’s supposed to be self-deprecating. Funny. But coming from 
           Liam it just feels kinda sad. Martin laughs drunkenly. 

           We watch Amy react to this. Her party-smile disappearing. We 
           hold on her, STRAINING, as the conversation drones along. 

           INT. KITCHENETTE - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Liam breathes a sigh of relief as he uncoils his scarf. 
           Clearly happy to be back home. 

                                 LIAM
                        You get enough to eat? Want me to 
                        cook some eggs? Amy? 

           Liam turns just in time to see Amy skulk off down the hall. 
           We hear the bedroom door shut O.S. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Liam cautiously enters. Amy sits on the edge of the bed, 
           wearing a worn expression. Her eyes glazed-over and faraway. 

                                 LIAM
                        Hey. You alright?   

                                 AMY
                             (hesitant)
                        Do you know what you looked like 
                        tonight, Liam? You looked small. 
                        You do this so much now, I don’t 
                        even think you realize when you’re 
                        doing it anymore.  

                                 LIAM
                        What are you talking about?
                                 AMY
                        Cutting yourself down in front of 
                        people. Hiding in the corner.

                                 LIAM
                        Amy--

           He tries to sit next to her. But she flinches. Scooting away. 
           A strange silence follows. This isn’t some throwaway fight.  

                                 AMY
                        You may not care about how you 
                        look. But how am I supposed to 
                        feel? How can I believe that you’re 
                        gonna stand up for us, when you 
                        won’t even do it for yourself? How 
                        am I supposed to feel secure?

                                 LIAM
                        Amy. I don’t understand--

                                 AMY
                        I’m telling you to grow a pair, 
                        Liam! Okay? If not for yourself, 
                        then for me. But maybe that’s too 
                        much to ask. 
                             (then)
                        Maybe that’s just not you.  

           Liam reacts. Rocked by this. Utterly blind-sided. He stares 
           at the floor. Trying to get that down. Finally he whispers:

                                 LIAM
                        This is how you see me?  

           Liam glances up. Her face puckers but she offers no response. 
           Liam sinks. Shaking his head. And as his pain turns to ANGER 
           he stands and exits. Leaving Amy behind in the awful silence.  

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Steam pours off Liam as he plunges into the freezing night. 
           His world totally upsidedown. Just then, his phone buzzes: 

                                *Match Request: Accepted* 

                                     *Meet Tonight?* 

           Liam stares down at the message. His face transforming. A 
           wildness in his eyes we’ve never seen before. Just then--
           INT. POST PRODUCTION FACILITY - NIGHT

           Overhead lights flicker to life, catching the plastic edges 
           of the TAPED-UP TRYST BOX. A hand suddenly snatches it up. 

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - [VR SCAPE] 

           Bare feet slap against the black marble floor. ADAM strides 
           through the deserted hotel, unconcerned with the scenery. 

           INT. ELEVATOR BANK / INT. ELEVATOR - [VR SCAPE]

           EVE waits for him by the ELEVATORS. As he approaches, she 
           slips down the shallow corridor. A game of cat and mouse.  

           AFTERIMAGE

           He arrives at the mouth of the shallow corridor. Eve waits 
           for him in front of an OPEN ELEVATOR. She ducks inside. 

           AFTERIMAGE

           Adam steps inside the ELEVATOR. Entering her personal space. 
           They stare at one another. Tranced. Lips inches apart. 

           AFTERIMAGE

           Just then, Eve lets out a short gasp. Adam tugs the hair at 
           the base of her skull. Eve SMOLDERS. Intense eye contact. 

           AFTERIMAGE

           His finger traces an “X” below her abdomen. Eve’s PUBIC HAIR 
           is visible, teasing the bottom of our frame.

           AFTERIMAGE

           Just then, the elevator lurches to life. Light strobes across 
           their faces as the lift hurdles upwards. And as Adam spins 
           her around. Taking her from behind, we--

           CUT TO BLACK

           INT. BOBBY’S STUDIO - DAY

           Bobby comes to in a tangle of sheets. 

           The DIGITAL CLOCK at the bedside reads 10:26 AM. 

           He straightens ungracefully. Coughing and scratching as he 
           walks towards the bathroom of his unkempt studio apartment.
           That’s when we notice a WOMAN still asleep in his bed. We 
           hold on her as Bobby’s piss stream echoes from faraway. 

           Bobby re-enters. Dressing extra quietly as we PRELAP: 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Hi there, do you guys have a second 
                        to talk about the young people of 
                        Africa?  

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           Bobby stands on a street corner wearing a ‘VOLUNTEER’ penny. 
           He tries unsuccessfully to solicit a passing couple.  

           He slowly exhales. Tap-dancing. Trying to keep his feet warm. 
           We JUMP CUT between several more attempts:  

                                 BOBBY
                        Excuse me, ma’am? You have a second 
                        to talk about the young people of 
                        Africa? 

           Another attempt:  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Sir? Excuse me, sir?
                             (then)
                        Yeah you. You have a second to talk 
                        about -- No? Okay. Have a good one. 

           Another attempt: 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        If you give me your email we could-- 

           And finally: 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Our goal is to electrify villages 
                        in Southern Sudan. Provide internet 
                        access. Get young people online. 
                        Get them educated. Connected. You 
                        know, make their lives a little 
                        simpler. 
                             (then)
                        So can I put you down for a ten 
                        dollar donation?
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Bobby settles down into a chair. Pulls a laptop from his bag. 
           He plugs his charger into the wall. 

           On his screen is a half-finished document -- BUSINESS PLAN. 
           Bobby stares, apprehensive. Intimated by the blinking cursor.

           Finally his fingers touch the keys.

                                 WORDS
                        Our goal is to inspire discussion 
                        and empower millennials through the 
                        acquisition of basic cooking skill--

           The words delete in a flurry of keystrokes. He tries again. 

                                 WORDS (CONT’D)
                        MISSION: To promote strong

                        with the broad reach of social med--

           Again the buzzwords disappear. 

                                 WORDS (CONT’D)
                        To provide a tactile outlet for 
                        those seeking to reconnect with 
                        something--

           The typing stops. The cursor blinking in cruel rhythm. Bobby 
           strains. Struggling to articulate his nebulous ambition. 

           JUMPCUT TO:

           His fingers fly across the screen of his phone as he scrolls 
           through his rotation of apps, social media, etc. He fires off 
           a couple texts to Lydia. Tagging her in the day’s best memes. 

           JUMPCUT TO:

           He shoves the phone across the table. No more distractions. 
           He wrestles his focus back on the business plan. The blinking 
           fucking cursor. Still waiting for inspiration to strike.  

           Frustrated, he glances up at the clock. 

           It’s only 1:13 PM. 

           As we hold on the clock, PRELAP the sound of CLANGING METAL. 
           INT. GYM - DAY

           Bobby grits, focusing his frustration on a LEG PRESS MACHINE. 
           As he pushes with surprising determination we PRELAP:  

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Yooo bud. What’s up? I’m in your 
                        neighborhood. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           Bobby talks on the phone as he walks out of the gym and onto 
           the midday street. We only hear his half of the conversation. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah man. Happy hour starts at 
                        three for a reason.
                             (beat)
                        Word. I’m just walkin’ out of the 
                        gym. Lemme see if I can get cleaned 
                        up at my girlfriend’s place. I’ll 
                        hit you in a sec. 

           Bobby ends the call and texts Lydia: 

                                 TEXT (BOBBY) 
                        Is it cool if I take a quick shower 
                        at your place? I’m v stinky. 

           The typing bubble appears and then disappears. No text comes. 
           Bobby looks down at his phone, shaking his head. If that’s 
           how you wanna play it... 

           EXT. LYDIA’S BUILDING - DAY

           Bobby loiters on the walk-up. Someone exits the building. 
           Bobby catches the door and slips inside. 

           INT. LYDIA’S BUILDING - FOYER - DAY

           Bobby fishes a hand beneath the mailboxes, retrieving Lydia’s 
           HIDE-A-KEY. He smiles down at it. 

           INT. LYDIA’S PLACE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Bobby emerges from her bathroom in a towel. His wet hair  
           dripping carelessly as he walks down the hall.  
           INT. LYDIA’S PLACE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Bobby pulls on a shirt from his bag -- dressed now. He holds 
           the wet towel, considering how best to conceal the evidence. 

           Bobby opens the closet and begins pulling dirty clothes from 
           her hamper. He stuffs the wet towel at the bottom of the bin. 

           He bumps into her hanging shoe-organizer, dislodging items 
           from the high shelf -- causing an avalanche of knickknacks. 

           And out of the hat box rolls the TRYST VR HEADSET. 

           Bobby stares down at it -- totally caught off guard. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Bobby sits in low-light. His expression difficult to read. 
           Lydia arrives. Taking a seat opposite him.

                                 LYDIA
                        Sorry. Sorry. Today was absolutely 
                        crazy. 

                                 BOBBY
                             (he shrugs)
                        It’s fine. 

           She glances down at the menu. Then back up at Bobby. 

                                 LYDIA
                             (sensing)
                        Something up? You okay?

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah. Fine. 

           He gives her a thin smile. She smiles back before returning 
           her attention to the menu. Bobby’s eyes linger. Observing her 
           with strange intensity as we PRELAP a harsh plastic SCRAPING. 

           INT. KITCHENETTE - DAY

           Amy scrubs with a Swiffer mop. Blowing the hair from her eyes 
           as she cleans the ground in long vigorous strokes.  

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY 

           Amy folds laundry. Making clean piles of Liam’s underwear. 
           INT. KITCHENETTE - DAY 

           Amy stares out the window, nervously drumming the table with 
           her fingertips. Just then we hear keys RATTLING in the door. 

           LIAM enters -- finding Amy in the freshly cleaned kitchen. 

                                 AMY
                        Hey you. 

                                 LIAM
                        Hi. 

           Amy approaches and gives Liam a long hug. He indulges her, 
           but hardly matches her warmth. Then, before she even lets go: 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Babe, I gotta--

           Liam shakes free. Sidestepping her. 

           He walks off towards the bedroom without noticing the 
           sparkling counter-tops. The flowers set out. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Amy climbs into bed. Liam watches something on his tablet. 
           His face bathed in cold, sterile light. 

           She cuddles into him.  

                                 AMY
                        It’s freezing in here. You think 
                        you could spare a little warmth?

           She playfully slides her feet up his legs. Liam squirms away. 

                                 LIAM
                        Amy. C’mon. 

                                 AMY
                             (re: tablet)
                        What is that anyway? 

                                 LIAM
                        Some new show.

                                 AMY
                        Is it any good? 

                                 LIAM
                        Not really.
           Liam puts away the tablet. Exhaling the stress of the day. 
           Amy looks up at him. Sensing an opportunity. 

           She removes his glasses. Places them on the night-stand. 

           Her breathing changes as she slides a hand over his chest. 
           She nuzzles into his neck. Kissing him delicately. Liam’s 
           eyes rim closed.

           We watch her hand move below the sheet, slowly migrating 
           down. But before she gets there-- 

                                 LIAM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You should know -- I have to work 
                        late again. 

           Amy stops.  

                                 AMY
                        Why? 

                                 LIAM
                        I have to sit with Martin. He wants 
                        to be there when I implement the 
                        notes on this big two-parter. He’ll 
                        probably keep me late the whole 
                        week. 

           Amy reacts. Stung by this. She struggles to conceal it. 

                                 AMY
                        Okay. Fine.

           An unpleasant beat follows. Amy slowly disentangles herself.  
           Liam clicks off the bedside lamp. Amy rolls away from him. 
           Feeling rejected. Insecure. Eyelashes fragile and flickering.  

           INT. LYDIA’S WORK - DAY

           Lydia sits at her desk. We hear a PUSH NOTIFICATION buzz. 
           Lydia glances around. Dipping down low. Inspecting her phone.

                                     *Meet Tonight?* 

           Lydia bites her lip. Considering it. 

           INT. BAR - LATER 

           Lydia hurries into a bar. It’s packed to the gills with young 
           professionals. There’s a last day of school vibe. Everyone’s 
           playing with house money. Expensing IPAs on the company card. 
           Lydia scans the crowd. Confident. Very much in her element. 

           BEGIN SEQUENCE: An OFF-CAMERA CONVERSATION plays throughout 
           as we cut between SNAPSHOTS of the Happy Hour. Starting with:   

           LYDIA shmoozing. A natural. She cracks up a circle of peers. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.) 
                        Lydia, my name’s Ryan Caldwell.

                                 LYDIA (O.S.) 
                        Yes. Ryan. Hi. Nice to finally meet 
                        you.   

           A WAITRESS unloads a round of drinks. Appetizers. The kind of 
           place that refuses to put out ketchup. Everyone celebrates. 
           Cheersing. Knocking the foam heads off their expensive beers. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I loved the presentation you just 
                        gave on customizing experience. 

                                 LYDIA (O.S.) 
                        Really? You saw it? 

                                 VOICE (O.S.) 
                        Yeah. They sent us the Powerpoint. 
                        For the record, I totally agree.

           ROD (the earbuds guy from earlier) knocks over a JENGA tower. 
           He sways as people laugh. Clearly drunker than he should be.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        If we want the default option to be 
                        ‘share everything’ we need to 
                        prioritize in-stream options, 
                        instead of building out the app. 

           Later, Rod takes an unsteady step, barely catching himself on 
           the edge of a table. Another coworker grabs his coat, herding 
           Rod out the door -- you’ve had enough, big guy. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been trying to get them to 
                        understand that for three years. 
                        But I never articulated it as well 
                        as you did. Really, great stuff. 

           A SINGLE DUDE sidles up to a GIRL at the bar, smiling wide. 
           She hardly acknowledges him. Swiping through TINDER instead.

           END SEQUENCE.  
           INT. BAR - LATER

           Lydia sits at the bar, speaking to RYAN (30s), the source of 
           the VOICE. He’s got perfect teeth. Ivy League genetics.    

           The place has thinned out quite a bit. But her glass is full. 
           And he just ordered another Old Fashioned. 

                                 RYAN
                        So how long have you been with the 
                        company? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Let’s see. I was a UX designer for 
                        three years. And they upped me to 
                        Project Manager in September. 

                                 RYAN
                        That’s very impressive, Lydia. 
                        You’re gonna put guys like me out 
                        of a job. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Well, that’s very kind of you to 
                        say. Even if it’s total bullshit. 

                                 RYAN
                        You wanna see bullshit? Wait ‘til 
                        our meeting next week. They call me 
                        the brown-eyed king of fuckery. 
                             (then)
                        Engineers aren’t the best with 
                        nicknames. 

           She laughs. Warmed by the booze. The common language they 
           share. Ryan looks over at her. A beat. He pulls out his card. 

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        This is me. Anytime you wanna talk 
                        shop. Suss out office politics. Who 
                        slept with who five years ago. Give 
                        me a ring. Seriously. Anything. 
                        Anytime. 

           The offer is benign enough, but when he hands over the card 
           something in his eyes gives Lydia a half-seconds pause. She 
           tries to shake away the gut feeling -- stay in the moment. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Very generous. I will.  

                                 RYAN
                        So you got any plans for after? 
                                 LYDIA 
                        The meeting? I’ll probably sleep 
                        for a couple days.

                                 RYAN
                        No I mean tonight. After this. 

           Her face draws tight. Looks like that gut feeling was right.  
           Ryan reads her reaction. Sipping his drink extra casually.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I’m just saying it’s nice to 
                        have friends. God knows I could’ve 
                        used a few more seniors in my 
                        corner when I was where you are. 
                        Could’ve really sped things up for 
                        me. Anyway--

           He drains his glass. Drops a couple bills on the bar-top. 

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Looking forward to working with you 
                        Lydia.

           Lydia can only manage the weakest of smiles. He stands, pats 
           her on the shoulder, and walks out. She remains at the rail, 
           swirling her wine. Angered by what’s transpired. We PRELAP: 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Wait, wait, wait. So who is this 
                        guy? 

           INT. LYDIA’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Bobby anxiously paces around the apartment as Lydia downloads 
           the events of the night.   

                                 LYDIA
                        His name’s Ryan. His engineers are 
                        gonna be the ones implementing my 
                        changes. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s Ryan’s last name?  

                                 LYDIA
                             (white lie)
                        I don’t know. 

                                 BOBBY
                        And this guy’s your boss? How long 
                        have you known him?
                                 LYDIA
                        What does that have to do with 
                        anything? Are you even listening to 
                        me right now? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Oh my ears are wide open, Lydia. 

           Lydia is totally taken back. Appalled by this jiu-jitsu move 
           Bobby’s trying to pull. 

                                 LYDIA
                        No. Nuh-uh. You know what? I do 
                        know his last name. But I’m not 
                        telling you. Because you don’t get 
                        to be upset here. This is me. This 
                        is my life. My career. I try and 
                        include you in it and you act like 
                        a fucking sixth grader? 

                                 BOBBY
                        This guy hits on you, you lie to me 
                        about it, and I’m not supposed to 
                        get upset? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Maybe if you had your own life, you 
                        wouldn’t be so concerned about the 
                        people who pass through mine. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What is that supposed to mean? 

                                 LYDIA
                        You’re smothering me, Bobby. I feel 
                        you sitting at home, obsessing over 
                        every little thing. Checking in. 
                        Texting me. Sending me fucking 
                        memes all day. Get a job! Do 
                        something with yourself. Instead of 
                        just making my life harder. 

                                 BOBBY
                        How the hell did we get onto this? 

                                 LYDIA 
                        It’s all I see when I look at you 
                        now.

                                 BOBBY
                        Is that why you’re giving Ryan a 
                        good, hard look? 
                                 LYDIA
                        Grow up, dude.  

                                 BOBBY
                        No, since we’re on the topic. Lemme 
                        ask you -- project manager of 
                        everybody’s fucking life -- What do 
                        you want me to do, huh? Sell 
                        drapes? Flip burgers? I am working. 
                        I’m putting together a plan. It 
                        takes time. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Oh yeah? How’s that going for you? 

                                 BOBBY
                             (stung)
                        You’d rather me be fucking 
                        miserable, wouldn’t you? So long as 
                        you can trot me out at your 
                        cocktail parties. Because God 
                        forbid I have to tell your friends 
                        that I’m in-between things right 
                        now. 

                                 LYDIA
                        There’s no shame in not knowing 
                        what you wanna do, Bobby. But that 
                        doesn’t mean you get to piss your 
                        life away.  

                                 BOBBY
                        So that’s it? That’s your big 
                        advice? Be like everybody else?  
                        You want me to be a fucking loser? 
                        Is that it? 

                                 LYDIA
                        No. I’m asking you not to be one. 
                        For once. 

           They glare at one another. Hateful. A long beat passes.  

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking a shower. I can’t even 
                        look at you right now. 
                             (on her way out)
                        And do me a favor, ask yourself if 
                        this is something you want to keep 
                        doing. I’ll be asking myself that 
                        too.  

           Disdain flickers as Lydia stomps off down the hall-- 
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The bedroom door slams shut. Lydia paces. Muttering curses. 
           Then, her eyes flick to the CLOSET DOORS. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           MEANWHILE. Bobby stews in the other room. Trying to wrap his 
           head around what’s just happened. Just then we hear the CHIME 
           of a notification. It’s coming from Lydia’s open LAPTOP. 

           Bobby approaches. Sure enough, a RED ICON waits there. 

           Bobby clicks it: ‘RYAN CALDWELL WANTS TO BE YOUR FRIEND.’

           Bobby seethes. Slaps the laptop shut. 

           But after a beat he re-considers. Looking over his shoulder.

           INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

           Lydia flings open the double-doors. Retrieving the HAT BOX. 
           She pops off the top, revealing the TRYST VR HEADSET.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bobby sits at Lydia’s laptop. He searches RYAN CALDWELL’S 
           PAGE. Popping through pictures: Ryan sailing in Connecticut. 
           Him and his bros in Vegas.

           Bobby clicks over to LYDIA’S PAGE now. He sifts through 
           private messages. Searching for a smoking gun. 

           Frustrated he changes tack, opening a GOOGLE SEARCH. He 
           stares at the search bar.  

                                 WORDS
                        Find Tryst match...

           He pushes enter. The results appear instantaneously. He 
           clicks the first hyperlink. It takes him to a MESSAGE BOARD. 

                                 WORDS (CONT’D)
                        Is it a good idea to meet your

                        This is driving me crazy! What if 
                        this is my soulmate?!

           Bobby scowls. Hitting another dead-end. 

           He re-directs to the official TRYST WEBSITE. It’s simply a 
           LOG-IN SCREEN. The cursor blinks in the PASSWORD text box. 

           Bobby’s eyes narrow... 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Lydia sneaks into the hallway. Lugging SOMETHING wrapped up 
           in a bath towel. She slips inside the bathroom. 

           The lock CLICKS behind her.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tight on BOBBY, leaning in, his face inches from the screen.    

           In a new tab, he highlights and copies Lydia’s AUTO-STORED 
           PASSWORD from her online banking website. He clicks back over 
           to the TRYST sign-in page, pasting in the stolen information. 

           The mouse floats down to the SUBMIT button... 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           The shower hisses on. Steam swirls overhead. Lydia stares 
           down at the PUSH NOTIFICATION: 

                                     *Meet Tonight?* 

           Her finger hovers over the “YES” and “NO” buttons. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bobby reacts, gaining access to Lydia’s TRYST ACCOUNT. He 
           filters through different options: Activity, Settings, 
           Rendezvous. Finally he lands on a tab marked ‘MY MATCHES.’ 

           He clicks it. A username is revealed to us:   

                                      REARWINDOW12
           Bobby recoils. Practically dumbfounded. Seeing the culprit’s 
           name right there in black and white practically knocks him 
           over. He jumps to his feet. Turning off the laptop.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Lydia reacts, hearing the front door slam O.S. She snorts. 
           Shaking her head. Good fucking riddance. 

           She stares down at the TRYST VR HEADSET, turning it over in 
           her hands. Frustration furrows her brow as she takes a deep 
           breath, pulling the headset on. Blocking out the world. 

                                       Welcome Back

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT - [VR SCAPE]

           EVE rides the elevator alone. Lights strobe on her 
           expressionless face as the elevator climbs higher and higher. 

           INT. ANTEROOM - NIGHT - [VR SCAPE]

           The elevator DINGS. The doors slide open. Eve steps out.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - [VR SCAPE]

           A hallway stretches out in both directions. Eve walks towards 
           a LARGE GLASS WALL MIRROR positioned in front of a chic 
           accent table. Potted succulents sit atop white marble.

           She studies her reflection. Staring with strange intensity.

           Just then, ADAM appears on the other end of the hallway. He 
           walks towards her, falling in and out of shadow as he passes 
           beneath the evenly spaced lights. 

           As he draws nearer, we watch EVE’s lips curl mischievously. 

           She’s got an idea... 

           Just then, she grabs a POTTED SUCCULENT off the accent table 
           and hurls it at the WALL MIRROR. There’s an EXPLOSION of 
           glass. Adam shields himself, jagged shards tinkling down all 
           around them. 

           Adam uncovers himself. Taking stock of things.

           In front of him, a DANGEROUS PATHWAY of BROKEN GLASS lines 
           the floor between. She’s ostensibly created a bed of nails. 
           Adam looks up at Eve. She coolly raises an eyebrow. Making 
           her intentions clear: You want it... Come get it... 

           An AFTERIMAGE flickers.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - [VR SCAPE]

           Adam takes a cautious step forward. GLASS POPS AND CRUNCHES. 
           His breath catches. Face contorting. 

           He glances at Eve -- not even a trace of pity in her eyes. 

           He steps forward... AGAIN... AND AGAIN... AND AGAIN... 

           An AFTERIMAGE sizzles 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - [VR SCAPE]

           He arrives in front of her. Stumbling. Dropping to a knee. 
           Eve slides her fingers through the hair on the back of his 
           skull. For a moment it looks like she may comfort him... 

           Instead, she grips his hair PULLING HIS FACE INTO HER CROTCH. 
           Eve throws her head backward. Moaning. Eyelashes fluttering. 

           An AFTERIMAGE warps. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - [VR SCAPE]

           Eve’s FOOT presses into Adam’s chest. Adam stares up at her, 
           INTENSE EYE CONTACT, as she LAYS HIM DOWN on the bed of 
           BROKEN GLASS. He growls as she pushes down, INFLICTING PAIN.  

           Then... SHE LOWERS HERSELF ON TOP OF HIM. 

           Their fingers interlace as she GRINDS the backs of his palms 
           into the floor. Then she begins to RIDE HIM.

           Adam grunts. Sharply inhaling. Enjoying it now.

           And as we pull back, the avatars punishing each other in a 
           spiderweb of broken glass, we PRELAP: a DOOR BANGING.

           INT. EDITING BAY - NIGHT

           The BLUE LIGHT of the TRYST HEADSET pulses softly in the 
           dark. LIAM’s mouth hangs open as he sits there, jacked in. 
           Totally catatonic. Then we hear more KNOCKING on the door. 
           The door handle starts to jiggle. Followed by muffled calls. 
           Soon the effort INTENSIFIES. The handle flapping up and down. 
           Finally Liam’s head turns. Sensing something. CUT TO:

           LIAM throws opens the door. WILD EYED. Standing half-hidden 
           behind it. This startles the COWORKER on the other side.   

                                 LIAM
                        What?!

                                 COWORKER
                        What the hell, man? We’re locking 
                        doors now? 

                                 LIAM
                        What do you want?  

                                 COWORKER
                        I converted those audio files for 
                        you. You said you wanted them 
                        tonight. 

                                 LIAM
                        So send them over. 

                                 COWORKER
                        I did. Hours ago. I wanted to make 
                        sure you got them before I left. 
                             (then)
                        Jesus man, get a grip. 

           The Coworker walks off. Liam chews his lip, checks his 
           surroundings, and shuts the door. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Amy walks down the street, carrying an armful of groceries. 
           Suddenly her expression turns: 

           Across the street MARTIN nips at a cigarette outside of a 
           Dumpling House. He takes a final drag before walking off, 
           disappearing around the corner. 

           Amy’s eyes FLASH. She jaywalks across the street, catching 
           him before he enters the restaurant. 

                                 AMY
                        Martin. Hi. 
                             (off his look)
                        Amy. I’m Liam’s girlfriend. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Amy. Yes. How are you? 
                                 AMY
                        Good. Yeah. How’s that big two-part 
                        episode coming? 

                                 MARTIN
                        Pardon? 

                                 AMY
                        Liam told me that you guys were 
                        gonna be working late this week. 
                        Putting together this big finale 
                        episode or something? 

                                 MARTIN
                        Huh. No. We finished that ages ago.

                                 AMY
                        Really? Is there any other big 
                        project that would be keeping him 
                        this late? Maybe I got it confused. 

                                 MARTIN
                             (squirming, at a loss)
                        Uhhh. I really couldn’t say off- 
                        hand. Listen Amy, I have to get 
                        back inside.

                                 AMY
                        Right. Yeah. Enjoy your dinner. 

           Martin exits into the restaurant. Amy leans against the wall. 
           Struggling to reconcile it. Gut-punched by the implications. 
           After a beat she glances up, noticing a nearby LIQUOR STORE.  

           She stares at it -- conflicted. 

           We PRELAP the sound of JANGLING KEYS. 

           INT. KITCHENETTE - NIGHT

           Liam enters the dark apartment. He flicks on the light. 

           The space is EMPTY. 

           Liam walks around the corner, glancing down the hallway. 
           Through the open door we see Amy passed out on their bed. 
           Liam looks down at his watch, confused. 

           It’s really early to be asleep.

           He walks back into the kitchen. Pops open the refrigerator. 
           He sifts through tupperware. Selecting one. Sniffing at it. 
           He takes a bite and his face SOURS. 

           He pulls out the TRASH CAN, about to toss the food when 
           something else catches his eye. 

           He pulls out an EMPTY WINE BOTTLE from the garbage. He turns 
           it over in his hand. Darkening. Putting the pieces together. 

           CUT TO BLACK

                                 BOBBY (OVER BLACK) 
                        So you’re gonna get a kick outta 
                        this.

                                 LIAM (OVER BLACK)
                        Oh yeah? 

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Bobby stares out the window as the train hurtles down the 
           track. The lights of the tunnel flash by at high velocity. He 
           wears a strange grin. Like he’s tonguing at a rotten tooth. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I was rooting around in Lydia’s 
                        closet. Guess what I found? 

           Liam coolly raises an eyebrow -- waiting for the punch line. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Your little VR headset. Turns out 
                        she’s got one too. Can you believe 
                        that shit? 

           Liam’s face drops -- this is the opposite of funny. He sits 
           there. DUMB. Practically paralyzed. Just blinking for a bit. 
           Finally he stammers: 

                                 LIAM
                        Shit.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah. Shit is right. 

                                 LIAM
                             (a beat, recomposing)
                        Well, it’s like you said. It’s just 
                        a game. No big deal right? 

           Bobby doesn’t answer. He just stares out the window instead.
           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           The uncomfortable silence has carried over as Bobby and Liam 
           walk down the street. We favor Liam, mind racing as he tries 
           to cobble together some type of response. Advice. Anything.  

           He opens his mouth, but the words clot in his throat. 

           Just then, they arrive at the COFFEE SHOP. As they disappear 
           through the door we PRELAP: 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        You think your parents were 
                        faithful?

           EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

           They’re sitting now. Drinking coffees in their familiar spot. 
           Bobby gazes at the jagged skyline. Liam stares at his shoes. 

                                 LIAM
                        I guess so. My dad’s too sweaty to 
                        pull off an affair. You? 

                                 BOBBY
                        I dunno. I know my grandparents 
                        weren’t. It was different for them. 
                        You see the girl from the 
                        neighborhood. She seems nice. 
                        Fertile. That was all you needed. 
                        It was more of a transaction back 
                        then. He did his thing. She did 
                        hers. And then they’d sit down and 
                        have dinner together. There wasn’t 
                        any pressure to find your soulmate. 
                        Honestly, I think that’s why all 
                        our parents got divorced. Because 
                        what the fuck do you do with that? 
                        Tell you the truth, I don’t think 
                        either approach works.

           Bobby scoffs. Run aground in self-defeating thoughts. Liam 
           sits there quietly. Anguished. Then after a long pause. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think I should do? 

           Liam glances over at Bobby -- hardly able to look at him. 

                                 LIAM
                        Sleep on it. 
           Bobby nods. Chuckles a little. Suddenly aware of how crazy he 
           must seem. He looks over at Liam. Real gratitude in his eyes.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Thanks for listening, man. 

           Liam swallows his guilt. Mustering a supportive little grin. 
           The two of them sip their coffees in the quiet that follows. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Amy presides over the chaos of her classroom. Her eyes are 
           glazed over, face in her hands as she lazily scans the room. 
           Watching the kids play during their break: 

           A bucket of Legos is poured out, inciting a feeding frenzy.

           Another group plays DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE. The kids giggle, 
           testing their tiny turning radiuses. 

           Finally we see a BOY and GIRL off to the side, lost in their 
           own world. They pantomime domestic duties. Playing a game of 
           house. 

           The boy finishes his chore. The girl kisses him on the head. 
           Amy watches them, affected. PRELAP: 

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        Heyyyy girl. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Heyyy. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Lydia and Amy hug on a heavily trafficked street corner.  

                                 AMY 
                        Thanks for doing this with me. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Are you kidding? I love this stuff. 
                        Whose wedding is it? 

                                 AMY
                        My cousin’s. She’s pregnant.  

                                 LYDIA
                        Oh. Well good news is she’ll be 
                        glowing in all the wedding pics. 
                        Pregnancy is like super good for 
                        your hair. 
                                 AMY
                        I just hope I don’t strangle the 
                        fetus when I’m tying the bustle. 

           They laugh together as they spin through the revolving door 
           of a large DEPARTMENT STORE. 

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Amy stands before a mirror, trying on her BRIDESMAID dress. 
           It looks decent enough, but we get the feeling Amy doesn’t 
           think so. She stares at her reflection. A little saddened. 

           She takes out her phone and snaps a picture. We see her text 
           it to her MOTHER. Quickly the three dot bubble appears.

                                 TEXT (MOM) 
                        WOW. So pretty! I can’t believe how 
                        gorgeous you look. 

           This elicits a tiny smile from Amy. 

                                 TEXT (MOM) (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be your turn soon, honey. 
                        You’re going to make an absolutely 
                        beautiful bride. 

           Amy stares down at the text. Her face puckering. She jams a 
           hand to her mouth. Muzzling herself. But it’s too late. She’s 
           unable to stop it. 

           She begins crying. Trying hard to keep silent. Just then:  

                                 LYDIA (O.S.) 
                        Well? How is it?! 

           Lydia knocks on the door, poking her head in. Amy turns 
           around, revealing her current state. Tears streaking through 
           her makeup. Lydia’s face turns. 

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Amy.

           As Lydia approaches, bringing Amy into a hug we PRELAP: 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        We’ve just been in a really weird 
                        place for a long time. 
           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER

           They sit hunkered down in a quiet corner of the store. Amy’s 
           momentarily calmed. Her face still a bit puffy from crying. 

                                 AMY
                        Liam and I don’t really fight. It’s 
                        just not us. That’s why this 
                        distance is so strange. Scary. I 
                        just hope I haven’t ruined 
                        everything. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Amy. Of course you haven’t. 

                                 AMY
                        I’ve just been so awful to him 
                        recently. 

                                 LYDIA
                        You couldn’t be if you tried. 

                                 AMY
                        You don’t get it. Something 
                        happened. 

           Thick silence. Amy tugs at her sweater. Self-comforting. 
           Concern spreads across Lydia’s face.

                                 LYDIA
                        What? 

                                 AMY
                             (hesitant)
                        So my sobriety thing? It’s not just 
                        a fun little -- whatever. A month 
                        or two before I met you, I did 
                        something really, really fucked up. 
                        That’s why I don’t drink anymore.
                             (correcting herself)
                        Didn’t drink anymore. 

           She strains slightly before continuing:   

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I had been leaning on Liam pretty 
                        hard to get engaged. You know a 
                        shit or get off the pot kinda 
                        thing. One night we were out 
                        drinking with friends and Liam got 
                        called into work. I stayed out. And 
                        I got really drunk. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        That night, Liam came home and 
                        found me in our bed, making out 
                        with someone I met at the bar. A 
                        girl. A total stranger. 

           Lydia reacts to this. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Whoa. 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Has this kind of thing ever 
                        happened before? 

                                 AMY
                        God no. Not even in college. 
                        Honestly I didn’t even remember 
                        what she looked like until we saw 
                        her at the grocery store. 
                             (then)
                        The whole thing’s such a blur. 

           Amy frowns, fidgeting ever so slightly as we PRELAP: 

                                 AMY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I guess I had just been feeling 
                        really insecure. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           They’re walking now. 

                                 AMY
                        About us. The future. I think I 
                        just needed him to notice that.  

           Lydia side-eyes her -- debating whether or not to speak up.

                                 LYDIA
                        Amy. Are you sure that’s what this 
                        is? Cause I gotta be honest. I just 
                        don’t see that. 

                                 AMY
                        What do you mean? 

                                 LYDIA
                        You don’t strike me as the 
                        vindictive type. I’m mad at you so 
                        I’m gonna fuck somebody? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LYDIA (CONT'D)
                        That’s not you. Plus, when I’m 
                        drunk? I’m not rationalizing 
                        things. Or thinking about my life 
                        in capital letters. I just do what 
                        I want.
                             (then)
                        Maybe this isn’t a you and Liam 
                        thing? Maybe it’s coming from 
                        somewhere else?   

           Amy’s struck by this. It’s a scary thought. One she’s clearly 
           never considered. She blinks at it. Processing for a beat. 

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        Either way, you need to let 
                        yourself off the hook. Because 
                        crying in dressing rooms? You don’t 
                        deserve that shit. 

           Lydia takes Amy’s hand. Giving it a squeeze. 

           Amy cracks a half-hearted smile before dodging eye contact.  
           Mulling things.  

           INT. BEDROOM - LIAM AND AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           MORNING. Liam dresses for work. Doing up the final button of 
           his shirt. He glances over his shoulder. 

           Amy lays asleep in bed.  

           Liam stares at her for a long beat. Shamefaced. 

           She’s right there, but somehow she feels so far away. 

           For a moment it looks like he might wake her. But he thinks 
           better of it, shouldering on his coat before exiting. 

           We hold on Amy as we hear the front door shut. 

           Just then her eyes pop open. 

           She was pretending to be asleep. 

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY 

           Liam stares off into another dimension as he walks down the 
           street. We begin a CROSS-CUT SEQUENCE: 
           IN THE EDITING BAY:

           Liam stares at his monitor. Totally numb. 

           He clicks through old PICTURES of him and Amy. 

           IN THE SHOWER: 

           The AVATARS make love in the shower. 

           Skin glistening. Pressing the glass. 

           Their figures half-obscured in rolling steam.

           IN THE EDITING BAY:

           Liam lands on a treasured photo of him and Amy. 

           They smile, looking like the PERFECT COUPLE.  

           IN THE SHOWER:

           Adam kisses Eve. 

           Hungry. Unable to stop. 

           ON THE STREET:

           Liam grimaces. Fighting off a migraine. 

           IN THE EDITING BAY:

           The camera slowly pushes in on AMY. 

           Her image begins to FLATTEN OUT. 

           Her smile PIXELATING ever so slightly. 

           IN THE SHOWER: 

           Adam stares into Eve’s big EYES.  

           A feeling of REAL INTIMACY. 

           ON THE STREET:

           Liam THUDS shoulders with a passerby. 
           The passerby turns around. SHOUTING. 

           But Liam doesn’t notice. Continuing on like a zombie. 

           IN THE EDITING BAY:

           Liam toggles between the photo and a SIMILAR ONE. 

           The couple caught in-between smiles. 

           The artifice of the moment EXPOSED. 

           IN THE SHOWER:

           Adam THRUSTS with all his might. 

           Burying his forehead into the glass wall. 

           He glances over.  

           WATER DROPLETS crawl up the glass like GRAVITY IN REVERSE.

           Shocked, he blinks. 

           And the GLITCH corrects itself. 

           IN THE EDITING BAY:

           Liam toggles between the two pictures. 

           The images FLASHING BY. 

           BLURRING TOGETHER. 

           IN THE SHOWER:

           Adam reacts to this. HORRIFIED. 

           But it’s too late now. His eyes PINCH SHUT. 

           He comes HARD. 

           Shoulders slumping. Catching his breath. 

           He picks his forehead off the glass. 

           And then his face drops in SHOCK. 

           It isn’t Eve he’s looking down at. 
           It’s LYDIA. 

           Her eyes glazed in ECSTASY. 

           A satisfied smile curls her lips as we END CROSSCUT SEQUENCE. 

           INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

           Liam jolts awake. Totally shaken by this nightmare. He 
           blinks. Disoriented. Almost stuck between two realities.    

           His disembodied face floats in the air. Pulled from the 
           blackness by the glow of his monitor. 

           Slowly he backs away from the screen. 

           Turning it off. 

           His AFTERIMAGE burns into the blackness. Lingering there.  

           INT. KITCHENETTE - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT -  DAY

           Amy leans on the counter. Drumming her fingers on the tile.  
           She pulls out her phone. Texting Liam: 

                                 TEXT (AMY)
                        When do you think you’ll be home 
                        tonigh--

           She deletes the words before she finishes. Frustrated by the 
           thought of another night spent waiting around. She stares 
           off. Weighing her options. 

           She texts Bobby:  

                                 TEXT (AMY) (CONT’D)
                        You got any plans tonight?

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Bobby stands outside of a 2nd story walk-up. He cinches his 
           drawstring hoodie, bracing himself against the freezing cold.

           Just then, he smiles. A puff of warm air escapes his mouth.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Yo!

           Amy appears nearby. Jogging over. Her skin flushed with cold. 
           Bobby’s clearly tickled by her presence. This isn’t the norm.   
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Look at you, all spontaneous and 
                        shit.

                                 AMY
                             (teeth chattering)
                        Can we please go inside.

                                 BOBBY
                        What do you mean? It’s on the roof.

           Amy gives him a DEATH GLARE. Bobby grins mischievously. 
           Having fun with her. She snorts a half smile. Exasperated.  

                                 AMY
                        Funny. Can we go now? 

           As Bobby pulls her in, ushering her up the building’s stairs: 

                                 BOBBY
                        When’s the last time you went out 
                        on a school night? What are your 
                        kids gonna say? 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, well -- they ain’t learning 
                        shit tomorrow. 

           As they laugh together, we PRELAP a VIBE-Y BASELINE. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           We’re in a HOUSE-PARTY. Artsy hipsters take Snapchats of each 
           other, laughing drunkenly, putting on for the camera. 

           Their expensive clothes are designed to look like shit, 
           burning through daddy’s money at breakneck speed. 

           Bobby and Amy appear in the doorway. Amy takes one look 
           inside and her eyes BULGE. What have I gotten myself into? 

           Bobby glances back. Reading her mind. Just relax, okay? 

           He walks off toward the KITCHEN. Snaking through the crowd. 
           Amy takes a deep breath. Committing herself. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           KEG BEER froths as it splashes into a red solo cup. Music 
           plays so loud we can’t hear ourselves think. Amy watches 
           Bobby fill two cups. Trying hard not to look squeamish. 
           He offers her the cup. Amy looks at it. Hesitating a beat. 
           Bobby just shrugs like: hey it’s your call. 

           Finally, Amy grabs it. Taking a big swig. 

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Amy LAUGHS hysterically. Listening to a stranger’s story.

                                 STRANGER
                        The poor kid, has a peanut allergy, 
                        and everyday his best friend gets a 
                        Reeses cup for lunch. For months my 
                        dawgs sitting there, watching this, 
                        lusting after these peanut butter 
                        cups. One day he snaps. He screams: 
                        I can’t take it anymore! He eats 
                        one, stabs himself with an epi-pen 
                        and tells his friend to call 9-1-1. 
                        Obviously, dude’s my hero.    

           Amy cracks up. Looking lighter. Finally enjoying herself. 

           INT. APARTMENT - LATER

           Amy and Bobby dance in a throng of people. Amy’s eyes are 
           closed, bouncing with the music. Looking more and more free. 

           She opens her eyes. Bobby looks down at her. Smiling wide. 

                                 AMY
                             (yelling over music)
                        Thank you. 

                                 BOBBY
                        For what? 

                                 AMY
                        For this. I really needed it. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t mention it
                             (re: solo cup)
                        Want more? 

                                 AMY
                        Sure. 

           He grabs her cup. Sliding through the makeshift dance floor. 
           Amy continues to dance, eyes open now, scanning the room.  
           Just then she notices a WOMAN, leaning on the opposite wall. 
           She’s handsome. Punky short hair. Lipstick. She makes no 
           attempt to hide her interest. Eyes wandering all over Amy. 

           Amy quickly looks elsewhere. But a moment later, her eyes 
           flick back. The WOMAN grins at her. Enjoying the view. 

           Just then, Bobby returns.

                                 BOBBY 
                        Keg’s tapped.
                             (handing her a beer)
                        Enjoy it, okay? 

           Amy dances. Gulping down it down. Something’s come over her 
           now as she lets loose. Grinding on Bobby. Hair tousled. 
           Sweaty. And every so often, she steals glimpses of the Woman. 

           People pass in the foreground but her gaze remains constant. 
           Shameless. Sexy. And as the Woman smokes her cigarette, we--

           PRELAP keys JANGLING in a door. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Amy and Bobby spill into the dark apartment. Amy clops off in 
           her heels, swaying slightly as she flicks on the lights. 
           Bobby looks around the empty apartment. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Seriously? 

                                 AMY
                        Yep. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Where the hell is he? 

                                 AMY
                        Work. Maybe.

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s brutal. 

                                 AMY
                        Tell me about it. 

           Amy tosses her keys onto the counter. Plops onto the couch. 

           Bobby takes the seat next to her. He kicks off his shoes. 
           Helping himself to a nearby blanket. He spreads it over their 
           laps. A careful 50/50 split. Amy smiles at this. 
                                 BOBBY
                        What? 

           She shakes her head. Kicking off her own heels. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        It’s nice, right?  

           Bobby reclines. Lifting his feet onto her lap. Amy side-eyes. 

                                 AMY
                        Uhhh. What? 

                                 BOBBY
                        They’re not just gonna massage 
                        themselves, Amy.  

           He pokes her in a soft spot with his toes. She reacts. 
           Playfully shucking his feet. Resisting the urge to laugh. 

                                 AMY
                        Your feet literally could not smell 
                        any worse. 

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s how you know they’re ready 
                        for a rub. 

                                 AMY
                        Well thank God that’s not in my 
                        purview.

           She pushes his feet again. He raises his hands. Pacifying.  

           They readjust. Falling into a kind of half-cuddle. His arm 
           atop the couch as she eases down next to him. Head resting on 
           his shoulder. 

           Their faces glow blue as the TV turns on. They sit in silence 
           as Amy clicks the remote. Scrolling through endless options. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        What’s Lydia up to tonight? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Uch. Who knows. 

                                 AMY
                        You guy’s okay? 

                                 BOBBY
                        Can we not talk about it, maybe?  
                                 AMY
                        Sorry. 

                                 BOBBY
                        It’s fine. It’s just nice not to 
                        think about it for once. You know? 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. I do. 

           Amy puts a comforting hand on top of his. 

           Bobby stares down at it. His expression TIGHTENING. Suddenly 
           aware of the warmth of her body. The graze of her breath. 

           Amy settles down deeper into the crook of his arm. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Relationships are hard, aren’t 
                        they? If you’re not careful, they 
                        can turn you into a crazy person.  

                                 BOBBY
                        I dunno. Not all of them do.

           Bobby runs his thumb along Amy’s hand. Caressing it almost. 
           Now it’s Amy’s turn to clam up. Heart pumping in her throat. 
           Her eyes flick up at his lips. Feeling drunk. Spun around.   

           We hold here for a beat in TENSE SILENCE.  

           Finally-- 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        If we’re gonna watch this thing we 
                        should probably put it on now. 

           And just like that the spell is broken. Amy jumps to her 
           feet. Her voice too loud as she quickly responds:  

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. Lemme just throw on some 
                        comfy pants. 

           Amy disappears into the bedroom.

           Bobby winces. Upset with himself. Immediately regretting it. 

           He sighs, grabbing the nearby LAPTOP off a couch cushion. 
           Bobby opens it. The browser’s filled with a MILLION TABS. 

           Bobby smirks. X-ing out of Liam’s tabs. But then he stops--
           On the screen we see LYDIA’S FACEBOOK PAGE. We’re deep in her 
           photo albums. A SELFIE is on the screen. She winks at camera. 

           Bobby blinks at this. 

           He pushes the ‘BACK BUTTON.’ A different picture pops up. 
           Lydia and her girls painting the town red. They’re striking 
           poses. Nailing the skinny arm. He pushes the back button 
           again. And now a BIKINI SHOT appears. Cleavage everywhere.  

           Bobby sours at this. 

           He clicks the button more rapidly. Pictures of Lydia fly by 
           at high speed. Someone’s looked through HUNDREDS of them. 

           Bobby closes the tab. He sits there quietly for a beat. 
           Disoriented. Unable to shake this niggling thought. 

           He opens a GOOGLE SEARCH. He stares intensely at the cursor.  
           Teetering on the edge of something. 

           He types: 

                                 WORDS
                        Find Tryst match. 

           He clicks. The familiar search results appear. But this time 
           the HYPERLINK IS PURPLE. Someone’s been here already.

           Just then, we hear Amy re-emerging from the hall. 

           Bobby reacts, shutting the laptop. Trying to act normal. Amy 
           takes a seat on the couch, a little further away this time.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Amy, do the words: Rearwindow12 
                        mean anything to you?  

                                 AMY
                        Oh my God. He hasn’t recruited you 
                        too, has he?
                             (off Bobby’s blank look)
                        It’s Liam’s gamer tag. He thinks 
                        it’s cool. I think it’s fucking 
                        creepy to be honest. You boys and 
                        your video games. 
                             (then)
                        Why do you ask? 

           Bobby shrugs. Staring straight ahead. “No reason.” Amy thinks 
           nothing of it. Clicking the TV REMOTE to life. 

           We hold here. Bobby brooding in the bluish haze of the TV. 
           INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

           Liam sleeps on the ratty spare couch of his editing bay. His 
           coat is draped across him like a makeshift blanket. Then he’s 
           roughly shaken awake.

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        Liam -- what are you doing here?

           Liam jolts awake. Throwing off his coat. Frightening Martin. 
           He looks ROUGH. Hair matted. Lips chapped. For a moment he 
           struggles to place himself. Reality becoming more attenuated.  

           Martin stares down at him. Horrified.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on with you, man? 

                                 LIAM
                             (sobering)
                        Just a late one. No big deal. 

                                 MARTIN
                        I think you should go home. 

                                 LIAM
                        I just need a coffee is all. 

                                 MARTIN
                        No. Go home. Take the rest of the 
                        day. You need to clean yourself up, 
                        Liam. You’re scaring people.

           Martin exits.

           Liam sits there. Chastised. Struggling to shake this off. He 
           buries his face in his hands. Just now realizing the scope of 
           his workplace fuck-up. 

           On cue, his phone BUZZES on the nearby coffee table.

           Liam stops breathing. Blood running cold. He glances between 
           his fingers. Hardly able to look. 

                                      *Meet Today?*

           Liam glares at it. Sullen. Bucking against the urge. He 
           grinds his teeth. Reasserting himself. Suddenly he stands-- 

           Liam reaches behind the couch, pulling the TRYST VR HEADSET 
           from its hiding spot. Roughly he shoves it in his backpack. 
           Zipping it shut. 
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Lydia stands at the head of a long table. Finishing up her 
           big presentation. Floor to ceiling windows provide a CEO’s 
           vantage of the city. SENIOR EXECUTIVES sit around the table.    

                                 LYDIA
                        So if we’re really going to focus 
                        on product excellence, we need to 
                        integrate in-stream ads across all 
                        devices. And not just the app. Any 
                        questions? 

           She turns from her presentation and faces the room. Exuding 
           confidence. Like a gymnast who just stuck the landing. 

           TOM (the big boss) stands, clapping enthusiastically. Nearby, 
           RYAN (from the bar) follows suit. Looking far less amused. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

           Lydia blows into the stairwell. Pumped up. Allowing herself 
           this private moment of victory. She worked so hard for this. 

           But just as fast, the smile vanishes from her face.  

                                 VOICE #1 (O.S.) 
                        What’d you think of her 
                        presentation? 

                                 VOICE #2 (O.S.) 
                        Eh. Typical UX bullshit. Another 
                        dog and pony show. 

           Lydia creeps towards the railing, looking over the edge: 

           Two floors below, a couple CO-WORKERS sit on concrete steps, 
           passing a VAPORIZER between them. Smoke plumes as their 
           voices carry throughout the stairwell. 

                                 VOICE #1 (O.S.)
                        What do you mean?  

                                 VOICE #2 (O.S.)
                        Bro. Tom’s always pulling up the 
                        hot, young female managers. Why do 
                        you think she’s been fast-tracked? 
                        I mean, everybody knows Rod did 
                        most of the brain-work on her team.

                                 VOICE #1
                        Shit man. I wouldn’t mind riding 
                        her coattails to the top.  
           The two of them stand, disappearing from view. As they exit: 

                                 VOICE #2
                        That’s not the only thing I’d like 
                        to ride...  

           We hold on LYDIA as their laughter echoes off the walls. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        So a bit of follow up. 

           INT. ELEVATOR BANK - DAY

           Elevator doors slide open. The lunch crowd spilling out. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Several weeks ago we did a podcast 
                        on the Tryst VR headset. Since then 
                        we’ve been inundated with listener 
                        comments. You’ve written. You’ve 
                        called. You’ve sent us messages.

           We spot Lydia in wash of people. Something’s breaking in her. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        So today we’re going to play some 
                        of your responses. Our first 
                        message comes from Mariel in 
                        Arlington, Texas.

           Lydia floats through the crowded lobby. Numb to the world. 

           EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

           Lydia exits the building. A WOMAN’S VOICE filters in now:

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        So I’m an attorney who works on 
                        behalf of womens’ advocacy groups. 
                        And I have some serious ethical 
                        issues with this technology.  

           Lydia walks past smoke-breakers. Coffee-talkers. Fountains.   

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        The whole scheme feels tantamount 
                        to sexual assault!
           EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY

           Lydia continues. Back-dropped by a mosaic of ADVERTISEMENTS. 
           Buy this car. Wear this dress. Ads filtering seamlessly.    

           We hear a NEW VOICE now: 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        As a psychiatrist, what I’m dealing 
                        with is unprecedented. We’re seeing 
                        patients show signs of physical 
                        dependency. Changes in mood. Weight 
                        loss.

           We pass tourists marveling at the TV boards towering above. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        I feel like we’re on the cusp of a 
                        dangerous phase change here: 
                        reality is now optional.   

           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           We follow Lydia as she dodges taxis. Crossing the street. A 
           MALE VOICE filters in now. Tremulous. Slightly nervous.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Recently I suffered an accident 
                        that left me paralyzed from the 
                        waist down. I’ll spare you the 
                        details, but adjusting’s been hard.

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY

           Lydia gazes out the scuffed window of a subway car. 

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        That’s why this Tryst machine has 
                        been a godsend. To be able to 
                        experience sex again, its, uh--
                             (voice quavering)
                        It’s meant everything to me.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY 

           Lydia enters the HIGH LINE, a city park built atop a 
           suspended subway track. Our HOST’s voice returns.
                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        Our last listener comment comes 
                        from Shelby, a fourteen year old 
                        from Pittsburgh.

           EXT. HIGH LINE - DAY

           Lydia drifts through the park. Taking in all the artwork.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.) 
                        She writes: “A few weeks ago I 
                        stole my sister’s Tryst headset. My 
                        boyfriend had been pressuring me to 
                        have sex. And, as a virgin, I 
                        thought it would be a good idea to 
                        practice. But now having done both, 
                        I find myself confused. Is it wrong 
                        that I prefer one over the other? 
                        What does that mean, exactly?”  

           She passes statuary. Digital silhouettes projected on walls.

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        These are just some of the many 
                        responses we’ve received. Having 
                        sifted through story after story, I 
                        still have more questions than 
                        answers. However a clear theme did 
                        emerge. 

           Then Lydia stops. Not struck by the words. Something else.     

                                 PODCAST (V.O.)
                        Whether virtual or physical, sex 
                        will always be a human endeavour. 
                        Remember that the next time you 
                        plug in. That’s it for us today. 
                        We’ll be back next--

           Lydia plucks the earbuds from her ears. 

           Across the way, a group of TEENAGERS loiter, cutting class. 
           The group of boys clown a GIRL. She clutches her bookbag. 
           Body language making it clear she’s not enjoying herself. 

           On Lydia, deeply affected. She anguishes for this girl. Her 
           fate. It doesn’t change... 

           We hold on her, overcome in this moment, as the honk and 
           bustle of the city slowly washes back in. Enveloping her. 
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Bobby glares out the window of his coffee shop. The buzz and 
           whir of the fancy machines fail to provide him any solace. 

           He glances back at his laptop. Sneering. Like that’s gonna 
           calm him. He quickly slaps it shut, worrying his lips with 
           his fingers. Then an idea slowly takes shape. He glances down 
           at his PHONE. Thinking for a beat. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Amy’s phone sits face-up on her desk. Amy blurs by in the 
           background, chasing seven-year-olds to and fro. Just then, 
           her phone VIBRATES.

                                 TEXT (BOBBY) 
                        Stop by my place after work? 

           INT. BOBBY’S STUDIO - DAY

           Amy fidgets impatiently, sitting on the edge of Bobby’s ratty 
           futon. She fiddles with jewelry. Unable to keep still.    

           Just then, Bobby emerges from the kitchen. Offering wine.

                                 AMY
                        Oh, Bobby, I don’t want any of 
                        that. I can’t stay long. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re gonna want it. Trust me. 

           Bobby sinks down next to her. Amy reluctantly accepts it.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Look Amy, I don’t know how to tell 
                        you this. But what I have to say: 
                        it’s gonna suck. 

                                 AMY
                        Okay... 

           Bobby hesitates. Clinking the wineglass with his fingernail. 
           Amy reacts. Growing impatient.   

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        What?     

                                 BOBBY
                             (softly)
                        Liam’s cheating on you, Amy. 
           Amy reacts like Bobby told an off-color joke. Souring at it.  

                                 AMY
                        Uhhh... Excuse me?  

                                 BOBBY
                        It gets worse. He’s cheating on you 
                        with Lydia. 

                                 AMY
                             (almost leaving)
                        Okay. If this is some weird prank, 
                        I gotta tell you, I’m not down for 
                        it. Thanks for the wine, but--

                                 BOBBY
                        They got matched on Tryst. I found 
                        Lydia’s headset. Broke into her 
                        account. It’s been happening for a 
                        while now. I have proof, Amy. 

           With that, Amy sits back. Staggered. Hardly able to absorb 
           it. Bobby considers his shoes. Unable to look her in the eye.   

                                 AMY
                             (dawning)
                        You’re serious... 

           He nods. Allowing her a silent moment before continuing. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I think in the beginning I tried to 
                        convince myself it wasn’t a big 
                        deal. That was until I saw the 
                        change in her. The sneaking around. 
                        The distance. The lying. It’s clear 
                        to me now that this isn’t some fad.  

           He looks up at Amy. His words affecting her. Resonating.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        They took us for granted Amy. 
                        Allowed us to feel like shit. I 
                        don’t know about you, but I’m 
                        fucking tired of it.

           He slides his hand onto her thigh, and immediately the mood 
           in the room CHANGES. Ulterior motives becoming clear...   

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        We deserve to feel good again.

           Amy peers down at her leg. Then up at Bobby. Dumbstruck. 
                                 AMY
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 BOBBY
                        Don’t pretend like you don’t want 
                        it too.

           Her face puckers with revulsion as she slaps his hand away, 
           bolting to her feet. Bobby scrambles after her. Reaching out. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Amy--

           He tries to grab her, but she flinches badly. Screaming out:

                                 AMY
                        Don’t fucking touch me, Bobby.
                        You think, because you’re in pain -- 
                        you get to fuck me now? Is that it? 
                        Because of this Tryst thing, you’re 
                        entitled to some revenge pussy? Is 
                        that how it works?? 
                             (then)
                        Jesus Christ, Bobby. How could you?

           Amy’s face twists. Hurt. Betrayed. Let down by a friend. 
           After all these years, he’s finally shown his true colors. 

           Her eyes shimmer, staring down at him in disbelief. Then-- 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Wanna know why none of your 
                        relationships last? You’re selfish, 
                        Bobby. It’s why I dumped you. And 
                        it’s why she’s gonna dump you too.

           Bobby reacts. Gut-punched. Amy grabs her things, walking off 
           towards the door. But before she can exit, he calls out. 

                                 BOBBY (O.S.) 
                        That’s not why you dumped me, Amy. 
                        I think we both know the real 
                        reason.

           Amy stops and turns. Bobby practically snarls. Lashing out.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        You two were cute together last 
                        night. I hope you got her number.
                             (then)
                        I may be an asshole, Amy. But at 
                        least I’m not pretending. 

           And as Amy’s EYES WIDEN, totally knocked off balance, CUT TO:  
           EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

           Amy fast-walks. Head spinning. Cheeks flushed. Horns honk. 
           Taxis streak by. Confusion and noise surround us. Yet Amy 
           moves through it all TOTALLY NUMB. LOST IN HER OWN MIND. 

           We PRELAP a DOOR SLAM.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Amy leans against the door. Exhausted. The silence of the 
           room providing us momentary relief. Then she opens her eyes:

           Liam stands in the hall. He looks like shit. Red-rimmed. 
           Bedraggled. He’s so affected by the sight of her he can 
           hardly speak. After a long pause, he manages to whisper: 

                                 LIAM
                        Hi.

                                 AMY
                        Hey. 

           They stare at each other for a long time. Neither of them 
           knowing what to say. How to feel.  

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing home? 

                                 LIAM
                        They gave me the day off. I wanted 
                        to see you. 

           Amy gives him a thin-lipped smile. Liam closes the distance 
           now. Scooping her up into a big hug. We watch as Liam melts 
           into it. It’s like water in the desert for him.

           But Amy just stares off into the void. Indulging him, but 
           feeling nothing. 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I’ve been so off lately. 
                        I just -- I miss you. 

                                 AMY
                        Liam.

           Amy pulls out of the hug. Facing him. Looking into his eyes. 
           About to start the bigger conversation. But she hesitates.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I need to shower. How about you run 
                        out and grab us some food? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        We’ll have dinner together. How’s 
                        that sound? 

           Liam smiles at her. Buoyed. He kisses the top of her head. 

                                 LIAM
                        Sounds great.

           He pulls on a coat and exits the apartment. Amy exhales big. 
           Burying her face in her hands.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Amy enters the room. Sitting down on the edge of the bed. 
           That’s when she notices Liam’s BACKPACK leaned against the 
           nightstand. Amy blinks at it. Looking at it with skepticism. 

           She pulls it over. Unzips it. 

           Her face turns as she pulls out the TRYST VR HEADSET. She 
           rotates it in her hands. Staring down at the source of so 
           much pain. Disgusted, she tosses it on the bed.   

           But a beat later, her eyes drift back. Her expression 
           changing now. Suddenly she has the look of a cliff diver, 
           peaking over the ledge... 

           And as her face hardens. Growing resolute. We--

           CUT TO BLACK

           INT. HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT [VR SCAPE] 

           Bare feet leave shadows on the black marble floor as ADAM 
           tiptoes into the HOTEL. His eyes are like saucers. Mouth 
           totally agape. It’s more real than he could’ve ever imagined. 

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           He runs his fingers along the wall. It’s cool to the touch.

           INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           He loiters behind the counter. Pressing the phone to his ear. 

           INT. HOTEL - MIRROR - NIGHT [VR SCAPE] 

           He looks at himself in the mirror. Awestruck by his dangling 
           manhood. He wiggles his hips. Testing its flop. 
           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT [VR SCAPE] 

           Elevator doors slide open. A LONG CORRIDOR lined with rooms 
           stretches out in front of us. All of them are shut except a 
           single OPEN DOOR looming at the end of the hall.

           We’re on Adam -- considering it. 

           He takes a step toward it. Then another. And another. 

           Just then, he notices SHADOWS moving beneath the row of 
           doors. Other guests. God knows what they’re up to. 

           Unsettled, Adam shifts his focus back to the door. Getting 
           closer now. And as he takes a deep breath, ENTERING IT, we--

           CUT TO BLACK. 

           INT. HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           A DOORWAY. Total blackness beyond it. Everything’s still. 

           After a few seconds ADAM emerges from the open door. The 
           audience will recognize the moment. IT’S THE FILM’S OPENING 
           SHOT. Adam takes a step inside and stops in his tracks.

           EVE stands naked in the center of the room. Waiting for him. 

           They lock eyes. 

           AFTERIMAGE 

           The COUPLE stand before one another with perfect posture...

           AFTERIMAGE 

           Eve slowly extends her hand... taking him by the wrist... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           She lifts his hand to her mouth. We hear the slick pop of 
           saliva with INTENSE CLARITY AND VOLUME... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           She guides his hand downwards. Slowly passing her breasts... 
           Her perfect abdomen... Descending towards her pubic hair...

           AFTERIMAGE

           A small exhale escapes her lips, yet we experience it like 
           the RUSH OF A SUBWAY CAR. Her eyes bulge as she SLIDES HIS 
           FINGERS INSIDE HER... 
           AFTERIMAGE

           Adam’s eyes SLOWLY RIM CLOSED... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           Eve secures the BLINDFOLD on him... Blocking out the world... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           Adam tumbles backward onto the bed... falling WEIGHTLESSLY... 
           We watch as Adam surrenders himself to her... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           FINGERS crawl up his inner thighs... Adam shudders as she 
           makes her way up his body... leaving nothing untouched...   

           AFTERIMAGE

           Eve nibbles his ear... Climbing atop him... TAKING CONTROL... 
           Adam reacts as EVE GUIDES HIM INSIDE HER... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           His teeth gnash below his mask... ADAM LOSES HIMSELF IN IT... 
           BREATHING RATCHETING UP... THRUSTING with all of his might...

           AFTERIMAGE

           Their pace quickens...  Eve’s eyes pinch shut... She lets out 
           a SATISFIED SCREAM... HURTLING TOWARDS THE EDGE...

           AFTERIMAGE

           ADAM RIPS off THE BLINDFOLD... EXPRESSION ON FIRE, AS--

           Eve’s EYES SPARKLE down at him... ABSOLUTELY MESMERIZING... 
           More BEAUTIFUL than anything he’s ever seen before... 

           AFTERIMAGE

           Adam REACTS... Blown away... the experience ROCKING him... 
           We’re witnessing something TRANSFORMATIONAL... SPIRITUAL... 

           ADAM SMILES NOW... FULLY PRESENT... CONNECTING WITH HER... 
           THE FINAL PUSH... AND AS ORGASM GRIPS... ROILING HIS FACE... 

           CUT TO:
           INT. HOTEL - ROOM - LATER [VR SCAPE]

           They lay in a heap. Totally spent. Staring up at the ceiling. 
           Adam and Eve remain perfectly still. FROZEN IN TIME. Then--

                                 ADAM 
                        Why did you start doing this?

           Eve reacts. His voice surprising her. It’s the first time 
           they’ve spoken. After a moment she returns her gaze to the 
           ceiling. Reflecting. Fingers tracing circles in the sheets. 

                                 EVE
                        I dunno. Freedom I guess. The 
                        freedom to do what I wanted. To 
                        figure out what I wanted. What I 
                        like.

                                 ADAM
                        But it’s not real.

                                 EVE
                        I dunno.
                             (then)
                        I think people are their truest 
                        selves when they’re wearing a mask. 

           The room falls silent. Adam chews on that. Eve lets out a 
           deep, post-coital sigh. Luxuriating. Almost to herself: 

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        God I needed this today. 

                                 ADAM
                             (beat)
                        Why?

           Eve turns. Studying his face. Suddenly feeling VULNERABLE. 
           Unsure how to feel about this stranger asking questions.

           They stare at each other for a long beat. On the cusp of 
           something new. Are we really gonna cross that line?

           INT. KITCHEN - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           AMY stares into space. WIDE-EYED. Slowly sipping tea. 
           Attempting to wrap her head around what just happened.  

                                 LIAM (O.S.) 
                        I got your favorite. Shrimp Pad 
                        Thai. Extra peanut goop. 

           Liam appears. Dropping the PAPER BAG onto the counter top.
           Liam glances over at her as he unpacks the bag. Something 
           about her posture is strange to him. 

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        You okay? 

           Amy snaps out of it. Eyes fluttering. Slowly re-animating.   

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, no... I’m good. 

           Liam smiles. Softening. Breathing a sigh of relief. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Liam and Amy make love. Their first time in a while. A stark 
           contrast to the VR sex. It’s arrhythmic. Clumsy. Normal.  

           LIAM thrusts away. Eyes pinched shut. So engrossed he doesn’t 
           notice AMY, fully glazed, HER MIND SOMEWHERE ELSE ENTIRELY. 

                                 EVE (V.O.) 
                        What’s your deepest fantasy?  

           And as the ghost of a smile curls her lips, we BEGIN MONTAGE:

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Amy snores softly. Liam slowly rises. Slipping out of bed.

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Honestly? I don’t think I have one. 

           Quietly, Liam opens the closet doors -- hiding his BACKPACK.  

                                 ADAM (V.O.) 
                        I know that’s super lame, but I’ve 
                        been so -- nervous  -- to try new 
                        things. Too afraid to walk down the 
                        darkened corners of my mind. 

           He pulls out his phone. We watch him “DELETE” the TRYST APP.  

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           THE NEXT MORNING. Liam shoulders his coat, exiting the room. 
           Just as the door closes, Amy’s eyes POP OPEN-- 

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        I think for fear of being judged. 
                        Or looking foolish. 
           INT. SEX SHOP - DAY

           A HAND snatches a brand-new TRYST VR HEADSET off a shelf. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.) 
                        That’s what’s so special about this 
                        place: It takes the curse off not 
                        knowing. In fact, it’s fun not to 
                        know. To see yourself as a mystery 
                        again. Full of possibilities. 

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           A FIRE PLACE roars. Adam and Eve make love in the foreground. 
           Their pace slow. Tender. Luxuriating in every minute of it.   

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        God, it feels like I can actually 
                        talk to you. I mean, could you say 
                        this stuff to anybody out there? 

           AFTERWARD, they lay together. Sprawled. In no hurry at all. 

           INT. BASEMENT PARTY - NIGHT

           Strobes FLASH over Bobby’s sweaty face. He dances alone in 
           some shitty Brooklyn basement. Looking angry and heartsick.     

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        No way. I’ve never said any of this 
                        stuff to anyone. It’s too personal. 

           INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bobby has dispassionate sex with a stranger. Barely there. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        Honestly, I kinda feel like I’m 
                        faking it out there. 

           LATER. He composes a TEXT to Lydia. Pushing the SEND BUTTON. 
           We see a string of past attempts. All have gone unanswered.  

           INT. LYDIA’S WORK - DAY

           Lydia works. Tom and Ryan chat nearby. Lydia scowls at them. 
                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        I say the right things not because 
                        I want to, but because I know 
                        that’s what people want to hear. 

           INT. HOTEL - RESTAURANT - NIGHT [VR SCAPE] 

           Adam gives Eve oral in the booth of an ABANDONED RESTAURANT. 
           Her eyes pinch shut -- shoulders quaking with climax. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        That’s why in here -- it’s like I 
                        can fucking breathe again. There’s 
                        no bullshit rules. Or hoops to jump 
                        through. For once I can just be me. 
                        No compromises.   
                             (then)
                        Can I ask you something? 

           INT. HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           Eve services Adam by a LARGE WINDOW. Through tinted glass we 
           can just make out LIGHTS twinkling in the city beyond.  

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        What?  

           INT. HOTEL - BED - LATER [VR SCAPE]

           Adam watches Eve sleep. He delicately strokes her hair. 
           Completely enamored. Real tenderness in his eyes. 

                                 EVE (V.O.)
                        If you could do anything, totally 
                        free of consequence, what would it 
                        be? 

           INT. HOTEL - POOL - LATER [VR SCAPE]

           UNDERWATER. The electric blue of the pool fills the frame. 
           Then an EXPLOSION of bubbles as they cannonball into view. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        Honestly? 

           Adam and Eve swim towards each other. Free of the bounds of 
           gravity. They stare deeply into each other’s eyes. 

                                 ADAM (V.O.)
                        This. 
           As they kiss, bodies tumbling weightless, we END MONTAGE. 

           CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. EDITING BAY - DAY

           Liam hovers over his monitor. His eyes are bloodshot and raw. 
           Stubble dots his chin, marking the passage of time. 

           He looks different now. Hollowed out. Reduced. Like a drunk 
           who’s forty days sober. White-knuckling his sobriety. 

           On cue, he leans back. Grimacing through a tension headache. 

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY

           Liam nips at a cigarette. His shoulders tighter than ever. 
           Frustrated he drops the butt. Grinding it underfoot.   

           INT. KITCHEN - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Silverware clinks as Amy and Liam eat another wordless meal. 
           Liam glances up at her. She’s practically miles away.    

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGH

           Liam stares at the ceiling. Mouth sour. His face tight. 

           Amy’s nasal-y breathing bleeds in from O.S. His expression 
           tweaks. Clearly bothered by it.   

           He glances at the CLOSET DOOR, gritting his teeth. Trying his 
           best to ride out this urge. We watch as his eyes shimmer with 
           desperation. Expression crumbling. 

           OFF Liam, realizing it’s no use--

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Liam’s PHONE glows blue in the darkness. We watch as he re-
           downloads the TRYST APP. The familiar icon reappears. 
           Taunting him. Liam stares at it. Letting out a weary sigh. 

                                     *Meet Tonight?*
           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - [VR SCAPE]

           Bare legs stride into view. Feet leave shadows on the marble 
           as ADAM moves through the abandoned hotel. Eyelids heavy. A 
           subtle grin ghosting his face -- God, it’s good to be back. 

           INT. FRONT DESK - [VR SCAPE]

           EVE stands at the front desk, her back turned. Adam watches 
           her for a beat. Hungry-eyed. Transfixed. Wetting his lips. 

           He sidles up behind her. Entering her personal space. He 
           lifts a finger to her lower back, tracing an ‘X’ across her 
           skin. Her shoulders tremble in response.

           Adam smirks at this, burying his face in the nape of her 
           neck. But just then--

                                 EVE (O.S.)
                        I thought we agreed we were done 
                        playing games.

           Adam stiffens. Practically FROZEN in place. Slowly, he lifts 
           his head up. Eyes BULGING as takes a cautious step backward.  

           HE’S NEVER HEARD HER VOICE BEFORE. She turns. Facing him now.  

                                 EVE (CONT’D)
                        I thought maybe tonight you could 
                        choke me? How does that sound? 

           OFF Adam, stammering -- looking like he’s seen a ghost. 

           EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

           Liam chews his fingernails. Leg bouncing up and down. It 
           doesn’t look like he slept much. Jittery with nervous energy.  

           Liam’s eyes dart around the park. Weekend bikers ride by. 
           Groups of kids play freeze tag. Life unfolds like normal. 

           Liam blinks at this. Feeling lost. Alienated from it. 
           Suddenly the tableau feels foreign to him. Just then--

                                 BOBBY (O.S.)
                        Jesus, man. 

           Liam startles. Shocked to find BOBBY standing over him. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                             (blunt)
                        You look like shit. 
           Liam snorts. Catching his breath. He offers Bobby a coffee. 
           Bobby raises an eyebrow. You’re fucking kidding me, right?  

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Seriously?
                             (impatient)
                        What do you want, Liam? 

                                 LIAM
                        I just wanna have a coffee. I feel 
                        like I haven’t seen you in months. 
                        How you been?  

           Bobby snorts a laugh. Bitter. Shaking his head in disbelief. 

                                 BOBBY
                        You got some balls, man... 

                                 LIAM
                        What are you talking about? 

                                 BOBBY
                        You’re really gonna play dumb??
                             (exploding)
                        I know, Liam! I know about you. And 
                        Lydia. And Tryst. You think I’m 
                        fuckin’ stupid? You ruined my life, 
                        man. 

           Liam takes a step back. Caught. Staggered. Blind-sided by it. 

                                 LIAM
                             (survival mode)
                        Bobby -- you gotta know -- I never 
                        would’ve done it if I knew it was 
                        her on the other end. By the time I 
                        realized it--

                                 BOBBY
                        Save it. 

           Liam trails off. Shamed into silence. Bobby stares at the 
           ground. A terrible beat passes. Finally Bobby looks up at 
           him. His face twists. Pitying. Resigned to their broken fate. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        You’re a coward, Liam. You deserve 
                        what happens next.

           Bobby begins to exit. But moments later, he turns around: 
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Oh and by the way: I told Amy. 
                        She’s known for months now.
                        Don’t text me again, alright?  

           Bobby walks off, disappearing through leafless trees. 

           We stay on Liam as his world comes un-done. Eyes BULGING as 
           he puzzles it together. The distance in Amy. The change in 
           Eve. It all points toward one inescapable fact: AMY HIJACKED 
           HIS TRYST ACCOUNT! And as the sky falls atop of him, PRELAP: 

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        Heyyy! 

                                 AMY (O.S.) 
                        Hey!

           EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY 

           Amy waits on the sidewalk, heart-fluttering as LYDIA walks 
           towards her. Amy scoops her into a tight hug. Closing her 
           eyes. Practically melting into it. 

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                        Honestly, it’s been a long time 
                        coming. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

           Amy listens to Lydia. Totally rapt. She hangs on every word, 
           hardly touching the BRUNCH SPREAD laid out before them. 

                                 LYDIA,
                        I feel like I was just giving, and 
                        giving, and giving. And I wasn’t 
                        getting anything back.  
                             (pausing)
                        It sucks. Going out with a whimper. 
                        But honestly: I haven’t had any 
                        second thoughts. I know it sounds 
                        awful to say, but -- I’m just so 
                        fucking relieved. 

           Amy nods. Her face sympathetic. She lets a pause float by. 

                                 AMY
                             (careful)
                        So you guys are like done, done? 
                                 LYDIA
                        I mean, yeah. He’s been texting me 
                        but, as far as I’m concerned, it’s 
                        over. I’ve moved on.

           Lydia takes a deep breath. Broaching a delicate subject. 

                                 LYDIA (CONT’D)
                        Look, Amy -- I know how close you 
                        and Bobby are. And I know it always 
                        gets weird when friends break up. 
                        But I’m hoping that -- well -- 
                        You’re important to me, Amy. I just 
                        hope we can stay close. 

           Amy reacts. Genuinely touched. Tears welling in her eyes.  

                                 AMY
                        Lydia. Jesus. You’re gonna make me 
                        cry all over my french toast.  

           They laugh together. Cutting the tension in the room. Then-- 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                             (sincere)
                        You did the right thing, Lydia. I’m 
                        happy for you. Seriously. And if 
                        you’re worried that I’m gonna 
                        choose sides in this -- don’t be. 
                        Because the truth is: I choose you.  

           Lydia’s face puckers at that. Feeling loved. Supported. Seen. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Thanks, Amy. That means a lot. 

           Lydia reaches across the table. Giving Amy’s hand a SQUEEZE. 
           Amy thrills. Her heart practically leaping out of her chest. 

           Lydia lets go. Taking a sip of her mimosa. Starting in on the 
           untouched food. Amy eyes her furtively. Choosing her moment. 

                                 AMY
                        Hold on. Back up a second for me. 
                        You said you’ve ‘moved on?’ Does 
                        that mean what I think it means?
                             (then)
                        Is there someone else? 

           Lydia blushes. Hiding her face in her hands. Amy relishes it.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        For real? 
                                 LYDIA
                        Ummm. I dunno. Kinda? It’s early 
                        stages, but, yeah. It’s exciting. 

                                 AMY
                        Tell me. 

           A beat. Lydia looks off. Trying to put feelings into words.  

                                 LYDIA
                        I’ll just say... 
                             (beat)
                        It’s really different.

           She smiles. Picking up cutlery. Content to leave it at that. 

           We hold on Amy, averting her eyes. She tries to corral her 
           excitement. Stiff a grin. But it’s no use. She can’t help 
           herself. We go off her, a gorgeous smile breaking through.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LIAM & AMY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Liam sits on the couch, stupefied, staring off into space. 
           The glow of the TV moves like a storm cloud across his face. 
           Just then, KEYS RATTLE in the door O.S.

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Heyyy. 

           Amy breezes inside. Liam shifts in his seat, as she unloads 
           belongings. Dropping her PHONE on the kitchen counter top. 
           Eventually she plops down beside him. 

           He tries to act normal--

                                 LIAM
                        How was your morning? 

                                 AMY
                        Fine. Just had brunch with Lydia. 

                                 LIAM
                             (tightening)
                        Oh yeah? How is she?

                                 AMY
                        Good. Really good actually.

                                 LIAM
                        What’d you guys talk about? 

                                 AMY
                        You know. Girl stuff.
           Liam nods -- figures. Lydia begins clicking through options 
           on the streaming device. Liam begins fiddling with a ring on 
           her finger. Wilting slightly. It’s almost painful to look at. 

                                 LIAM
                        Would you say this is your favorite 
                        ring? 

                                 AMY
                        I dunno... Probably. 

                                 LIAM
                        What is it? Size six? Seven?  

           Amy stiffens a bit. Glancing over at Liam. He doesn’t meet 
           her eyes. Staring at the ring.

                                 LIAM (CONT’D)
                        Probably something I should know. 
                             (then)
                        Right?

           Finally Liam looks at her. His eyes are desperate. Pleading. 
           Please tell me this is salvageable. Please tell me this isn’t 
           totally fucked up. But in this moment, AMY PANICS. 

           She pulls away. Her hands slips out of his, as she stands 
           abruptly, exiting to the kitchen. She clears her throat, 
           trying to play it off. Trying her hardest to act natural.  

                                 AMY
                        You want some water? Food? 
                             (then)
                        Liam?

           But Liam doesn’t respond. His eye lids droop. Lip trembling. 
           His worst suspicions are now confirmed. Silence reigns until-- 

                                 LIAM
                             (grave)
                        We’re not okay, are we? 

           With that, a weird chill falls over the room. They’ve finally 
           arrived at the brink. Given words to the unspeakable thing. 

           Slowly, Liam turns and faces Amy. Pain brimming in his eyes. 
           Amy stares at the floor. Sagging. Putting all her weight on 
           the counter. When she speaks, it’s hardly above a whisper.

                                 AMY
                        No... We’re not... 
           Finally she meets his gaze. A mix of shame. Sadness. Anger.  
           Liam suffers through the moment. Trying to keep himself 
           together. Barely hanging on. The laughter... The memories...  

                                 LIAM
                        Was it ever even real? 

           And as Amy winces, struggling to answer, their phones BUZZZ 
           in unison. Both of their expressions drop. 

           We see AMY’S PHONE, sitting there on the island between them. 
           A TRYST PUSH NOTIFICATION pulses, like a harbinger. A eulogy. 

                                     *Meet tonight?*

           And as Liam looks up at Amy, straining, in agony, we-- 

           CUT TO BLACK. 

           INT. HOTEL - FOYER - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           We’re inside ADAM’S P.O.V. Moving through the dimly lit 
           hotel. A feeling of weightlessness. It’s like we’re floating. 
           We round a corner, revealing--

           INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT [VR SCAPE]

           EVE, her back turned to us, waiting there at the front desk. 
           Her naked body. Porcelain skin. She’s impossibly PERFECT. 
           Just as we close the distance, she turns around...

           Her eyes are sultry and wild. Seductive yet unknowable. When 
           she speaks, her voice sends a shiver down our spine--

                                 EVE
                        Hey you. 

           And as a MISCHIEVOUS SMILE curls her lips, we CUT TO BLACK. 
           Our final afterimage trembles before burning away. 

                                                             ROLL CREDITS.
