           Then, a slight glimmer of light. It grows brighter, larger, 
           the black of the screen shimmering until we reveal we are --

           EXT. A LEAF - DAY

           Looking at an extreme close-up of the black eye of a tiny
           jumping spider resting on a wide leaf. It twitches.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        You know jumping spiders?

           The little spider raises a leg in the air, testing the wind.
           Suddenly, a large fly -- large enough to dwarf the spider --
           lands on the leaf.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Fearless little freaks. They'll take
                        out prey twice their own size. Know
                        how they do it?

           The spider positions itself, moving in short, sharp bursts.
           The fly rubs its front legs together, none the wiser.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        They're smarter than the other bugs.
                        Sneakier. And when it's time to
                        pounce --

           The spider LEAPS onto the fly, latches on hard, and sinks
           its fangs through its carapace before we --

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           A nondescript room: a comfy chair, a potted plant in the
           background, a small side table with a glass of water and a
           small, empty dish on it. Sitting in the chair is --

           SUPER: TANYA K. METAKSA, GUN RIGHTS ACTIVIST

           Pushing 80, with thick glasses and short hair that's dyed a
           bright blonde, she chews on toothpick that she removes when
           she speaks. She looks like America's angry grandma.
                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        That was Harlon Carter. The Bullet.
                        My mentor. Taught me everything I
                        needed to know. Like how to pounce on
                        the biggest prey around if I thought
                        I could win. And goddamn, did Harlon
                        know how to win. What he pulled off
                        in Cincinnati is... legend. Among the
                        NRA crowd, at least. Not so much for
                        the rest of you.

           She puts the toothpick back between her teeth.

                        But I can't just start with Harlon.
                        You're gonna need some context first.

                        So we'll start with a man who called
                        himself Alek J. Hidell.

           FADE IN:

           INT. HIDELL'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Sunlight filters through drawn blinds as ALEK HIDELL (24),
           thin with sharp features, carefully clips a coupon out of
           the pages of a glossy magazine.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        In March of 1963, he opened his issue
                        of the NRA's American Rifleman
                        magazine and found this ad. "Lightly-
                        used, fast-loading, fast-firing 6.5
                        Italian carbine," it said. Beautiful
                        weapon. With a coupon, it would cost
                        him twenty-one dollars and forty-five
                        cents. So Hidell clips this coupon
                        and mails it, along with a check...

           We follow close on the coupon as Hidell pairs it with the
           check and slips it inside an envelope --

           INT. MAIL ORDER HOUSE - DAY

           Close on the Italian carbine itself, resting on a rack with
           others like it.
                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        ...to a mail-order house in Chicago.
                        They pack it up and ship it off to
                        Hidell in Texas. Remember that.
                        Illinois to Texas.
                               (
                                then, chuckles
                                              )
                        Bet they wouldn't have done that if
                        they knew what was coming.

           INT. HIDELL'S DOORSTEP - DAY

           A long, narrow cardboard box plunks down on the cracked
           cement stoop.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Anyways, a few days later the carbine
                        shows up on Hidell's doorstep.

           The door opens and Hidell snatches up the package.

           I/E. HIDELL'S APARTMENT - DAY

           A rapid-fire series of shots as Metaksa continues talking --

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        He opens it, loads it, and tests it.
                        Like any responsible gun owner would.

           Hidell removes the gun from its packaging.

           Hand-loads rounds into it.

           FIRES at a tree in the building's small backyard.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        And it works like a dream. So he
                        stores it until the next November.

           Hidell places the rifle upright in the back of a closet.

           INT. HIDELL'S APARTMENT - CLOSET - TIMELAPSE

           The gun sits and waits as the closet door opens, closes,
           opens, closes. Spring jackets become winter coats hanging
           from the crossbar.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Then, on November 22 of 1963, Alek J.
                        Hidell picks up his rifle...

           Hidell opens the closet door and snatches the carbine up.
                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        ...and heads to Dealey Plaza in
                        downtown Dallas.

           EXT. DEALEY PLAZA - DAY

           A parade is on. People line the streets, cheering as --

           A PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE rolls by. PRESIDENT KENNEDY waves
           from the back of a roll-top limousine.

           INT. TEXAS SCHOOLBOOK DEPOSITORY - THAT MOMENT

           Hidell aims the Italian carbine at the President's head.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        See, Alek J. Hidell's real name was
                        Lee Harvey Oswald.

           Hidell, AKA LEE HARVEY OSWALD, takes a deep breath. Exhales.
           And pulls the trigger. But instead of a gunshot, we hear --

           INT. US SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

           The BANGING of a gavel as SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MIKE
           MANSFIELD signals the end of voting on a new bill.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Five years later, the traitors in
                        Congress ram through the Gun Control
                        Act of 1968...

           INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON signs the bill with a smile on his
           face. Cameras flash.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        ...and LBJ signs that steaming pile
                        into law. Among its provisions, a
                        total ban on mail-order firearm sales
                        across state lines. No more Illinois
                        to Texas.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY - END FLASHBACK

           Metaksa discards the toothpick in the little dish and takes
           another from a small container of them on the table.
                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        The goddamn Gun Control Act of 1968.
                        That proved to us gun owners, myself
                        included: our government did not
                        trust us. We scared 'em. So in their
                        infinite wisdom, our leaders decided
                        to take our rights away one by one
                        until they weren't scared anymore.
                        And we weren't gonna let that happen.
                        Not a goddamn chance. Someone had to
                        put a stop that bullshit, and why not
                        us, right?

           EXT. A LEAF - DAY

           The little spider again, alone. Before the fly has landed.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Why not the NRA?

           INT. NRA-ILA OFFICE - MORNING

           SUPER: NOVEMBER, 1976

           Above the door, mounted in a place of honor, is an old 12-
           GAUGE SHOTGUN. From there, we take a tour through --

           A rented office space on the top floor of a hotel: a large
           bullpen littered with desks. Most cleaned out, others have
           PINK SLIPS atop them. This place has the air of a funeral.

           We zip past BOB KUKLA (42), all thin, greasy hair and
           oversized bifocals, looking distraught, as we move to --

           A corner where two men, JOHN D. AQUILINO (25) and JOSEPH P.
           TARTARO (39) comfort one another. Aquilino cries. We float
           by them, finding --

           A younger TANYA K. METAKSA (38), still with the short,
           sensible hair and thick glasses, chewing a toothpick.

           She sits at her desk in front of her typewriter. She looks
           left, to the neighboring desk: a pink slip rests on it.
           To her right, another desk with another pink slip.

           She exhales and rests her fingers on the keys of her
           typewriter as --

           The office door BURSTS open and in strides HARLON BRONSON
           CARTER (64). A big, broad bulldog of a man with a shining
           bald cranium, he wears a suit, carries a briefcase, and
           moves like a brick wall with a bad attitude. But --

           He stops cold when he sees the state of the office, dropping
           his briefcase to the floor with a resounding THUD.

           The remaining employees freeze. No typing, no talking, no
           breathing. All eyes are on Harlon Carter's scowling face.

                               (

           DIRECTOR, NRA INSTITUTE FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION

           END FREEZE-FRAME.

           Carter picks up a pink slip from the nearest desk and glares
           down at the signature on it: MAXWELL E. RICH.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        I'll be goddamned.
                               (
                                looks up, seething
                                                  )
                        How many?

           Kukla approaches like a scared puppy.

                                 KUKLA
                        Well um, let's see. He got Steve,
                        Joan, Fat Steve, Mike, Scooter --

                        Seventy-four.

           Carter grimaces, surveys the room. When he speaks, it's with
           the remains of a Texas accent he's tried and failed to lose.

                                 CARTER
                        Rich, you son of a motherfuckin'...

           He pulls the 12-gauge down from above the door and stalks
           right back out of the room, leaving his briefcase behind.
           EXT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Carter crosses the street, toting the shotgun on his
           shoulder like a marching soldier. The ILA's offices are in a
           hotel just across from --

           NRA HQ. An eight-story glass monolith.

           SUPER: NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION HEADQUARTERS. FAIRFAX, VA.

           Carter storms through the doors, alarmed pedestrians
           scattering in his wake.

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - DAY

           Carter strides quickly past the reception desk, where an
           immediately nervous young RECEPTIONIST greets him --

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Uh, good morning, Mr. Carter.

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah, not so much, Sheila.

           He moves to the elevators, past a BLANK WOODEN WALL that we
           linger on for a moment. In just a few months' time, this
           wall will be famous.

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - EVP'S OFFICE - DAY

           The top-floor corner office of the Executive Vice President
           of the NRA is all dark wood and huge windows. Standing
           behind the large oak desk is --

           GENERAL MAXWELL E. RICH (60), a stern and stone-faced boy
           scout, phone pressed to his ear in a white-knuckled grip.

                                 RICH
                        Aw Christ, Sheila, and you just let

           Carter THROWS the office door open and strides in.
                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        Sounds good, sounds good. Looking
                        forward to it. Bye, Greg.

           Rich hangs up the phone and looks up into the red, angry
           face of Harlon Carter.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        Harlon! Jesus, what are you doing

                        This here "thing" is my daddy's
                        shotgun. This gun saved my life, and
                        I keep it in the office to remind
                        myself, every day, of why we fight so
                        hard to keep gun ownership a
                        fundamental right in this country.
                        This gun is a symbol of my right to
                        defend me and mine. And that is what
                        I'm here to do, General. To defend
                        the ILA.

                        Actually, he's not. But before we go
                        any further...

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           The older Metaksa pulls the toothpick from her lips, holding
           it between two fingers like a cigarette.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        ...it'd probably be good to explain
                        what the ILA actually is.

           INT. US SENATE CHAMBER - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Metaksa speaks over images of floor debate: white men in
           navy suits make competing speeches, using diagrams and
           graphs adorned with pictures of guns.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        When these waves of gun control
                        legislation hit, Harlon knew exactly
                        what to do. The ILA was his idea.
           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - BOARD ROOM - DAY

           A long boardroom table lined with old white men, many of
           them blowing smoke into the hazy air. Up at the front,
           Carter makes an impassioned speech. All eyes on him.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        A whole arm of the NRA dedicated to
                        political action, built to put a stop
                        to gun control legislation. The
                        Board, they loved it. Thought it
                        would really fire up the membership.

           In the corner, Max Rich watches darkly.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Max Rich, on the other hand, was not
                        a fan. The man hated politics. And
                        fair enough, if we're being honest.

           INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

           Streamers and deflated balloons hang limply from the
           ceiling. Remnants of a wedding.

           Carter stands at the window, glowering out at NRA HQ across
           the street. This is the future office of the ILA.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Rich did his damnedest to make sure
                        the ILA was a failure from the jump.
                        Put us in a goddamn ballroom across
                        the street from HQ, for one.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY - END FLASHBACK

           Metaksa still holds her toothpick like a cigarette.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        And never gave us the funding we
                        needed to do any real lobbying, for
                        another.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Why don't we have Harlon himself
                        explain how the ILA went so wrong?
                        It's really more his purview, anyhow.

           And we're WHISKED off to --

           INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - OUTSIDE OF TIME

           We're in a cavernous, darkened lecture hall with Carter
           front and center before a chalkboard.
           On the chalkboard, a series of illustrated steps. As Carter
           speaks, the chalk illustrations animate, coming to life to
           act out each step.

                                 CARTER
                        It's simple. A lobbyist's job is to
                        incentivize legislators to help his
                        cause. So we take 'em out to dinner.
                        Invite 'em to fancy parties. Dump
                        money into their campaigns. Just kiss
                        all the Congressional ass we can.

           A cartoon Harlon Carter shakes hands with a number of
           cartoon Congressmen on the chalkboard.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        While we've got their ear, we tell
                        'em what kinda laws we wanna see and
                        what kind we don't. And if they're
                        amenable to our agenda, we'll keep
                        'em elected and workin' for us.

           The cartoon Carter hands a Congressman a stack of bills.
           Another cartoon Congressman lights a cigar with a bill of
           his own. They all laugh and slap each other's backs.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                               (
                                with rising anger
                                                 )
                        But all that wheel greasin' costs
                        money. And say your organization is
                        under-funded because some snake-in-
                        the-grass former General won't loosen
                        the purse-strings...

           The cartoon Carter now entertains a group of cigar-smoking
           Congressmen at a restaurant.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        In that case, well... you're pretty
                        much fucked.

           The bill arrives at the cartoon table. The Congressmen all
           look to the cartoon Harlon Carter, who sinks in his seat.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        So the ILA, to this point, has been
                        about as effective as a blank on a
                        battlefield. All thanks to Max Rich.

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - EVP'S OFFICE - DAY

           We're back with Carter as he confronts his boss. Rich shifts
           a bit nervously.
                                 RICH
                        Harlon... I'm sure from your end this
                        looks like an ambush --

                                 CARTER
                        Ha! You think I didn't see this
                        comin'? I've been waitin' for you to
                        try somethin' like this, you sneaky
                        little piece of shit.

                                 RICH
                        Please. This isn't personal. Just
                        hear me out.

           Carter smirks.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        It's purely budget-based. The Board
                        thought your lobbying would bring in
                        members, and it didn't. So we've
                        agreed -- we're drawing back on your
                        Second Amendment... stuff.

                                 CARTER
                        You mean our battle for your rights?

                                 RICH
                        Um... sure. That's how you put it.
                        But the ILA hasn't been as effective
                        as we'd hoped.

                                 CARTER
                        Because you never gave us the chance
                        to be! We've been under-funded from
                        day fuckin' one and you know it.

                                 RICH
                        I've done the best I could with what
                        I have, Harlon. It's not like
                        lobbying is big business, it was
                        always a gamble.

           Carter sneers as he pulls out a cigarette case: silver,
           embossed with the image of a 12-gauge shotgun. The same
           shotgun on Rich's desk.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke
                        in here.

                                 CARTER
                        I bet you would.
           Carter lights a cigarette. Rich sighs.

                                 RICH
                        Okay. The fact is, we're preparing to
                        leave the lobbying behind. The NRA
                        isn't built for politics. Never was.

                                 CARTER
                        Because you never gave us a chance --

                                 RICH
                        So, we're shifting all of our
                        resources back to basics, the way
                        Ambrose Burnside intended.
                        Marksmanship. Gun safety, hunting.

                                 CARTER
                        Gonna have a hard time huntin' once
                        the ATF confiscates your rifle.

                        I'm sorry, but Max Rich is dead wrong
                        about this. Yes, the government does
                        come for people's guns. It's not some
                        lunatic conspiracy theory.

                        See, back in 1971 the Bureau of
                        Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms busted
                        in the door of an NRA member named
                        Kenyon Ballew, just because they
                        heard he had some unregistered
                        firearms in his apartment. And maybe
                        a few grenades.

           Kenyon Ballew's stunning display case of Civil War, WWI, and
           WWII-era weapons. Mostly guns, but a few grenades. A hand
           reaches out and grabs an 1847 COLT PISTOL from the shelf.

           The door splinters and the ATF agents stream inside.

           INT. SHABBY APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           They stop: a barrier made from furniture blocks the way: a
           sofa, dining chairs, an ottoman.

                        The ATF claimed Ballew came at them
                        with a replica 1847 Colt cap-and-ball
                        pistol. Another beautiful gun.

           KENYON BALLEW stands, completely nude, on the other side of
           the barrier, aiming the Colt.

                        trying to be historically accurate.

           An ATF agent FIRES, hitting Ballew in the head.

                        paralyzing him from the waist down.
                        He could only form about fifteen
                        words after what the ATF did to him,
                        all because Ballew, an NRA member,
                        tried to defend his home from what he
                        thought was a criminal break-in.

                        So don't you tell me that the idea of
                        the government coming for us is some
                        paranoid fantasy. It's real. It

                        I didn't expect your support on this.
                        I know better than that. But we're
                        hurting here. Membership's been on

                                 CARTER
                        Because of the stigma the government
                        is puttin' on guns. I'm out there
                        tryin' to change that.

                        Come on, Harlon. I'm not the villain
                        here, and calling me the villain
                        isn't gonna make it true.

           Carter snorts, amused by this. Then, his eyes land on a
           piece of paper on Rich's desk. He picks it up. On it, a
           logo. Similar to the NRA's seal, but it doesn't say NRA.

           It reads National Outdoor Association. Carter looks first at
           the shotgun on the table, then at Rich.

                                 CARTER
                        The hell's this, General?

                                 RICH
                        We've already put in a bid for some
                        land in Colorado. Forests, rivers,
                        wildlife. An Olympic-level training
                        facility with the best marksmanship
                        coaches in the country.

                                 CARTER
                        You're... movin' the NRA to Colorado?

                                 RICH
                        You could have a job out there if you
                        wanted one. Hell, with your shooting
                        skills I bet you could coach the US
                        Olympic Rifle team.

                        Gonna be a whole new day for the NRA.

                                 CARTER
                        Well. In that case, it's gonna have
                        to fuckin' be one without me.

           INT. NRA-ILA OFFICE - DAY

           Harlon bursts into the room, thundering --

                                 CARTER
                        National Outdoor Association?
                        National fuckin' Outdoor Association?

           Metaksa and the few remaining ILA employees look up.

                                 METAKSA
                        What?

                                 CARTER
                        Goddamn son of bitch thinks he's Davy
                        fuckin' Crockett.

           Carter snatches up his briefcase from where he left it and
           heads to his office at the back of the room.

                                 METAKSA
                        What's happening?

                               (
                                turns back
                                 CARTER
                                          )
                        They're movin' the whole damn
                        operation to Colorado. Leavin' DC,
                        shuttin' down the ILA.

           Bob Kukla trails him into his office.

                                 KUKLA
                        What're you talking about, Harlon?

           Carter punctuates certain words by hurling office supplies
           into his briefcase.
                                 CARTER
                        I am talkin' about Rich tryin' to
                        relocate to goddamn Colorado and let
                        the government and the goddamn
                        hippies control the gun debate.

                                 KUKLA
                        That -- that can't be right. Max
                        wouldn't do that to us.

                                 CARTER
                        Why don't you go ask him yourself
                        then, Bob? Given that you're the man
                        in charge here now.

                                 KUKLA
                        I'm -- I'm the man in -- what?

                                 CARTER
                        I resigned.

           Carter SLAMS his briefcase shut and strides out of the
           office. Kukla scrambles to follow --

                                 KUKLA
                        You can't just -- hey! Harlon! We
                        need you here.

           Metaksa rises from her desk, calls to Harlon --

                                 METAKSA
                        If you're resigning, so am I.

           Carter stops, turns to her.

                                 CARTER
                        No. Absolutely not. Just keep your
                        head down. I'm gonna need good,
                        strong men on the inside.

           The younger Metaksa looks into the camera and gives us a
           charming wink as we --

           FREEZE-FRAME on her.

           SUPER: TANYA K. METAKSA, HEAD OF LOCAL OPERATIONS, NRA-ILA

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        That's right. I'm Harlon Carter's
                        strong man on the inside.

           END FREEZE-FRAME.
                                 METAKSA
                        For what?

                                 CARTER
                        You'll see.
                               (
                                to Kukla, darkly

                        Good luck there, Bob.

           Then he turns and leaves. As he goes, his expression darkens
           from confidence to something resembling rage, with maybe
           just a hint of fear.

           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - DAY

           MARYANN CARTER (58) sits in a worn rocking chair, cleans and
           oils a deconstructed pistol on the coffee table while
           keeping one eye on the TV, where --

           JIMMY CARTER makes a last-minute campaign speech. She scoffs
           at some political platitude. We hear the apartment door
           open. Maryann perks up.

                                 MARYANN
                        Harlon?

           THUD. The sound of Carter once again dropping his briefcase
           to the floor. He trudges into the living room, looking
           shell-shocked and defeated.

                                 MARYANN (cont'd)
                        What's wrong, why aren't you at work?

                                 CARTER
                        I resigned.

                                 MARYANN
                        You what?

                                 CARTER
                        It's over, Maryann. They're killin'
                        the ILA. Rich -- he's givin' up the
                        whole fight.

           Carter sinks down into a squatting position in the middle of
           the living room with a heavy sigh.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        We lost. We lost...

           He's like a child, hugging his knees with despair.

                                 MARYANN
                        Hey. Hey, Harlon. Come here.

                                he doesn't move
                                               )
                        Come here.

           And he does: Harlon Carter crawls on his hands and knees to
           rest his head in Maryann's lap. She strokes his bald scalp.

                                 MARYANN
                        Tell me. Why'd you go to work for Max
                        Rich in the first place?

                                 CARTER
                        You know that.

                                 MARYANN
                        But I want you to say it. Out loud.

                                 CARTER
                        Because it's my duty. Our duty, to
                        defend ourselves from  the government
                        when they try to overstep.

                                 MARYANN
                        And you still believe that?

                                 CARTER
                        Of course I do.

                                 MARYANN
                        Then I can't for the life of me
                        gather what you're doin' here in this
                        apartment right now.

           Carter lifts his head and looks at his wife, confused. She
           strokes his cheek.

                                 MARYANN (cont'd)
                        I have never known you to give up on
                        any damn thing, not once. You think
                        I'd be here right now, married to
                        you, if Harlon Carter knew how to
                        take no for answer?
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        I mean, look how far you've come
                        already.

           As Maryann stares into her husband's icy blue eyes, we're
           transported to --

           EXT. CARTER FAMILY HOME - DAY - FLASHBACK

           LAREDO, TEXAS, 1931: the sun beats down on a small ranch
           house. Bleached, chipped paint and a sagging porch.
           Everything is idyllic: drenched in golden-hour sunlight, a
           perfect, peaceful recollection of a rustic upbringing.

           A YOUNG HARLAN CARTER (17, and we'll come back to why his
           name is spelled that way) rolls up to the house on a rickety
           bike, hops off, and climbs those precarious steps.

           INT. CARTER FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           We follow Harlan inside. He's strong, tall, handsome -- our
           Harlon's idealized version of his younger self.

                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                        Mama? You home?

           We hear a SOB from the next room.

                                 YOUNG HARLAN (cont'd)
                        Mama?

           We follow Harlan into the --

           KITCHEN

           Where we find MRS. CARTER (42) seated at the kitchen table,
           clutching a 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN with white knuckles. She wears
           a worn house dress, her hair a frizzy mess.

           Harlan immediately goes to her.

                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                        Mama! What's wrong, what happened?

                                 MRS. CARTER
                        It's -- it's them damn wetback boys.
                        They're back, they been loiterin' by
                        the river all afternoon...

           Harlan hurries out of the kitchen, back to the --

           LIVING ROOM

           Where he peers out a window. Fifty or so yards away, a small
           river lazily winds its way through the landscape. Beside it,
           three MEXICAN BOYS ranging from ages 12 to 15 skip rocks.

           Harlan stares at them for a moment. His blood begins to
           boil. He straightens up and marches back to the --

           KITCHEN

           Where his mother looks up at him.
                                 MRS. CARTER
                        They still there?

           Harlan nods, stoic, brave, All-American.

                                 MRS. CARTER (cont'd)
                        They already stole your daddy's car.
                        I'm sure it was them. Who knows what
                        they'll take next?

           Mrs. Carter's breath comes in short, sharp sobs. She's
           terrified. Harlan reaches out and grasps the shotgun --

                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                        Nothin'. That's what.

           He snatches the gun out of her hands, cocks it, and marches
           out of the kitchen and out of the house. As sunlight fills
           the frame, turning it stark white, we --

                                                           FADE TO:

           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - DAY - END FLASHBACK

           And back to Carter's face. No longer filled with despair,
           his expression has hardened into resolute determination.

           He takes a breath. Maryann smiles.

                                 MARYANN
                        There. There's the tough Texas son of
                        a bitch I married.
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        Now what're you gonna do?

           Carter leans over, kisses Maryann on the mouth, and stands.

                                 CARTER
                        I'm gonna call Neal.

           Tanya Metaksa discards her toothpick. Thinks as she pulls

                        He and Harlon had a lot in common.
                        They both loathed any form of gun
                        control.

                        Both wanted to lead the charge on
                        fighting it. But they had very
                        different reasons. Harlon believed in
                        the right to bear arms for self-
                        defense, protecting your family, that
                        kinda thing. But Neal... Neal's
                        reasons were a little more, let's say
                        batshit.

           INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - OUTSIDE OF TIME

           Now, it's CLIFFORD NEAL KNOX (42) standing before the
           chalkboard. Jowly, with dark hair in a slicked part and
           large, thick glasses perched on his nose.

           He wears an ill-fitting suit and speaks quickly, almost
           feverish. Eager to convince us.

                                 KNOX
                        Our rights are being stripped from
                        us. That much is crystal clear
                        through cataracts. Why? Because they
                        -- y'know, the government --  caught
                        a little glimpse of the real power of
                        the people during Vietnam and it
                        scared 'em shitless. So now they're
                        takin' away that power. And do you
                        trust the so-called "people" who sent
                        kids -- kids! -- to an impossible war
                        for twenty goddamn years to ever know
                        when to stop? Ha! Sure, today they
                        just wanna take your cheap handguns
                        that break apart when you fire 'em,
                        but tomorrow it'll be your granddad's
                        pistol from the War. Then your
                        hunting rifle. And step by step until
                        you're not allowed to go to church on
                        Sunday and can't say the word "fuck"
                        in your own bedroom and --

           Knox looks around, scowls.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Where are we, anyhow? This some
                        liberal university classroom? No
                        decent learning's happening in a
                        place like this. C'mon.

           Knox walks off camera and into --

           EXT. DEALEY PLAZA, DALLAS, TX - DAY - FLASHBACK

           In the distance, MUSIC, CHEERING.
                                 KNOX
                        You wanna know how they're getting
                        away with it? I'll tell you: they're
                        making you afraid.

           Knox starts walking up a small hill. One might even call it
           a knoll. It has grass on it.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        People actually believe that Lee
                        Harvey Oswald shot the bullet that
                        killed JFK. He didn't. Nah, that
                        bullet came from right here. From a
                        gun fired by an agent of the CIA.

           A CIA SHARPSHOOTER lies prone on the grassy knoll, sighting
           through a sniper rifle.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        And Martin Luther King, Jr.?

           INT. BOARDING HOUSE, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - EVENING

           Suddenly, Knox is standing in a bedroom across the street
           from the Lorraine Motel. If you squint, you might make out
           the figure of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. on the motel balcony.

           Another CIA ASSASSIN, decidedly not James Earl Ray, sights
           down the scope of a rifle at him.

                                 KNOX
                        Same damn thing. Then there's Bobby
                        Kennedy.

           INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL, LOS ANGELES - BACK HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A MAITRE D'HOTEL leads ROBERT F. KENNEDY through a narrow
           back hallway as Knox, in the foreground, continues.

                                 KNOX
                        Oh, you bet your ass that was the
                        CIA.

           A GUNSHOT in the background, a scuffle, shouting, as Knox
           moves around a corner to block our view.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        And then suddenly --
                                mocking
                               (
                                       )
                        "Oooo, guns are too dangerous for
                        ordinary Americans! We need
                        restrictions, for the public good!"

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        But this is just the first step: a
                        few more CIA killings, and they'll be
                        taking all of our guns. Knives too,
                        probably. And most folks, most sheep,
                        they'll give 'em up willingly. After
                        that, they'll be able to do anything
                        they want. And anyone who resists...

           INT. SHABBY APARTMENT - NIGHT -

           Kenyon Ballew, bullet wound bleeding in his head, lies on
           the ground, blinking. Alive, but barely present.

                                 KNOX (V.O.)
                        Well, you already saw what they did
                        to Kenyon Ballew.

                                                          SMASH TO:

           INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING - END FLASHBACK

           Carter, cigarette in hand, glass of seltzer in front of him,
           sits beside Knox, also smoking, drinking bourbon.

           The air around them is hazy with more smoke from the small
           table of SUITED WHITE MEN behind them. Congressmen.

                                 KNOX
                        It was the ATF. Or the FBI. Or the
                        CIA. One of those three-letter
                        devils, I guarantee it. They got to
                        the General, squeezed him. Threatened
                        his family or --

                                 CARTER
                        Or. Or the man just loves hunting.

           Knox sighs, rolls his eyes.

                                 KNOX
                        We can sit here and argue about the
                        General's motives all damn night. But
                        you didn't call me here for that.

                                 CARTER
                        No. That I did not.

                                 KNOX
                        Why then?
                                 CARTER
                        'Cause I figure if anyone was
                        interested in findin' a way to keep
                        up the fight, it'd be you. We could
                        start a new organization, like
                        Americans for Liberty. Or... Firearms
                        for Families, or somethin'.

           Knox grins, shifts in his seat to face Carter.

                                 KNOX
                        You wanna keep lobbying?

                                 CARTER
                        'Course I do. I figure you might be
                        able to drum up some support with
                        those magazines of yours, rally some
                        members to get us started.

           FREEZE FRAME on Knox.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Oh, that's right. Neal Knox was the
                        editor of no less than two gun
                        publications.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - PRESENT DAY

           Metaksa holds up aged copies of Knox's magazines. The covers
           look like 70's porn mags, but for guns instead of girls.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        At that time I believe they were
                        Rifle Magazine and Handloader
                        Magazine.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING

           Knox nods thoughtfully. Then --

                                 KNOX
                        I could. But...

           Knox trails off, the gears in his addled mind shifting.

                                 CARTER
                        You got a better idea?

                                 KNOX
                        Why don't we just take back the NRA?

           Carter almost chokes on his seltzer. He COUGHS a bit.
                                 CARTER
                        I'm sorry?

                                 KNOX
                        Think about it. If we could oust the
                        General, we could turn the NRA into
                        everything it always needed to be.
                        Rebuild it entirely around the ILA.
                        No more money to fucking target
                        ranges in New Mexico, nothing to
                        Colorado. Whatever resources we have,
                        it's all funneled straight to
                        lobbying. Membership dues, donations.

                                 CARTER
                        Once we start seeing real results the
                        gun makers won't be able to empty
                        their pockets fast enough.

                                 KNOX
                        And with that kind of money, we'd be
                        the most powerful lobby in DC.

           Carter quickly becomes lost in a daydream. We drift past the
           men, over to the table of Congressmen behind them...

                                 KNOX (O.S.)
                        Paints a mighty pretty picture...

           And now Carter himself sits among the Congressmen, chomping
           a stogie and flashing some cash. And we ZIP TO --

           INT. GUN STORE - DAY

           A gleaming selection of pristine pistols, rifles, and semi-
           autos. A handsome gun store owner smiles at them as --

           Carter guides the cigar-smoking Congressmen on a tour of the
           shop's offerings. Grins all around as we ZIP TO --

           INT. NRA MEETING OF THE MEMBERS - NIGHT

           A crowd ROARS as Carter, a massive toothy smile splitting
           his face in two, raises a 12-gauge shotgun over his head.

           He wears a cap with the letters N-R-A on it, and as we push
           in on his crocodile grin and bright red hat, we ZIP TO --

           INT. REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION - NIGHT

           Harlon Carter on a stage, going in for a handshake with none
           other than RONALD REAGAN himself. As Reagan bypasses the
           handshake, going straight for the hug, we ZIP BACK TO --
           INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING

           Carter blinks, coming out of his reverie.

                                 KNOX
                        Nice thought, huh?

                               (
                                breathless
                                 CARTER
                                          )
                        Yeah. Yeah, sure is. I just don't see
                        any kinda path to it.

                                 KNOX
                        'Cause you're still thinkin' like
                        police, not a politician.

           Now it's Carter's turn to look at Knox, intrigued.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        You know about the voting rules at
                        the Meeting, yeah?

                                 CARTER
                        Well, sure...

                                 KNOX
                        Anyone can bring a measure to the
                        floor and it has to be voted on. So,
                        we wanna get rid of Rich, we gotta
                        bring it to a vote.

                                 CARTER
                        But the Board elects the Executive
                        Vice President. That ain't
                        membership.

                                 KNOX
                        Yeah, 'cause that's a rule. And rules
                        can be changed...

                                 CARTER
                        Hot damn.

                                 KNOX
                        Now you're getting it.

                                 CARTER
                        By a vote from membership.

                                 KNOX
                        Meeting's in six months. Think that's
                        enough time to lobby the whole of the
                        NRA's membership to our side?
           Carter drains his seltzer and stubs out his smoke.

                                 CARTER
                        If we get started right fuckin' now?

           He breaks out that big crocodile grin of his again...

           EXT. A LEAF - DAY

           The jumping spider again, still alone. The fly lands on the
           leaf. The spider turns its attention toward it, twitching...

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        So now they had a plan.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        We had a plan. But of course, in
                        order for it to have any chance of
                        working, Harlon and Neal needed to
                        get the word out. And they couldn't
                        do that alone. They were gonna need
                        help. A team of true believers.

           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING

           CLOSE ON: An old radio sitting on the kitchen counter. Bing
           Crosby's "Santa Claus is Coming to Town" plays through the
           tinny speaker as --

           Carter paces. Knox sits at the table, pad of paper in front
           of him. Maryann sits at the table, too.

                                 CARTER
                        John Aquilino?

                                 KNOX
                        He's young, though.

                                 MARYANN
                        Plenty of energy.

           INT. DISCO - NIGHT

           A deeply uncool late '70's disco club. Dancing like an idiot
           full of youthful energy booze is JOHN AQUILINO (26).
                                 CARTER (V.O.)
                        Hard worker, too. Can't imagine
                        anybody could've been more pissed
                        about what the General did than me,
                        but he'd give me a run for my money.
                        And yeah, kid's got a lotta energy.

           Aquilino dumps a small pile cocaine from a vial onto his
           hand and hoovers it up, then dances even more stupidly.

           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Knox jots down Aquilino's name on his notepad.

                                 KNOX
                        Fine. John Aquilino.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        What about Joe Tartaro?

                                 MARYANN
                        Do I know Joe?

                                 CARTER
                        You've met Joe.

           INT. TARTARO HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Huddled in the corner of the modest bedroom is JOE TARTARO
           (34), his WIFE, and their whimpering GOLDEN RETRIEVER.
           Tartaro white-knuckles a shotgun as --

           A FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays under the doorjamb. An intruder.

                                 KNOX (V.O.)
                        Good family man. And he comes at his
                        Second Amendment views from
                        experience. Used a shotgun to defend
                        his family from a break-in.

           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING

                                 KNOX
                        So you've got a little something in
                        common, Harlon.

           Carter scowls, disapproving of Knox's comment.

                                 CARTER
                        Joe's good. I like Joe.

           Knox writes the name down, mumbling --
                                 KNOX
                        Joseph... Tartaro.
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        You know my guy in California?

                                 MARYANN
                        You got a guy in California?

                                 KNOX
                        Ray Arnett? Used to be the head of
                        Fish and Game out there.

                                 CARTER
                        Sounds like more of a Max Rich guy.

                                 KNOX
                        Nah. He'd be with us. Plus --

           INT. CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL - DAY

           G. RAY ARNETT (46 here, 52 in 1977), a tan, square-jawed
           California man, smiles and clings to a stack of folders in
           the back of a group of suited men.

                                 KNOX (V.O.)
                        The man worked directly with Reagan.

           PULL BACK to reveal Ronald Reagan at his desk, utterly
           ignoring our man Arnett.

                                 CARTER (V.O.)
                        Reagan lost the nomination.

                                 KNOX (V.O.)
                        But I hear whispers he might run
                        again.

           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING

                                 KNOX
                        Can you imagine getting Reagan's
                        endorsement?

           Carter grins.

                                                          FLASH TO:

           INT. REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION - NIGHT

           Ronald Reagan skips Carter's handshake and goes for a hug.
           INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING

                                 CARTER
                        Sure would be nice.

                                 KNOX
                        Alright. Ray Arnett.

           Knox rights it down. Maryann clears her throat.

                                 MARYANN
                        What about Tanya?

                                 CARTER
                        Metaksa?

                                 MARYANN
                        You know she'd work hard for you,
                        Harlon. And it'd be nice to have a
                        woman's perspective. Another woman's
                        perspective, I mean.

           Carter slips the notepad away from Knox and studies the
           little list of names.

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah. I can call Tanya. I'll call 'em
                        all tomorrow.

                                 KNOX
                        You'll call 'em -- call 'em all?

           Carter blinks at Knox, surprised by his indignation.

                                 CARTER
                        Well, if I'm gonna be in charge of
                        this little operation they oughta be
                        hearin' from me first, right?

                                 KNOX
                        You're gonna be...?

                                 CARTER
                        Who else?

           Then Carter realizes Knox had hoped he'd be in charge.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        It'd look a little funny if the
                        magazine editor ran the NRA over the
                        former NRA president and executive
                        director of the ILA, wouldn't it?
           Carter shoots Maryann a sly grin. She smiles back. Knox
           notices the exchange.

                                 KNOX
                        Just thought, considering the whole
                        plan was my idea --

                                 CARTER
                        There'll be plenty for you to do,
                        Neal. Don't get your panties in a
                        bunch about it.

           Carter laughs. Knox gives a low chuckle before we --

           INT. KNOX'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Knox pacing back and forth in front of the bed in his
           tighty-whities, his wife WENDY (40) sitting up in bed
           watching. A pistol rests on the nightstand beside her.

                                 KNOX
                        That son of a bitch, Wendy. That son
                        of a bitch.

                                 WENDY
                        Calm down, Neal --

                                 KNOX
                        He's trying to take this from me.
                        Just using my ideas, my connections,
                        just using me to get what he wants.

                                 WENDY
                        But what he wants is what you want,
                        isn't it?

                                 KNOX
                        That's not the goddamn point.

                                 WENDY
                        Why not? Let it go, honey. If you
                        just work with him --

                                 KNOX
                        I'd be working for him. My best
                        friend, supposed best friend --

                                 WENDY
                        You need each other to get this done.
                        He knows that.
           Knox sits on the edge of the bed and groans. Wendy scoots
           down to him and starts caressing him moving her hands
           steadily toward his crotch.

                                 KNOX
                        Son of a goddamn...

                                 WENDY
                        Honey. Work together.

                                 KNOX
                        Yeah, yeah.

           He gives her a perfunctory kiss.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Fuck.

           She kisses him, puts her hand in his briefs, but his mind is
           clearly elsewhere.

           The younger Metaksa sits at her desk, stone-faced, dutifully

           Metaksa lowers her voice and turns away from prying eyes.

                                 METAKSA
                        Nothing to report.

                        When Harlon told me what they were
                        planning, I damn near flipped my desk
                        over and quit the ILA on the spot.
                        Here was the man that hired me,
                        promoted me, showed us all what the
                        NRA could really do... I was in
                        before he finished the first
                        sentence. I remember he said --

                        So what do you --

           Metaksa glances over to Kukla, sitting in Carter's old
           office across from Max Rich himself. She scowls, letting us

           Bob sits behind Carter's old desk. The desk itself is
           covered in wrinkled papers and ink, just as disheveled as
           Bob himself. Rich sits opposite him.

                        All I'm saying here is that you
                        really ought to consider that the
                        will of the membership brought the
                        ILA into being in the first place --

                        Because they got sold a bill of

                                off-balance
                        I -- I just think you're
                        underestimating --

                                 RICH
                        Aw, can it, Bob. I'm not
                        underestimating shit.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                               (
                                through a toothpick
                                                   )
                        Hmm. Not doing so well, by the looks
                        of it. Ah, shit.

           She licks her lips, spits a little.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (cont'd)
                        Splinter. Can't believe I gave up
                        cigarettes for this shit.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Anyways, now that Harlon had rallied
                        his troops, it was time to meet. And
                        for some unfathomable reason, we
                        chose to meet in --

           EXT. LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - VARIOUS

           The skyline of Louisville, mirrored in the Ohio River.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Louisville, Kentucky. Just a hundred
                        miles southwest of our final
                        destination in Cincinnati.

           Images of the city: horses on the track at Churchill Downs,
           the Louisville Slugger factory, the Louisville Waterfront
           Park, Whitehall House and its lush gardens.
           A plane ROARS in for a landing at Louisville International.

           EXT. BROWN HOTEL - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           The historic Brown Hotel in downtown Louisville: a massive
           concrete facade with a burgundy awning proclaiming THE BROWN
           in golden letters.

           Tanya Metaksa hurries up to the front door, dragging a
           suitcase behind her.

           INT. BROWN HOTEL - BAR - LOUISVILLE - EVENING

           Dark wood, burgundy carpet, flowers and candles on the
           tables, warm evening light filtering through the windows in
           the open lobby/bar/restaurant area.

           A glass of bourbon is raised --

                                 KNOX (O.S.)
                        To the Second.

           And several more glasses of bourbon -- along with a single
           glass of seltzer -- follow.

                                 ALL (O.S.)
                        To the Second!

           Carter, Knox, Metaksa, Aquilino, and Arnett all sit at a
           table in the plush hotel bar. All drink -- Carter is the one
           with the seltzer.

           A moment as everyone downs their bourbon. Carter takes the
           opportunity to light a cigar with a silver lighter. He holds
           it up, showing off the 12-gauge shotgun embossed on it.

                                 CARTER
                        This gun right here -- my daddy's
                        shotgun -- saved my life. This gun.
                                          )
                               (
                                to Tartaro
                        Joe, I know somethin' similar
                        happened to you.
                               (
                                to all
                                      )
                        And I just want y'all to know how
                        happy I am, how proud I am, to be
                        sittin' here gettin' ready to defend
                        that right to ownership with all of
                        y'all true Americans.

                                 AQUILINO
                        Here, here!
           He raises his glass. No one else does. He quickly lowers it
           and takes a sip of bourbon.

                                 KNOX
                        Agreed. Harlon and I couldn't be
                        happier that you're all here.

                                 ARNETT
                        And um, beg pardon but what exactly
                        are we here for? What's the plan?

                                 METAKSA
                        That's what we're here to figure out.
                        Right, Harlon?

                                 CARTER
                        That's right. Before we get into
                        anything like that though, don't
                        y'all think we need to come up with a
                        name? For the group of us, I mean. We
                        ain't the NRA, not yet at least.

                                 TARTARO
                        You're saying we need a brand?

                                 CARTER
                        Why not?

                                 AQUILINO
                        How about... The Straight Shooters?

                                 KNOX
                        The New NRA.

                                 METAKSA
                        But we're not trying to be a new NRA,
                        we're just trying to fix the old one.

                                 ARNETT
                        The Society of the Second?

                                 AQUILINO
                        I like Straight Shooters more.

                                 TARTARO
                        No one else does.

                                 CARTER
                        Folks. Folks.
                               (
                                all eyes on him
                                               )
                        I got it.
           With a twinkle in his eye, Carter opens his mouth to utter
           the name of the group --

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - PRESENT DAY

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        The Federation for the NRA. That's
                        what we wound up calling ourselves.
                        Not great, but... fine. It was fine.

           INT. GUN RANGE - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           An indoor shooting range: Tartaro watches Aquilino FIRE a
           handgun at a target, hitting more often that not. Aquilino
           blows on the barrel like a cowboy out of an old Western.

                                 AQUILINO
                        Beat that.

                                 TARTARO
                        Oh, I'm meant to be impressed?

           We drift to the next lane, where Metaksa loads a handgun of
           her own as Arnett drones on.

                                 ARNETT
                        You didn't hear it from me, but
                        Reagan's definitely running again.
                        One hundred percent.

                                 METAKSA
                        He'd have my vote.

           Knox saunters over and joins their conversation. Carter
           watches from the sidelines, arms crossed over his chest.

                                 KNOX
                        Damn right. Politicians been running
                        Washington for too damn long, and
                        look where it's got us.

           BANG. Tartaro fires at the target. Bullseye. Aquilino huffs.

                                 AQUILINO
                        We've been dicking around long
                        enough. Shouldn't we get started?

                                 KNOX
                        Aw, don't be mad, Johnny. It's all
                        moot anyways.

           Aquilino looks at him.
                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Harlon's got y'all beat on the
                        marksmanship front.

                                 TARTARO
                        That so?

                                 KNOX
                        How many records you got there,
                        Harlon?

                                 CARTER
                        Still standing? Three.

                                 KNOX
                        You got one of the best shooters that
                        ever lived right there.

                                 TARTARO
                        Well, let's see it, then.

           Tartaro offers Carter his gun. Carter looks at it.

                                 CARTER
                        Actually, I gotta hit the head.

           He saunters off. The others watch him go.

                                 AQUILINO
                        And we got work to do. Right?

                                 ARNETT
                        That kinda marksman and he never
                        served in a war, huh? Seems like a
                        real waste of talent.

                                 KNOX
                        Border Patrol starting in '36. He
                        stuck with that, kept him out of the
                        war. But that doesn't mean he never
                        put them skills to good use.

           At the bathroom door, Carter pauses. He listens briefly.

                                 TARTARO
                        What do you mean?

                                 KNOX
                        You hear things, is all. Rumors...

           Carter steps into the bathroom and emerges in --
           EXT. CARTER FAMILY HOME - TEXAS - DAY - FLASHBACK

           LAREDO, 1931. The nostalgic, sepia-toned sunlight gives
           everything a gorgeous golden glow. Harlon has become Harlan,
           the younger version of himself, looking down at --

           The 12-gauge shotgun in his hands. Gathering his senses,
           Harlan strides across the yard toward the river.

           There, the three young Mexican boys continue to skip rocks.
           The oldest is RAMÓN CASIANO (15), lanky, skinny, with the
           ghost of a mustache on his lip.

           Harlan hops easily over the fence marking the property line
           and approaches the boys.

                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                        Beg pardon, boys.

           Ramón turns to him, sees the shotgun. Smirks.

                                 RAMÓN CASIANO
                        Piérdase, gringo.

                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                               (
                                indignant
                                         )
                        Boy, you're on my property.

           Ramón shakes his head, amused.

                                 RAMÓN CASIANO
                        No. Your fence is back there. And my
                        name is Ramón.

           Ramón turns back to his younger friends, who are eying
           Harlan and his gun nervously from the riverbank.

                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                        I know what you done, Ramón.

           Ramón turns back.

                                 RAMÓN CASIANO
                        ¿Qué?

                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                        My daddy's car? I know you stole it.

                                 RAMÓN CASIANO
                               (
                                amused
                                      )
                        What do I want with your papá's
                        shitty car?
                                 YOUNG HARLAN
                        I dunno, but you're gonna come with
                        me and we're gonna call the police.
                        You're gonna tell 'em where you
                        stashed it.

           Ramón LAUGHS. Harlan's face twists with anger: if there's
           one thing he hates, even at this age, it's being laughed at.

           He steadies the shotgun, aiming it at Ramón's chest.

                                 YOUNG HARLAN (cont'd)
                        C'mon, boy.

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY - LOUISVILLE - END FLASHBACK

           Carter stands at the sink in the bathroom, ramrod straight,
           studying himself in the mirror. The flat white fluorescents
           contrast sharply with the sepia glow of 1931.

           Carter puts his hand on his reflection. Almost tenderly,
           before marching out of the dingy bathroom, leaving a
           handprint fading on the glass.

           INT. GUN RANGE - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           Knox has Metaksa and Arnett's attention as Tartaro and
           Aquilino continue their little competition next door.

                                 KNOX
                        All I'm saying is, you look up
                        "Harlon Carter" with an O, you get no
                        records. Look up "Harlan" with an A,
                        on the other hand...

                                 METAKSA
                        Why are you looking this up to start
                        with? You're just causing trouble.

                                 KNOX
                        Why would you ever trust anyone to be
                        who they tell you they are? That's
                        how you get in real trouble.

           Carter stalks into the room toward the rest of the
           Federation. Tartaro is taking his turn with the handgun, and
           Carter simply strides up to him and --

           Slips the gun from his hand and empties it at the target. An
           effortless tight grouping. He sets the gun down.

                                 CARTER
                        Enough dickin' around.
           He turns and walks away. The other Federation members look
           at each other, at the grouping on the target.

                                 AQUILINO
                        Yeah.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           There's a growing pile of toothpicks in the dish beside
           Metaksa. She adds another one to it.

                                 METAKSA
                        Speaking of dicking around, what do
                        you think Max Rich was up to while we
                        were in Louisville?

           EXT. COLORADO CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

           Max Rich, wearing a yellow hardhat, walks through a clearing
           with a REAL ESTATE AGENT. Fallen pines litter the ground,
           the Rocky Mountains loom in the background.

           Nothing has been built here yet; it's just a piece of real
           estate that's being cleared by bulldozers and dump trucks.

                                 RICH
                        So actually the guy's patent just
                        expired. Which means you're going to
                        see a lot more companies
                        manufacturing the AR-15. For my money
                        though, you want to hunt a buck, a
                        Remington 700 rifle is still your
                        best friend.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Is that a semiautomatic?

                                 RICH
                        Why do you need that? If you're a
                        good hunter, all you need is one
                        clean shot.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Just doesn't seem as fun that way.

                                 RICH
                        How much more of this forest is
                        getting cleared?

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        They're about eighty percent done.
                               (
                                points
                                 RICH
                                      )
                        We'd put the main facility over
                        there. So we're standing in the
                        parking structure right now.

           Rich pauses, takes a huge SNIFF of the fresh air. Surveys
           his future kingdom wistfully.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        I can really see it.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Does that mean you're ready to sign
                        the preliminary paperwork?

                                 RICH
                        You bet I am.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        And um, you actually don't have to
                        wear the hardhat. They're just
                        clearing brush today.

           Rich just takes another big breath of mountain air.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           Metaksa smirks into the camera.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        Yeah. Really focused on what matters,
                        that guy. Anyways, back in
                        Kentucky...

           INT. DINER - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A cup of coffee being filled to the brim. A plate
           of bacon, eggs, toast, and grits. A flask tipping a splash
           of bourbon into the coffee.

           The Federation is crammed into a pleather booth in a greasy
           spoon. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air.

                                 KNOX
                        We'll start by going around the
                        table, and if you know any local NRA
                        organizers or chapter leaders, Tanya
                        will write their names down.

                                 METAKSA
                        Why am I writing them down?
                                 KNOX
                        You're the secretary.

                                 METAKSA
                        Oh no, I absolutely the fuck am not.

           In the neighboring booth, a MOTHER with two young CHILDREN
           looks over her shoulder and gives Metaksa a filthy look.

           The other men at the table laugh. Knox burns with
           embarrassment, eyes down on the table. Carter, watching all
           of this with a slight smirk, clears his throat --

                                 CARTER
                        Actually.
                               (
                                all eyes on him
                                               )
                        The first thing we gotta do is come
                        up with a platform. Ain't no one
                        gonna get on board with us if we
                        can't tell 'em exactly what they're
                        gettin' on board with.

           Aquilino sips his coffee, winces. It's not good.

                               (
                                mouth full
                                 ARNETT
                                          )
                        First step in any successful
                        campaign.

                                 KNOX
                        You've never run a campaign, Ray. You
                        were an appointee.

           Aquilino, pouring a bit more bourbon into his coffee --

                                 AQUILINO
                        So uh, what is our platform?

                                 TARTARO
                        It's... no gun control, right?

           A WAITRESS with terrible bangs appears with a pot of coffee.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Y'all doin' okay?

           They all collectively ignore her.

                                 METAKSA
                        But there already is gun control. The
                        1968 act --
                                 TARTARO
                        Okay, so no more gun control.

                                 KNOX
                        Nuh-uh. There's things in that 1968
                        Act that we cannot allow to stand.
                        The government gets to decide who is
                        and isn't mentally fit to own a gun.

                                 ARNETT
                        That's not so bad.

                                 KNOX
                        'Til they tell you you're mentally
                        unfit to own one.

                                 ARNETT
                        But -- I'm not.

                                 KNOX
                        Exactly.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Well, alright then.

           She slips away, still unnoticed.

                                 TARTARO
                        We can live with the Saturday Night
                        Special ban, at least.

           Carter SNORTS in derision. The others look at him.

                                 CARTER
                        That ban opened a door, Joe. It might
                        only be open a crack for now, but
                        mark my words, it's get gonna get
                        wider. And before you know it, it's
                        gonna blow wide open and there'll be
                        nothing we can do to stop it.

                                 TARTARO
                        But that ban's done some good --

           FREEZE-FRAME on Tartaro.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Y'know what, it might help if we
                        pause to explain just what the hell a
                        Saturday Night Special is. Joe?
           INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - OUTSIDE OF TIME

           It's Joe Tartaro's turn in the lecture hall this time.

                                 TARTARO
                        A Saturday Night Special is a cheap,
                        small caliber handgun. Like this.

           He holds up a Röhm Gesellschaft RG-5: a small .22 pistol,
           with a black barrel and cheap faux-wood grip.

                                 TARTARO (cont'd)
                        They'd come in under thirty bucks, so
                        just about anyone could afford one...

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           A ROBBER in a ski mask points an RG-5 at a cowering CLERK.
           He thrusts a paper bag at the terrified man. Tartaro talks
           as the clerk hurried pulls cash out of the register.

                                 TARTARO (V.O.)
                        Including your common criminal, which
                        is why they caught a lot of flack
                        during that urban crime wave in the
                        '60's. The gangs, the robbers, the
                        muggers: y'know, the negros. They
                        could buy 'em, use 'em once, and get
                        rid of 'em.

           And now, Tartaro himself steps into the scene. The robber
           and clerk don't see him; it's like he's walking through a
           moving, life-sized diorama.

                                 TARTARO
                        Totally disposable. Which meant
                        they'd occasionally --

           The robber FIRES the gun. It backfires, disintegrating in
           the robber's hand and blowing half of his face off in
           excruciating slow motion.

                                 TARTARO (cont'd)
                        Just blow up in your hand.

           He pinches the grip of the pistol between two fingers and
           gingerly lowers it onto an endcap display of beer.

                                 TARTARO (cont'd)
                        So when they were banned by the Gun
                        Control Act of 1968, most folks said
                        good riddance.
           INT. DINER - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           Back in the diner, Carter holds court.

                                 TARTARO (V.O.)
                        But not Harlon Carter.

                                 AQUILINO
                        I dunno, we put those guns back on
                        the street and they're just gonna be
                        used to kill decent folk again.

                                 CARTER
                        That's the price of freedom, John.

           Carter takes a huge bite of pancakes. As he chews --

                                 METAKSA
                        He's right.
                               (
                                all eyes on her
                                               )
                        That's how Stalin started. When my
                        parents were living in the USSR -- he
                        started small, just like they're
                        doing here. But before you knew it,
                        the son of a bitch had all the guns
                        and the people had fuck-all. And if
                        anyone complained... BANG!

           She SLAPS the table. The men jump, except for Carter. The
           mom at the next table shoots Metaksa another glare.

                                 ARNETT
                        So you want to, what? Advocate the
                        repeal of the entire 1968 Act?

                                 CARTER
                        You bet your ass I do.

                                 KNOX
                        I'd love that as much as you, but you
                        think it's realistic?

                                 CARTER
                        I don't care about what's realistic,
                        I care about what's right. When I'm
                        walkin' down the street in DC and I
                        see some shadowy figure comin' my
                        way, the only reason I feel safe is
                        because I got my sidearm on me.
                        Everyone deserves to feel that safe.
                        Every day. That's what's right.
                                 TARTARO
                        I think we all agree on that, but
                        there must be some kinda compromise
                        we can find --

                                 CARTER
                        No. No compromise.

                                 AQUILINO
                        Harlon --

                               (
                                 CARTER
                                a sudden epiphany
                                                 )
                        No. That's it. That's the platform.
                        No compromise. No gun control.

           The group pauses. They look at one another.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Simple. Clear. Clean. A goddamn
                        three-year-old could understand it.

                                 ARNETT
                        It's good.

           The attention goes to Arnett now.

                                 ARNETT (cont'd)
                        We get to fight on as few fronts as
                        possible and make the other guys
                        fight on as many as we can. We say,
                        "No compromise. No gun legislation."
                        They gotta say, "Some gun
                        legislation," and then we make them
                        justify every single piece of it
                        while our message stays exactly the
                        same. It's smart politics.

                                 CARTER
                        It ain't just that.
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        This ain't just about winning. It's
                        about this. Our whole country. We let
                        the government chip away at the
                        Second Amendment, how long before
                        they come after the First? And when
                        they do, what's gonna stop 'em?

           A sobering pause. Knox picks up his mug of coffee and raises
           it in a toast.

                                                      MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

           A mug with the NRA seal on it gripped in a hand that belongs
           to MERRILL RIGHT (60), handsome with salt and pepper hair
           and a crisp suit. He nods as the man across from him talks.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile, Bob Kukla was trying
                        desperately to get anyone to listen
                        to him. Even the President of the
                        NRA. Who, despite the title, is just
                        a figurehead with a pretty face.

           SUPER: MERRILL RIGHT, PRESIDENT, NRA

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        And he's not even that pretty.

           Right continues to nod as Kukla's voice takes over.

                                 KUKLA (O.S.)
                        I just don't think Max is taking this
                        seriously. These guys -- they mean
                        business. If you ignore them...

                                 RIGHT
                               (
                                nods thoughtfully
                                                 )
                        You think they could get Max ousted?

                                 KUKLA
                        I think they're sure gonna try. And
                        listen, I happen to agree with the
                        guys. But I still wanna do this
                        right. If Max can address their
                        concerns now maybe there won't have
                        to be a circus in Cincinnati.

                                 RIGHT
                        Alright. I hear your concern. I'll
                        bring it up with Max, maybe we can
                        find some kind of compromise.

           Right sips his coffee again and we --

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BROWN HOTEL - BAR - LOUISVILLE - EVENING

           A glass of bourbon held aloft in Knox's hand.

                                 KNOX
                        No compromise! No gun control!
           A ROAR of approval from the Federation members, who are all
           gathered around the table. A few other hotel bar patrons
           shoot annoyed looks at them.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Okay. Local chapter leaders you know.

                                 AQUILINO
                        I got this guy Wayne in Virginia.
                        He's not into guns, but he'll fight
                        like hell against the government.

                                 CARTER
                        Wayne what?

                                 AQUILINO
                        LaPiedro or something?

                                 KNOX
                        Call him up. Anyone else?

                                 METAKSA
                        I'm in touch with a woman in Florida
                        who could be helpful. I'm not sure if
                        she's leading a chapter yet but she
                        wants to be as involved as possible.

                                 CARTER
                        Name?

                                 METAKSA
                        Marion Hammer.

                                 TARTARO
                        Good name.

                                 KNOX
                        Great name.

                                 CARTER
                        Mark it down. Anyone else?

           INT. GUN SHOP - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           The Federation members admire the wares. Carter holds up a
           shiny silver Colt revolver, examining its glittering finish.

           Aquilino stands beside him, leaning in close.

                                 AQUILINO
                        What about the Panthers?
                               (
                                distracted
                                 CARTER
                                          )
                        What?

                                 AQUILINO
                        You know...

                                 CARTER
                        Y'mean the Black Panthers?

           He looks at Aquilino sharply. Aquilino gives him a look
           back: Yeah, I'm serious.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                               (
                                chuckles
                                        )
                        You are outside your mind on that
                        one, son.

           Carter turns his attention back to the Colt, but Aquilino
           squares up to him.

                                 AQUILINO
                        Think about it, man. They believe in
                        the Second, same as us. Hell, they
                        might even believe it harder than us.
                        Remember that stunt they pulled in --
                        what was it, '67?

           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL - DAY

           Reagan stands before a crowd of gathered third-graders, who
           all sit cross-legged on the grass, rapt as he speaks.

           Meanwhile, a group of fifteen ARMED BLACK PANTHERS, guns on
           their shoulders, saunter by toward the capitol building.

                                 AQUILINO (V.O.)
                        They marched all locked and loaded
                        straight up to Reagan himself after
                        he signed that bullshit gun law.

           The kids, and even Reagan, turn their attention to the
           Panthers as they head up to the capitol, berets and all.

           INT. GUN SHOP - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           Back with Aquilino and Carter.

                                 CARTER
                        That's just theatrics.
                                 AQUILINO
                        But those theatrics might really help
                        our cause, don't you think?

                                 CARTER
                        Forget it, Johnny. We're not gangin'
                        up with a bunch of... gangsters.

                                 AQUILINO
                               (
                                to himself
                                          )
                        Well I thought they were cool.

           Carter focuses back on the Colt for a beat, leaving Aquilino
           disappointed. Then --

                               (
                                                 )
                                 CARTER
                        Although that does remind me...
                                over his shoulder
                        Hey Ray, what about the Gipper?

           Arnett, standing in an aisle, jumps and drops the box of
           bullets he's examining. A hundred or so of them CLINK as
           they scatter across the floor.

                                 ARNETT
                        Ummm...

           EXT. CALIFORNIA STATE CAPITOL - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Arnett himself stands behind Reagan as the Black Panthers
           march by. He subtly shifts his position so he's more or less
           hiding behind Reagan, who --

           Senses him there, turns, gives him a look: What the hell?

           INT. GUN SHOP - DAY - LOUISVILLE - END FLASHBACK

           Arnett gulps.

                                 ARNETT
                        I'll uh -- I'll see what I can do.

                                 CARTER
                        That's all we ask.

                                 METAKSA
                        You don't think calling up members is
                        gonna get the job done on its own
                        though, do you?

                                 CARTER
                        No. That I do not. That's why we got
                        our secret weapon. Neal?
           EXT. DRIVING RANGE - LOUISVILLE - DAY

           A sudden cut to a driving range as Knox THWACKS a golf ball.
           It sails through the air as the others watch approvingly.

                                 KNOX
                        I got a total circulation of one-
                        hundred thirty-eight thousand, two-
                        hundred seventy-three between the two
                        of 'em.

           He hands his club to Carter. Behind them --

                                 AQUILINO
                        That's a helluva lot of members.

                                 CARTER
                        It ain't bad.

           He scoops up a ball and places it on the tee.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Tell you what, Neal. Set some pages
                        aside for us. Put in some calls to
                        action. "Keep Rifle in National Rifle
                        Association." "Defend Your Rights,"
                        that sorta thing.

                                 KNOX
                        We aren't worried about tipping off
                        the General?

                                 CARTER
                        Fuck the General.

           THWACK. His ball sails over the green and lands just past
           Knox's, edging him out.

           INT. BROWN HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           The group sits around a conference table. Carter stands
           before them, drawing on a paper display resting on an easel.

           He diagrams as he speaks --

                                 CARTER
                        He's got the NRA using membership
                        dues to provide services: classes,
                        workshops, and shit. The membership
                        then pays in again to retain access
                        to those services.

           He's created a diagram that looks something like this:
           He continues with a new diagram --

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        But. We get lobbying going, the NRA's
                        money goes to campaigns and programs
                        instead. We start getting
                        sponsorships. Gun makers, outfitters,
                        the folks we're benefiting. That's
                        more income, which we use to get more
                        influence. It's a beautiful circle.

           His new diagram looks like this:

           Most of the Federation members nod. Tartaro raises his hand.

                                 TARTARO
                        But... what about the members?

           Carter just blinks at him and looks back at his diagram, not
           comprehending the problem.

                                 CARTER
                        They'll still pay dues.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (PRE-LAP)
                        And that was that for Louisville.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           The older Metaksa removes the toothpick from her mouth.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        Everybody ran off to their corners of
                        the country and got to work. Me and
                        Ray went back to DC. John, too. Joe
                        was back in Buffalo with his family.
                        Harlon and Maryann left DC and went
                        back to their house in New Mexico. He
                        always did hate the city.

                        And he went right to work.

           EXT. WOODS - HUNTING BLIND - MORNING

           CLOSE ON: A full-page glossy magazine advertisement. A
           gleaming rifle clutched in a fist, along with the words KEEP
           RIFLE IN NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION!

           REVEAL: Merrill Right stares at down at the ad. He wears
           khakis and a blaze-orange vest. So does his hunting
           companion, who sits beside him:

           Max Rich, sighting down the scope of a brand new rifle. He
           adjusts, aiming at a squirrel.

           Right holds out the glossy: Handloader Magazine.

                                 RIGHT
                        You seen this?

                                 RICH
                        One second.

           The squirrel hops behind a tree. Rich sighs, takes the
           magazine, peers at the cover.

                                 RIGHT
                        I think we got a small problem.

                                 RICH
                        With Handloader Magazine?

                                 RIGHT
                        Look at the insert.

           Rich flips to it, looks at the ad. He focuses on the smaller
           print at the bottom: Join the fight in Cincinatti!

                                 RICH
                        The hell is this?

                                 RIGHT
                        Neal Knox's magazines. Looks like him
                        and Harlon are plotting something.

                                 RICH
                        Harlon? What makes you think that?

                                 RIGHT
                        You know they don't agree with your
                        plan for --
                                 RICH
                        You been talking to Bob?

                                 RIGHT
                        I'm -- I'm sorry?

                                 RICH
                        Kukla! Bob Kukla. He tried the same
                        shit with me, telling me Harlon
                        Carter is gonna somehow stop our deal
                        in Colorado. You talk to him?

                                 RIGHT
                        He uh, he might've mentioned
                        something...

                                 RICH
                        Sneaky little piece of shit.

           Rich sets the magazine aside and starts fiddling with the
           scope on his rifle again.

                                 RIGHT
                        So you don't think we should worry?

                                 RICH
                               (
                                looks at him

                        Merrill. You know why folks call
                        Harlon Carter "Bullethead?"

                                 RIGHT
                        Because his head is shaped like --

                                 RICH
                        Because his head is as hard as a
                        bullet. He'll never admit he's wrong,
                        but these guys got nothing. They
                        wanna scream about decade-old gun
                        laws, let 'em. No one's listening.
                        Except maybe Bob fucking Kukla.

                                 RIGHT
                        Are you sure?

                                 RICH
                        I'm sure of what the NRA needs and
                        what the membership wants. I'm also
                        sure I didn't invite you here so we
                        could talk work. We're here to hunt.
                        So keep it down.

           Rich goes back to his scope briefly, then glances back down
           at the magazine's cover.
                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        And who the hell reads Handloader
                        Magazine, anyhow?

           He takes aim at the squirrel again, and --

           BANG.

           MONTAGE: WHO THE HELL READS HANDLOADER MAGAZINE?

           - Knox sits at a desk in his dim study, hammering away at a
           typewriter. Wendy sets a beer beside him.

           - Copies of Handloader Magazine and Rifle Magazine fly off
           the presses.

           - A pile of mail, Rifle Magazine on top, is shoved into a
           mailbox.

           - Handloader Magazine goes in another mailbox.

           - Another mailbox, another Rifle Magazine.

           - A bundle of Handloader Magazines held by a pair of hands:
           John Aquilino's. He wears a shirt and tie and hands them to
           people as they exit a church.

           - Bob Kukla glances around before entering Max Rich's empty
           office. He leaves a Handloader Magazine on Rich's desk.

           - Joe Tartaro, in a Buffalo public library, glances around
           before dumping a load of Rifle Magazines on a shelf beside
           some LIFE and TIME magazines.

           - Harlon Carter, wearing a bright yellow Lion's Club vest,
           hands Handloaders to other aging vest-clad Lions seated in
           rows of folding chairs in a community center.

           - Rich finds the Handloader Kukla left on his desk. He
           scoffs at it and tosses it straight in the trash.

           - Handloader in the hands of MARION HAMMER (38), wearing a
           red blazer and sporting a severe bob haircut, sitting in her
           Florida living room. Her phone RINGS.

           She picks up. We enter a --

           SPLIT SCREEN

           With Metaksa in the ILA office.

                                 METAKSA
                        Marion Hammer?
                                 HAMMER
                        Yes?

           As their conversation quiets, the screen divides into four
           quadrants with --

           WAYNE LAPIERRE (28), soft-spoken, already wearing his
           signature face-subsuming spectacles, in a nondescript
           office. He's utterly boring and mundane. 

           His desk phone RINGS. He picks up.

           In the final quadrant, John Aquilino in a messy bedroom,
           clothes strewn everywhere, empty whiskey bottle on the
           nightstand.

                                 JOHN AQUILINO
                        Wayne!

                                 LAPIERRE
                        Um, yes?

           And now the screen splits again. More members calling more
           people. It splits again and again, exponentially growing
           into a cacophony of "Hellos" and ringing phones. Then --

           - Neal Knox sitting at a desk in his office, typing away on
           his typewriter, generating copy for his magazines.

           - CLOSE ON a magazine ad: COLORADO? COLORA-NO! Marion Hammer
           raises it in front of a community center crowd, shouting --

                                 HAMMER
                        If you can, if you are able, get on a
                        plane, on a bus, in a car, and --

           - Knox pulls a type-filled page from his typewriter.

           - Tartaro, in a smoky Elk's Club Lodge, pontificates before
           an audience of tipsy middle-aged men.

                                 TARTARO
                        Get your ass up to Cincinnati!
                        Because gentlemen, this --

           - Knox feeds another page into the typewriter.

           - LaPierre speaks from a podium in a church basement.

                                 LAPIERRE
                        Is deeply troubling news, to say the
                        least.
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAPIERRE (cont'd)
                        The NRA is um, is abandoning the
                        Second Amendment to the wolves of
                        government, and that means --

           - Knox furiously pounds the keys.

           - Aquilino, standing on the porch of a frat house, talking
           to a cluster of clean-cut, sweater-clad FRATERNITY BROTHERS.

                                 AQUILINO
                        You are the last line of defense
                        against the tyranny of Washington.
                        How's that sound? Badass, huh?

           The frat brothers all grin at each other, totally into it.

           - Knox pounds out the last couple words and rips the page
           from the typewriter.

           - CLOSE ON a copy of Handloader Magazine. Pulling back, we
           see feet on a very expensive desk. The magazine is lowered
           to reveal the grinning face of Ronald Reagan himself.

           INT. CARTER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           THWUMP! A stack of magazines lands on the table in a bright,
           well-lit kitchen in Carter's Arizona home.

           Carter sits at the table across from Maryann. Both eat eggs
           and bacon, drink orange juice as Carter cracks a magazine.

                                 CARTER
                        "Defend your rights in Cincinatti!"

           Maryann looks at him as he holds up a new ad: fists holding
           up rifles in front of the Cincinatti skyline.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Neal's been on fire.

                                 MARYANN
                        I'll say.

                                 CARTER
                        Hand me the book?

           Maryann slides a LEDGER across the table to him. He opens it
           up: it's filled with lists of names and phone numbers. Some
           are crossed out, most have CHECK MARKS next to them.

           CLOSE ON: Check mark after check mark after check mark.
                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Sorry. I just like lookin' at it.
                               (
                                whistles
                                        )
                        Damn, that's pretty.

                                 MARYANN
                        You think it's enough?

                                 CARTER
                        Guess we'll find out in a couple
                        weeks.

           He glances over at a CALENDAR on the wall. It's already
           turned to MAY, 1977.

           EXT. A LEAF - DAY

           Our little spider friend raises its front legs, preparing to
           attack the enormous fly just a few inches away. It adjusts
           its position, hunting...

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (PRE-LAP)
                        So. Seemed like Neal's magazines were
                        doing the trick.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           Metaksa looks up from a copy of Handloader Magazine.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        So were the calls, the meetings,
                        etcetera. But Neal, well. The son of
                        a bitch had a hard time leaving well
                        enough alone.

           INT. WASHINGTON, DC STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Knox and Arnett have a quiet dinner: white tablecloths,
           cigar smoke hanging in the air. A copy of the NRA RULES AND
           REGULATIONS on the table beside Knox as he --

           Slices into a rare T-bone. Blood pools on the plate.

                                 KNOX
                        Okay, so point one is more power to
                        membership. Make it a 501(c)4. Rich
                        is gonna have a hard time arguing
                        against that. Then --

                                 ARNETT
                        We come in hard against Colorado.
                                 KNOX
                        The asshole won't know what hit him.

           Arnett nods, but looks doubtful.

                                 ARNETT
                        You really think this is gonna work?

                                 KNOX
                        It's a risky play. But it's the only
                        one we got. Just...
                               (
                                                    )
                                leans in, conspiring
                        The only thing I'm not sure of is
                        Harlon.

           Arnett blinks, taken aback. Knox takes a bite of steak.

                                 ARNETT
                        You -- what, you don't think he's
                        all-in? Because if anything it seems
                        like he's too all-in.

                               (

                        You remember Operation Wetback?

           EXT. DESERT ROADSIDE, TEXAS - DAY - 1950'S

           Blinding sunlight blasts a bone-dry landscape. A 1950's bus
           idles at the side of the road, a long line of MEXICAN
           MIGRANT WORKERS kicking at the dirt beside it.

           BORDER PATROL OFFICERS work the line, checking ID's, asking
           for papers. Their leader is Harlon Carter himself, in his
           early 40's but no less imposing and no less bald.

                                 ARNETT (V.O.)
                        When they deported all those Mexicans
                        without due process?

                                 KNOX (V.O.)
                        He oversaw that whole thing when he
                        was with the Border Patrol.

           Carter strides over to a MEXICAN MAN who's standing up
           straight, proud and defiant. He gets uncomfortably close to
           the man, threatening.

                                 KNOX (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        And he saw something more than a
                        government operation, too. Always one
                        step ahead. He saw an opportunity.
                                 MIDDLE-AGED CARTER
                        I'm gonna need bus fare from you.

           The Mexican man looks at Carter, uncomprehending. Carter
           takes a step back to address the whole line.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED CARTER (cont'd)
                        Y'all think these buses are free?
                        They're takin' you all the way to
                        Juarez! This shit is not free!

           The migrants glance at one another, but none make move.
           Until one of Carter's Border Patrol guards SLAMS the butt of
           his rifle into the proud Mexican man's gut.

           The others scramble to hand their money over to Carter.

           INT. WASHINGTON, DC STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

                                 KNOX
                        Took every red cent those Mexicans
                        had and pocketed it for himself.

                                 ARNETT
                               (
                                concerned
                                         )
                        Who uh, who told you all this?

                                 KNOX
                        Old Bullethead himself.

           EXT. DESERT ROADSIDE, TEXAS - DAY - 1950'S

           Carter smiles his wide bullfrog grin as he slips the
           migrants' money into his front shirt pocket.

                                 KNOX (V.O.)
                        He's goddamn proud of it.

           INT. STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

                                 ARNETT
                        You're saying Harlon -- Harlon
                        bragged about stealing everything
                        these people had?

                                 KNOX
                        Well, when you put it that way it
                        sounds practically sinister.

                                 ARNETT
                        We are about to enter the political
                        arena here, Neal.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARNETT (cont'd)
                        Our opposition is gonna do everything
                        they can to dig up dirt on whoever's
                        leading us.

                                 KNOX
                        So... what should we do?

                                 ARNETT
                        If it were me? I'd nominate someone
                        other than Harlon Carter to lead the
                        NRA once we're rid of Max Rich.

                                 KNOX
                        Got anyone in mind?

                                 ARNETT
                        I uh, I dunno. I suppose... you were
                        the other half of the team that came
                        up with the idea in the first place.

           Knox shoves another bite of steak into his mouth to suppress
           his sly grin.

                                 KNOX
                        Hm.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - TEXAS - DAY

           The middle-aged Carter glances around outside a large
           government warehouse. He wears his Border Patrol uniform as
           he approaches a truck stacked with crates of ammunition.

                                 ARNETT (V.O.)
                        This is a man who was running the
                        Border Patrol when 20,000 rounds of
                        ammunition went missing right out
                        from under his nose.

           Carter picks up a box of ammo, scans his surroundings again,
           and hustles over to a shiny new 1950's Ford pickup.

                                 TARTARO (V.O.)
                        That doesn't mean he stole it.

           Carter opens the gate of the pickup. Several more crates of
           ammo are already waiting there.

                                 ARNETT (V.O.)
                        Not necessarily. But that's not the
                        point.
           EXT. KNOX'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           A cookout at Neal Knox's house. The entire Federation minus
           Carter is there. They're in a new subdivision: houses spread
           out with sprawling backyards leading to bare fields.

           Hammer holds a rifle while next to her, Aquilino holds a
           clay pigeon, discus-style.

                                 HAMMER
                        PULL!

           Aquilino HURLS the clay pigeon.

           BANG! It explodes in the air.

           A handful of NEW FEDERATION MEMBERS are scattered around the
           yard. KNOX'S SONS, twelve and ten, chase through the little
           groups of adults, FIRING cap guns at each other.

           Over near a charcoal grill, Knox and Arnett chat with
           Tartaro and LaPierre, who JUMPS at the sound of the gunshot.

                                 ARNETT
                        The point is, he had to testify
                        before a Grand Jury. The man's been
                        accused of stealing from good
                        American law enforcement officers.

                                 TARTARO
                        Sure, but he wasn't convicted.

                                 KNOX
                        This is just you not understanding
                        politics, Joe. He doesn't have to
                        have done it if his enemies can make
                        people believe he's done it.

           Knox goes about flipping burgers on the grill. Flames LEAP
           into the air.

                                 HAMMER (O.S.)
                        PULL!

           BANG!

           LaPierre jumps again.

                                 LAPIERRE
                        So um, so what -- what are we going
                        to to do about this?
                                 ARNETT
                        Well, when the time comes, I think
                        it'd be a smart move to support Neal
                        for Executive VP.

                                 LAPIERRE
                        Over Harlon?

                                 TARTARO
                        But this whole thing was Harlon's
                        from the get-go.

                                 KNOX
                        It was both of us. Harlon and me.

                                 ARNETT
                        And Neal has plenty of name
                        recognition from the magazines.

           Metaksa edges into the conversation, peering at the grill.

                                 METAKSA
                        How're those burgers coming?

                                 KNOX
                        Almost done. Just give us a couple
                        more minutes.

                                 METAKSA
                        Lookin' good.

           Metaksa stands there with the men, Knox giving her a look
           that says, Go away, the adults are talking.

           Metaksa gets the message. She raises the beer in her hand.

                                 METAKSA (cont'd)
                        Well.

           Takes a sip and saunters off.

                                 HAMMER (V.O.)
                        PULL!

           BANG!

           LaPierre jumps. Again.

                                 KNOX
                        So what do you think, boys?

           LaPierre and Tartaro glance at each other, unsure...
           EXT. KNOX'S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Carter approaches the front door, carrying a suitcase and
           wearing a dark look on his face.

           He mounts the steps, takes a breath. Replaces his grimace
           with a grin, raises his fist to knock, and --

           The door opens. Wendy Knox smiles and goes in for the hug.

                                 WENDY
                        Harlon! How are you?

           EXT. KNOX'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Metaksa sits in a lawn chair removed from the rest of the
           group, a beer in hand, observing. Knox laughs with Tartaro
           and LaPierre, then glances her way.

           Metaksa looks away, but it's too late. Knox is already
           sauntering toward her.

                                 KNOX
                        How you doing there, Tanya?

                                 METAKSA
                        I'm good. Good.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Excited.

                                 KNOX
                        Damn right. So uh...
                               (
                                leans in
                                        )
                        How much of that did you hear back
                        there? About Harlon?

           Metaksa just looks at him, sips her beer.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        You know him as well as any of us.
                        You really think he's the right man
                        to lead this thing?

                                 METAKSA
                        You really think you are?

           Before Knox can answer, Wendy opens the back door for
           Carter, who now has a beer in hand. All eyes turn to him.
           Metaksa stands up and walks right past the speechless Knox.

                                 METAKSA (cont'd)
                        Harlon! Welcome back!
                                 CARTER
                        I don't know if I'll ever feel
                        "welcome" in DC, but I thank you for
                        the sentiment. Good to see ya, Tanya.

           They hug as, in the background --

                                 HAMMER (O.S.)
                        PULL!

           BANG! A clay pigeon EXPLODES in the sky, and we --

                                                          SMASH TO:

           INT. KNOX'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Wendy stands exasperated in the living room as the two Knox
           boys chase each other around the furniture, firing their cap
           guns and laughing.

                                 WENDY
                        Boys! Boys, it's time to go to --
                        boys! Bed!

           Laughter from the boys as we push out the window and into --

           EXT. KNOX'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Where Carter and Knox drink in the dim light from a fixture
           on the back of the house, lounging in patio chairs. Carter
           lights a cigar with his shotgun-embossed lighter.

                                 CARTER
                        So. You think we pulled it off?

                                 KNOX
                        Christ. I dunno.

                                 CARTER
                               (
                                snorts, then
                                            )
                        I owe ya a big thank you, Neal. I
                        don't want you to think I'm not
                        appreciative of what you've done.

                                 KNOX
                        Nah, you don't have to --

                                 CARTER
                        No, I do. I do. I think -- I think my
                        whole life, I've been fightin' for
                        something without really knowin' what
                        it was. And now I know. And that is,
                        in part at least, thanks to you.
                                 KNOX
                        Well. I appreciate that. And we're
                        gonna win on Sunday, I'd stake my
                        life and my wife on it.

                                 CARTER
                        And once we do, I want you to know --
                        you're gonna be my right hand man. I
                        might get the General's office, but
                        you and I -- we're still gonna be a
                        team. I can't do this without you.

           Knox hides a reflexive scowl at being considered the
           sidekick behind his beer.

                                 KNOX
                        Thanks. I'm... lookin' forward to it.

           He picks up a NOTEBOOK resting on the table beside him.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Whaddya say? Wanna go over the
                        manifesto one more time?

           Carter rests his cigar on the edge of the table as Knox
           opens the notebook. The two begin to conspire.

           EXT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - DAY - ESTABLISHING

           A bright, sunny spring day: the impossibly shiny facade of
           NRA HQ reflects the fluffy white clouds in the sky.

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - BOARDROOM - DAY

           A large boardroom, with Max Rich at the head of it, Merrill
           Right at his right hand. The Board, entirely male and almost
           entirely white, lines both sides of a conference table.

           Behind Rich, a large window looks out at the hotel across
           the street where the remains of the ILA reside.

                        Just a couple more points before we
                        all head to the airport. The Colorado
                        deal is set to close immediately
                        after the meeting. Oram
                        International, the consultants Tom
                        brought on, tell us fundraising
                        should increase significantly as long
                        as we limit the use of firearms on
                        outdoor firing ranges --
           The boardroom door opens and Bob Kukla enters. He's timid,
           hunched, one hand in a pocket. The entire room turns to look
           at him. Rich sighs.

                                 KUKLA
                        Hello?

                                 RIGHT
                        Bob? What are you doing?

                                 KUKLA
                        Well, um... I wanted to -- before we
                        go to Cincinnati, I wanted to bring
                        up -- I think we may be
                        underestimating the um, the
                        seriousness of Harlon Carter and Neal
                        Knox's um... movement.

                                 RICH
                        Oh Christ, not this again.

                                 KUKLA
                        No, I -- just hear me out.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I know you ran the numbers and that
                        gun legislation -- it doesn't seem
                        important to the membership. Or it
                        didn't. But Neal and Harlon...

           QUICK CUTS: PREPARING FOR REVOLUTION

           As Bob speaks in voiceover, we get images of Federation
           members prepping their supplies for Cincinnati.

           - Tanya Metaksa presses large CAMPAIGN BUTTONS with the
           slogan KEEP RIFLE IN NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION! on them.

           - Knox types out the manifesto from his notebook.

           - Aquilino packs a ludicrous number of BLAZE ORANGE HATS
           into his suitcase.

           - Harlon Carter straightens his tie in a bedroom mirror.

                                 KUKLA (V.O.)
                        What they're doing -- they're making
                        people think that their rights might
                        really be at risk here. And most of
                        these folks had never even considered
                        that, so of course the legislation
                        wasn't important to them, but -- I'm
                        worried it might be very important to
                        an awful lot of them now.

                                 RICH
                        Are you done, Bob?

                                 KUKLA
                        Um, yes.

                                 RICH
                        So what is it you want us to do?

                                 KUKLA
                        Just -- reconsider Colorado? Or at
                        least getting rid of the ILA. We
                        could do great work with enough
                        funding. We could be the public face
                        of the whole organization.

           The entire room looks at Kukla. Sweaty, oily, balding Kukla.

                                 RIGHT
                        You want to be the face of the NRA?

                                 KUKLA
                        Well no, not me specifically, but --

                                 RICH
                        That's enough. It's not gonna happen.
                        You really think our members care
                        more about the freedom to carry a
                        goddamn tommygun than they do about
                        their own kids' safety? Because I
                        think that's downright insane.

                                 KUKLA
                        Are you willing to wager the entire
                        NRA over that point?

           Rich, already annoyed, stands up.

                                 RICH
                        I'm not wagering. I'm sure of it.
                        Lobbying against settled law is a
                        waste of resources, it's not what the
                        NRA was built for --

                                 KUKLA
                               (
                                to the Board
                                            )
                        We've been fielding complaints across
                        the street, people wondering why the
                        ILA was cut back --
                                 RICH
                        It's a waste of time. Just like you.

                                 KUKLA
                        I'm telling you --

                                 RICH
                        Get the fuck out!

           Kukla looks like he might say something more, but instead 
           nods and scurries out of the room. We follow him out to --

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As the door CLICKS shut behind him, LAUGHTER can be heard
           from the Boardroom.

           Kukla straightens his tie, mops his forehead with a
           handkerchief, and strides away. His gait is surprisingly
           confident for a man who just got dressed down by his bosses.

           We stay on him as he recedes down the hallway and disappears
           around a corner, slowly cross-fading to --

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA (V.O.)
                        Kukla tried to warn him.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           Present-day Metaksa sits smugly in her chair, the little
           pile of toothpicks growing on the side table next to her.

                        But instead Rich strolled into
                        Cincinnati like Napoleon marching
                        into Russia.

           EXT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION-EXHIBITION CENTER - DAY

           A blocky building with a grid-like design on its wall that
           spells out CiNCiNATTi. It's kind of an eyesore.

           SUPER: MAY 22, 1977

           Sweaty folks in camo, blaze orange, red, white, and blue,
           and yes, even nondescript streetwear all stream into the
           building. Heat haze obscures the distance.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION-EXHIBITION CENTER - VARIOUS - DAY

           The place is bustling with gun-loving, gun-toting patriots.
           We see them in a series of shots --
           The ATRIUM: NRA members stream through the doors. Then --

           A long, narrow EXHIBITION HALL lined with booths:

           One for the BLACK PANTHERS, dressed in their self-styled
           military garb and chatting amicably with white passersby.

           A MAN in full Revolutionary War garb shows off some period
           weaponry in another booth.

           Even a booth for Handloader Magazine, a tired-looking
           EMPLOYEE manning it.

           The interior of the CONVENTION HALL itself: rows upon rows
           of folding chairs, and still more being set up.

           Up on the dais, Max Rich looks out upon his kingdom, flanked
           by American flags and framed by the seal of the NRA.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION-EXHIBITION CENTER - ATRIUM - DAY

           The airy entryway, one wall of which is all glass. The
           Federation members stand in a sea of people, who part like
           water to move around them. Carter stands in the center.

                                 CARTER
                        Alright everybody, walkies on.

           Everyone in the group has a walkie talkie. They switch them
           on as Aquilino hands out BLAZE ORANGE HATS: their uniform.

                                 KNOX
                        Everybody has the manifesto?

           Affirmative murmurs from the gathered Federation members.
           Wayne LaPierre holds his copy up: several stapled pages.

                                 METAKSA
                        Oh, I almost forgot --

           Metaksa opens her purse and pulls out a stack of her KEEP
           RIFLE IN NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION buttons. She hands one
           to Carter, who grins at her.

                                 CARTER
                        Very nice.

           The Federation members pin their buttons to their chests.

                                 CARTER
                        Everybody ready?

           A chorus of "yes."

                     KNOX
           Alright, let's --
                                                     CARTER
                                            Let's get to it! Fan out!

           Knox shoots Carter a glare, but nobody notices. They all put
           their orange hats on their heads and --

           Spread out into the crowd. A brief beat of them all walking
           in SLOW MOTION in a line, the other NRA members giving them
           plenty of space for their cool group walking shot.

           INT. CONVENTION HALL - DAY

           Up on the dais, Max Rich adjusts the podium and glances back
           at IRVINE C. PORTER (66), a straight-and-narrow lawyer with
           an Alabama drawl who's fiddling with some audio cables.

                                 RICH
                        Hey, Irv.

                                he looks up
                                           )
                        I want you to keep a real tight rein
                        on the voting tonight. No weird shit,
                        got it?

                                 PORTER
                        What kind of weird shit you
                        expectin', sir?

                                 RICH
                        I'm not sure yet. Just -- keep things
                        moving, would you?

                                 PORTER
                        Things ain't gonna move at all if I
                        can't get this mic workin', sir.

           Porter approaches the podium, and Rich awkwardly steps out
           of his way.

                                 RICH
                        Oh, sorry.
           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION-EXHIBITION CENTER - HALL - DAY

           The narrow exhibition hall, lined with booths. Carter and
           LaPierre cut through the crowd, Carter pointing at a large
           cluster of men.

                                 CARTER
                        You said you wanted to learn how it's
                        done? Watch a master work, kid.

           Carter strolls toward the group with a big grin on his face.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Excuse me, gentlemen, can I have a
                        moment of your time?

           LaPierre stands there watching. He glances to one side and
           sees Aquilino laughing it up at the Black Panthers' booth.
           He blinks at the spectacle, unsure what he's looking at.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION-EXHIBITION CENTER - HALL - DAY

           Elsewhere, Hammer and Metaksa have cornered an NRA WOMAN,
           one of very few in the room.

           Knox, Arnett, and Tartaro scope out their battleground from
           the back of the room, watching Rich and Porter on the dais.

           Knox strolls up the center aisle, leaving Arnett and Tartaro
           to look at each other nervously.

                        idea if it was gonna be enough to
                        unseat Max Rich and his Old Guard.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - EVENING

           Later. The chairs are quickly filling up, NRA members of all
           stripes streaming in and jostling for position. The
           Federation's orange hats are scattered throughout the crowd.

           Carter finds his place up near the front of the room. Arnett
           saunters up and takes a seat next to him.

                                 ARNETT
                        Mind if I join you?

           Carter nods his approval.

           A hush comes over the crowd as Porter steps up to the mic.
           It WHINES, making the collected membership wince.

           Behind him, the ENTIRE BOARD sits in a row of chairs. On one
           side, a row of MEN in Revolutionary War uniforms and
           triangle hats stand at attention with period rifles.

                                 PORTER
                        Sorry. Sorry. Um, please find your
                        seats. We are about to begin.
           Down on the floor, Hammer and Metaksa scan the crowd. Hammer
           elbows Metaksa and points at another WOMAN.

                                 HAMMER
                        Got one!

                                 METAKSA
                        Nah, we talked to her already.

                                 PORTER
                        Okay. Good evening, everyone.

           Mumbled "good evenings," like we're in church.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        Hi. My name is Irv Porter, and I'll
                        be your master of ceremonies for the
                        evening. I'd first like to welcome
                        everyone to the National Rifle
                        Association's Annual Meeting of the
                        Members. The NRA has been going
                        strong for one hundred and six years
                        now, and the past year was our best
                        one yet. Some highlights...

           As he talks, Metaksa eyes Knox as he strolls up the center
           aisle. He finds a seat on the edge near the front.

           APPLAUSE, and we're back on the dais with Porter.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        I'd now like to welcome to the podium
                        President Merrill Right, who will
                        lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

           Right steps up to the podium. Clears his throat.

                                 RIGHT
                        Let us now honor America by reciting
                        the Pledge of Allegiance.

           The whole room stands, hands over their hearts.

                                 EVERYONE
                        I pledge allegiance to the flag of
                        the United States of America.

           Down in the crowd, Knox's eyes take in each mic: one stage
           left, one stage right, one front and center, and one in the
           center aisle toward the back.
                                 EVERYONE (cont'd)
                        And to the republic for which it
                        stands, one nation under God,
                        indivisible, with liberty and justice
                        for all.

           The Revolutionary War guys snap into action, FIRING blanks
           into the air to honor America. In the crowd, Wayne LaPierre
           jumps, startled.

                                 RIGHT
                        And now, a welcome message from our
                        Executive Vice President, General
                        Maxwell E. Rich.

           As Rich steps up to the mic, we hear a few BOOS scattered in
           with the applause. Rich looks up sharply, perturbed.

                                 RICH
                        Good -- um, good evening. Welcome to
                        Cincinnati. The jewel of Ohio!

           A few native Ohioans applaud. Someone in the back coughs.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        We're very pleased to see the largest
                        ever turnout for a Meeting of the
                        Members! This year marks a great
                        turning point for the NRA. Tonight,
                        we're going to be discussing some
                        changes that will see our
                        organization leading the way into a
                        safer, stronger, and better future
                        for firearms in America.

           Again, scattered applause. Carter SNORTS derisively.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        Before we get into all of that, we'd
                        like to first allow members to bring
                        up any points of order they would
                        like to discuss. Irv?

                               to(
                                 CARTER
                                   himself)
                        Here we go.

           Rich steps aside and Porter once again takes the mic.

                                 PORTER
                        There are four microphones on the
                        floor.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        If there are any items you would like
                        placed on the agenda, now is the
                        time. Please keep statements brief
                        and on-topic.

           Carter and Knox both go at the same time. Carter is closer
           to the front-most mic than Knox, but Arnett stands in his
           way, taking up the whole aisle.

                                 CARTER
                        Pardon me, Ray.

           Arnett pretends not to hear as --

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Hey. Ray --

           Knox throws a smug look at Carter as he hurries to the mic.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        What the fuck're you doin'?

           Knox reaches out. Grabs the mic. A subtle WHINE of feedback,
           and Neal Knox wins the first round.

                                 KNOX
                        Hello. My name is Clifford Neal Knox,
                        I'm the editor-in-chief of Handloader
                        and Rifle magazines.

                                 CARTER
                        What the goddamn hell you think
                        you're doin', Ray?

                                 ARNETT
                        Oh, I'm sorry! You were trying to --
                        geez, my apologies, Harlon.

           Carter growls, but calms down a bit as Knox continues,
           leaning into his Texas drawl for effect.

                                 KNOX
                        I wanna read something for all of
                        y'all tonight.

           He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled piece of
           paper. Clears his throat. Then --

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Hell, I don't even need to read it. I
                        got this memorized.

           He tosses the paper over his shoulder.
                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        "A well regulated militia, being
                        necessary to the security of a free
                        state, the right of the people to
                        keep and bear arms shall not be
                        infringed."
                               (
                                APPLAUSE, then
                                              )
                        Shall. Not. Be. Infringed. Now, let's
                        talk about a little law that was
                        passed in 1968.

           A few more scattered BOOS in the crowd.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Damn right, boo. Boo to a general
                        prohibition on interstate firearms
                        sales. Boo to mandated licenses for
                        gun merchants. Boo to the ban on
                        Saturday Night Specials. Those things
                        sure sound a helluva like
                        infringements to me. How about you?

           CHEERS and affirmations from the crowd.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        But it's all just fine and dandy with
                        Max Rich and Merrill Right! They want
                        the NRA to give up on politics. They
                        want to abandon the Second Amendment
                        to the whims of big government so
                        they can build vacation homes in
                        Colorado. What say you to that?

           Louder BOOS from the crowd. Up on the dais, Right glances at
           Rich, nervous. Rich remains stoic.

                                 PORTER
                        Would the gentleman please make his
                        proposal and leave the microphone?

                                 KNOX
                        Damn right, I'll make my proposal. In
                        fact, I've written a series of
                        fifteen proposals to save the NRA.

                                 CARTER
                                      )
                               (
                                snorts
                        He's written?

                                 PORTER
                        One proposal per member, please.
                                 KNOX
                        Alright. That's fine.

           Knox makes eye contact with Arnett and points at the other
           microphones around the room, trying to be subtle about it.
           Arnett pulls out his walkie and heads to the nearest mic.

           Carter sees him leave, glowers, and slips out of his seat.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        My first proposal: to change the
                        NRA's nonprofit certification to
                        501(c)4. This would allow membership
                        to vote the out-of-touch old guard
                        the hell out!

           ROARS of approval from the crowd. In the aisle, Carter
           pauses, soaking in the cheers.

                                 CARTER
                        Holy shit.

           On the dais, Porter turns and looks at Rich. He's frozen.

                                 PORTER
                               (
                                into mic, confused
                                                  )
                        Um, we cannot change the nonprofit
                        status of the NRA right now. That
                        requires significant paperwork --

                                 KNOX
                        Prepared and ready to file first
                        thing in the morning.

                                 PORTER
                        Um, alright. The uh, the proposal is
                        to change the NRA's nonprofit filing
                        status to 501(c)4 to allow for a
                        strengthened role for membership. Is
                        there anyone who would like to speak
                        against this?

           A hush falls over the crowd. Porter looks back at Rich,
           panic in his eyes. Right starts to stand, but Rich grabs his
           arm and pulls him back.

                                 RICH
                        How're you gonna speak against
                        democracy, Merrill?

           Chastened, Right sits back down.
                                 PORTER
                        Um, alright. Those in favor say aye.

           The "Ayes!" echo thunderously from all corners of the room.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        Those opposed say nay.

           The "Nays!" are hugely outnumbered. Porter, wide-eyed,
           glances back at Rich again. Rich grinds his teeth.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        The uh -- the ayes have it. Motion
                        passed.

           BANG. He slams his GAVEL on the podium.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        Next proposal?

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           The elder Metaksa smiles into the camera, supremely
           satisfied. She shakes a toothpick out of its container.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA
                        Alright. Listen, I know parliamentary
                        procedure isn't thrilling stuff. It's
                        boring as hell and -- y'know what,
                        screw it. I'm just gonna let Aquilino
                        handle it. Take it away, John.

           INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - OUTSIDE OF TIME

           Behind Aquilino, the chalkboard is scrawled with terms,
           names, and a massive web of crisscrossing arrows connecting
           everything. It looks like the work of a madman.

                               (
                                sarcastic
                                 AQUILINO
                                         )
                        Gee, thanks Tanya.
                                then
                               (
                                    )
                        What you just saw was the membership
                        of the NRA voting to give themselves
                        power to elect their own leaders, who
                        used to be elected by the Board.

           Using a pointer stick, he points to MEMBERS, LEADERS, and
           OLD GUARD ASSHOLES (AKA the Board) on the chalkboard.

                                 AQUILINO (cont'd)
                        So now that we've got that power, we
                        have to vote to --
           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - EVENING

           Tartaro on the mic now.

                                 TARTARO
                        Restore the Institute for Legislative
                        Action to the number of employees it
                        had prior to November, 1976!

           A thunderous round of "AYE!"

           A BANG of the gavel.

           INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - OUTSIDE OF TIME

           Aquilino again.

                                 AQUILINO
                        Then we gotta bat a little cleanup.
                        Stuff like --

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - EVENING

           Hammer takes the floor this time.

                                 HAMMER
                        Abolishing the corrupt NRA management
                        committee in favor of more power for
                        the membership!

           "AYE!"

           BANG.

           Merrill Right pales, looking like he might barf.

           INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - OUTSIDE OF TIME

           As he talks, Aquilino tries to follow his own story with the
           pointer, tracing the maze of lines on the chalkboard.

                                 AQUILINO
                        So we're voting on the right to vote,
                        voting to vote out the old guard,
                        then voting their ideas down and
                        voting to nominate new people, and...

           He's lost his place on the chalkboard.

                                 AQUILINO (cont'd)
                        And it's -- it's just, listen. You
                        get it. It's a lot of voting. It's
                        just a lot of voting, and --
                                 (MORE)
                                 AQUILINO (cont'd)
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Seriously, Tanya? Neal got to do the
                        grassy knoll and Joe got that guy's
                        face blown away and I get this shit?
                        What gives?

           There's no answer from off-screen. Aquilino scoffs and
           stomps off the lecture hall set in a huff.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           Present-day Metaksa looks uncomfortable, shifts. Then --

                                 METAKSA
                        Oookay. Moving on, I guess. With the
                        passage of that preliminary shit all
                        taken care of, it was time for Carter
                        to strike a real blow.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - EVENING

           Carter stands at the mic closest to the dais so he can look
           Max Rich in the eye. He clears his throat.

                                 CARTER
                        Harlon Bronson Carter, NRA President,
                        1965 to 1967, ILA Executive Director,
                        1975 until... well, some bullshit.
                                TITTERS in the crowd
                               (
                                                    )
                        I'd like to bring up a temporary
                        moratorium on all expenditures on
                        facilities in Colorado. These plans
                        are fraudulent, corrupt, and
                        compromised by our leadership.

           MURMURS throughout the crowd. Metaksa watches, rapt.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Oram International is a fund-raising
                        consulting firm with no stake in our
                        Association or our mission. But when
                        they came to Max Rich and the Board
                        and told them to tone down our stance
                        on the Second Amendment and -- and --
                        limit shooting at our new Olympic-
                        level shooting center, Rich and his
                        sycophants said --
                               (
                                mocking tone
                                            )
                        "Sure thing, boss! Anything for more
                        money!" They sold you out.

           A mixture of BOOS and applause from the crowd. Onstage --
                               (
                                to Right
                                 RICH
                                        )
                        How the hell does he know about Oram?

                                 CARTER
                        No more money spent in Colorado or
                        New Mexico. Not one dime until we are
                        assured that the NRA will focus on
                        protecting the Second Amendment
                        rights of every single American.

           CHEERS.

                                 PORTER
                        Okay. The proposal is for a temporary
                        moratorium on spending for projects
                        underway in New Mexico and Colorado.
                        Is there anyone who would like to
                        speak against this proposal?

           On the dais, Rich gives Merrill Right a look. Right sighs,
           stands, and takes the mic.

                                 RIGHT
                        Hello, Mr. Carter.
                               (
                                clears throat
                                             )
                        Merrill Right, NRA president. It has
                        never been the NRA's mission to deal
                        in politics --

                                into mic
                                 CARTER
                                        )
                               (
                        Oh, come on --

                                 RIGHT
                        Please, Mr. Carter. You had your
                        chance to speak.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Furthermore, Harlon Carter and Neal
                        Knox believe that anyone should be
                        able to carry any gun they please.
                        They're extremists. So if you think
                        every criminal should be able to get
                        their hands whatever firearm he
                        wants, by all means vote vote with
                        them. That's what they're fighting
                        for. But that's not who we are.

           Right steps back from the mic as THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE fills
           the room. Knox is red-faced, furious.
                                 KNOX
                        That's -- that's goddamn libel!
                        That's libel!

           Behind him, a MAX RICH LOYALIST scoffs.

                                 MAX RICH LOYALIST
                        You don't even know what that word
                        means, do you?

                                 KNOX
                        I'll show you exactly what I know,
                        you motherfuckin' --

           A FEDERATION SUPPORTER beside Neal grabs his arm --

                                 FEDERATION SUPPORTER
                        Whoa, whoa! Hey!

           Knox steps down, still fuming, and scowls at the loyalist.

           On the dais, Right settles in beside Rich --

                                 RICH
                        Nice work.

           Right nods his thanks.

                                 PORTER
                        Okay. All those in favor, say aye.

           "AYE!"

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        Those opposed say nay.

           "NAY!"

           A pause. The two responses were almost identical in volume.
           Porter glances at Rich, unsure. Then back to the mic --

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        I um -- the nays have it.

                                 CARTER
                        Bullshit!

           The crowd ERUPTS.

           Knox turns back to the Rich loyalist behind him and tries to
           take a swing, but the Federation supporter catches his arm.
           Carter looks over to the Federation as he pulls his walkie
           talkie from his pocket. He holds it up.

           Metaksa sees this and pulls out her own walkie. Channel
           three. She hits the button.

                               (
                                into walkie
                                 METAKSA
                                           )
                        Everyone, keep it going. Keep it
                        loud, push for a re-vote!

                                 HAMMER
                        RE-VOTE! RE-VOTE! RE-VOTE!

           Off in another part of the crowd, Aquilino lowers his walkie
           and takes up the chant --

                                 AQUILINO
                        RE-VOTE! RE-VOTE!

           He turns to the people around him: Black Panthers.

                                 AQUILINO (cont'd)
                        C'mon man, you gonna let them get
                        away with this shit?
                               (
                                    )
                                then
                        RE-VOTE! RE-VOTE!

           The Panthers start chanting, too.

           Even LaPierre, positioned toward the back, chants quietly as
           he nods his encouragement at those nearby.

                                 LAPIERRE
                        Re-vote. Re-vote. Re-vote.

           On the dais, Porter is bewildered. The fuming Rich finally
           stands and stalks over to him, gets in his ear.

                                 RICH
                        For Christ's sake, just do it a-
                        fucking-gain!

           Porter nods, swallows, leans into the mic.

                                 PORTER

                                bangs gavel
                                           )
                        Okay. Okay! Quiet please, everyone!
                        Or -- order!
                               (
                        Order! Order!

           At last, the crowd quiets.
                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        We'll vote again.

           JEERS from Rich loyalists. Some FEDERATION FAN in the
           audience shouts --

                                 FEDERATION FAN
                        You're goddamn right!

                               (
                                Shut up!
                                 PORTER
                                        )
                        Alright!
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        All those in favor say aye.

           A deafening "AYE!!!" from the crowd.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        Those opposed, say nay.

           "NAY!" Notably quieter than the ayes this time.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        The ayes have it. The motion passes.

           Porter BANGS the gavel. The Federation members and their
           supporters erupt into cheers. Metaksa and Hammer hug. Carter
           grins and shakes hands.

           Knox flashes a trolling grin at the Rich loyalist.

           On the dais, Rich glares at the crowd for a moment, then
           stalks off --

                                 RIGHT
                        Max? Max!

           And out a side door to a --

           BACK HALLWAY

           Dim, dingy. He turns a corner, moving with purpose.

                                 RICH
                        Hello?
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Hello?

           He turns another corner and there he is: a JANITOR taking a
           break from mopping, smoking, leaning against the wall.

                        Huh?

           Rich takes out his wallet, fumbling with it as he pulls out
           a wad of cash.

                                 RICH
                        Where are the controls for the air
                        conditioning?

           He holds up the wad: all hundreds. The janitor is impressed.

                        Alright, full disclosure: all we know
                        is that the AC broke down in the
                        convention hall on the hottest day of
                        the year. We don't know for sure that

           Rich strides back onto the dais and sits beside Right, who's
           fanning himself with a piece of paper.

           They watch as Porter tries to wrest control of the voting
           from Aquilino, who's at a floor mic.

                                 RIGHT
                        Jesus, it's hot in here.

                        Where'd you go?

                                 RICH
                        Don't worry about it.

           At the podium, Porter has calmed Aquilino and the crowd.

                                 PORTER
                        The proposal is to hold a vote for

                        Garcelon. Any nominations?

           No one volunteers. Rich scans the lineup of the Board. His
           eyes land on THOMAS BILLINGS (55), overweight, balding.
                                 RICH

           Billings looks confused.

                        Just -- take as long as you can. We

                                 BILLINGS
                        O -- okay.

           Billings hustles to the podium. Porter steps aside.

                        Thomas Billings, Vice President of

           Down in the crowd, Knox fans himself with his copy of the
           manifesto and checks his watch. It's nearly 11PM. He slides
           out of his seat and heads for the door at the back.

           From his seat, Carter watches Knox go, then gets up to
           follow. As he strides down the aisle --

           Metaksa spots the brewing confrontation and follows Carter
           out into the --

           A few NRA members hang out in the relative cool of the
           atrium as Knox strides through. One of them, wearing a
           COWBOY HAT, calls out --

                                 COWBOY NRA MEMBER
                        Good goin', Mr. Knox!

                                 KNOX
                        Yeah, thanks.

           He keeps walking, his eyes on a set of VENDING MACHINES
           against the far wall.

           He PLINKS some quarters into one before noticing --

           All of the little "Empty" lights are lit up next to every
           single option. Same with every other vending machine.
                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Fuck.

           He hits the coin return button: nothing.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Fuck!

           He BANGS on a machine, turns, and --

           Finds himself face to face with Carter.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 CARTER
                        Aw, sorry. Didn't mean to scare you.

                                 KNOX
                        It's -- fine.

                                 CARTER
                        Goin' pretty good in there, huh?

                                 KNOX
                        Seems to be. Listen, if you're
                        lookin' for a Coke, they're all out.

                                 CARTER
                        Nah, I ain't lookin' for a Coke. I
                        actually wanted to ask you -- when
                        you got up there on the mic, you said
                        you wrote that manifesto. Yourself.

                                 KNOX
                        Well, I did. I typed it up --

                                 CARTER
                        Using points we devised.

                                 KNOX
                        But you didn't write it.

                                 CARTER
                        That's not what I'm sayin' and you
                        know it.

                                 KNOX
                        Then what are you saying?

           Carter studies Knox for a moment. Leans in --
                                 CARTER
                        I know you been tellin' our friends
                        stories about me. About the Border
                        Patrol. Maybe even before that.

           Knox freezes for a beat -- he wasn't expecting this. He
           tries to shrug it off with a little LAUGH --

                                 KNOX
                        Aw, c'mon Harlon --

           LAREDO, 1931. Young Harlan stands, shotgun pointed at Ramón
           Casiano's chest. Ramón's LAUGHING, just like Knox.

           Ramón pulls a SWITCHBLADE from his pocket and flicks it open
           in a single smooth, practiced motion.

           Harlan's finger tenses on the trigger, and --

           BAM! Carter's fist SLAMS into the vending machine.

                                 CARTER
                        Don't. Lie to me.

           Knox suddenly looks terrified. Carter is much bigger than
           him, and much more experienced when it comes to violence.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        We were in this together, right? We
                        started this whole goddamn thing. And
                        now you're in there pullin' a Brutus,
                        and I can't for the life of me figure
                        out the hell why.

                        You told Ray to stop me from gettin'

                        everyone and make your big damn
                        speeches, soaking in the glory,
                        taking it all for yourself, and you
                        promise me, me, the man who came up
                        with this whole fucking plan, that
                        I'll be allowed, by the grace of
                        Harlon Carter, an executive position
                        when all's said and done?

           Knox, having built up a full head of steam, leans in, gets
           in Harlon's face, full of venom --

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        I don't want an executive position. I
                        want the executive position, because
                        I'm the best goddamn man for the job.
                        Not least of all because I'm not a
                        murderer or a criminal.

           Carter takes a step back, considering. Nods. Sniffs. Then --

           Winds up and THROWS A FUCKIN' PUNCH at Knox, who --

           Does an awkward half-dodge, half-block, avoiding the blow.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        Fuck --

                        Harlon! Harlon!

           She races onto the scene and grabs Harlon's beefy arm before
           he can take another swing.

                                 METAKSA
                        Stop it! Stop it! For Chrissake!

           She gets between the two, instantly diffusing the threat of
           physical conflict.

                                 METAKSA (cont'd)
                        You're on the same damn side, you
                        morons!

           Carter and Knox glower at each other.

                        Honestly, I don't give a fuck anymore

                        your dicks put a stop to what's about
                        to happen in there, I will personally
                        cut 'em off. Okay?

                        Okay.

           She strides off in a huff. A tense beat. And when Carter
           speaks, he's convincing himself as much as Knox.

                                 CARTER

                        for the post?

           Hammer is on a floor mic.

                        I'd like to nominate Joseph Tartaro,
                        life member of the NRA.

           As the voting continues, Carter slips in at the back and
           makes his way back toward his seat down a side aisle.

           On the dais, Rich spots him. He quickly dismounts from the
           stage and stalks toward him.

                        Hey, Max --

           Too late. Again. Rich approaches Carter, a full head of

                        Nah. We ain't done. Just you watch.

           Carter brushes past Rich and heads back toward his seat as
           the resigned Porter keeps the voting going --

                                 PORTER
                        Alright. Joseph Tartaro is the new
                        Vice President for Finance.

                                 RICH
                        Goddammit.

           Carter slides back into his seat beside Arnett.

                                 ARNETT
                        Joe just won.

           Another light TAP of the gavel.

                        Nine. Hours. That's how long floor
                        debate and voting went on. Ousting
                        every single Board member.

                                 PORTER
                        The proposal is to hold a vote for
                        the position of First Vice President,
                        currently occupied by Mr. Irvine

           Porter TAPS the gavel.

                                 PORTER
                        The gentleman from New York is
                        elected First Vice President.

           A middle-aged FEDERATION MEMBER shakes hands with those
           around him.

                                 PRESENT-DAY METAKSA

           "AYE."

           TAP goes the gavel.

                        And over.

           Sweat-soaked folks fan themselves, an exercise in futility.
           But no one leaves: the place is still just as packed as when
           this marathon began.

           "AYE."

           TAP goes the gavel.

                        We just had one thing left to do.
           EXT. A LEAF - DAY

           The little spider creeps closer than ever to the fly. Its
           legs tense, ready to pounce.

                        Get the hell rid of Max Rich.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - NIGHT

           Dark circles under his eyes, sweat soaking his hair and
           shirt, Porter grips the sides of the podium to stay upright.

                                 PORTER
                        Are there any other proposals our
                        members would like to bring forward?

           He looks around. No one on the microphones.

           At the back of the room, Knox looks around frantically for
           his cohorts.

           Arnett is asleep in his chair.

           Tartaro is chatting with a couple of supporters.

           Neither is paying any attention.

           Knox springs into action and hurries toward a mic.

                                 PORTER (cont'd)
                        Anyone? I think we're all more than
                        ready to call it a night.

           Knox is working against a crowd of people standing in the
           aisles, fanning themselves --

                                 KNOX
                        No. No --

           And he emerges from the other side of that crowd near a mic.
           He reaches for it, and --

           Someone steps in front of him. Takes the mic.

           It's Bob Kukla. In a blaze orange hat.

           Knox stops cold, confused. Kukla was never a part of the
           Federation. Never a part of his plan.

           Kukla glances across the room and makes eye contact with
           Carter. Carter nods back at him.
                                 KUKLA
                        Um, Bob Kukla, Executive Director of
                        the Institute for Legislative Action.

           Rich sits up in his chair, alarmed.

                                 KUKLA (cont'd)
                        I would like to um, I'd like to
                        propose a vote by membership for the
                        position of Executive Vice President.

           Murmurs ripple through the exhausted crowd as --

           Kukla starts to pull something from his pocket.

                                 KUKLA (cont'd)
                        I believe that Maxwell Rich is unfit
                        to represent the interests of the
                        majority of the gathered members. And
                        um, this is why.

           A HANDHELD TAPE RECORDER. He holds it up to the mic.

           Rich sees it and almost topples out of his chair.

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Kukla stands just outside the door to the boardroom,
           recorder in hand. Through the door, muffled --

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        Oram International, the consultants
                        Tom brought on, tell us fundraising
                        should increase significantly as long
                        as we limit the use of firearms --

           Kukla hits RECORD, slips the device into his pocket, and
           walks into the --

           BOARDROOM

           Where the whole Board looks at him.

                                 RICH
                        Bob?

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - NIGHT - END FLASHBACK

           Kukla holds the tape recorder up to the mic as the recording
           finishes playing out.

                                 RICH (TAPE)
                        Get the fuck out!
           Kukla hits STOP and --

           The crowd goes NUTS. People SCREAM. Empty soda cans from the
           vending machines are HURLED onto the stage. These sweaty,
           exhausted people are suddenly fully tuned in again.

           Rich stands, almost charges off the stage and into Kukla
           before Right grabs him and holds him back.

                                 RICH
                        What -- what the fuck! Bob, you son
                        of a bitch! You backstabbing piece of
                        fucking shit --

                                 RIGHT
                        Max! Max! C'mon!

           Porter ducks a flying can, yells into the mic --

                                 PORTER
                        Pl -- please! Please! Let's --

                                       )
                        ORDER, GODDAMMIT!

           At last the crowd starts to settle down.

                        Yeah. That really happened. Little
                        old Bob Kukla and the enormous brass
                        balls swingin' in his trousers really
                        did that shit.
                               (
                                chuckles
                                        )
                        Lord, what a night.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - NIGHT

           Back to Porter on the mic.

                                 PORTER
                        Alright! Would you like to nominate
                        anyone for the position, Mr. Kukla?

                                 KUKLA
                        Um, yes I would.

           Behind Kukla, Knox watches, sweating profusely, fists balled
           at his sides, desperately hoping for some kind of miracle.
                                 KUKLA (cont'd)
                        I'd like to nominate Harlon Carter,
                        former president of the NRA and
                        former Executive Director of the ILA.

           Scattered APPLAUSE. On the dais, Rich is apoplectic.

           Over by Carter, Arnett sees Knox scowling.

                                 ARNETT
                        Shit.

           He starts making his way toward Knox as, on the mic, Kukla
           makes the case for Carter in a surprisingly impassioned
           speech for such an anxious, unassuming man.

                                 KUKLA
                        Harlon Carter put up with the
                        poisonous, uncaring, and frankly
                        unpatriotic attitude of our Executive
                        Vice President for two years at the
                        ILA, and when Rich stabbed him in the
                        back, he gave up his job and a steady
                        paycheck to fight for us. That's who
                        Harlon Carter is.

           A HUGE OVATION from the crowd. Kukla looks over at Carter,
           who soaks it in with a huge grin on his face.

                                 PORTER
                        I'll take it the nomination is
                        seconded.
                               (
                                crowd CHEERS
                                            )
                        Any other nominations?

                                 RICH
                        Yes.

           Rich stands, smooths out his suit jacket, and approaches the
           podium. Porter stands aside.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        I'd like to nominate myself.
                               (
                                crowd BOOS
                                          )
                        Harlon Carter, Neal Knox... Bob
                        Kukla, these men, they claim they're
                        trying to protect your rights. But
                        really, my friends, they are afraid.
                        Of the government, of their
                        neighbors. Their own friends. And
                        they want you to be afraid, too.
           The gathered members slowly start sitting up straighter,
           paying attention as Rich makes a compelling case.

                                 RICH (cont'd)
                        It was General Ambrose Burnside
                        himself who created this
                        organization. Not to fight against
                        the government or his neighbors, but
                        to support them. To protect them.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           1871. A green, grassy field. AMBROSE BURNSIDE (47), with his
           killer sideburns/mustache combination and full military
           regalia, walks along a lineup of --

           YOUNG MEN firing rifles at straw targets.

                                 RICH (V.O.)
                        He wanted to teach American boys to
                        shoot straight, so should the need
                        for war ever arise again, they could
                        more readily defend America from all
                        enemies, foreign and domestic.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           1950. An NRA INSTRUCTOR walks along a lineup of young men
           firing more modern rifles into paper targets.

                                 RICH (V.O.)
                        And for generations, that's what we
                        have done. We have taught
                        marksmanship, gun safety, and gun 
                        maintenance to law-abiding Americans.

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - NIGHT

           Back with Rich at the podium.

                                 RICH
                        We have never been a political
                        organization. To become one now,
                        well... we wouldn't be the NRA
                        anymore. Not one I'd recognize, and
                        not one I want to be a part of.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        We're at a crossroads here, folks.
                        Please. Make the right choice.

           Rich steps down. APPLAUSE fills the room. On the floor, the
           smile has disappeared from Carter's face.
           Porter approaches the podium as --

           Knox heads for the floor mic Kukla just vacated, but --

           Arnett grabs him before he gets there.

                                 ARNETT
                        Neal, don't do this.

                                 KNOX
                        Lemme go.

                                 ARNETT
                        You're gonna split the damn vote! If
                        you nominate yourself, you could hand
                        the General a victory.

                                 KNOX
                        I said let me go.

           Arnett looks into Knox's resolute face and relents. Knox
           continues to the mic.

                                 PORTER
                        Does anyone second Mr. Rich's
                        nomination?

           Behind Porter, Right pipes up --

                                 RIGHT
                        Seconded!

                                 PORTER
                        Very well. Any further nominations?

           He spots Knox at the floor mic.

                                 KNOX
                        Yes. I would like to...

           Knox pauses. Clears his throat. Surveys the crowd. All eyes
           are on him, including Carter's. His expression is
           inscrutable. Knox sniffs.

                                 KNOX (cont'd)
                        I would like to endorse Harlon Carter
                        for the position.

           More applause and cheers. Carter smiles, and we --

           LAREDO, 1931. Ramón Casiano brandishes his knife with a
           cocky grin.

           Young Harlan's mouth twists into a snarl --

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - NIGHT - END FLASHBACK

                                 PORTER
                        Thank you, Mr. Knox. Mr. Carter's
                        nomination was already seconded. Any
                        further nominations?
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Very well. All those in favor of
                        Harlon Carter being appointed to the
                        position of Executive Vice President
                        of the NRA, say "aye."

           "AYE!!!!!!"

           The sound threatens to blow the roof off the place.

           Ramón's smile falters when he sees Harlan's expression. A
           moment of recognition: he knows what's about to happen.

           Shotgun aimed square at Ramón's chest, Harlan pulls the
           trigger and --

           INT. CINCINNATI CONVENTION HALL - NIGHT - END FLASHBACK

           BANG.

           Porter's gavel falls on the podium, and the eleven hundred
           gathered NRA members CHEER.

           Right leans over to Rich.
                                 RIGHT
                        What in the hell just happened?

                                 RICH
                        They took it. They just fucking took
                        it right out from under us.

           On the floor, Metaksa applauds and cheers --

                                 METAKSA
                        Speech! Speech! Speech!

           The crowd picks up the chant, THUNDERING, "SPEECH! SPEECH!"

           Feigning humility, Carter heads for the dais, mounting the
           steps. As he approaches --

           Rich gets out of his seat and stalks offstage, brushing by
           Carter, who gloats --

                                 CARTER
                        Bad luck, Max.

           Before heading to the podium, Carter goes to one of the
           Revolutionary War reenactors, who hands him his musket.

           Carter raises it above his head triumph. The crowd goes
           absolutely fucking bananas, and Carter's bullfrog smile is
           wider than it's ever been in his life.

           As the ovation slowly dies down, Carter takes the podium.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        Thank you, ladies and gentleman.
                        Thank you. I can't tell you what an
                        incredible honor this is. And I can
                        promise you this: with me as your
                        leader, there will be no more civil
                        war in the National Rifle
                        Association. There will be no more
                        compromise and no more gun control!

           The crowd ROARS rabidly, and their screams carry us to --

           EXT. A LEAF - DAY

           The spider LEAPS, and in extreme closeup it --

           Sinks its fangs into the fly's head. The fly scrambles, but
           can do nothing as the venom takes it over.

           The CHEERING of the crowd continues.
           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - MODERN DAY

           The present-day Metaksa just smirks into the camera,
           satisfied, a toothpick hanging from her lips.

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - DAY

           The wooden wall that, when Carter walked by it at the
           beginning of our story, was blank.

           Now, a JANITOR cleans the brand new shining stainless steel
           cursive lettering there. It reads --

                                 "...the right of the people
                                 to keep and bear arms,
                                 shall not be infringed."

           A broad, bald, besuited man strides by these words, carrying
           a duffle bag into the elevator.

           INT. NRA HEADQUARTERS - NEW ILA OFFICES - DAY

           The top floor of the building. Out the window, the hotel the
           old ILA offices were crammed into is visible.

           The new office is packed with shiny new computers, their
           tiny state-of-the-art CRT monitors glowing green.

           Smiling employees type, laugh, work. Metaksa is among them.
           Ray Arnett leads a smiling CONGRESSMAN in a suit out of his
           office. This is Harlon Carter's dream, and we --

           Drift through it, past a door reading EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
           NEAL KNOX, and out into a --

           HALLWAY

           Where we find Carter walking with purpose. He pauses at the
           door to the ILA office and looks in, smiling.

           Metaksa sees him and smiles back. Carter waves, then --

           Continues down the hallway and through a door into the --

           BOARDROOM

           Where the new Board of Directors awaits him. Knox is there,
           as is Tartaro. A group of new and familiar white male faces
           all look up as Carter enters and --

           THUNKS his duffle bag on the table. Unzips it. And pulls out
           his daddy's shotgun.
           He turns and carefully, reverently places it on a mount
           already installed on the wall above the door. Then --

           He goes to the head of the Board table. Clears his throat. A
           beat as the Board waits for Carter's first words as the
           unquestioned leader of the new NRA.

                                 CARTER
                        I hope you are all ready to fight
                        like hell, because we are never going
                        to win this.

           Carter's loyal soldiers look at one another, uncertain

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        There'll always be folks lookin' to
                        strip the Second Amendment from us.
                        Weak people scared of our freedoms.
                        Politicians tryin' to seize more
                        power. There's always gonna be
                        someone. So no, we're never gonna
                        win. But that's okay. Because victory
                        doesn't look like peace. Not for us.
                        For us, victory looks like war
                        without end. We give not one inch.
                        Not one. They'll throw everything
                        they got at us, and we'll stand
                        strong and tall. Because from here on
                        out, gentlemen, the NRA's got one
                        mission and only one mission: zero
                        gun legislation in America.

           Speech over, he takes his seat at the head of the table.

                                 CARTER (cont'd)
                        What do you say we get started?

                                                    SMASH TO BLACK.

           A beat. Then, a --

           SERIES OF SUPERS:

             In 1980, the NRA endorsed its first Presidential candidate:
                                   Ronald Reagan.

               His victory cemented the NRA's importance as a powerful
                                       lobby.

           In 1981, the public finally learned of Harlon Carter's fatal
                 shooting of fifteen-year-old Ramón Casiano in 1931.
            When the story hit the presses, his approval rating with NRA 
                               membership skyrocketed.

           These words fade. We wait in darkness for a beat, then --

           SERIES OF SUPERS:

             96 people per day are killed with firearms in America. Four
                    more died while you were watching this movie.

             There is a nearly 15% chance that one of those people was a
                                       child.

              Harlon Carter's NRA currently has over 5 million members.

           The little spider sinks its fangs into the fly and begins to
           feed. We watch for a moment.
