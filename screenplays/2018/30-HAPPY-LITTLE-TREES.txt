           Based on the true story of Bill Alexander and Bob Ross...

           ...and on imagination.
           East Prussia. 1927.

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY

           Half-muddy and trampled grass of a field that was once a
           farm, but no more. A broken fence stretches out toward a
           clump of trees and the shell of a long-abandoned farmhouse.

           Over this we hear LAUGHTER.

           A group of five BOYS chase each other with sticks in hand.

           Bringing up the rear is WILLIAM "BILL" ALEXANDER (12), short
           and stout with a joyous smile. He runs as fast as his stubby
           body can, chasing after his older brother PAUL (14).

           Everyone speaks German with English subtitles.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm gonna get you!

                               (
                                laughing
                                 PAUL
                                        )
                        You're too slow, Wim. You'll never
                        catch me!

           William pumps his arms faster trying to reach Paul, who's a
           few feet ahead. He starts to gain on him, or maybe his
           brother is letting him to catch up--

           Oops! William trips and crashes hard to the ground. Paul
           stops running, out of breath.

           The other boys notice and also stop. William gets up slowly
           from the fall.

                                 PAUL
                        You okay? What happened?

           Knees and palms muddy, William shakes it off.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm fine.

           He looks down to see what caused him to trip.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Look at this.

           Paul comes over to see what he's found. Sticking out of the
           mud are the rusted interlocking slats of old tread.

           Fascinated, William tries to pull it out of the ground. Paul
           tries to help, but it's no use. The tread is stuck.
                                 PAUL
                        Must be from an old tractor.

                                 OTHER BOY (O.S.)
                        Over here!

           They all turn to see a BOY holding a rusted HELMET. Another
           BOY finds a decaying RIFLE.

           Now William knows what he's found.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's a tank! There was a big battle
                        here in the war.

           The boys are excited now and hunt for more refuse. One finds
           a bayonet, another finds a second helmet.

           William and Paul pull on the tread like they're going to
           unearth the entire tank.

           Several yards away, another boy, FREDRICK (10), finds
           something that makes his eyes light up. He reaches down and
           picks up an old HAND GRENADE. He turns to show the others.

                                 FREDRICK
                        Look what I found!

           They all see Fredrick rearing back to throw the grenade.
           Everyone laughs, as Fredrick really makes a show of it--

           BOOM! The grenade explodes in Fredrick's hand, killing him
           instantly. The boys drop to the ground.

           But not William. He stands there, blood sprayed across his
           face, in complete shock.

           INT. KOCE STUDIO - DAY

           Costa Mesa, California. 1982.

           A small, functional studio with minimal lighting and years-
           old equipment. Welcome to PBS affiliate KOCE. If it looks
           like something from a college campus, that's because it is.

           An older WILLIAM ALEXANDER (60s, passionate, enthusiastic,
           wearing a blue smock) has the same wide-eyed look. He's in
           the middle of reliving the horrible memory.

           Which at this moment is a problem, because he's also in the
           middle of taping an episode of his PBS show, The Magic of
           Oil Painting.
           William stands before an easel with a painting of a lush
           green field with a long fence and tidy farmhouse. An
           idealized replica of the scene we just saw.

           William continues to stare, not saying a word.

           Off-screen, the DIRECTOR desperately gestures for him to
           snap out of it.

           Behind him is William's producer, DON GERDTS (30s), whose
           mustache and goatee make him look like an Errol Flynn
           villain. But he has a friendly face.

           The Director turns to Don and swipes his hand across his
           neck, asking if he should cut. Don looks worried, but
           gestures to keep rolling.

           William's wife, MARGARETE (50s, hard-nosed, pragmatic, often
           wears a red kerchief), has seen enough. She stamps out a
           cigarette and gets up from her chair.

           Margarete gets in William's eyeline and gives him a calming
           look. Her presence snaps him back to reality. He chuckles to
           cover up his lapse.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                slight
                                       German accent)
                        Ha, I spaced out there for a minute.
                        But that's okay, because when we
                        create we go deep into our
                        subconscious to find ideas. And when
                        we do, we grab hold of them-- and we
                        FIRE IN and put them on the canvas.

           Don sighs relief. The Director shakes his head. They're
           back. Margarete crosses her arms, her concern evident.

           On camera, William taps the brush on the canvas to create
           arcing green shapes on a black line that rises from the
           ground in the spot where Fredrick was killed.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We put some sap green on our one-inch
                        brush and we tap-tap-tap it like
                        this. Pitter-pat, pitter-pat-- like
                        so. Go ahead, say it out loud. It's
                        okay. Pitter-pat, pitter-pat. And now
                        we see... rising from the ashes... a
                        great, Almighty Tree.

           William does a few more pitter-pats and like magic creates a
           beautiful, almighty tree.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Just a few more happy branches like
                        so. There. Now we clean the brush and
                        mix some Alizarin crimson and cadmium
                        yellow for a nice orange, and we
                        pitter-pat some more. Isn't that
                        wonderful? The world can be such an
                        ugly place sometimes, but we can make
                        it beautiful and happy. All we need
                        is our imagination and some paint,
                        and we make it all go away.

           William finishes the tree with a flourish. He turns to the
           director, who's gesturing that time is up.

           William goes to put finishing touches on the canvas, but
           realizes he's out of time and throws up his hands.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And there is our beautiful painting.
                        Thank you for watching me. Bye bye.

           The Director holds for a beat.

                                 DIRECTOR
                        And... we're out.

           Williams slumps, as the lights go dark.

           The Director turns to Don.

                                 DIRECTOR
                               (
                                low
                                   )
                        Why didn't we cut? We can't air that.

                                 DON
                        It's okay. We'll do what we can in
                        post.

           The Director moves off. Don tries to approach William, but
           gets stopped by Margarete.

                               (
                                 MARGARETE
                                also a German accent
                                                    )
                        I'll handle it, Don.

                                 DON
                        Is he okay? He hasn't been himself
                        lately.

                                 MARGARETE
                        He's just tired. It's okay, don't
                        worry. It's the end of the season. He
                        always gets like this.
                                 DON
                        Okay, but if we can't fix that, we'll
                        have to retape. The network's already
                        on me for being over budget.

                                 MARGARETE
                        I said I'll handle it. It won't
                        happen again.

                                 DON
                        Let me know if he needs anything.

           Margarete nods her appreciation, as Don moves off. She
           turns, but sees William has already left the set.

           INT. WILLIAM'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Not really a dressing room. It's more of a converted supply
           room with a table and mirror set up in the corner. Racks of
           clothes and props occupy most of the space.

           William is in front of the mirror wiping off makeup.

           There's a QUICK KNOCK at the door and Margarete enters. We
           catch a glimpse of a gold star with Bill Alexander written
           in cursive on the door.

           She sits next to him, worried. William puts on a good face.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We do a good show today. One more and
                        we can finally take a break.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Are you okay? What happened out
                        there? People are getting worried.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who, Don? He worries about
                        everything. That's his job.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You were off in some dark place
                        again. What's going on?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's nothing. Really.

           William gives her a reassuring smile and wipes off the
           remaining makeup.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You can talk to me. Not as your
                        manager, but as your wife and friend.
                                 WILLIAM
                        What's to talk about? The show is
                        good. Lots of people watch and send
                        letters from all over the world. They
                        want to be happy painters like me.

           William faces himself in the mirror, but what he sees
           prompts him to quickly get up.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Where are you going?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll see you at home.

           William leaves.

           INT. HALLWAY - TV STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           William lumbers toward the exit, passing a cheery GRIP
           wearing a T-shirt that says I [Heart] PBS.

                                 PBS GRIP
                        Great show today, Bill!

           William smiles, again putting on a good face, but he says
           nothing in response and pushes through a door to leave.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Turning on the light, William enters carrying a bottle of
           whiskey and a glass. He pours and downs his drink, heading
           over to a vehicle covered with a large tarp.

           William grabs hold of the tarp and rips it down, revealing
           an old 1960 VOLKSWAGEN BUS in sad shape. It's covered in
           dirt, rusted in parts, and the windshield is cracked.

           Running a hand along the front edge, William stops at the
           passenger side door, which has the words The Ol' Magic from
           Faraway hand-painted on it.

           He smiles, his mind flooded with warm memories. He goes
           around the front and climbs into the driver's side.

           INSIDE THE BUS

           Cobwebs and dust. William sees the keys are still in the
           ignition. He takes a deep breath, coughs breathing in the
           dust, turns the key-- and nothing.

           BACK IN THE GARAGE

           William climbs out and lifts the hood, looking inside--
           there's no battery!
                                 WILLIAM
                        Shit!

           INT. ALEXANDER HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAYS LATER

           At a desk stacked with paper, Margarete crunches numbers on
           an adding machine with roll paper.

           Margarete looks at the numbers, not happy.

           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           William has his head buried in the hood of the van trying to
           replace the battery, referring to a book nearby. He has no
           idea what he's doing.

           Margarete comes outside with a sheet of paper in hand and
           sees what he's up to.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What in God's name are you doing?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Putting in a new battery.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You don't know how to do that.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm learning how.

           He checks the book one more time, as Margarete looks on, and
           goes to attach one of the cables to a fresh battery-- sparks
           fly! William jumps back. Margarete shakes her head.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Here.

           She hands him an accounting sheet.

                                 MARGARETE
                        This month's supply orders. Our
                        numbers are down again.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's okay, they pick up in summer.

                                 MARGARETE
                        They started going down last year and
                        haven't picked up since. Almost seven
                        months in row. We keep going, we'll
                        be in the red in a couple months.
                                 WILLIAM
                        We'll be fine. Lots of people buy our
                        supplies. Give it another month.

           Margarete sees there's no getting through to him.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What's the point of fixing this old
                        thing anyway?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I miss this old hunk of junk. You
                        remember that time we couldn't pay to
                        fix the damn thing when it broke down
                        in Arizona?

           Margarete rolls her eyes, but smiles at the memory.

                                 MARGARETE
                        That crazy tow truck driver nearly
                        killed us with his driving. But he
                        bought all your paintings.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Twenty five bucks a pop. Everything
                        was simpler then, wasn't it?

                                 MARGARETE
                        Simple, but harder.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why don't we go on the road, have
                        some happy times like the old days.

           Margarete looks down at their cracked driveway, which teems
           with numerous weeds.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Maybe we should keep focused on the
                        road we're on instead.

           She goes back into the house.

           INT. ALEXANDER HOME - WILLIAM'S STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

           A cozy studio stuffed with various landscapes piled
           everywhere. Several candles provide light.

           William sits in front of his easel drinking whiskey. On the
           canvas is an unfinished scene of a farmhouse near a field.
           Half the canvas remains blank.

           He stares at the picture deep in dark thoughts, his eyes
           fixated on the farmhouse.
           There's a spot of yellow paint in the window, indicating
           light inside. As we move in closer, the light seems to come
           alive, and we TRANSITION TO:

           INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           East Prussia. 1931.

           A fire FLICKERING in the fireplace of a damp one-room cabin.

           Young William, now 16, sits next to his MOTHER (40s), who
           lies in bed COUGHING BLOOD. She's dying of tuberculosis.

           William wipes the blood from her mouth with a rag. He's
           distraught and desperate for her to get better.

           His mother lifts a hand and pushes the rag away, not wanting
           his care. Off William's confusion, we TRANSITION BACK TO:

           INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO - LATE NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)

           With shaking hand, William puts the brush to the canvas. But
           the lingering memory causes him to freeze, and he lowers it
           back down. He can't finish.

           INT. KOCE STUDIO - NEXT DAY

           William is taping another episode. This time he paints a
           cabin in the woods. He loads his palette knife with a mix of
           red and brown paint.

           This time, however, his enthusiasm is muted and any effort
           he makes feels forced.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Now we paint a roof over here like
                        so. A happy little roof... happy
                        little hunting lodge. Now we can do a
                        happy little window there if you want
                        to. Just put some white paint on the
                        palette knife-- but don't make it
                        perfect. Leave something for the
                        imagination.

           William does a few emphatic downstrokes with the white
           paint, creating a window on the side of the cabin.

           As he continues, Don walks on set with a woman in a sharp
           suit, FAYE ANDERSON (late 30s, buttoned up, distant). She's
           a PBS executive, which we'll learn soon enough.

           Both stand near the director. Heads turn. Faye watches
           William perform with arms crossed, closely studying him.
           But William doesn't notice, as he leans in to put various
           touches on the cabin and starts to ramble.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        There. Now we can peek inside. I
                        wonder what goes on in there? Who's
                        inside? A hunter? Yes, he's all alone
                        in there... Now we build a second
                        roof for him. He likes to hide things
                        up there. Keep them nice and safe so
                        no one finds them. What could he hide
                        in there? A bottle?

           Margarete stamps out her cigarette, growing concerned. She
           knows where William is going, but can't stop him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And then we put a shadow underneath
                        there-- pull it down like so. Now
                        let's give him a happy chimney up
                        there. A long chimney. He used to be
                        a chimney builder and likes a high
                        chimney so he can fry his ham and
                        eggs-- but he doesn't have any. He
                        doesn't work anymore and has no money
                        for food. He's a drunk and spends all
                        his money on the bottle!

           Margarete looks on in quiet horror. Don cringes. Faye
           continues to watch, unreadable.

           The set is thick with tension. William still doesn't notice.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Such a nice home. Now we give him a
                        little shed. He keeps his lawnmower
                        in there. He used to clean his lawn,
                        but he doesn't do it anymore. He's
                        not there. He just got up and left--
                        we don't know where he went...

           William looks up as he cleans his brush, finally noticing
           Don and Faye. It's enough to snap him back to reality.

           William quickly turns to his palette and presses the brush
           in yellow paint, getting flustered.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Now we use a one inch brush... take a
                        good look how I do that, see-- the
                        yellow, and-- lots of paint, always
                        use lots of-- you want to highlight
                        this thing-- but it's got to have so
                        much paint or it won't work, you see?
           Faye gives Don a look. She's seen enough and leaves the
           studio. Margarete lights another cigarette.

           INT. DON'S OFFICE - DAY

           A messy office with a good view of a strip mall across the
           street. Behind his desk on a shelf is a DAYTIME EMMY AWARD.

           A sheepish Don sits with Faye, as William enters the room in
           good spirits. Margarete follows him in.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What a show! You see that? Such a
                        wonderful painting we do today.
                               (
                                to Faye
                                       )
                        Hi, Bill Alexander. And my wife,
                        Margarete.

           Faye stands, giving a thin smile as she extends her hand.

                                 FAYE
                        Faye Anderson. I'm the new VP of
                        programming in Arlington.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You came all the way from Virginia?
                        Isn't that wonderful.

           An uncomfortable beat.

                                 DON
                        Have a seat, Bill.

           William sits next to Faye. Margarete takes a seat on the
           couch behind her.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So what's this all about?

                                 DON
                        Well, I just wanted to say thank you
                        for another great season at KOCE.
                        Seven years. I can't believe it's
                        been that long, can you?

           Faye shifts, growing impatient. Don picks up the signal.

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Okay, so. The reason we're all here.
                        I've been told-- and I'm learning
                        this today... the network wants to
                        make a few changes to the show.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What changes?
                                 FAYE
                        We're canceling The Magic of Oil
                        Painting.

           William is in shock. The news renders him speechless,
           forcing Margarete to step in.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What do you mean canceled? Why?

                                 DON
                        Do you remember our conversations
                        about ratings and how they don't
                        matter with PBS, but actually they
                        really do?

                                 MARGARETE
                        This is bullshit. You can't do this.

                                 FAYE
                        We own the show, so we can. And I am
                        sorry. However, if you would just--

                                 MARGARETE
                        After all we've done for the network.
                        The hard work, free demonstrations--
                        we won an Emmy two years ago.

                                 FAYE
                        Ratings do matter. Yes, we're
                        publicly owned, but we have sponsors
                        and some haven't been happy lately.
                        And with Reagan, anything with the
                        word 'public' is facing budget cuts.

                                 MARGARETE
                        But we thought PBS is committed to a
                        painting series. It's always been one
                        of the most popular shows. I'm not
                        buying this scheisse about sponsors
                        and Reagan.

                                 FAYE
                        You're right. We are committed to
                        doing a painting series, and we'll
                        continue to have one. Unfortunately,
                        just not with Bill.

           That knocks William out of his state of shock.

                                 WILLIAM
                        ...You're replacing me?
                                 FAYE
                        We found someone else to do the show.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Someone else?

                                 FAYE
                        An artist who's... an inspiration. He
                        has this vibe that makes you feel
                        like everything's going to be okay. I
                        can't describe it. When I first saw
                        him I was in a--
                               (
                                catches herself
                                               )
                        Look, it doesn't matter. I knew right
                        away I had to put him on TV.

                                 DON
                        Not to mention he's younger and more
                        relatable to the audience-- not that
                        you aren't relatable, Bill.

                                 FAYE
                        We understand you've given a lot to
                        PBS and that's appreciated. But the
                        network has made it's decision.

           Margarete and William share a look. They're uncertain what
           to do, but in this together.

                                 DON
                        But there's good news.

                                 FAYE
                        Yes. As I've been trying to say,
                        we're prepared to make you an offer
                        in exchange for your help.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What kind of help?

           William gives her a look. Margarete wants to hear them out.

                                 FAYE
                        We want Bill to mentor our new
                        talent. Help him out with being on
                        TV. And in return we'll give you
                        another book series.

           William jumps up from his chair.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Mentor? Book series? Schiesse drauf!

           William leaves. Margarete gets up to follow. Don and Faye
           share a look, confused.
                                 MARGARETE
                        He'll think about it.

           She leaves.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           William pushes his way out of the front door near a busy
           intersection. Margarete is on his heels, equally as upset.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Can you believe that? A book series!
                        What are we going to do?

                                 MARGARETE
                        Take it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Are you joking? Why?

                                 MARGARETE
                        We can't make it on art supplies and
                        seminars alone.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Forget it, I won't do it.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What choice do we have? Go back on
                        the road and hawk paintings out of
                        the back of that old van? Like the
                        good old days? I'm not doing that
                        again. We have it good now.

           William paces, his mind starting to clear a little.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So we do another show then. Go to
                        another network, do a local series--

                                 MARGARETE
                        Who else is going to put you on TV?

                                 WILLIAM
                        What's wrong with seminars? We were a
                        good team. And it will be different
                        this time. People will come from
                        miles around. I have a name. Bill
                        Alexander is a name.

                                 MARGARETE
                        But for how much longer?
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGARETE (cont'd)
                               (
                                off William
                                           )
                        If you're not on TV anymore, people
                        will start to forget. At least the
                        book will help remind them.

           William stops pacing. That struck a chord.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll think of something.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A modest space with a Bohemian flair. Hung on one wall is a
           series of gold pans with painted landscapes, mainly snow
           covered mountains and forests.

           West coast jazz plays quietly in the background. Over that,
           someone happily HUMS along.

           Then a MAN enters the living room, but we only see him from
           behind. Just a large AFRO and a freckled hand reaching for
           the phone.

           Oh, and he's also completely naked.

           The man keeps HUMMING as he dials, bare ass prominent.

           INT. ALEXANDER HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Margarete is crunching numbers again, this time her stress
           really shows.

           The phone RINGS. She reaches behind her to answer.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Hello?

                                 MELLOW VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Hello, is Bill Alexander there?

           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           William works on the van again. Now he has a battery in
           place and the cables hooked up. He steps back wiping his
           hands and gets in.

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUS - SAME

           William inserts the keys and takes a breath. He turns it
           over-- and success! The van starts up. William is exuberant.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Look at that. Wonderful!
                                 MARGARETE (O.S.)
                        Bill!

           William looks through the windshield and sees Margarete
           holding up the phone. He sticks his head out the window.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who is it?

                                 MARGARETE
                        Bob someone. Says he's one of your
                        old students.

           She turns back inside. William turns off the van, happy with
           his accomplishment.

           INT. ALEXANDER HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           William takes the phone from Margarete. She lights up and
           stands nearby to listen.

           Throughout the conversation, we don't see BOB ROSS, but only
           hear him over the phone. His voice is impossibly mellow.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello?

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        Hi, Bill. It's Bob Ross. How have you
                        been?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm sorry, who is this again?

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        Bob Ross. I was one of your students
                        years ago in Orlando... must've been
                        in '75, I believe.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It was'74, my only year there. I love
                        Orlando.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You're right. Still sharp as a tack.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, I always like to hear from old
                        students. What can I do for you, Bob?

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        I wanted to call and thank you
                        personally for everything you've
                        done. I really appreciate it.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Of course. What I do?

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        Oh, how you've been handling
                        everything in what I imagine must be
                        a very difficult time.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What do you mean handle? Handle what?

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        The transition with the show. Faye
                        told me you might be a little upset,
                        but I said, heck, let's get crazy.
                        Why not give ol' Bill a call and see
                        if we can't work things out?

           William's good cheer instantly takes a turn for the worse.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You-- you're the one taking my show
                        from me?

           Margarete straightens up. Oh, shit, here we go--

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        I'd rather see it as a natural
                        transition from teacher to student. A
                        passing of the torch, or in our case
                        a passing of the paint brush.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I wouldn't pass you a pile of shit
                        for you to eat it.

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        I'm sorry, I don't understand--

           William HANGS UP the phone, and lumbers past Margarete
           without even a glance. She watches him go.

           INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

           Candle light again. And William is drunk. He paces in front
           of an easel with a blank canvas, bottle in hand.

           Frustrated, William sits down and looks to the shelf, where
           he sees a framed photo of his FATHER (40s), a hard man,
           standing next to a cowed 10-year-old WILLIAM.

           William drinks and picks up the photo. Off that, we
           TRANSITION TO:
           INT. BARN - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           East Prussia. 1927.

           A quick, violent image looking up at William's FATHER
           viciously throwing punch after punch, his face twisted in
           fury and anguish--

           EXT. ALEXANDER FARM - NIGHT

           Wearing fresh bruises on his face, William sneaks away with
           a sack over his shoulder. He's running away.

           INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)

           William flips the photo face down and slugs down the bottle.

           INT. KOCE - DAY

           Daylight floods the otherwise dim studio, as William enters
           through a side door. It's quiet. No one else there. The
           cameras are covered and pushed off to the side.

           Across the way, he sees his old dressing room. His star has
           been removed. Only the faded outline from years of hanging
           on the door remains.

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        Bill?

           William turns to see Don down the hallway. He smiles, as
           always trying to put a good face on a bad situation.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Don. I thought I forgot some things.
                        But then I realize I got everything
                        before, so...

                                 DON
                        Okay, good. Great.
                               (then)
                        Listen, I'm glad you stopped by. I
                        wanted you to know that I did
                        everything I could. I tried.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah, I know you did.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        But what did I do wrong? It's okay,
                        we're friends a long time. You can
                        tell me.

                                 DON
                        You didn't do anything wrong. It's a
                        network thing. You understand.
                                 WILLIAM
                               b( eat)
                        I love teaching, Don. It's all I've
                        ever done. And here I had the biggest
                        classroom in the world.

                                 DON
                        You can do public access. Have you
                        thought about that?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Nobody watches public access. This
                        was the only place for me.

                                 DON
                        I'm sorry, Bill. I really wish there
                        was more I could do.

           Don holds out his hand and they shake. William turns to
           leave the studio.

           INT. GARAGE - DAY

           The van is up on jack stands and Margarete is underneath on
           a roller. Smoke rises up through the engine from underneath.

           William lumbers up the driveway and sees what Margarete is
           doing. He's not surprised.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I thought you didn't care about this
                        old thing.

           Margarete abruptly rolls out from underneath, grease on her
           face and hands, cutting him off. She flicks her cigarette.

                                 MARGARETE
                        I got a call when you were sleeping.
                        Leewards wants to drop our supplies.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What? Why?

           Margarete gets to her feet and wipes sweat with her sleeve.

                                 MARGARETE
                        I told you sales were dropping. Now
                        you're not on TV and they're afraid
                        they'll drop more. I got them to hold
                        off for now, but we have to do
                        something.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Then we go with someone else. Aaron
                        Brothers or some regional store.
                                 MARGARETE
                        Why would someone else pick us up if
                        there's no show to advertise?
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        This could be a big hit on our money.
                        We need to go back to Faye.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Not that again.

           Margarete SLAMS the hood. William winces from the noise.

                                 MARGARETE
                        We're going to Virginia. They want us
                        to come out to discuss everything...
                        and to meet with this Bob Ross.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don't have a say in this?

                                 MARGARETE
                        We don't have a choice.

           William paces, his mind reeling.

                                 WILLIAM
                        There has to be another way.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Unless you can convince them to give
                        you another show, I don't see one.

           Margarete moves to William and gets him to stop.

                                 MARGARETE
                        I have always believed in you and
                        your talent. And you still have much
                        to give the world. But you are the
                        most stubborn son a bitch I've ever
                        known.

           A beat, then he nods.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Okay, we hear them out-- but no
                        promises.

           Margarete sighs. It's the best she's going to get right now.

                                 MARGARETE
                        We have some time. At least we can
                        hit the road like you want to.
           INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUS - THE NEXT DAY

           In the driveway, Margarete sits behind the wheel, Volkswagen
           bus idling and packed with their things.

           William exits the house and climbs in. A beat.

           Then he turns and gives her a nod. He's ready. Margarete
           puts the van in drive and they're off.

           STAR ON THE ROAD MONTAGE

           William and Margarete cross the country past various
           familiar landmarks as they head east: PALM SPRINGS... LAS
           VEGAS... MONUMENT VALLEY...

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           While Margarete pumps gas, William sells paintings to
           customers and even the STATION ATTENDANT.

           He turns to her, holding up cash with a smile.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           William paints a desert scene outside the open door. Inside,
           Margarete does the accounting.

           He turns to her. A happy smile. Margarete obliges, but drops
           the pretense when he goes back to painting.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY/NIGHT

           Now driving through the south. JACKSON... BIRMINGHAM...
           ATLANTA...

           EXT. REST STOP - DAY

           Margarete and William sell paintings to anyone they can.
           There's a sizable crowd, as they haggle for money.

           They share a quick look. Even Margarete can't help enjoying
           herself.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           The van drives past a sign that reads Welcome to Virginia.

           EXT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT

           And finally they pull into the lot to park.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Dark because of the shades. William is up bright and early.
           Margarete is still asleep.
           He makes his way to the window in T-shirt and tighty
           whities, and pulls open the heavy shades, flooding the room
           with harsh light that wakes her up.

                                 MARGARETE
                               (
                                      )
                                groggy
                        What are you doing?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Look at this beautiful morning.

           Margarete gives him a look.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Why are you so happy all of a sudden?

           William puts on his pants.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Can't a man enjoy a brand new day
                        with his beautiful young wife?

                                 MARGARETE
                        You're acting like we did something
                        more than sleep last night. What's
                        come over you?

           William sits on the edge of the bed.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I have a plan.

           Margarete throws the covers off and gets out of bed.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You don't want to hear it? We need
                        one for tonight.

           Margarete grabs her cigarettes off the table and lights up.
           She gestures-- Go ahead, let's hear it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Competing shows. PBS puts The Magic
                        of Oil Painting back on and we go up
                        against Bob. Let's have the public
                        decide who stays and who goes.

                                 MARGARETE
                        They won't go for that. It's too
                        expensive. We're here to accept the
                        book and meet Bob. That's it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who cares about the book? I can't
                        teach people that way.
                                 MARGARETE
                        Be happy they offered this much.

           William plops onto the bed. Margarete sits next to him.

                                 MARGARETE
                        If there was a way to get you back,
                        I'd fight like hell to get it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I know that.

           She takes his hand in both of hers and gives him a kiss on
           the cheek. He smiles, appreciating the gesture.

           INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A no frills ristorante with latticed walls, checkered
           tablecloths, and an old world vibe.

           William and Margarete enter dressed nicely for dinner. Both
           look on edge.

           Across the way, they spot Faye with a MAN wearing tinted
           glasses and a denim shirt with the top unbuttoned, revealing
           a medallion on a gold chain.

           Meet BOB ROSS (30s, afro, always happy, maybe stoned), the
           man we saw in silhouette before.

           William turns to Margarete, not impressed. Margarete puts on
           a good face, as Bob smiles and waves them over. Bob and Faye
           stand as they arrive.

                                 FAYE
                        Thank you for coming all this way.

           Bob beams a beatific smile, but now that we're closer, we
           see a little more calculation behind the tinted glasses.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Hello, Bill. So wonderful to see you.
                        We really appreciate you making the
                        trip out.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, I guess we wouldn't be here
                        without you.

           As they sit, Margarete gives William a discreet kick. Nobody
           notices. Then she lights up a cigarette.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Would you mind? I'm sensitive to the
                        smoke.
           Margarete holds a beat and puts out the cigarette on the
           ground without a word.

           A beat. Faye tries to break the ice.

                                 FAYE
                        So, how was the drive out?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It was good. Listen, we have an idea
                        we'd like to share. It's a good one,
                        if you give it a chance--

                                 FAYE
                        If it has anything to do with putting
                        you back on TV, the answer's no.
                               o( ff William sinking)
                        I understand this isn't easy. Believe
                        me, we're as uncomfortable about it
                        as you are--

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                step
                                    s in)
                        Would you mind?
                               (
                                she doesn't
                                           )
                        I want to say from the bottom of my
                        heart how much I appreciate this.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I heard this on the phone already.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        It's more than that. When I took your
                        class, you opened up whole new worlds
                        I never knew before. All my life I
                        was trapped inside a box, but thanks
                        to you I was able to break free.

           William eyes Bob skeptically, but he's listening. Margarete
           keeps a wary eye on both.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How many classes you take? I remember
                        lots of students, but I don't
                        remember you.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Only the one. But when I was
                        stationed in Alaska, I never missed
                        your show. I used to rush home on
                        breaks to catch it. When I pick up
                        that brush now, I can still remember
                        the thrill I'd get watching you.
           Bob is entirely convincing. His affability is infectious and
           starts to break down William's defenses.

                                 BOB ROSS (CONT'D)
                        To be honest, Bill, if it wasn't for
                        you, I wouldn't be here today.

           William wavers. Margarete sees this, her mood changing.

                                 FAYE
                        You had a great run, Bill. Seven
                        incredible years. I hope we did as
                        much for you as you have for us.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I only hope I can accomplish half of
                        what you did, God willing.

                                 FAYE
                        So, we didn't have you come all this
                        way for us to sit here and tell you
                        how great you are--

                                 MARGARETE
                        We don't want the book series.

           Heads turn. Faye is taken aback. Even William is surprised,
           but manages to hide a smile.

                                 FAYE
                        We think it's more than fair.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Well, you said yourself we gave seven
                        years. Bill deserves more than some
                        book nobody will read.

                                 FAYE
                        If you're asking we put Bill back on
                        TV, I'm afraid that's not possible.

                                 MARGARETE
                        We want a video series.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We do?

                                 MARGARETE
                               (
                                ignoring
                                        )
                        It will sell better and be cheap to
                        produce. And our fans get what they
                        want.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGARETE (cont'd)
                          ots of people will be unhappy not to
                        L
                        see Bill on screen again, which I'm
                        sure the network is worried about.
                        Does the audience want Bob in his
                        place? I don't know. Do you?

                                 FAYE
                        I know you're doing your job as his
                        manager, but let's be realistic. PBS
                        is not going to agree to that.

                                 MARGARETE
                               (
                                leaning in
                                          )
                        What I don't understand is why you
                        need Bill to help Bob in the first
                        place. Any director can help him be
                        on TV. Why Bill?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        This was my condition for taking the
                        show. After all, he's my mentor. But
                        really it's my way of thanking him
                        for what he's done. It's important to
                        me, and really the least I can do.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Well, if it's so important-- video
                        series or nothing. Tell us now.
                        Otherwise we have a long drive back.

           Bob and Faye share a look. Bob gives her a nod.

                                 FAYE
                        Give me a minute.

           AT THE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           William and Margarete talk while Faye is on a pay phone near
           the entrance in the background.

           At the table, Bob eats his linguine, happy as a clam.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What was with all that bluffing?

                                 MARGARETE
                        I wasn't bluffing. They don't give us
                        the video, we go home. You agree?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I thought you wanted me to take the
                        book. What's come over with you?
                                 MARGARETE
                               (
                                glancing at Bob
                                               )
                        What do you think of him?

                                 WILLIAM
                        He's a little spaced out, but we saw
                        worse living in Long Beach.

                                 MARGARETE
                        That's not what I'm talking about.
                        It's something in the eyes.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Maybe I'm tired of the run around. I
                        want to know where our lives go next.
                        If they say no, maybe we take the
                        book and be done with it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It doesn't matter to me. Where you go
                        I go. That's all that's important.

           Faye hangs up and walks over to the bar. William and
           Margarete put their game faces on.

                                 FAYE
                        You're in luck. The brass agreed a
                        video would sell better. But it's our
                        final offer.

           She holds out her hand. William looks at Margarete one more
           time. She gives him a slight nod.

           William reaches out and shakes, sealing the deal.

           INT. PBS STUDIO - ARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - WEEKS LATER

           Much bigger than the one we saw in Costa Mesa. Large open
           space, newer equipment, even sizable dressing rooms. Still,
           it's PBS and not NBC in New York.

           William enters carrying his supplies. Bob is waiting in the
           same denim shirt and jeans. He beams and waves William over.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm so glad you made it. I can't wait
                        to get started. I've got everything
                        all set up over here.

           Bob has an easel with a blank canvas set up with paints and
           brushes in the corner. He's chomping at the bit.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So how do you want do this?
                                 BOB ROSS
                        I've got it all figured out. You take
                        a seat right here...

           Bob pulls a director's chair over.

                                 BOB ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Now, I'll go through how I might do
                        an episode and you give me pointers
                        on how I can do things better. Don't
                        be afraid to interrupt. And please,
                        be tough. I can handle it.

           William takes a seat and folds his arms. Bob turns as if
           he's looking at the camera and, impossibly, starts speaking
           in an even mellower voice than he has.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Hello there, and welcome. I'm so glad
                        that you could join us today...

           Bob's soothing voice lulls William and he starts to nod off.
           His lids droop, and--

           From his POV, we see the image of Bob turn fuzzy, his voice
           murky. He's nothing more than a blurry afro--

           And William's chin hits his chest. He's out.

           TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           William snorts awake to see Bob standing before a completed
           painting: a snow-covered cabin next to a mountain with
           fluffy clouds floating in the sky.

           Bob sees William awake.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Looks like you dozed off for a
                        minute. I have that effect on people.
                        And good timing. I was about to do my
                        sign off. Ready?
                               (
                                turns to "camera"
                                                 )
                        There's so much that you can do with
                        this canvas. You can paint anything
                        in the world you want.
                               (
                                points to his heart
                                                   )
                        All you need is a dream in here that
                        you want to put on there. So Happy
                        Painting and we'll see you next time.

           William's lids start to droop again, but he catches himself
           this time. Bob smiles, and he's "out."
                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm not terribly happy with that last
                        line, are you? Think I need to work
                        on it a bit more.

           But William acts like he didn't hear Bob. That's because
           he's eyeing the painting. It's okay, but something is off
           about it and William doesn't like it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What is that?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        A cabin the woods. I used to go
                        hiking outside Fairbanks--

                                 WILLIAM
                        A cabin? It looks like a cartoon.

           William jumps to his feet and goes to the painting, pointing
           at it as he fires off a withering critique--

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        Look at this. Your edges-- they're
                        round, not straight. And your colors
                        are off. Did you mix them right? And
                        what is this... a mountain? A giant
                        sponge sprouting from the ground?

           Bob lowers his palette, upset, but he doesn't raise his
           voice. In fact, Bob never talks above conversation tone.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, that's disappointing to hear.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I thought you were my student? I
                        don't teach that.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        But how was I on camera? I think that
                        part is okay.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who cares if you can't paint?

           Bob looks around and leans in to talk in private.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Listen, I admit I might need help
                        with that. My first episode tapes in
                        a few weeks and I don't want to let
                        Faye down. It means so much to her
                        for me to be on TV teaching others
                        the joy of painting.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB ROSS (cont'd)
                               (
                                realizing
                                         )
                        That's a nice name for the show.
                               (
                                    )
                                then
                        Will you help me?

           William is floored, but Bob's earnest plea has an effect.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll think about it. Just don't say
                        'happy'. That's my word.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A furnished rental home that serves as William and
           Margarete's temporary residence. Boxes of supplies and
           canvas are piled in a corner.

           Margarete is on the phone mid-conversation.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Bill Alexander... The Magic of Oil
                        Painting... no, it's not on PBS
                        anymore. But he has a VHS series
                        coming... Okay, yes. I understand.
                        Thank you.

           Deflated, she hangs up right as William lumbers inside.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What happened?

                                 WILLIAM
                        He can't paint! He should be drawing
                        Mickey Mouse, not painting mountains.
                        I'm being replaced by an amateur.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Slow down. What does the network
                        think?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Who knows? They probably can't tell
                        the difference.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What did you say to Bob?

           William looks away. Margarete senses something is up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        He asked me to help fine tune his
                        technique.

                                 MARGARETE
                        And you said yes?
                                 WILLIAM
                        I didn't say yes.

           Margarete relaxes a little.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Tomorrow you march into Faye's office
                        and tell her. They need to know
                        you're the better painter. Maybe they
                        come to their senses and put you back
                        on the air.

           Margarete's pep talk gets William worked up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You're right.

           William kisses her and leaves. Margarete watches him go.

           INT. FAYE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Sitting at her desk, Faye watches BOB'S AUDITION TAPE on a
           TV/VCR combo. Even though the tape is low-quality, it's easy
           to see how Bob radiates on screen.

           Faye is mesmerized, as ONSCREEN Bob calmly paints a log
           cabin in the woods. The same thing he painted for William.

           There's a KNOCK at the door. Faye looks up and sees William
           poking his head in.

                                 FAYE
                        Come in.

           William enters and stands in front of her desk. Faye shuts
           off the TV, and doesn't offer a seat.

                                 FAYE
                        What can I do for you?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's about Bob.

           Faye leans back and gives him an incredulous look, waiting
           for William to get to the point.

                                 WILLIAM
                        He can't paint.

           Faye sits on that a beat. She's unreadable, which makes
           William a little nervous. Then:
                                 FAYE
                        You're right. He's not an artist like
                        you. But Bob has something you don't.
                        He has presence.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Presence? What's that mean? All I see
                        is hair and a dopey smile.

                                 FAYE
                        You think that's all there is?
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Did I ever tell you how I found him?

           William folds his arms. Faye's mood darkens.

                                 FAYE
                        Three years ago I lost my husband.
                        Leukemia. He was young and vibrant...
                        and then he wasn't. It happened so
                        fast. We got the diagnosis in March,
                        and by April he was gone.

           William sinks into his seat. He wasn't expecting this.

                                 FAYE (CONT'D)
                        Some days I couldn't even get out of
                        bed. But a friend told me about this
                        painter who was giving art classes
                        nearby, and I should go to take my
                        mind off everything. I don't know why
                        I bothered. I'm not an artist. Maybe
                        I needed to get out of the house. And
                        that's when it all changed. Bob was a
                        revelation. He had this spirit that
                        lifted me out of a really dark place.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Bob's more than a painter-- he's a
                        healer. The world needs that more
                        than ever.

           Faye goes back to work, indicating it's time to go. He
           turns, but then he stops--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Faye.
                               (
                                she looks up
                                            )
                        I'm sorry about your husband.

           She smiles thinly and William leaves.
           INT. PBS HEADQUARTERS - STUDIO - DAY

           Bob is at his easel painting another cabin, this one in
           front of a lake. William hurries in. Bob turns around.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        There you are.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We need to talk.

           William looks around to make sure no one's around to listen.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Way I see it, you need something and
                        I need something. So I help you to
                        paint and you help me sell supplies
                        on your show. It's win-win.

           Bob thinks a moment, unreadable behind those shaded glasses.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        And everything stays between us?

           William nods.

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                smiling
                                       )
                        I think it's a marvelous idea.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - DINING AREA - EVENING

           Margarete sits in front of an easel painting a winter scene:
           a snow-covered bridge going over a small icy creek. In the
           background is majestic mountain.

           She's a better painter than Bob and may even rival William.

           The door opens and William enters in a good mood. Margarete
           keeps painting, as he looks at her work.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You were always a great artist. Why
                        don't we get you a show instead?

                                 MARGARETE
                        Because they don't put old chain-
                        smoking German women on TV.
                               (
                                    )
                                then
                        So what happened?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I have the solution to all our
                        problems.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIAM (cont'd)
                        Bob agreed to sell our products on
                        his show. Isn't that wonderful?

           Margarete is not surprised to hear this.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You didn't talk to Faye.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Forget Faye. She won't budge.

           Margarete puts down her brush.

                                 MARGARETE
                        He agreed because you're teaching him
                        to paint.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's a little fine-tuning. We come
                        out better in the end, I promise.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Don't you see what he's doing?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I won't teach him everything. I'll
                        give him enough so he does okay and
                        we get a boost in sales. But he'll
                        start running out of ideas, and
                        people will demand that PBS put the
                        old German guy back on. They cancel
                        Bob, and our show is back.

           Margarete glares at him before going back to painting.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A boxy, brown PLYMOUTH RELIANT pulls to the curb outside
           William's rental home. BEEP-BEEP!

           INT. RENTAL CAR - PARKED - SAME

           Bob is behind the wheel of the clutter-free car. One of
           those green Little Trees fresheners hangs from the mirror.

           He watches William exit the front door with an art bag slung
           over his shoulder. On the stereo, Captain & Tennille's "Love
           Will Keep Us Together" plays.

           He waves and reaches over to open the passenger side door.
           William gets in and immediately grimaces at the music.

                                 WILLIAM
                        This is still on the radio?
                                 BOB ROSS
                        It's a tape. You don't like it?

           William gives Bob a look. Bob stops the tape.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Can you stop at Leewards on the way?
                        We need more paints.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You're the boss.

           Bob shifts into drive and pulls away.

           INT. LEEWARDS - DAY

           An arts and crafts chain typical of the time. Florescent
           lights, cheap prices, and plain sheet rock walls.

           William enters with Bob and heads for the painting supplies,
           moving past a STOCK BOY sweeping the floor. The Stock Boy
           stops, recognizing William as they pass--

                                 STOCK BOY
                        Hey, aren't you the guy on aisle 5?
                        From that show, right?

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's right. What's your name?

                                 STOCK BOY
                        Steven.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                warmly
                                      )
                        Well, thank you Steven for watching.

           He pats Steven n the shoulder. Steven smiles, as William
           moves down the aisle with Bob.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I love all my fans. They're going to
                        be very unhappy when they find out
                        I'm canceled.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Ah, here we are.

           They reach the paint aisle. Bob's eyes light up when he
           spots a cardboard cutout of William holding a can of his
           Magic White paint.

           The cutout stands next to an entire section of Bill
           Alexander brand art supplies, which dominate the aisle.
                               (
                                 BOB ROSS
                                        )
                                whistles
                        Would you look at that.

           William proudly watches Bob take it all in.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Took years of struggle and hard work
                        to get here.

           Bob puts his arm around the cutout of William and chuckles.
           Even William can't help but smile.

           Bob scans the shelves and finds a can of William's Magic
           White. He picks one up and looks at the back.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Can I give you some advice?
                               o( ff Bob, nodding)
                        Presence is bullshit. If you don't
                        have strong craft, people will see
                        right through you.

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                smiling
                                       )
                        That's why I wanted your help.

           William nods, as he grabs some paint and heads for the
           counter. Bob watches him go, the wheels spinning behind his
           tinted rims.

           INT. BOB'S APARTMENT - DAY

           A furnished one-bedroom that serves as a temporary residence
           for Bob to stay while he's taping.

           William stands before an easel, palette and brush in hand,
           waiting impatiently.

           Bob enters tying off his kimono.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Let's get started.

           Bob readies his palette. William turns to his easel,
           wondering what the hell he's gotten into.

           START HAPPY PAINTING MONTAGE

           Bob and William start with painting various landscapes. Bob
           still wears his kimono.

           First is a mountain and woods without a cabin.
           William points at something Bob's doing wrong and
           demonstrates on his own canvas, pitter-patting the brush to
           create a large tree.

           Bob tries to copy him, but gets it wrong again. William gets
           irritated and pitter-pats harder. There!

           Bob tries again and gets it wrong again. William throws up
           his hands in frustration.

           ANOTHER DAY

           Both wear different clothing. This time Bob has on jeans and
           a shirt.

           Bob shows William his pitter-pat technique. William nods and
           smiles. It's getting better!

           ANOTHER DAY

           Now William make X-strokes across the canvas. Sharp and
           fast. Bob tries, but his strokes are soft and gentle.

           William grabs his hand and forces Bob to do it the right
           way. There! Bob is taken aback.

           LATER

           Now William shows Bob the correct way to use the palette
           knife, emphatically pulling down paint to create a rocky
           cliff overlooking crashing waves.

           But Bob gently pulls the paint down, irritating William
           again! William pulls down hard. Bob does it gently. William
           throws down his palette knife.

           ANOTHER DAY

           William and Bob paint a woodland scene with tall trees and a
           lake. Bob's looks as realistic and life-like as William's.
           They're almost identical.

           William looks over and sees that Bob has gotten better. Bob
           turns to William, the proud student showing off his work.

           William smiles, putting on a good face, but deep down he's
           not happy.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. PBS STUDIO, ARLINGTON - DAY

           William and Margarete arrive at the studio, where there's a
           ton of activity. GRIPS set up C-stands, GAFFERS hang lights,
           a two CAMERA OPERATORS make adjustments.
           A DIRECTOR is talking to Don. Don notices William and
           Margarete, and comes over to greet them with open arms.

                                 DON
                        Bill, Margarete. How wonderful.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What are you doing here?

                                 DON
                        Ah, well. You see, Bob-- he asked me
                        to, you know... He needed a producer.

           Before William can say anything, Margarete jumps in.

                                 MARGARETE
                        It's okay. We understand.
                               (
                                to Bill
                                       )
                        Don't we?

           Off William, not wanting to say anything, his feelings hurt.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Sitting before a vanity mirror, Bob wears his denim shirt
           and quietly repeats lines to himself.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Happy Painting, and see you next
                        time.
                               (
                                that was no good
                                                )
                        Happy Painting, and hope to see you
                        real soon.
                               (
                                also no good
                                            )
                        Happy Painting, and have a wonderful
                        day.

           Frustrated, Bob closes his eyes to focus deep within
           himself. And then, inspiration.

           Bob opens his eyes and looks into the mirror with a smile.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Happy Painting and God bless, my
                        friends.

           Bob lets out a sigh of satisfaction. He's found it.

           INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY

           William ambles down the narrow hallway, taking a deep swig
           from a flask.

           A door opens and Bob comes out. He sees William right away.
                                 BOB ROSS
                        Bill! I'm so happy you made it.
                               (
                                re: flask
                                         )
                        Little early in the day, isn't it?

                                 WILLIAM
                               h( olds out flask)
                        Have some for the taping. It'll help.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        That's okay. Listen, I know I've
                        thanked you a hundred times, but I
                        don't think I ever showed you my
                        appreciation. I hope you don't mind,
                        I have something for you...

           Curious, William watches as Bob reaches into his bag and
           produces a check and hands it to him.

           William takes the check and marvels at the amount.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What is this-- five thousand?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        It's for the lessons you gave me over
                        the past couple weeks.
                                off Bill
                               (
                                        )
                        Is it not enough?

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, I mean... it's very thoughtful.
                        Thank you.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Advertising your products on the show
                        isn't enough. Of course this takes a
                        big chunk out of the old savings, but
                        it's worth it. I really believe my
                        time with you is going to pay huge
                        dividends in the future.

           Bob smiles and moves toward set.

           INT. PBS STUDIO, ARLINGTON - DAY

           Bob is talking to Don and the director prior to taping.

           William joins Margarete, who waits nearby. They see Faye
           come onto the set and sit in a chair across the way.

           A beat, then William turns to Margarete.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maybe I was wrong about Bob.
                                 MARGARETE
                        Have you been drinking?

                               (
                                ignoring
                                 WILLIAM
                                        )
                        He's not such a bad guy. Maybe I'm
                        okay with him taking over the show.

           He smiles at Margarete. Meanwhile, there's activity on set.
           They're ready to shoot.

                                 BOB'S DIRECTOR
                        Places everyone.

           Don moves behind the cameras. Faye takes a breath. This is a
           big day for her, too.

           Bob picks up his palette and looks to William, who gives him
           a nod and a smile.

                                 BOB'S DIRECTOR
                        Camera's ready. And... action.

           Bob turns to the camera with a smile.

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                a little stiff
                                              )
                        Hi, I'm Bob Ross, and for the next 13
                        weeks I'll be your host as we
                        experience The Joy of Painting.
                               (
                                slight beat
                                           )
                        I think each of us sometime during
                        our life has wanted to paint a
                        picture. I think there's an artist
                        hidden at the bottom of every single
                        one of us...

           Bob is stiff as a board. He stumbles over words and pauses
           at the wrong moments, closes his eyes, takes breaths between
           words. He's struggling on camera.

           Faye shifts in her chair, growing concerned. Don looks on
           nervous. This is not what anybody expected.

           Margarete turns to William, who looks sympathetic to Bob's
           struggle.

                                 BOB ROSS (CONT'D)
                               (
                                tries to get into it
                                                    )
                        And here we will show you how to
                        bring that artist out. To put it on
                        canvas. Because you, too, can paint
                        almighty pictures.
           Wait a minute. William looks at Margarete. Did he just say
           almighty?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You know, most of us have avoided
                        painting because I think we've been
                        told you have to go to school half
                        your life, or maybe even be blessed
                        by Michelangelo at birth to ever be
                        able to paint a picture. And here we
                        want to show you that's not true. You
                        can paint an almighty picture right
                        along with us.

           There it is again. He did say it.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Let's go over some of the equipment
                        we're going to use.

           As Bob goes over his equipment and paints, William goes to
           Don and speaks in hushed tones.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What is he doing? He sounds like me.

                                 DON
                        He doesn't sound like you at all.

                                 WILLIAM
                        He's doing my show!

           Don gestures for William to keep quiet. William grows more
           upset as Bob gets comfortable on camera.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        So let's do it. Let's paint a picture
                        right here.

           Bob grabs a brush and dips it in white paint.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        We're gonna start with a big brush
                        and we'll cover the canvas in a thin
                        layer of magic white. We call this a
                        wet-on-wet technique. Cover it nice
                        and even. You also need an almighty
                        easel when you're doing this to hold
                        your canvas very firm. There.

           Bob dips his brush in yellow paint and starts making little
           X-strokes, sharp and fast, like William taught him.
                                 BOB ROSS
                        Now we mix some cadmium yellow and
                        phthalo green, and make little X's
                        like this. There. We're making little
                        crisscross strokes with our almighty
                        brush.

           William needs to get the hell out of there and backs away,
           accidentally knocking over a C-stand and sending it CRASHING
           to the floor. Heads turn.

           But Bob doesn't skip a beat. He continues to paint and stays
           as calm as can be.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        By now maybe you've recognized some
                        of the equipment we're using as
                        something you've seen before. And I
                        learned this fantastic technique from
                        a wonderful man that all of us have
                        enjoyed for many, many years on TV,
                        Bill Alexander. Bill taught me this,
                        and it's the most fantastic way to
                        paint that you've ever seen. And now
                        I'm happy to share it with you.

           William hurries off the set.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           William is pacing back and forth, red-faced and agitated.
           Don comes in and sees William's state.

                                 DON
                        What's wrong with you? Why are you so
                        upset?

                                 WILLIAM
                        He stole my technique, Don. I
                        invented wet-on-wet!

                                 DON
                        Let's talk this through, okay? Nice
                        and calm. Big breaths.

           Don starts to breathe, as the door opens again. It's Faye.

                                 FAYE
                        What hell is going on? He almost
                        ruined the shoot.
                                to William
                               (
                                          )
                        What are you even doing on set?
                                 DON
                        It's okay, I've got this.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Bob ripped me off. That's my show
                        he's doing!

                                 FAYE
                        That's ridiculous.

           Now Bob comes in with a warm smile.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, I think that went better than
                        expected. Started a little rough, but
                        once I got to painting, I felt real
                        good. What did you think, Bill?

                                 WILLIAM
                        You son of a bitch!

                               (
                                confused
                                 BOB ROSS
                                        )
                        I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?
                        It was the X's again, wasn't it. I
                        knew I wasn't doing them right.

                                 WILLIAM
                        The X's are mine. Almighty brushes
                        are mine. Pitter-pat, happy trees,
                        wet-on-wet is mine.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Oh. I thought it was a nice homage to
                        your show.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Homage? I trained you and now you're
                        copying me. You think you can do it
                        better?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, I did give you full credit for
                        teaching me.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's right, I taught you. And now
                        you betray me.

           William looks to Faye.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        You hear that? I taught Bob Ross how
                        to paint. So why is he on TV teaching
                        my technique?!
                                 FAYE
                        Because you were wrong. He does do it
                        better.

           William turns to Don for help.

                                 DON
                        I have to admit, it was a nice pass
                        the torch kind of episode.

           It's clear that no one is on his side.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You think you can cast the old man
                        aside and hope he'll go away. But I
                        won't do it!

           William takes Bob's check and rips it up, throwing the
           pieces to the ground. He grabs his coat and leaves.

           EXT. PBS HEADQUARTERS - TOP FLOOR - DAY

           William gets off the elevator and heads for a pair of double
           doors marked Rod Harris, President.

           He moves past the confused SECRETARY, who stares as he
           pushes through the doors--

           INT. HARRIS' OFFICE - SAME

           William enters to find ROD HARRIS (50s) at his desk going
           over paperwork. Rod is a thoughtful looking man who peers
           over his reading glasses--

                                 WILLIAM
                        You think I'm going to take this
                        lying down? I struggled too long to
                        let some frizzy-haired jerk steal my
                        show. You hear what I'm saying?

           A beat. There's no response. Frustrated, William turns
           around and storms out.

           Harris' secretary comes in.

                                 ROD HARRIS
                        Who was that?

           She shrugs. So does he, and goes back to his paperwork.

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUS - DRIVING - DAY

           William weaves through traffic, still very angry.

           Margarete, in the passenger seat, holds on for dear life--
                                 WILLIAM
                        Hurensohn! After all I've done. I'm
                        going to-- I don't know, something!

                                 MARGARETE
                        Pull over so I can drive and not get
                        us killed!

           A beat, as William settles down.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm okay.

                               (
                                 MARGARETE
                                also settling down
                                                  )
                        I agree with you, he was doing your
                        show. It was almost the same. But
                        what can you really do?

           A beat, as William thinks.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I know-- I'm going to sue for...
                        whatever they call it.

           INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Williams sits before an ATTORNEY in an upscale office.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Copyright infringement is complex.
                        There's no cut-and-dry type of case.
                        But generally you need to show two
                        things: one, you have ownership of a
                        valid copyright and two, the work
                        being copied is original.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I can do that.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        So this painting technique is
                        original, and you own the copyright?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Of course. He used the same words and
                        everything.

                                 ATTORNEY
                               (
                                not getting it
                                              )
                        Okay. But you did agree to teach him
                        this technique, correct?
                                 WILLIAM
                        I teach lots of people over the
                        years. Thousands. Maybe millions.
                        It's the most important thing I've
                        done.

                                 ATTORNEY
                        Have you ever filed paperwork with
                        the U.S. Copyright Office?

                                 WILLIAM
                                beat
                                    )

                        I don't know.

           EXT. LAW OFFICE - DAY

           William leaves the office dejected. But one lawyer's not
           going to stop him.

           START MONTAGE

           INT. ANOTHER LAW OFFICE - DAY

           Another ATTORNEY sits with William, only this one laughs in
           his face. We can even see him mouth, "No dice."

           INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A poster on the wall shows an ad for accident attorney
           "EDDIE" EDWARDS with KNOW YOUR RIGHTS!! in bold letters.

           William sits among other potential clients, many of whom are
           in various states of injury recovery.

           A CLIENT on crutches gets called in by a RECEPTIONIST.
           William folds his arms and digs in for a long wait.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           William is on the phone pleading his case. He hangs up in
           frustration and crosses out another name and number in the
           yellow pages.

           On the porch, Margarete paints a forest scene, refusing to
           take part in William's quixotic quest.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Back to the ambulance chaser's office, which has thinned
           out. A few clients, including William, are still there.

           The door to the office opens. William perks up.

           Holding a file, the RECEPTIONIST calls out another name.
           It's not William. He crosses his arms and sits back.
           INT. RENTAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           William is on the phone still pleading his case. Then he
           goes silent, and gently hangs up the phone, dejected.

           William crosses out a number in the phone book. He's gone
           through dozens with the same result. He closes the book.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           And back to the waiting room again. William is alone.
           "EDDIE" himself exits the office, briefcase in hand.

           William stands, but "Eddie" moves right past without giving
           him a look.

           The lights go out.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. COURTHOUSE - CLERK WINDOW - DAY

           William waits in line, and judging from all the people
           behind him, he's been there a while.

                                 COURTHOUSE CLERK
                        Next.

           William steps up to the counter.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I want to file a lawsuit.

                                 COURTHOUSE CLERK
                        Small claims is on the third floor.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's for a lot of money.

                                 COURTHOUSE CLERK
                               (
                                fine
                                    )
                        Did you fill out a warrant in debt?
                               (
                                           )
                                off William
                        A civil claim for money.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, I haven't.

           The clerk finds the form and slides it to William.

                                 COURTHOUSE CLERK
                        Next.

           SEVERAL MINUTES LATER
           Off to the side, William struggles to fill out the form.
           Lots blank spaces and he has no clue how to fill them in.

           Frustrated, William does what he can, leaves other spaces
           blank and steps up to the counter.

                                 COURTHOUSE CLERK
                        You have to get back in line.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Please, just take it.

           William leaves the form on the counter and moves off.

           The clerk gives it a quick glance before crumpling it up and
           tossing it in the trash.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - STUDIO - NIGHT

           Alone, William drinks whiskey by candlelight while sitting
           in front of his easel. The canvas reveals a half-painted
           CITY STREET that comes alive, as we TRANSITION TO:

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Konigsberg, East Prussia. 1931.

           William, now 16, is on a street corner in front of an easel
           painting for a small crowd. His clothes are threadbare, his
           face and body thin.

           The crowd hangs on his every word, as he exuberantly
           demonstrates how to paint a vase of flowers.

           Then a YOUNG MAN (18), out of breath, runs up to him and
           urgently tells him something. William's mood takes a
           downward turn, as we CUT TO:

           William running down the street with his art supplies on his
           back. Pushing through a CROWD, he enters a post office--

           INT. POST OFFICE - DAY

           At the counter, a POSTAL WORKER hands William a letter. He
           eagerly opens it. His face goes pale. Not good news.

           EXT. ALEXANDER FARM - DAY

           Days later. William runs down a dirt road as fast as he can.
           The fields are overgrown and unworked, barn falling apart,
           his father's shed filled with rusted unused tools.
           INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           William bursts in, heart pounding. His brother Paul, now 18,
           is nursing their sick mother in bed. They lock eyes.

           Paul gets up to leave. He stops next to William. A heavy
           beat, then he puts a comforting hand on William's shoulder
           and moves away.

           William sees his mother in poor health and sits next to her.
           She's barely there, but opens her eyes enough to see him.
           We're back to the flashback from page 9.

           She coughs. Blood trickles from her mouth. William takes a
           rag to wipe it, but she pushes his hand and turns away.
           William is confused. In German with English subtitles.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Please, mamma.

           His mother turns back, her eyes suddenly sharp.

                                 WILLIAM'S MOTHER
                               (
                                weakly
                                      )
                        My only wish... was to die before you
                        came.

           And she turns her head to face the wall again. William is
           devastated, as we TRANSITION BACK TO:

           INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO - NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)

           William snaps back, and suddenly grabs an opened can of
           Magic White and splashes paint on the canvas.

           He drops the can, picks up his bottle and drinks. Eyes
           fixated on the thick glops of white paint running down the
           canvas to the floor.

           EXT. RENTAL HOME - STREET - DAY

           A green '76 Ford Pinto pulls to a stop out front. The door
           pops open and GERTRUDE OLSEN (30s, black) exits the car.

           Gertrude wears a bright late-70s style blazer and slacks,
           and has the nervous energy of someone desperate to make a
           good impression.

           Gertrude fumbles for her purse, smooths out her jacket and
           heads for the door.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - RENTAL HOME - DAY

           DING-DONG.
           William is passed out on the couch from the night before and
           barely moves or makes a sound.

           Margarete moves past him without so much as a glance to
           answer the door--

           And Gertrude is there on the stoop beaming wide.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Hi, is there a Bill Alexander here?

                                 MARGARETE
                        Yes. Who are you?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Gertrude Olsen, attorney at law.

           William hears the word attorney and pops awake. Margarete is
           not pleased.

                                 MARGARETE
                        I'm sorry, we're not interested.

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, wait.

           William jumps to his feet, but he's woozy and knocks over a
           lamp, sending it CRASHING to the floor.

           Margarete and Gertrude react, as William staggers to the
           door looking like death warmed over, if death were a
           hungover 60-something in tighty whities.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You're an attorney?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        That's right. And I heard that you've
                        been looking for one. Here I am.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Where did you hear that?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You reached out to someone I went to
                        law school with and they referred you
                        over. Happens all the time.

           Margarete gives her a look. William gets excited and steps
           aside for her to come.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Please, come in.
           Gertrude finally notices his state of undress. Oblivious,
           William grabs a robe off a chair and covers up. Gertrude
           tries to hide her embarrassment.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm so happy you're here. I was
                        rejected by every lawyer in town.
                        They tell me I don't have a case.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Well, yeah. Copyright infringement is
                        tough. Really tough. But hey, tough
                        doesn't mean impossible, and I've
                        handled some pretty hard cases.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Like what?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Let's see... DUI, criminal defense,
                        little divorce here and there.
                        Whatever I can get my hands on.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Great, you're hired.

                                 MARGARETE
                        We should talk about this.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Please, talk. Go ahead.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why shouldn't we hire her?

           Margarete lights up and levels her gaze on Gertrude, making
           clear that she's the one who needs to be convinced.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Why do you want this case? Like he
                        said, every lawyer rejected him.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Everyone deserves representation.

           Margarete gives Gertrude a look: don't bullshit me.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Okay, I'm a big fan. I used to watch
                        the show all the time back when I
                        was, uh--
                               (
                                flailing
                                        )
                        You know, I tried like hell to paint,
                        but I was terrible. Like really bad.
           Gertrude chuckles to cover up her anxiety. Margarete catches
           onto something she said.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Back when you were in where?

           A beat. Gertrude knows she has to come clean.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Recovery. But I'm sober 19 months
                        now. Honestly, the show got me
                        through some really hard times. I
                        don't think I'd be here without it.

           Margarete seems to soften. Gertrude is breaking through.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I know I screwed things up. But I'm
                        trying to get back and rebuild my
                        business-- and I don't have any other
                        clients right now. Bill will get my
                        undivided attention.

           William turns to Margarete.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You see? All those times we needed
                        help, money for gas or a bite to eat,
                        there was always somebody to help.
                        Now the universe is saying we have to
                        give some payback.

           Gertrude waits with anticipation, and Margarete's defenses
           fall. She can't say no.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Wonderful. You're hired.

           INT. TV STUDIO - WEEKS LATER

           A local station in Arlington, where a HOST for a live talk
           show brings out her next guest.

                                 LOCAL TV HOST
                        Welcome back. We now have with us a
                        brand new face on PBS, Bob Ross.

           We see Bob standing before an easel holding a blank canvas.
           The audience APPLAUDS. Bob smiles and waves. He looks a
           touch uncomfortable being in the limelight.

                                 LOCAL TV HOST
                        Bob has a new show on the air called
                        The Joy of Painting.
           INT. RENTAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Sitting in front of the TV, William watches Bob do the show
           with pen and paper on his lap.

                                 LOCAL TV HOST (ON TV)
                        Tells us about it.

                                 BOB ROSS (ON TV)
                        Well, we hope the show is way for
                        people to discover talents that they
                        never knew they had. And we do that
                        by showing them how to paint with a
                        simple technique that will allow even
                        the most self-doubting artist to
                        create wonderful pictures in less
                        than an hour.

           William is annoyed, but focuses on writing something down.

                                 LOCAL TV HOST (ON TV)
                        What about other artists who dismiss
                        this style of painting?

                                 BOB ROSS (ON TV)
                        Well, I don't know about you, but
                        when I paint something--

                     WILLIAM
           --I don't want to explain
           what it is.
                                                     BOB ROSS (ON TV)
                                            --I don't want to explain
                                            what it is.

           The audience LAUGHS. They're hooked by Bob's easygoing
           nature. William grips his pen tightly.

                                 LOCAL TV HOST (ON TV)
                        Will you give us a demonstration?

                                 BOB ROSS (ON TV)
                        I'd love to. Now I'm going to cover
                        the canvas with something I call
                        Liquid White.

           Bob reaches for a can of white paint and holds it up for the
           audience and viewers to see.

                                 BOB ROSS (ON TV)
                        This is a new formula I'm trying that
                        keeps the canvas wet longer, which is
                        essential to my technique, The Bob
                        Ross Method. It's not for sale yet,
                        but we'll get it out real soon.

           William SNAPS his pen in half, ink exploding everywhere, as
           his phone RINGS. William jumps up, pants stained with ink.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Verdammt!
                                answering
                                         )
                               (
                        Yeah? Hello?

           INT. GERTRUDE'S OFFICE - SAME

           A small, cramped space that looks like it's in the back of a
           storage facility.

           Gertrude is at a desk cluttered with papers and Diet Coke
           cans. On the wall is a framed quote: One Day at a Time.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Bill, it's Gertrude. Couple things
                        for you. So, I checked with the
                        copyright office. You never filed
                        paperwork with them.

           INTERCUT WILLIAM AND GERTRUDE

           William dabs his stained paints with a wet paper towel,
           making a bad situation worse.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Scheisse-- yeah, I know that. That's
                        not a problem, right?

           Gertrude rifles through some papers.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It doesn't make things easy, but we
                        can get around it. Also I've been
                        going over your business filings--
                        why haven't you set up an LLC yet?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Margarete handles that stuff.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I gotta be honest, this is a mess. We
                        need to show a clear example of
                        infringement, otherwise we'll get
                        laughed out of court. It's hard
                        enough with everything in order.

           William stops and thinks a moment, his eyes falling on the
           TV, where Bob finishes covering his canvas with white paint
           and picks up his palette. An idea strikes--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Liquid White.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Come again?
                                 WILLIAM
                        His new paint. Remember I told you
                        about our agreement to sell my
                        products on his show?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        There's no contract for that either.

                                 WILLIAM
                        He said on TV that he had a new
                        formula for white paint. It took me
                        20 years to perfect Magic White. He
                        was using my paint, now all of a
                        sudden he has his own? No way.

           Gertrude doesn't quite get it.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Are saying he stole your formula?

                                 WILLIAM
                        What do you think?

                               (
                                thinks on it
                                 GERTRUDE
                                            )
                        We have to know for sure. Do you have
                        have any?

                                 WILLIAM
                        He said it's not for sale yet.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Just get it. I know a lab we can use.
                        We need to test the formula to see if
                        it's the same. And if it is, we're
                        gonna sue the shit out of him.

           William lets out a big smile and hangs up, leaving ink on
           the receiver. William takes a moment to watch Bob smile and
           paint for the audience.

           CLICK! Bob disappears from the TV.

           INT. PBS STUDIO HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           William walks through the studio past CREW MEMBER milling
           about. Nobody seems to notice he's there.

           Which is good considering how he left last time.

           William keeps an eye out for Faye or Don or anyone else,
           while finding his way into--
           INT. BOB'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           There's nobody there. William immediately starts rifling
           drawers and supplies, looking for Bob's paint--

                                 BOB ROSS (O.S.)
                        Bill? Is that you?

           William's eyes light up and he quickly turns around.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh-- I just wanted a few brushes to
                        borrow. I thought you were still
                        taping... I hope you don't mind.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        We finished the season and I leave
                        for Florida tomorrow. What a
                        wonderful experience. And the ratings
                        are fantastic. We had a 1.5 our third
                        show. People are really responding.

           William's mood darkens, but stays quiet. Tough to tell if
           Bob is needling him or not.

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                souring
                                       )
                        Forgive me, I can't help still being
                        a little angry about what happened.
                        You hurt my feelings when you said I
                        betrayed you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Well, that's why I'm really here. I
                        came to apologize.

           Bob takes that at face value and relaxes.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I appreciate that. But you didn't
                        have to come all the way down here.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I like to do these things in person.
                               (
                                an idea
                                       )
                        Why don't we get a drink, mend fences
                        over some whiskey?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I gave that up in the Air Force. But
                        I think spending time together would
                        be splendid.
                               (
                                then, smiling
                                             )
                        I know the perfect thing.
           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Bob and William hike down a path. It's a beautiful day.
           Perfect for a walk in the woods.

           Bob leads the way with a warm smile. He's really glad to be
           alive. William follows, but not so sure why.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Where are we going?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Wherever the path takes us. I used to
                        hike in the woods quite a lot when I
                        was stationed in Alaska.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Air Force, right?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I was in for life until I realized
                        I'd rather paint. Leaving was the
                        best decision I ever made.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Getting captured by you guys in the
                        war was mine.

           Bob smiles, enjoying the camaraderie, but notices something
           and stops near a large tree. He goes up to it and puts his
           hand on the trunk.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Look at this incredible white ash.
                        Amazing what Mother Nature can do.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        What's your name, mighty tree?

           William gives Bob a strange look. This has taken a weird
           turn. Bob notices and chuckles.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Oh, I know it's strange, but how else
                        am I supposed to make friends with
                        it? I always say, there's nothing
                        wrong with having a tree as a friend.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's getting late. Let's head back.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        We just started. Nature has so many
                        friends to offer. Squirrels, deer,
                        trees.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB ROSS (cont'd)
                                so lost in the bustle of life,
                        We get
                        we forget what's important. Coming
                        out here reminds me what is.

           Then a RUSTLING NOISE in the leaves. Bob turns and spots a
           squirrel hunting for food. His eyes light up.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Look at this little guy.
                               (
                                bends down, to
                                squirrel)
                        You're looking for your lunch, aren't
                        you little fella?

           Bob chuckles as he digs into his pocket for a carrot and
           holds it out.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I've got something for you right
                        here. Come on. I won't bite. That's
                        it, don't be afraid.

           Bob's soothing voice seems to draw the squirrel in, as it
           skitters across the ground sniffing out the carrot.

           Then the squirrel decides that it's okay and starts nibbling
           on the carrot. Bob smiles.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        There, that's it. It's all yours.

           William is transfixed on Bob's strange behavior, unable to
           move or say a word. He's trapped with no way out.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Now the hard part. We ready?

           Bob reaches with his other hand and very carefully scoops up
           the squirrel while still holding onto the carrot.

           And the squirrel lets him! Bob smiles, as he hands the
           carrot off to the squirrel and props him on his shoulder.

           The squirrel sits calmly on Bob's shoulder nibbling away at
           the carrot.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        See? Cute little devil, isn't he? I
                        think he could use a name. Let's call
                        him Peekaboo. Nice to meet you,
                        Peekaboo.

           Bob gently pets the squirrel's head.
                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                to William
                                          )
                        Would you like to make friends with
                        him, too?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Maybe another time.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Go on, what do you have to lose? New
                        friends bring such joy, and it looks
                        like you could use a little of that.

           William sighs. He has no choice.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Fine, give me the carrot.

           Bob gives him a carrot and puts Peekaboo down.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Go ahead.

           William feels like an idiot, but stoops down and holds out
           the carrot anyway, wiggling it to attract him.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You have to talk to him. But be
                        gentle. He's frightened and you're
                        trying to make a good impression.

                                 WILLIAM
                                feeling stupider
                                                )
                               (
                        Here, friend.
                               (
                                to Bob
                                      )
                        How's that?

           Bob gestures for more. William plays along.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I got a nice juicy carrot for you.
                        Let's eat together, okay?

           William pretends to nibble on the carrot. Bob beams.

                                 WILLIAM
                        See, it's good for you.

           Peekaboo sniffs out the carrot and makes a careful approach.
           Bob's anticipation grows.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        That's it, little fella.
                                to William
                               (
                                          )
                        He's almost there.
           William jiggles the carrot, his eyes lighting up a little.
           He's actually doing it!

           Peekaboo is right there-- and he starts nibbling the carrot.
           William can't believe what's he's accomplishing.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Now, while still holding the carrot,
                        use your other hand and scoop him up.

           William nods and carefully reaches out with his other hand--

           And he scoops him up! Bob beams widely. William also smiles.
           The two men share a moment, a bond perhaps starting to form

           But Peekaboo suddenly jolts and BITES William's hand!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Ow-- shit!

           Peekaboo jumps off and skitters away. William holds his
           hand, a slight trickle of blood forming.

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                chu
                                   ckling)
                        Well, guess he didn't really want to
                        be your friend.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - BATHROOM - DAY

           William sits on the toilet lid, as Margarete uses a Q-tip
           dipped in peroxide to clean the cut.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What if I have rabies? I might start
                        foaming at the mouth!

                                 MARGARETE
                        You do that every day. How can I tell
                        the difference?

           Margarete touches the cut with the Q-tip-- William pulls
           away, wincing in pain!

                                 MARGARETE
                        Sit still!
                               (
                                keeps cleaning
                                              )
                        What were you doing out there anyway?

           William doesn't answer. Margarete gives him a look.

                                 WILLIAM
                        He's using my formula for Magic
                        White. Gertrude told me to get a
                        sample. I'm undercover, like a spy.
                                 MARGARETE
                        You know how ridiculous that sounds?

                                 WILLIAM
                        How else am I supposed to get it? It
                        doesn't go to market for months.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You're turning into a lunatic.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Everything we worked for all our
                        lives has poof-- gone because of him.
                        What else am I supposed to do?

                                 MARGARETE
                        I suppose you have to do something.
                        And so do I.

           Margarete finishes cleaning his hand.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What's that mean?

                                 MARGARETE
                        I'm going back to teaching. I've been
                        practicing to get back into shape, in
                        case you haven't noticed.

                                 WILLIAM
                        But the business...

                                 MARGARETE
                        What business? There's no show. Fans
                        hardly write. Supplies are down. Even
                        the video series is in doubt.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Maybe it's time to move on.

           Margarete tosses the bloodied Q-tips and bandage wrappers
           away, and leaves William alone on the toilet.

           INT. BOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Clearwater, Florida.

           Wearing his Kimono, Bob is cooking shrimp gumbo with light
           jazz playing in the background.

           As he sips tea, the phone RINGS. Bob goes to answer.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Hello?
                                 WILLIAM
                        Hi, it's Bill.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - STUDIO - DAY

           William sits before the canvas with dried paint covering the
           photo of Bob.

                                 BOB ROSS (OVER PHONE)
                        Good to hear from you. How's your
                        hand doing?  I've never seen someone
                        run from a squirrel so fast before.

           INTERCUT - BOB AND WILLIAM

           William lets out a sigh. He doesn't want to talk about that.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm okay. Listen, I'm calling to ask
                        a favor?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Of course. Anything for you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's for the video series. I'm
                        thinking of having guest painters and
                        I want you to be the first one. What
                        do you say? We can finally have our
                        pass the paint brush moment.

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                smiling
                                       )
                        That would mean so much to me. I can
                        make a trip up there--

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, I'll come to you.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, the closest studio is in Tampa.
                        With traffic, that's a good 30
                        minutes both ways. It's best I come
                        to you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        But I've got it all figured out. We
                        do it in your backyard. Mother nature
                        will be our studio. Let me take care
                        of everything. All you do is get
                        ready to paint.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        It would make me happy if you say
                        yes.
                                 BOB ROSS
                        If that's the case, anything I can do
                        to make you happy.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

           William has an open suitcase on the bed and slowly packs for
           his trip. Margarete comes in from the hallway--

                                 MARGARETE
                        I'm going to the store. Do you need--
                               (
                                notices
                                       )
                        Where you going?

           William looks up and puts on a good face, suddenly as bright
           as he can be.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Great news! I found somebody to sell
                        our supplies. A new retailer. Isn't
                        that fantastic?

           Margarete is surprised.

                                 MARGARETE
                        When? How did this happen?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Things always fall out of the sky. I
                        got a call from somebody who
                        remembered the show and heard our
                        line was available. You see? They
                        haven't forgotten me yet.

                                 MARGARETE
                        That's great. Who's the retailer?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Some place in Florida. I can't
                        remember the name right now. But I
                        have to go and meet them in person.
                        Soon as possible.

                                 MARGARETE
                               (
                                growing wary
                                            )
                        Okay, I'll pack my bag.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I want to go alone. Let me take care
                        of these things for once.

                                 MARGARETE
                        It's my job because you have no mind
                        for business. I'm going.
           William grows desperate.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It'll be okay. I want to do this.

           Now Margarete knows something is wrong, but she doesn't want
           to fight. She stares at him a beat and then leaves.

           William lowers his head, feeling awful about lying to her.

           EXT. SINGLE LEVEL HOME - DAY

           A cab pulls out front and William gets out. He removes
           several bags, including cameras, from the trunk.

           The cab drives off. William turns to the house.

           INT. BOB'S HOME - DAY

           DING-DONG.

           Bob answers the door and sees William.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Bill, how was the trip down? The
                        flight okay?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Good. Do you mind?

           Bob sees the equipment by his feet and reaches for it,
           notices no one else is with him.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Where's the crew?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I got everything we need right here.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Shouldn't we have some help?

                                 WILLIAM
                        The network is being cheap. They said
                        there's no money for crew. So I say,
                        why not do it ourselves? We set up
                        the cameras and let it roll.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, if you think that can work.

           Bob opens the door for William, helping him with the bags.
                                 BOB ROSS
                        Margarete didn't come? I was hoping
                        to take you guys out for crab and key
                        lime pie. There's a wonderful place
                        up the road.

                                 WILLIAM
                        She's not not feeling so good. We
                        should get started.

           William grabs a couple bags and follows Bob.

           As they move through, William looks around to get a sense of
           the place. He sees the gold pans on the wall, the Bohemian
           decor, the '70s-style shag rug--

           He also sees framed photos on various surfaces. Some are of
           BOB'S SON at various ages. But a few frames are face down.

           Bob disappears into the kitchen. William stops and quickly
           flips one of the photos. It's a recent one of Bob and his
           teenage son with arms around a BLONDE WOMAN between them.

           William puts the photo back before he gets caught.

           He moves into a SHORT HALLWAY, where he sees a door cracked
           open a little. Curious, he goes to peak inside--

                                 BOB ROSS (O.S.)
                        Oops, wrong way.

           William turns.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        It goes down to my studio.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Wonderful! I'd love to see where the
                        magic happens.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        We should probably get in a few takes
                        before we lose the light.

           Bob leads him away from the door. William eyes it, as he
           moves away.

           EXT. BOB'S BACKYARD - DAY

           It's late afternoon. There's an easel with a blank canvas
           set up underneath a large tree.

           William fiddles with a camera on a tripod with a tilted
           viewfinder and built-in microphone.
           He's trying to connect various cables. Bob waits off to the
           side, arms folded and impatient.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Need help?

           William waves him off and connects the power cord. He looks
           into the camera bag and feigns surprise.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Oh, can you believe this? I forgot
                        the video tapes in the house. I'll be
                        right back.

           William starts to move away--

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Don't bother.

           He stops. Bob goes over to his own bag and brings it over.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I have some right here.

           He reaches in and produces a VHS tape. Annoyed, William
           grabs it and puts it into the camera.

           Bob readies his palette and gets in front of the camera.
           William hits record, grabs his palette and stands next to
           him. Both look at the camera, all smiles.

           A beat.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Do you want me to start?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's okay, I'll do it. Ready?
                        Three... two... one...
                                to camera
                               (
                                         )
                        Hello and welcome to my new video
                        series, The Art of Bill Alexander.
                        I'm so happy that you can join us.
                        Today we have a wonderful guest, Bob
                        Ross, and we're going to paint with
                        him a beautiful woodland scene--

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm sorry. Do you think you should
                        say the name of my show? "Bob Ross
                        from The Joy of Painting?" We can do
                        a little cross promotion.
                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        Fine. Three... two... one...
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Hello, and welcome to my new video
                        series, The Art of Bill Alexander--

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm sorry again. But maybe I should
                        introduce myself. You do you, like
                        you just did, and I'll come right in
                        after. Does that work?

           William throws up his hands.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm sorry. Let's do it one more time.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You know, I have an idea. We write
                        down our lines so we know exactly
                        what to say.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I can wing it. Let's keep going.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'd really feel more comfortable
                        knowing the words. Maybe we get
                        something to write on?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Stay right here.

           Bob pauses the camera and goes inside the house.

           William makes sure Bob's gone and starts to snoop around. He
           sees the basement window and heads right for it.

           Getting down on all fours, he presses his face against the
           grimy glass and shields out the sun--

           WILLIAM'S POV - A messy studio with snapshots and postcards
           of various landscapes everywhere. Taped to walls, tacked to
           cork boards, strewn about the floor...

           There's also a lot of paintings. Dozens lined in rows
           against one wall.

           And then a stack of boxes covered by a tarp in the corner.
           Part of the tarp is pulled back, revealing a box with
           Caution - Hazardous Materials written on it.

           CRACK! The sound of a screen door closing.
           BACK TO WILLIAM

           Who jumps to his feet, his suspicions confirmed.

           He sees Bob looking around for him, pad and pen in hand, and
           spots him in the driveway.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        There you are. I don't have cue cards
                        to write on, but then again we don't
                        have anyone to hold them.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You know what? I'm thirsty. Why don't
                        we go inside for a drink?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        What about the light? The sun will
                        set real soon.

                                 WILLIAM
                        One drink. We'll be fine.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Okay, I have coffee, juice, water--

                                 WILLIAM
                        Nothing stronger?

                               (
                                thinking
                                 BOB ROSS
                                        )
                        No, I-- wait, I did receive a bottle
                        of Scotch one year for Christmas.
                        It's sort of been hanging around the
                        house ever since.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Perfect.

           William heads into the house. Bob follows.

           INT. BOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           William cracks open the Scotch and pours two glasses. He
           hands one off to Bob, who refuses.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You're forgetting I gave that up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Come on. We toast our renewed
                        friendship. It won't kill you.

           William holds up his glass. Bob lets out a sigh.
                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                               )
                                takes the glass
                        To art and friendship.

           They toast, as Bob takes the smallest of sips.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        That's strong... and actually pretty
                        darn good. Heck, I've forgotten how
                        much I like this.

           He takes another sip. William smiles and downs his in one
           gulp, before pouring another.

           William watches Bob drink. A thought comes over him.
           Something that's been bothering him ever since the two met.

           Bob notices.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        What?

                                 WILLIAM
                        This whole time I can't figure out
                        what the devil's wrong with you.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I don't understand.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You're always smiling, never raise
                        your voice. You talk to trees. Why
                        are you so happy all the time?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        To be honest, I'm not always happy. I
                        just don't show it. Lately, though,
                        some things have made it hard for me
                        to be happy at all.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's crazy. Your life is great.
                        You're on TV, you paint for millions
                        of people. What's not be happy about?

           Bob finishes his glass. William pours him another.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        There's more to life than some TV
                        show. Don't get me wrong, I
                        appreciate every moment, and I owe a
                        lot to you. But-- no, I can't. I
                        don't much like talking about myself.
                                 WILLIAM
                        I thought we were friends. What good
                        is that if we don't share?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You're right... I went through a
                        divorce. Real bad one. There was a
                        lot of anger and yelling, if you can
                        believe it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That why all the frames are down?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm just glad we got through it in
                        one piece, and our son doesn't hate
                        either one of us.
                               (
                                shrugs, then
                                            )
                        But it helped me realize something:
                        Always appreciate every day that
                        you're alive.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sounds like fortune cookie bullshit.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, why are you so unhappy all the
                        time? I know I've poked fun at you
                        about it, but boy, you really are a
                        miserable son of a bitch.
                               (
                                chuckling
                                         )
                        Sorry, that's the Scotch talking.

           Bob drinks more. William glares at him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You have no I idea what I've gone
                        through. Growing up poor. Almost
                        killed in that godforsaken war. I
                        struggled for years selling my art.
                        And I got divorced, too. But that's
                        not the worst-- forget it.

           William drinks.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        What good is being friends if we
                        don't share?

           Bob puts a gentle hand on his shoulder. It's a calming
           gesture that's also a little unnerving, like he's reaching
           into a place William really doesn't want to go.
                                 WILLIAM
                        My father.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        We all have issues with our fathers.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Mine was a bastard. He left our
                        mother as she died of consumption.
                        The son of a bitch killed her!

           William SLAMS his glass down. He grips the counter to steady
           himself. Bob looks on, sympathetic.

           A beat, as William calms himself enough to speak.

                                 WILLIAM
                        He made me leave home when I was 14,
                        and I never saw my family again.
                        Everything changed.

           William looks away, like he doesn't completely believe that
           last part. Bob gets a plastic cup and pours another for him.
           William looks at before drinking.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Have you ever thought, what if things
                        were different?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I wouldn't be here, that's for sure.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Just listen!

           William clams up. Did Bob just yell at him?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        What if you weren't thrown into to
                        the world so fast-- what could've
                        happened? You probably stay in
                        Germany, marry some girl, have a
                        family. Then the war comes and you're
                        drafted into a another unit... and
                        you get killed. Or maybe you survive
                        and go back home instead of getting
                        captured and coming here.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I know what you're doing.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Let me finish! That means you never
                        go on the road and paint, and The
                        Magic of Oil Painting never exists.
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOB ROSS (cont'd)
                        And then I never take your class or
                        watch the show, and The Joy of
                        Painting never exists, either.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Imagine that.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm serious. Because of what happened
                        with your father, you went down a
                        certain path that allowed you touch
                        so many lives-- and in ways you might
                        not ever understand.

           William crosses his arms.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You know nothing about my father.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        "Without the darkness, there can be
                        no light."

                                 WILLIAM
                        More fortune cookie bullshit.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You said that. On your show.
                               (
                                off William
                                           )

                               (
                                    )
                        You were talking about how to use
                        dark colors to make lighter ones
                        stand out. But I always thought it
                        meant that without life's bad moments
                        we might never see the good ones. We
                        appreciate the good moments when they
                        come around, and they do more a lot
                        more than we realize. All we have to
                        do is look.
                                then
                        Go ahead, try it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Look around you. Start with the show.
                        So what if you're not on TV anymore?
                        You had seven wonderful years. If I
                        can have half that, I'd be grateful.

                                 WILLIAM
                        This is ridiculous.
                                 BOB ROSS
                        Try it. Think about all the people
                        you've touched over the years and how
                        their lives might've been different
                        if you didn't.

           Bob's soothing tone gets William to shut up and listen.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        And what about your home? For a long
                        time you and Margarete never had one.
                        Now you have a beautiful place to
                        call your own.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        And Margarete. Think about how
                        wonderful she is. She's not just your
                        wife, she's your best friend, a
                        talented artist, and a tough cookie
                        in business. Believe me, I know.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Where would she be without you? Where
                        would you be without her?

           William's face starts to quiver. Bob is breaking him down
           before our eyes.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        She's been with you through all your
                        ups and downs. Never once wavered or
                        gave up on you. That's love. Think
                        about all the people who've never had
                        such great love in their lives.

           That's it! William rushes out the room. Bob watches him go.

           INT. BATHROOM - BOB'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           William bursts through the door, locks himself inside and
           loses it. He breaks down and SOBS-- big drunken German sobs
           that sound more like the wail of dying seal.

           William takes a few deep breaths and looks at himself in the
           mirror. His mind drifts, and we TRANSITION TO:

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           East Prussia. 1931.

           Young William looks at himself in a mirror, eyes filled with
           regret. He wears a hat and coat, like he's ready to leave.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Bag slung over his shoulder, William looks down at a grave.
           The headstone reads: MARTHA ALEXANDER 1893-1931.
           Hesitant, William turns his heavy gaze toward another
           headstone: FREDRICK ALEXANDER 1917-1927.

           William can't look anymore and turns, but right behind him
           is a disheveled OLD MAN, drunk and in tattered clothes.

           William recognizes him. And so do we. It's his father.

           William glares at the old bastard, a twisted mix of emotion.
           His father, shattered and alone, moves past William like he
           wasn't there and kneels down before the graves.

           William can feel nothing but contempt watching his father
           weep and turns his back to leave, as we TRANSITION BACK TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - BOB'S HOME - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           William looks at himself again the mirror, sad and broken.

           INT. HALLWAY - BOB'S HOME - MINUTES LATER

           William exits the bathroom having composed himself enough
           and heads back toward the kitchen.

           For a moment, he walks like he's move across a shaky bridge
           stretched across a long chasm, his mind flooded with Scotch
           and torn emotions.

           INT. BOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Bob is at the coffeemaker scooping in grounds. He turns when
           William comes back in.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        How about something to wake us up?

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's late. I should go.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Oh, sure. I'll call you a cab.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll wait outside.

           SHORT HALLWAY

           William passes the basement door. Now it's closed all the
           way. He looks at it a moment, and moves heavily away.

           INT. GERTRUDE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A small one-bedroom somewhere in D.C. Pictures of Martin
           Luther King and Shirley Chisholm on the walls.
           Gertrude has the phone to her ear and is sitting behind an
           easel with brush in hand, face and smock smudged with paint.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You get the paint?

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           William sits on the bed, phone to his ear.

           INTERCUT - WILLIAM AND GERTRUDE

                                 WILLIAM (INTO PHONE)
                        It was in the basement and-- never
                        mind, I didn't get it yet.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What's wrong? You sound different.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why is everybody so concerned with
                        how I feel? I'm fine.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Hey, you'll never guess what I'm
                        doing right now.
                                before he can answer
                                                    )
                               (
                        I'm painting.

           William is taken aback.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Really? That's wonderful. But I
                        thought you gave that up?

           Gertrude looks at her attempt to paint a cabin in the woods.
           There are a couple of other finished canvases against the
           wall. All can charitably be described as awful.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Well, yeah. I did. But I went back
                        and started watching tapes of your
                        show to, you know, familiarize myself
                        a little more. And then I remembered
                        how much the show got me through my
                        recovery.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Those first few months were the
                        hardest of my life. All I thought
                        about was having just one drink. But
                        the only time I didn't was when I was
                        watching the show.

           William is genuinely touched.
                                 WILLIAM
                        I don't know what to say.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I know it's hard, but we're gonna do
                        this. When I got sober, I didn't
                        think I'd last a day. But I took it
                        one day at a time, and here I am.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        We are gonna take Bob to the cleaners
                        whether he likes it or not. Just get
                        the paint and I'll do the rest.

           Gertrude hangs up and goes back to painting, brimming with
           confidence.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           William sags on the bed looking at a photo he brought of him
           and Margarete next to their van.

           He ponders the photo and picks up the phone. But he can't
           bring himself to call and cradles the receiver.

           EXT. BOB'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           There's a light on in the far bedroom. Otherwise, it's quiet
           and dark.

           Which is good, because William is sneaking around the other
           side of the house armed with a flashlight and crowbar.

           Looking around, he moves in front of the garage-- and the
           FLOOD LIGHTS turn on!

           Shit! William ducks into the shadows next a tall fence.

           He eyes the house, waiting for more lights to turn on
           inside. But they never do.

           And the flood lights TURN OFF.

           William sighs in relief. He moves carefully for the basement
           window and stoops down.

           He checks the window, but it's latched from the inside.

           William wedges the crowbar between the jam and frame, and
           pries it open-- CRACK!

           INT. BOB'S BASEMENT STUDIO - SAME

           It's dark, but we can see William's shape struggling to
           squeeze through feet first. William grunts and groans, his
           feet dangling as he gives it one last hard push--
           And he falls onto the floor out of breath.

           A beat, as he makes sure nobody heard him.

           Then William turns on his flashlight, keeps his beam low,
           and heads for the boxes.

           He pulls back the tarp and reaches into one of the open
           boxes, and finds exactly what he's looking for-- a can of
           Bob Ross Liquid White.

           He's got it! But now he has to get back out.

           William goes to the window to get out, but he can't squeeze
           back through and gives up.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                whispering
                                          )
                        Shit!

           He shines the light on the stairs, and realizes he has no
           choice but to go up to get out.

           Taking a breath, William puts a foot on the first step--

           CREAK! William jumps back. A beat. Nothing stirs above.

           He tries again, this time going onto the second step. That
           one's better.

           William makes his way up the stairs and reaches the top.

           He puts an ear to the door and hears a SOFT VOICE talking
           continuously. It sounds far enough away to open the door--

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME

           William slowly pokes his head out. No one there. The soft
           voice is coming from the bedroom. It's repeating something
           over and over again, like a mantra...

           William sees his avenue for escape, but the cracked open
           door beckons him to look--

           He can't resist. William quietly heads over. Now we can hear
           that the soft voice is Bob...

                                 BOB ROSS (O.S.)
                        The secret to doing anything is to
                        believe... Anything that you believe
                        in strongly... As long as you
                        believe, you can do anything you put
                        your mind to...

           William gets to the door and peaks inside--
           WILLIAM'S POV -- Bob is sitting in front of a vanity mirror
           naked from tip to toe, as he twists thin curlers into his
           long straight hair.

           He drops one on the floor and leans over to pick it up.
           Turning his head, Bob appears to see something behind him--

           ON WILLIAM

           Pressing against the wall. Holy shit, did Bob see him? He's
           freaking out, as we're--

           BACK TO BOB

           A beat, then he smiles, as a warm thought comes over him. He
           straightens up and looks into the mirror.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        There are no mistakes. Only happy
                        accidents.

           Bob chuckles and grabs a pen to write that one down.

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - SAME

           William slowly backs away and makes it down the hallway. He
           goes through the kitchen and slips out the back door.

           EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - SAME

           William hurries down the driveway, paint can in hand, as the
           FLOOD LIGHT turns on--

           William presses against the fence. A beat, then the flood
           lights go out. William breathes a sigh of relief--

           But then he hears SQUEAKING SOUND next to him--

           Terrified, William turns and sees a SQUIRREL on the fence
           next to his head. It gets up on its hind legs, front arms
           out like it's ready to strike--

           William freaks out and trips over the garbage cans as he
           tries to run away--

           Now a light goes on inside Bob's kitchen.

           William gets to his feet and waddle-runs as fast as he can--

           He makes it to the end of the driveway and onto the street.
           There aren't many places to hide--

           So he ducks behind a parked car and waits, sweating and out
           of breath--
           EXT. BOB'S HOME - BACK DOOR - SAME

           Bob exits in his kimono, looks around, and sees the basement
           window broken open. And the crowbar on the ground.

           He lets out a sigh.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Gripping the crowbar, Bob emerges from down his driveway,
           looks up and down the street.

           BEHIND THE PARKED CAR

           William leans against the back, eyes wide with panic.

           From that vantage point, we see Bob step onto the street in
           the background. He's little more than a blurry afro.

           Bob turns to look in William's direction and holds a moment.
           Does he see him? It's not clear.

           William stays frozen, breathing through his mouth and trying
           to stay quiet, as Bob holds his gaze--

           And then he moves toward William!

           William panics, as Bob's bare feet SLAPPING on the concrete
           grows louder--

           Now Bob comes into focus, passes the driver's side door of
           the car William's hiding behind--

           And stops right at the rear quarter panel.

           Sweat pours down William's face, and he stops breathing, not
           wanting to make any sound--

           Both stay like that for what feels like forever. William's
           cheeks puff, as he struggles not to breathe--

           And Bob sighs again, turns and heads back to his driveway.

           William lets out the air and breathes heavily, then peaks
           around the side of the car and sees Bob is gone.

           He cradles the paint can and runs for it.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           William sits with Gertrude in a back booth, a suitcase on
           the floor and carry-on next to him.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        You have something for me?
           He reaches into the carry-on, takes out the can of Bob's
           LIQUID WHITE and slides it across the table.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Great! I'll get it tested right away.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        So tell me about the trip.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        I'm exhausted. I want to go home.

           Gertrude watches William get up and leave.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           William drags himself in through the front door and drops
           his suitcase.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello? Anyone home?

           A beat, then Margarete enters dressed to leave.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Hello.

           She goes to the hall closet for her coat. Uncomfortable
           silence. William struggles for something to say.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You're not going to ask me how was
                        the trip?

           She closes the door and puts on her coat.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Do I really need to?

           A beat.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Where you off to?

           Margarete doesn't answer. She goes back to the other room
           and emerges with a small suitcase. William is devastated.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You're leaving me?

                                 MARGARETE
                        You can't be serious.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I'm teaching a class at the senior
                        center.
                               (
                                relieved
                                 WILLIAM
                                        )
                        That's great. See, I told you. Bill
                        Alexander is a name. People never
                        forget.

           Margarete heads for the door and then stops. She can't leave
           without speaking her mind, and turns to face him.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You lied to me. You didn't go to
                        Florida to talk to a retailer. You
                        went there because of him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I can explain.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What would be the point?
                                    )
                               (
                                then
                        This feud with Bob is out of hand. I
                        have felt many things for you over
                        the years, but never disappointment.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You can't mean that.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Yes, I do! You've been acting exactly
                        like-- never mind.

           William glares at her.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Like what?

           Margarete glares.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You can't see? The lying, the heavy
                        drinking, the anger-- you're acting
                        exactly like him.

           Her words plunge in like a dagger. Margarete picks up her
           things again and heads out.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           On the sofa, William is curled up under a blanket, tossing
           and turning, but not really sleeping.

           He struggles to keep his eyes closed, as we CUT TO:
           EXT. ALEXANDER FARM - DAY

           East Prussia. 1927.

           William staggers back to the farm, face etched in shock and
           covered with Fredrick's blood. It's a continuation of the
           opening scene.

           From the barn, his father, drunk, sees the blood. Eyes wide,
           he charges up to William, demanding to know what happened--

           And that's when older brother Paul arrives, carrying
           Fredrick's limp and bloodied body.

           William shakes in fear. Anguished, his father runs up to
           Paul and takes Fredrick from him. Their mother runs out of
           the cabin and crumbles to her knees.

           His father gently lays Fredrick on the ground, brushes back
           blonde hair matted with blood. And he looks at William.

           William is frozen. The world blurs. All he can see is the
           distorted image of his father rushing toward him--

           Now the world turns upside down, as William is dragged into
           the barn and thrown to the ground--

           William's father, his face twisted in anguish, savagely
           beats his son. And the world TURNS BLACK.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT (PRESENT DAY)

           William jolts awake, sweating profusely from the terrifying
           memory. He quickly turns on a light.

           A beat. Then he looks up at the staircase--

           Where Margarete is standing. Soon as he sees her, she heads
           back up the stairs.

           William turns back and stares off into the void.

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN  BUS - DRIVING - DAY

           William is behind the wheel, lost in thought and in life.
           Disheveled and unshaven. A complete wreck.

           He's passes by the Leewards he and Bob visited months ago.
           William glances at the store-- and SLAMS the brakes--

           Cars HONK as they pass. But William doesn't care. He's
           fixated on something. And he's stunned.
           INT. LEEWARDS - DAY

           William enters and looks around. Instantly he's greeted by
           his worst fucking nightmare:

           A cardboard cutout of BOB ROSS front and center. Smiling
           with that weird afro and holding a can of Liquid White. Bob
           Ross' original Liquid White paint only sold here!

           Bob's section dominates the front of the store. It's a
           better placement than William had.

           William looks for his supplies, but his section is gone. He
           finds the same Stock Boy from before and approaches, only
           now he's looked at like a complete stranger.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Steven, what happened to my supplies?
                               (
                                off Stock Boy
                                             )
                        It's Bill Alexander. You don't
                        remember?

                                 STOCK BOY
                        Oh, yeah-- I'm sorry. They're in the
                        back. If we even have them anymore.

           William hurriedly heads that way.

           BACK AISLE

           William looks high and low, and finally finds his supplies
           on the bottom shelf all the way in back. And his cut out is
           gone. He's devastated.

           FRONT OF THE STORE

           William moves past Bob's display. He turns and PUNCHES
           Cardboard Bob's smiling face, leaving a nice dent.

           Heads turn, as he pushes out the front door.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - STUDIO - NIGHT

           William stares at a blank canvas again. Then he looks over
           at a full bottle of whiskey on a shelf.

           Ignoring the bottle, he turns back to the canvas and tries
           to focus with a few deep breaths, the photo of his dad
           looming nearby.

           William opens his eyes and lifts his brush with a trembling
           hand-- but he can't do it!

           He puts the brush down, as a thought comes over him. William
           makes a decision.
           EXT. RENTAL HOME - STREET - NIGHT

           Carrying the easel and art supplies, William tosses it all
           in the trash cans next to the house.

           He slams home the metal lid, knocking over one of the cans
           and spilling its contents everywhere.

           William kicks it for good measure, hurts his foot, and limps
           back inside.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Still in pain, William stumbles inside, where Margarete is
           there waiting for him.

           William stops and meets her eyes. A long moment between
           them. Something unspoken. William finally understands.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Okay. Let's go home.

           Margarete smiles, glad William has come to his senses.

           EXT. RENTAL HOME - DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

           William closes the back of the van, having packed the last
           of their things.

           He climbs into the passenger side, where Margarete waits
           behind the wheel.

           Margarete gives him a sad smile and drives away.

           INT. ALEXANDER HOME - BACKYARD - DAY

           Costa Mesa, California.

           Time has passed. William is building a small man-made pond.
           He already has the hole dug and is laying down the liner.

           But William looks healthier. More tan and robust.

           Margarete comes outside with two lemonades. She's smudged
           with dirt and sweat.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Here, drink something before you keel
                        over and die of dehydration.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Put it there. I'll drink in a minute.

           Margarete puts the glass down next to him and drinks hers.
           She watches as William is laser-focused on his work.
                                 MARGARETE
                        So, I was thinking you could come to
                        the rec center and do one of the
                        classes. I have lots of new students
                        and could use the help.

           William keeps working and doesn't look up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You doing great without me. I'll stay
                        here, it's fine.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Bill. BILL.

           William finally stops and looks up.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You haven't picked up a brush in
                        months.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And I'm fine. Lots of things to do
                        around here. After the pond, I'll
                        build a chicken coop. I've always
                        wanted chickens running around.

           Margarete is about to say something else, but the phone
           RINGS inside the house.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll get it.

           William clamors out of the hole and heads inside.

           INT. ALEXANDER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           William wipes his hands and brow on a paper towel, as the
           phone continues to RING.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                answering
                                         )
                        Yes, hello?

           INT. GERTRUDE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Gertrude is on the phone surrounded by boxes piled in the
           corner. All her stuff is packed away. She's moving out.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It's your favorite attorney.

           INTERCUT - WILLIAM AND GERTRUDE AS NEEDED
                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello, Gertrude. Good to hear from
                        you again. What's up?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I have great news.

           Margarete appears in the doorway and leans against the
           frame, arms crossed.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Who is it?

           William cups the receiver.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Gertrude.
                               (
                                into phone
                                          )
                        Sorry about that. What's the news?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        The paint is a match. Except for a
                        minor ingredient, it's identical to
                        yours.

           No reaction, as William matches eyes with Margarete. But she
           can tell he's conflicted. And so can we.

                                 WILLIAM
                        So, what do we do?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        We file suit.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        I don't think we should do that.

           Gertrude is incredulous.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It's your formula and he's selling it
                        under his name. This is what you
                        hired me to do. But now you're gonna
                        let him make money off your work?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don't know, Gertrude.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Listen, I understand... You're afraid
                        of failing.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's not it.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        Can I tell you a secret? I almost
                        didn't show up that day I came to
                        your house. I was terrified of you
                        rejecting me.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        But I went through it anyway and
                        realized you wanted me to be your
                        lawyer. You have no idea how much I
                        needed that. Now I have other clients
                        and I'm moving into a real office.
                        All because you told me yes when
                        everyone else said no.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        If you say no, you'll regret it
                        forever. This isn't about paint--
                        it's your life. All those years of
                        struggle and that little bit of
                        success you finally earned. It's
                        about your legacy. Who remembers Bill
                        Alexander. If they even do.

           A long beat. William looks at Margarete, feeling the weight
           of the moment. A silent pull coming from both women.

           EXT. BOB'S BACKYARD - DAY

           Bob is underneath a large tree holding a BABY SQUIRREL and
           feeding it from a tiny bottle, smiling warmly. [Bob really
           did this-- Google it!]

           It's a very touching Bob Ross moment that gets suddenly
           interrupted.

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Ross?

           Bob turns around and sees a MAN in a Hawaiian shirt and
           sunglasses standing in his drive way.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Yes?

           Hawaiian Shirt Man drops papers on the ground.

                                 HAWAIIAN SHIRT MAN
                        You've been served.
           INT. DON'S OFFICE - KOCE STUDIOS - DAY

           William and Margarete sit with Don, who's leaning over his
           phone. There are boxes piled in the corner. Don is moving.

           Everyone looks tense, as we hear FAYE yell at them over the
           loudspeaker.

                                 FAYE (ON SPEAKER)
                        Unbelievable. Do you any idea what
                        this means to the network?

           William is back on his heels.

                                 WILLIAM
                        But he stole from me.

                                 FAYE (ON SPEAKER)
                        He says he didn't-- and you know
                        what? I believe him. But now he's
                        moving to another affiliate.

                                 MARGARETE
                        What does Bill's lawsuit have to do
                        with PBS?

                                 FAYE (ON SPEAKER)
                        He's one of our stars. You might as
                        well be suing Big Bird.

                                 WILLIAM
                        But what about the video series...
                        and the books...

                                 FAYE (ON SPEAKER)
                        You breached your contract after
                        walking out on the pilot.
                               t( hen, intensely)
                        The world needs Bob Ross, not Bill
                        Alexander.

           Faye hangs up. Don turns off the speaker with a sheepish
           look on his face.

                                 DON
                        I'm sorry, Bill.

           William gets up and leaves. Margarete glares at Don.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You could've said something on his
                        behalf.

           Margarete goes after William.
           INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUS - DAY

           William is already in the passenger seat when Margarete gets
           in behind the wheel. He's devastated.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I ruined everything. I should have
                        listened to you.

                                 MARGARETE
                        It doesn't matter. Right now we need
                        to worry about what happens with the
                        rest of our lives.

           William has nothing to say. He's a shell of his former self.
           Margarete turns away, thinking, and gets an idea.

                                 MARGARETE
                        I know what will help.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What?

           William looks at Margarete for an answer, but he doesn't get
           one. She just smiles and starts the van to drive away.

           EXT. PUBLIC PARK - DAY

           Margarete pulls the van to the curb and gets out. She rounds
           the back and starts pulling out art supplies: canvas, easel,
           paints, the works.

           William stays in van looking out of the window.

           Margarete sets everything up, takes a breath, and turns to
           address various PARK GOERS and PASSERS-BY.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Excuse me, can I have your attention?

           Maybe a couple of heads turn, but mostly she's ignored.

           Margarete puts her fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES. Now
           people are listening.

           William rolls down the window to hear what she says.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Right here in this van I have one of
                        the world's most famous painters.

           William rolls the window back up halfway, as a CROWD starts
           to gather. All kinds of people, young and old alike.
                                 MARGARETE
                        And he will paint some of the most
                        beautiful landscapes you've ever seen
                        in under 30 minutes.

           A YOUNG MOM with her DAUGHTER looks skeptical.

                                 YOUNG MOM
                        Yeah? Who is it?

                                 MARGARETE
                        Bill Alexander.

           Deafening silence. Nobody recognizes it. A STONER GUY (20s)
           raises his hand.

                                 STONER GUY
                        Is that the guy with the afro?

           Now the crowd knows who it is. Nods of recognition, and
           murmurs of I love that guy.

           William hears this and pushes his way out of the van--

                                 WILLIAM
                        I taught afro guy how to paint!

           Heads turn. Some chuckles from the crowd.

                                 WILLIAM
                        If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't
                        know who he is. And I'll prove it.

           Arms cross, all eyes on William. Lots of expectant looks.
           William starts to feel the pressure.

           He grabs his palette and a large brush. Margarete steps
           back, as William goes up to the canvas.

           But he's nervous. It's been so long since he's done this.

                                 YOUNG MOM
                        So... go on.

           William takes a few short breaths and turns to look at the
           faces in the crowd, all of them stern and unforgiving--

           As he scans them, they all MORPH into some hideous mutation
           of his father. Male, female, child-- doesn't matter, they
           all look like him--

           William shakes it off. He grabs hold of himself, opens a can
           of white paint and wets his brush--
                                 WILLIAM
                        We start by filling the canvas with
                        Magic White.

           Then he glides the wet brush across the canvas. And in an
           instant, he's back.

           His strokes grow more emphatic, more confident, as he wets
           the canvas with white paint.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We make sure to cover the whole
                        thing. Do it many times. Get it nice
                        and wet-- that's the key to my
                        technique.

           The crowd draws closer, as William switches brushes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Now, what do we want to paint? Name
                        it, I'll do it for you right now. And
                        better than afro guy ever could.

           More LAUGHS. He's winning the crowd over.

           The young mom's daughter comes up to him. William bends down
           with a smile.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You have an idea?

                                 YOUNG MOM'S DAUGHTER
                        A mountain with lots of trees.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Perfect, let's do that.

           William switches brushes and dips his paint in blue paint.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We put some Prussian blue on our
                        brush like so. Make sure to fill it
                        up with lots of paint-- and then we
                        FIRE IN to paint a happy blue sky.

           William spreads blue paint across the canvas, and like magic
           there's a bright blue sky up top. William comes alive for
           the first time in months. Maybe even years.

           As he loses himself in his work, Margarete watches, a warm
           smile on her face.
           EXT. VOLKSWAGEN BUS - EVENING

           It's later in the day and William is packing his things into
           the back of the van.

           Margarete sells an OLDER MAN the last of the paintings,
           waves goodbye and heads over.

           William watches her with a big smile on his face. Margarete
           flashes the money on the sly.

                                 MARGARETE
                        We did some good business today.
                        Almost felt like the old days.
                                        )
                               (
                                noticing
                        What is it?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Nothing. Just looking.

                                 MARGARETE
                        At what?

                                 WILLIAM
                        One of the good moments.

           Smiling, William opens the passenger side door for her.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'll drive.

           She climbs in, as he rounds the front.

           INT. RENTAL HOME - NIGHT

           William and Margarete enter after the demonstration, tired
           but satisfied with the day's work.

           Margarete sees the answering machine blinking, hits play.
           After the BEEP:

                                 FAYE (ON MACHINE)
                        Bill, it's Faye. Listen, we want you
                        to come out for a meeting.

           Off William and Margarete exchanging a look.

           INT. FAYE'S OFFICE - PBS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           There's a KNOCK on the door. We don't see who's in the room
           yet, but Faye's voice calls out--

                                 FAYE (O.S.)
                        Come in.
           Her ASSISTANT opens the door and lets William inside. He
           stops cold when he sees--

           Bob sitting on the couch against the wall. Faye is behind
           her desk. Neither looks happy to be there.

           And now neither does William. He's red hot off the bat.

                                 WILLIAM
                        What's this?

                                 FAYE
                               (
                                beat,
                                      gets up)
                        I'll leave you two alone.

           William is incredulous, as Faye leaves the room. Now it's
           just the two of them. William folds his arms, not looking at
           Bob. An uncomfortable beat.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        My attorney told me I shouldn't talk
                        to you.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Then why are you?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        We have some things left to say, and
                        I wanted to do that on neutral
                        ground. You know, despite everything
                        I hope that we're still friends.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Friends don't steal.

           Bob reaches into his pocket and produces the Polaroid that
           was dropped in his basement. William sits on the couch.

           Bob gets up and sits across from him. He leans forward,
           removing his glasses. There's a hint of malice in his eyes.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        You broke into my house. There are
                        consequences for that. And I can use
                        it to get your lawsuit thrown out.
                        All I need to do is say the word. But
                        I want to give you chance to do the
                        right thing, and drop it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        All I wanted was to teach others how
                        to paint. Its the purest joy I've
                        ever known. Their faces light up when
                        they fire in and see what they can do
                        on that canvas.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIAM (cont'd)
                        I
                           was able to bring that joy to lots
                        of people all over the world, and you
                        took that from me.

           A beat. Bob leans back, putting his glasses back on.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I want you to think about what you're
                        doing. Really think. You won't win.
                        So what do you hope to get from all
                        this? Certainly not happiness.

           That strikes a chord, but William isn't ready to give up.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You don't deserve to enjoy what I
                        struggled to build.

           Bob sees he's not getting through and gets up. It's time to
           give it to him straight.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Let it go, Bill. Your time has come.
                        And some day mine will, too. But you
                        won't get to see it, because I plan
                        on being around a long, long time.
                               (
                                             )
                                then, smiling
                        After all, people like me.

           Bob goes to the door, but realizes he can't leave on a sour
           note and stops.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I hope someday you find a way to be
                        happy. But I don't know if you will.

           And he leaves. William doesn't move, frozen in his defeat.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           William is waiting in booth by himself, nervously twisting a
           straw wrapper. Thoughts plagued by his meeting with Bob.

           The front bell JINGLES. William looks up, sees Gertrude
           enter and look around.

           Gertrude looks great. She wears a brand new suit, her hair
           is shorter and more professional, and her face radiates with
           confidence.

           William holds up a hand. She gives him a quick wave and
           heads over, all smiles.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        There's my favorite client.
           Gertrude gives him a kiss on the cheek. She sits down. A
           WAITRESS comes over.

                                 GERTRUDE

                               (
                        Coffee to start. Thank you.
                                the waitress leaves,
                                to William)
                        You didn't have to come here for
                        this. We could've talked on the
                        phone.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And not see my favorite attorney
                        again?

           Gertrude smiles. She can barely contain herself.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        So, great news, my friend. Bob agreed
                        to settle. He called up out of the
                        blue and-- boom! He said he felt bad,
                        but keeps talking bullshit that he
                        didn't steal your formula... I mean,
                        why settle if you're not guilty?
                               (
                                cuts off William
                                                )
                        No need to say it. You're welcome.
                        Now, he's only agreeing to ten
                        thousand, but I know I can squeeze
                        him for more. Give me the word and
                        I'll get the furry freak to cough up
                        six figures.

           William holds up his hands.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I can't accept.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        No shit. It's a low-ball offer.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm dropping the case.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Not this again. Come on, Bill. This
                        is what we've been fighting for all
                        this time. Now you want to give up?
                        He's giving you his money.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It's not about money. I just want to
                        be happy.
                                 GERTRUDE
                        And how does turning down what's
                        rightfully yours get you that?

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don't know. But I know taking it
                        won't change anything.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Okay, fine. What will? Naming rights?
                        A credit on the show? Just tell me.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                beat
                                    , then)
                        I can't paint over my mistakes
                        anymore.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        What do you mean?

           Gertrude looks at William, not sure what that meant. He
           stares down at the table, off in that dark place again.

           Gertrude reaches out and takes his hand, a friendly gesture
           that opens him up.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        It's okay.

                                 WILLIAM
                        When I was 12 years old, I lost my
                        brother, and--
                               (
                                pulls away
                                          )
                        I'm sorry, I can't.

           William gets up. Gertrude stops him.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        I'll walk you out.

           EXT. DINER - PARKING LOT - DAY

           William and Gertrude leave the diner.

           Gertrude gives him a hug, which surprises him. She gets in a
           brand new Mustang convertible, top already down.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Nice wheels. You've done good for
                        yourself.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        That's because someone helped me
                        believe in myself. Even if they
                        didn't always believe in themselves.
           She gets in and starts it up. William watches her drive off.

           INT. AUDITORIUM - RECREATION CENTER - DAY

           A small group of people sit behind easels, all painting
           variations of the same seascape. Some good, some not so
           good, and some, well, who knows what they are.

           Leading the class is Margarete, who wears a blue smock and
           kerchief on her head.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Now we mix Prussian blue and cadmium
                        yellow for a nice aqua green. And
                        let's spread it across where the
                        waves break on the beach. It's always
                        going to be greener closer to shore.

           Everyone keeps rapt attention as they follow her lead.

           In the back of the room, the door opens and William enters.
           He stays in back to avoid attention.

           One student nearby looks over and doesn't recognize him. She
           turns back and continues painting.

           William smiles, but can't help feeling a bit of a sting.

           Margarete finally notices him and smiling, gestures for him
           to come over. But he waves her off.

           Margarete puts down her brush.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Everybody keep spreading that green
                        across, blend it in really nice.

           She goes over to William.

                                 MARGARETE
                        How'd it go?

           William nods, but doesn't say anything.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You don't look happy about it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I don't know what to feel. Maybe it
                        was the right choice, maybe not. Time
                        will tell.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Well, I know which one it is.
           William smiles, though he's still uncertain. Margarete turns
           to look at her students.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Look at it. This is all your doing,
                        you know. They're all here because of
                        you, whether they realize it or not.
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        Why not get up there and show off
                        some of the old magic?

                                 WILLIAM
                        No, you're doing fine.
                                leans in
                               (
                                        )
                        You were always better at it than me.

                                 MARGARETE
                        You know it.

           She smiles and heads back to the easel.

           William hangs back. Margarete gives him a final look, before
           turning back to her class.

                                 MARGARETE
                        Okay. Let's take out our palette
                        knives and make some almighty rocks
                        near our shore.

           William smiles and slips out. Margarete turns right when the
           door closes, and we CUT TO:

           BLACK

           A beat. And then a TELEVISION turns on.

           START MONTAGE

           On TV is the iconic opening of The Joy of Painting, where
           Bob, dressed in white overalls, "paints" a large canvas with
           a giant brush, revealing a closeup of a mountain lake.

           Once he's done, he heaves the brush off-screen.

           Then a second Bob walks into frame with the same brush. He
           paints over the first Bob, arms waving No, no!, and makes
           him disappear.

           And then a WIPE reveals Bob standing before an easel with a
           white canvas. Open collar shirt and jeans. Afro and a
           beaming smile. Comfortable and easygoing.

           This is the Bob Ross we've always known.
                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                smooth
                                      )
                        Welcome back. Certainly glad could
                        join me today. It's a fantastic day
                        here and I hope it is, too, where
                        you're at. You ready to do a little
                        painting? Good, let's get started.

           He turns to the easel, and we CUT TO:

           EXT. ALEXANDER HOME - DAY

           There's a MOVING VAN out front and a small crew of MOVERS
           doing all the heavy lifting.

           Standing in the driveway, William watches the movers do
           their work looking forlorn.

           Margarete exits from the back carrying a box. She's a out of
           breath and coughing.

           Concerned, William takes the box from her and carries it the
           rest of the way.

           INT. NEW YORK TV STUDIO - DAY

           We're on set for an episode of The Joan Rivers Show,
           starring JOAN RIVERS (50s, annoying). Bob is Joan's guest,
           who as always, stands in front of an easel ready to paint.

                                 JOAN RIVERS
                        My next quest has been creating his
                        magic for the past several years on
                        his PBS show The Joy of Painting,
                        which I watch all the time. Please
                        welcome America's favorite art
                        instructor, Bob Ross.

           She shakes his hand. The crowd CHEERS loudly. Bob smiles and
           waves, really soaking in the adulation.

                                 JOAN RIVERS
                        Why are you so popular? Most people
                        can't paint, yet I find myself
                        fascinated to sit and watch.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, I think it's because magic
                        really does happen on the show. The
                        secret to doing anything is to
                        believe you can do it, and I try my
                        best to help people with that.

           The crowd CHEERS, as Bob's smile widens. MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. MOM-AND-POP BOOK STORE - DAY

           William sitting and smiling at a small table stacked with
           copies of his book, The Art of Bill Alexander. It's a book
           signing, but there aren't many takers.

           Margarete is with him looking pale and thin. He glances over
           at her and takes her hand, happy to be there with her. And
           she with him.

           Then finally someone comes up and asks William to sign her
           book. He obliges, trying to make the best of it. CUT TO:

           A TELEVISION

           And the CHANNEL CHANGING.

           Now we see Bob before his easel doing a commercial.

           He puts the finishing touches on a mountain surrounded by
           pine trees. The canvas framed by the MTV LOGO.

           Bob turns to the camera with a beatific smile.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        MTV, the land of happy little trees.

           The CHANNEL CHANGES into static, and CUT TO:

           INT. MALL - DAY

           William teaches an art class at the mall. He's older and has
           a head of white hair.

           He has more curious on-lookers than students, and instead of
           Margarete, there's an ASSISTANT handling business.

           William again makes the best of his situation, but there's a
           sadness now about him. CUT TO:

           INT. ANOTHER TV STUDIO - DAY

           Now Bob is on PHIL DONAHUE (50s, white hair), who introduces
           him to his audience.

           Bob is older with more gray in his beard and his eyes are
           puffy around the edges. He looks tired, but he's still in
           great spirits.

                                 PHIL DONAHUE
                               (
                                over the top
                                            )
                        Bob Ross-- this is the most famous
                        painter in the history of the
                        universe!
           Bob smiles and waves. The adulation is infectious. But his
           smile isn't as bright, like there's something off about him.

           INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

           Now we're back to Bob's studio, where he stands before an
           easel holding a painting of another woodland scene.

           He loads a thin brush with red paint. There's a bit of
           sadness in his voice.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Think I'll sign this one. The ol'
                        clock on the wall tells me it's time
                        to bring this show and this series to
                        a close. I really enjoyed being with
                        you for the past 13 shows and I hope
                        to see you again very soon.

           He finishes signing and turns to the camera.

                                 BOB ROSS (CON'TD)
                        Until next time, I'd like to wish
                        each and everyone of you Happy
                        Painting, and God bless.

           Bob does his Happy Painting wave to the camera and forces a
           smile. And we FADE OUT.

           A moment of silence in black.

           And then FADE BACK IN ON:

           EXT. ALEXANDER HOME - BACKYARD - DAY

           Powell River, British Columbia. 1995.

           A sprawling yard with a man-made pond and chicken coop.
           There's also a large cottage and barn with a connecting
           greenhouse.

           Now we see William, older with white hair, but still
           possessing lots of energy.

           He's in front of an easel holding a palette next to another
           painter, DIANE ANDRE (40s, red hair).

           A camera on a tripod is operated by a YOUNG MAN in a flannel
           shirt and ripped jeans. It's a low-rent production.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                to camera
                                         )
                        It's been a while since we do one of
                        these. And I'm happy to have our old
                        friend Diane here to help us.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIAM (cont'd)
                        She has done a wonderful job of going
                        around teaching our method, and I'm
                        always glad to see--

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Bill!

                                 WILLIAM
                        Shit-- okay, cut!

           William turns to the house, upset. A woman, HEATHER (30s),
           his assistant from the mall, is holding up a cordless phone.

                                 HEATHER
                        I'm sorry. It's Don. He says it's
                        important.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        It's okay. I'll take it in the
                        studio. Thank you.

           INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO - DAY

           Basically the same setup he had in Costa Mesa, only there's
           more room for all his paintings and supplies.

           William enters and takes the cordless off the base, but
           pauses when he sees a photo of MARGARETE in her smock and
           kerchief standing in front of a window.

           William picks up the photo to ponder it, smiling sadly. It
           has taken the place of the one with his father.

           Then he puts it down to answer the call.

                                 WILLIAM (INTO PHONE)
                        Hi, Don. Good to hear from you.

           INT. DON'S OFFICE - PBS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A larger space with a nice view of a busy downtown area in
           Arlington, Virginia. There are tons of photos of Don with
           Bob Ross, along with three EMMY AWARDS on a shelf.

           Don, graying hair but still with a youthful face, is seated
           behind his desk.

           INTERCUT - DON AND WILLIAM

                                 DON
                        Hey, Bill. Same here. Glad to see
                        you've been busy. The videos look
                        great.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Yeah, it's been okay. Not as good as
                        you over there, but we manage.

           An uncomfortable beat. Obvious tension between the two.

                                 DON
                        Listen, Bill. I have something to
                        tell you.

           Now we stay on William, who listens to Don. His face is
           blank at first, but then his eyes grow concerned and he
           starts to collapse inside.

           Don is giving him bad news, and William is having trouble
           processing it.

           EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - DAY

           New Smyrna Beach, Florida. 1995.

           A large Spanish-style house on a quiet tree-lined street.

           A cab pulls out front and William gets out. He hesitates a
           moment, before heading for the door.

           INT. BOB'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - DAY

           The doorbell RINGS. A woman in a nurse's uniform, KAY (40s),
           answers. She smiles warmly.

                                 KAY
                        You must be Bill. Come in.

           Bill nods and warily enters. Kay closes the door.

                                 KAY
                        He's in back. I'll take you to him.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                hesitating
                                          )
                        How's he doing?

                                 KAY
                               (
                                beat
                                    )
                        You should prepare yourself.

           Kay walks out. William takes a breath before following.

           EXT. BOB'S BACKYARD - DAY

           An idyllic space with lots of greenery and shade.
           There's a spot beneath a palm tree perfect for sitting, and
           that's where we find Bob back turned, in a deck chair
           wrapped in a blanket despite the 80-degree heat.

           There's an easel set up nearby with a half-finished
           painting. A snowy mountain with a lake and cabin.

           Kay is giving the man a drink from a cup and straw. She goes
           back in the house when William comes over.

           William goes around to face him. Bob looks thin and frail.
           He's dying of lymphoma.

                               (
                                in shock
                                 WILLIAM
                                        )
                        Bob. I don't know what to say.

           Bob turns his head and smiles as best he can. He's happy to
           see William.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        How about hello?
                               (
                                then
                                    )
                        I'm glad you could come. Honestly, I
                        didn't think you would.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Neither did I.

           An uncomfortable beat. William sits in a chair next to him
           and can't help staring. Bob's smile drops.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I know, it's the chemo. We're not
                        meant to have all these drugs and
                        radiation in our bodies.

                                 WILLIAM
                        That's okay, it makes you better.
                        Soon you'll be back on your feet and
                        doing the show.

           Bob lowers his head and looks at the ground. There's a long
           pause, as a gentle breeze comes through that makes Bob
           shiver. He gestures to a folded blanket on the table.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Would you mind?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sure.

           William takes the blanket and spreads it across Bob.
                                 BOB ROSS
                        I'm sorry about Margarete passing.
                        When I heard, I was so busy-- I
                        should've called.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Don't worry about it. I should have
                        done the same with Jane. Wish I could
                        have met her.

           Bob smiles and nods. William is at a loss again. But then he
           sees the unfinished painting.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You're still painting. That's good.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I stopped about a month ago. I can't
                        hold the ol' brush anymore.

           Another beat. William's discomfort is matched only by Bob's
           inability to be himself.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Why did you ask me here?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I didn't like the way we ended things
                        last time... I don't want to leave
                        knowing you're angry with me.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I'm not anymore.

           Bob smiles.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        That's a relief to hear.
                                    )
                               (
                                then
                        But I still can't help wondering, why
                        didn't you take the settlement?

           A beat, as William considers it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        If I did... I might not be here now.
                               (
                                    )
                                then
                        But I'm glad I am.

           Both share a warm smile, the last of the ice between them
           finally melting away. Bob goes to scratch his head, only his
           hand moves underneath his hair.

           William realizes Bob's wearing an AFRO WIG, unsettling him.
           Bob pretends not to notice.
                                 BOB ROSS
                        I wonder if anything we've done will
                        make a difference. Will people even
                        remember us ten years from now?

                                 WILLIAM
                        They'll remember you. But not me.
                        They forget already.

           Bob eyes the painting heavily.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Listen, I know this might be a lot to
                        ask, but would you...

           Bob indicates the brush nearby. William gets it.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sure. We finish it together.

           MINUTES LATER

           William has the easel closer to them and a palette ready
           with paints. They both look at the woodland scene, pondering
           what to do. Bob talks like he's doing his show.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        We're about done with this one, but
                        something's missing. What can we add
                        to make it complete?
                               (
                                struggling
                                          )
                        My mind isn't what it used to be.

           Then CHATTERING BARKS among the CHIRPING birds from the
           trees. Bob gets an idea.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        How about a squirrel?

                                 WILLIAM
                        No squirrels!

           Bob chuckles, appreciating the memory, as William stares at
           the woodland scene on Bob's canvas. There's something oddly
           familiar about it to him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Sometimes when I paint, I try to take
                        an old memory and make it new again.
                        Turn darkness into light.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Like what happened with your father?
                                 WILLIAM
                        That's the only one I could never do.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Well, maybe now you can.
                               (
                                off W
                                 illiam)
                        You never told me why you had to
                        leave home.

           William looks at Bob a moment before gathering himself.

                                 WILLIAM
                        They blamed me for what happened.

           We push in on the half-painted woodland scene on Bob's
           canvas and finds ourselves transported to:

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           East Prussia. 1927.

           We're back to the opening scene, where William, Paul,
           Fredrick and the other boys are playing, only it's a few
           moments before tragedy strikes.

           The boys are huddled near a long wire fence. A weathered
           sign ominously screams, Achtung! Fredrick is scared. Again,
           they speak in German with English subtitles.

                                 FREDRICK
                        Father said never cross here.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Watch me!

           Defiant, William slips through the barbed wire.

                                 PAUL
                        Are you crazy? You know the beating
                        you'll get?

           William LAUGHS and continues running through the woods. Paul
           slips through next, followed by the others. They all start
           to laugh at defying the rules.

           Fredrick hesitates, but not wanting to be left behind, he
           climbs through and chases after them.

           As their LAUGHTER vanishes in the woods, we drift away until
           we find a large, odd-looking OAK TREE standing by itself and
           bathed in golden sunlight.

           A beat, as we hold on the angelic tree. And that's when we
           hear the EXPLOSION from field. Off that, we're BACK TO:
           EXT. BOB'S BACKYARD - DAY (PRESENT DAY)

           Bob looks at William still staring blankly at the canvas.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We were told not to go past the
                        fence. Mother and father never
                        forgave me.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        Let's show them it wasn't your fault.
                        We'll turn darkness into light.

           Bob gestures for the brush. William smiles, a tear in his
           eye. But William doesn't pick it up just yet, something
           still nagging at him.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Listen, I have to know... the paint.
                        How did you come up with yours?

                                 BOB ROSS
                               (
                                bea
                                   t)
                        To tell the truth, I did what any
                        artist does. I took what their
                        teacher did and made it better.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How?

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I used dimethylformamide instead of
                        mineral turpentine. Lower evaporation
                        rate. Made all the difference.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (beat)
                        That is better.

           William and Bob turn back to the canvas.

                                 BOB ROSS
                        I think we both know what we can do.

                                 WILLIAM
                               (
                                smiling
                                       )
                        We do what we do best. We FIRE IN and
                        paint a great, almighty--

           But William stops and decides to tone it down. Now he sounds
           a little gentler and more like Bob.

                                 WILLIAM (CONT'D)
                        We paint a happy little tree.
           Bob smiles. William does, too. He puts a fan brush in Bob's
           hand, helps load it with paint and lifts it to the canvas.

           Bob fights back the tears, as William guides his hand across
           the canvas, and we CUT TO:

           INT. BACK STAGE - DAY

           Chicago, Illinois. 1995.

           William nervously waits backstage. His assistant, Heather,
           is with him. It's oddly quiet.

                                 WILLIAM
                        How many are out there-- Don't tell
                        me. I don't want to know.

           A STAGE MANAGER enters.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        We're ready.

           William grows more nervous.

                                 HEATHER
                        Remember, they're here for you.

           William nods and gets to his feet.

           CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           William moves down the corridor toward the stage. He mops
           his brow with a kerchief, as he moves up the steps onto--

           A STAGE

           An easel with a blank canvas is set up front and center.
           It's still weirdly quiet--

           But as he cross to center stage, a crowd of about a thousand
           immediately stands and applauds LOUDLY.

           William is overwhelmed. He waves and nods, soaking in the
           applause. Several people shout, We love you, Bill!

           William grabs his palette and a brush. The crowd settles in
           for him to paint, as William turns to the canvas. But he
           pauses and turns back around.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Everyone knows I taught Bob Ross how
                        to paint. Before he was a star,
                        bigger than me.
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILLIAM (cont'd)
                               (
                                off the laughter
                                                )
                        But Bob was also a teacher, and he
                        taught me a thing or two.

           William hesitates to say what exactly.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Bob once told me that without me
                        there would be no Bob Ross. But I
                        know that I wouldn't be standing here
                        today if it wasn't for him.

           The crowd applauds.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Okay, then. We ready to paint? Good.
                        Let's FIRE IN!

           The crowd cheers. William turns to the canvas, and--

           WE FADE OUT.

           POSTSCRIPT:

           Bob Ross died of lymphoma on July 4, 1995. True to his
           nature, Bob kept his battle secret from the public.

           Bill Alexander died on January 24, 1997 and fell into
           obscurity soon after.

           Years later, Bill later found new life online when The Magic
           of Oil Painting was rediscovered by new generations of fans
           on YouTube. Episodes get hundreds of thousands of views.
