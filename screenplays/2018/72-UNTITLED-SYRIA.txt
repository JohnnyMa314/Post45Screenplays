           Language: French and Arabic are spoken in the script with

           Types of Female Coverings: 

           Hijab - scarf worn tightly around the head and neck but does 
           not cover the face - the most common Islamic head covering. 

           Niqab - full face veil that covers everything but the eyes. 
           The niqab can be worn with an additional eye veil, achieving 
           the full face-covering effect of the burqa. 

           Abaya - loose overgarment that helps hide the shape of a 
           woman’s body.
           OVER BLACK:

           CHYRON: As of December 2016, over 30,000 foreign fighters 
           have traveled to Syria to join extremist jihadi groups. Over 
           4,500 came from the West. 

           One in seven are women. 

           CHYRON 2: The following story is inspired by real events.
           OVER BLACK we hear an older man’s voice:

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        It is good for a man to bear the 
                        yoke while he is young. Let him 
                        bury his face in the dust. There 
                        may yet be hope.

           EXT. RURAL ALABAMA CEMETERY - DAY

           CHYRON: Alabama, 2014

           The voice belongs to a Southern Baptist MINISTER, speaking to 
           a small group of mourners by a grave. Everyone wears black 
           except for LENA, 16, her sorrow seeped in anger. She wears a 
           SONIC YOUTH T-shirt under a worn green hoodie. 

                                 MINISTER
                        Lord, we pray that you shine your 
                        unfathomable mercy upon Shauna 
                        Alder, a mother, a daughter, who 
                        faced great trials in this life--

           A GAUNT MAN in his 30s walks up the hill towards the group. 
           Lena tries to will him away with her eyes, but he perseveres. 
           She can’t take it anymore.

                                 LENA
                        Hey!

           The mourners twitch, thrown by the break in protocol. Lena 
           approaches him, cutting him off.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Get outta here.

                                 GAUNT MAN
                        I just wanted to say--

           She SHOVES him.

                                 LENA
                        She can’t get high with you anymore 
                        so get the fuck away from her!

           He tries to dodge her, almost farcically, but she’s fast. She 
           pushes him again. The other mourners ignore them. 

           Lena’s grandmother, JEANNE, 59, her stern expression chiseled 
           from a thousand small sorrows, closes her eyes in prayer and 
           waits out the storm. Eventually the man gives up, sulking 
           away, leaving Lena alone on the hill, defiant.
           INT. ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Teenage girls chatter as they put on basketball uniforms. 
           SEPIDEH, 16, Iranian-American, wearing a hijab, looks up 
           incredulously as Lena enters and starts getting dressed.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LENA
                        Finished early.

           Sepideh realizes Lena needs to be here. She shoots a nearby 
           ball at Lena, who manages to catch it, deftly.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Don’t make me run after your granny 
                        shots today.

                                 LENA
                        You wish you had my follow through.

           INT. ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           The team is mid practice. These girls are fast and cut 
           throat, including Lena, though she’s off her game. She pushes 
           the ball up court, fast, and goes for a three pointer but is 
           intercepted. The girl, TARAH, takes the ball down the court.

           Sepideh manages to steal back the ball and pushes it up the 
           court again while Tarah and two other girls flank her. 
           Suddenly she SCREAMS as her hijab is WRENCHED SIDEWAYS. She 
           falls to the ground, HARD. 

                                 LENA
                        What the fuck was that?

           The coach WHISTLES to stop the play.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        You suck at defense so you attack 
                        her?

                                 COACH
                        Lena, stop.
                             (to Sepideh)
                        You OK?

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Yeah.
                                 TARAH
                        My hand got stuck on her scarf 
                        thing. She shouldn’t be allowed to 
                        wear that.

                                 LENA
                        It’s her legal right to wear that.

                                 TARAH
                        Separation of Islam and state, 
                        bitch.

                                 COACH
                        Enough. Tarah, keep your hands to 
                        yourself. Back to positions. 

                                 LENA
                        That’s it? She should get benched 
                        for that!

                                 COACH
                        You didn’t need to come today. Why 
                        don’t you sit this one out.

           Maybe she meant it kindly but it comes off as condescending. 
           Lena storms out of the gym.

           EXT. RURAL ALABAMA/INT. BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

           Lena stares out the window at the forest covered hills rising 
           above the strip of civilization along the road. The landscape 
           feels both isolating and achingly beautiful.

           EXT. JEANNE’S HOME - EARLY EVENING

           She arrives home to a single-wide trailer on a small plot of 
           land just off the road. There’s a lawn sign stuck in the 
           front yard: “As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord. - 
           Joshua 24:15.”

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER 

           Lena enters the simple, almost sterile living space. She 
           catches sight of the colorful rug peeking out of her mom’s 
           bedroom and goes in.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - SHAUNA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena touches the items in her mother’s closet, remembering: 
           trendy, revealing clothing, several waitress uniforms. 
           In a box there’s a bunch of Cosmo magazines, a Bible and a 
           Sunday School project she made as a kid.

           She flips through, it’s a book of pictures of things she 
           prays to God for: peace on Earth, duh. Her grandmother to buy 
           chocolate ice cream at the store. Her Mom to visit and take 
           her to Disney World. Lena SHOVES the book back into the box.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeanne and Lena eat a simple dinner. The third chair at the 
           small kitchen table is noticeably vacant.

                                 JEANNE
                        Could have used your help at the 
                        church afterward.

                                 LENA
                        I had practice. 
                             (then)
                        Sorry.

                                 JEANNE
                        Turned out fine. Susan Lowell’s 
                        daughter, Julie, stayed and helped 
                        me. Dumber than a pack of 
                        mayonnaise, God bless her, but at 
                        least she has manners. And somehow 
                        got into Ole Miss. Wonder who they 
                        paid off for that miracle.

                                 LENA
                        Maybe they just prayed really hard.

                                 JEANNE
                        Don’t act ugly with me. 

           They eat in silence for a moment.

                                 JEANNE (CONT’D)
                        Julie made sure to mention she’s 
                        going to your Homecoming with the 
                        quarterback.
                             (then)
                        If you wanna go, we got a sale in 
                        apparel fabric. I could make you a 
                        dress.

                                 LENA
                        Probably not, but thanks.
                                 JEANNE
                        I know you’re gonna turn your nose 
                        up, but you might wanna think about 
                        how boys ‘round here aren’t 
                        interested in girls who play 
                        sports.

                                 LENA
                        I don’t want to date anyone from 
                        here.

                                 JEANNE
                        Well, then you better get your 
                        grades up or find someone willin’ 
                        to support you or you’re gonna end 
                        up at the Walmart like me or dead 
                        in a ditch like your momma. Actin’ 
                        like we’re livin’ in high cotton 
                        while I’m working doubles to pay 
                        off that last joke of a rehab...

                                 LENA
                        Aren’t you sad? Like at all?

                                 JEANNE
                        Of course I’m sad. But she was a 
                        tortured soul. She’s in a better 
                        place now.

                                 LENA
                        You were always telling her if she 
                        didn’t get clean she was gonna end 
                        up in hell.

           Jeanne sees red. She THROWS HER WATER in Lena’s face.

                                 JEANNE
                        How dare you say a thing like that. 
                        She’s still your mother.

           Lena storms off. Jeanne crumples, regret and sadness seeping 
           through the cracks in her tough facade.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LENA’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Lena lies on her bed, watching YouTube basketball clips and 
           FaceTiming with Sepideh, burrowing into her place of comfort. 
           INT. ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Lena walks to class alone. Cliques of kids on either side 
           ignore her. They look like a different species, girls in make-
           up and trendy clothes flirt with boys and pose for selfies. 

           INT. ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           There’s a club fair going on during lunch. Lena and Sepideh 
           sling fliers and slogans from their Feminist Society booth. 

                                 LENA
                        Normalize equality. Hi, help us 
                        normalize equality.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Our voice is the future.

           Everyone ignores them.

           INT. SEPIDEH’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Lena and Sepideh hang out after school. Lena looks through a 
           photo album while Sepideh searches YouTube. Lena examines a 
           photo of about 30 people gathered at a house in Tehran.

                                 LENA
                        Wait, these are all your cousins?

                                 SEPIDEH
                        No, there’s like ten more of them.
                        My grandma had eight kids.

                                 LENA
                        Do you know all their names?

           Sepideh looks at the photo, pointing people out.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Donya, Laleh, Amir, Pierre --

                                 LENA 
                        Pierre?

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Yeah! He’s cool, he taught me how 
                        to play fooseball.

                                 LENA 
                        He’s cute.
                                 SEPIDEH
                        Come this Summer and meet him. Oh
                        my God, that would be so fun. You 
                        could be my cousin-in-law.

           Sepideh finds what she was searching for on YouTube. It’s a 
           MUSIC VIDEO for Iranian-Swedish pop star, ARASH’s upbeat 
           electronic dance song TEKOON BEDE (Shake Your Body).

                                 SEPIDEH (CONT’D)
                        Listen. Laleh told me about this 
                        guy. He’s good right? Maybe he’ll 
                        do a concert when we go.

                                 LENA 
                        I like it.

           They dance like crazy, losing themselves.

           INT. SEPIDEH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Sepideh’s mother, NOUSHA is cooking up a storm. Her brother 
           ARIN, 13 is supposed to be helping but is on his phone. 
           Sepideh and Lena come in from the bedroom.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Can Lena come to the UAB game and 
                        serve Iftar dinner with us at the 
                        mosque on Sunday? Pleaaaaase?

                                 NOUSHA
                        If it’s OK with her grandma.

                                 LENA
                        She’s happy anytime she doesn’t 
                        have to cook for me.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        I am sooooooo hungry.

                                 NOUSHA
                        Think about all the people who are 
                        hungrier than you. That’s the 
                        point. And stir that.

                                 NOUSHA
                        Good memory. Arin, get off your 
                        phone, please and chop that onion.  
                                 ARIN
                        OK.

           He doesn’t budge.

                        I could never fast every day for a 
                        month. I’m weak.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Yeah you could.

                                 LENA
                        Do you lose weight?

                                 NOUSHA
                        Have you seen how much she eats in 
                        the evening? Hardly starving 
                        herself.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        I’m an athlete!

           ROSHNI, Sepideh’s father arrives home from work.

                                 ROSHNI
                        Mubarak alaych! I see we have a 
                        guest. This smells delicious.

                                 NOUSHA
                        Thank you, my love. Help the girls 
                        set the table. 

                                 ROSHNI
                             (playfully)
                        But I have important, manly things 
                        to do.

                                 NOUSHA
                             (batting him)
                        Go set the table. Arin give me that 
                        phone!

           She snatches it.

                                 ARIN
                        Ah! Why??

           INT. UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA - BASKETBALL ARENA

           Lena cheers for the women’s basketball team along with 
           Sepideh and her family. 
           INT. BIRMINGHAM MOSQUE - BATHROOM - EVENING

           Lena follows Sepideh’s lead as she washes her face, hands and 
           feet at a line of ground-level taps next to several other 
           WOMEN. Lena loses herself in the peacefulness of the ritual. 
           Sepideh notices and splashes her. Lena splashes her back.

           INT. BIRMINGHAM MOSQUE - PRAYER ROOM - EVENING

           Lena kneels next to Sepideh and Nousha in a row of WOMEN, 
           covered, clean and focusing on prayer. They watch the Imam on 
           a TV screen at the front of the room. Lena lets go of the 
           tensions of the day and is filled with peace.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

           Lena and Sepideh shoot the shit while walking along a cotton 
           field lined road. Sepideh wears a leopard-print hijab.

                                 LENA
                        Maybe we should try to get 
                        basketball scholarships to UAB.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        HA. Done. 

                                 LENA
                        Seriously! I think we’re good 
                        enough. And we’d get to travel for 
                        games, have groupies.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Ugh, I think I’m gonna be pre-med, 
                        though. Probably hard to do both.

                                 LENA
                        Jerk. Fine, go save peoples lives.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Didn’t you wanna join the peace 
                        corps or something?

                                 LENA
                        Their site said you need a degree 
                        or work experience. I’m not even 
                        qualified for a volunteer job.

           A DARK BLUE TRUCK crests the hill behind them, it’s windows 
           down. They hear LAUGHTER of a group of guys inside. 
           Instinctively the girls move further to the side of the road.
                                 SEPIDEH
                        Maybe you could do something 
                        through your church or something.

                                 LENA
                        Maybe.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        What?

                                 LENA
                        I don’t know. Sometimes I feel like 
                        everything I said I wanted to do 
                        was just something I thought would 
                        make my mom stop getting high. I 
                        don’t know why I cared, anyway. She 
                        was a freaking junkie.

                                 SEPIDEH
                        Because she was your mom. 
                             (then)
                        You’re gonna figure it out.

           They realize the TRUCK has slowed and seems to be following 
           them. It’s creepy. They quicken their pace. 

                                 SEPIDEH (CONT’D)
                        What are they doing?

           Suddenly the truck revs up and comes up along side them. It’s 
           three TEENAGE GUYS, sipping out of a brown bag they pass 
           between them.

                                 FIRST GUY
                        Hey, Jihadi Barbie. I like your 
                        scarf. It’s sexy.

                                 SECOND GUY (O.S.)
                        Got a bomb in my pants, gonna go 
                        off for you.  

                                 LENA
                        Get out of here.

                                 THIRD GUY
                        Aw, she’s jealous.

           The girls start running and the car REVS up behind them, 
           stopping just before it hits them, over and over.

                                 FIRST GUY
                        Hey fuckin’ sandnigger. We don’t 
                        want you here!
           The First Guy in the passenger's seat hurls a BEER BOTTLE at 
           Sepideh's head. It HITS HER just as the driver accidentally 
           REVS the truck forward, HITTING HER as she goes down. Lena 
           SCREAMS as the truck screeches away.

           MONTAGE OF EVENTS:

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - LATER

           Lena watches as Sepideh’s body is loaded into an ambulance.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sepideh’s face is beaten and bloodied. She’s unconscious and 
           on a respirator. From the DOCTOR’s face we can tell the 
           prognosis isn’t good.

           Lena watches her friend for signs of life. Nousha is shaking, 
           holding Arin, as Roshni reads passages from the Qur'an, 
           trying to keep his voice calm.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY/WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A large group of MUSLIM FRIENDS, at least twenty people, sit 
           in the waiting room. They come and go, taking shifts by 
           Sepideh’s bedside. The amount of support is moving, but also 
           jarring in this all-white space.

           INT. BIRMINGHAM MOSQUE - WOMEN’S SECTION DAY

           Lena holds Noushas hand as she prays. They both wear hijabs. 
           The Imam is on the screen.

                                 IMAM
                        And let us remember to keep Sepideh 
                        Adeli and her family in our du’as.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY 

           Lena, still wearing the hijab, waits to purchase something 
           from the vending machine. She fights back tears, closes her 
           eyes and whispering a du’a prayer.

                                 LENA
                             (under her breath)
                        Oh Allah, you are peace and from 
                        you comes peace. Blessed are you oh 
                        owner of majesty and honor.
           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

           Lena eats alone where she and Sepideh once hung out together, 
           STILL wearing her hijab. She deflects the quizzical stares 
           and snickers with stern defiance.

                                                            OVER BLACK:

           CHYRON: FOUR MONTHS LATER 

           CHYRON 2: BOBIGNY SUBURB, PARIS 

           EXT. MOSQUE - BOBIGNY SUBURB, PARIS - DAY

           A bright white dome topped with a crescent moon is visible 
           just beyond a graffiti covered, cinder block underpass with 
           rusting rails. Dead grass and grey high rises dot the 
           landscape beyond. Bobigny is one of the toughest suburbs in 
           Paris, plagued by poverty, prejudice and social isolation.

           INT. MOSQUE - DAY

           In contrast to its bleak exterior, the mosque is impressive. 
           Beneath a vaulted ceiling, an IMAM performs the Iqama prayer 
           for his congregation, kneeling on the brilliant blue carpet. 

           As the Imam intones, we sweep past white pillars to where 
           ABEL FATTAH WASEM, early 60s, warm and humble, looks up to 
           send a warm but meaningful smile to IDRIS BADDOUR. 

           Idris is French of Afro-Turkish descent, 40s, muscular and 
           serious. He nods deferentially to Wasem. As the Imam finishes 
           the prayer, both men turn their attention back to Allah. 

           INT. WASEM’S BOBIGNY APARTMENT - LATER

           Honey-colored tea cascades into porcelain cups. A plate of 
           dates is passed. Wasem and a group of ten or so MEN, ranging 
           in age from 18-50 sit at a circular table. Their Qur’ans are 
           set neatly beside their plates. Idris sits among them.

                                 ABDEL FATTAH WASEM
                        My wife swears she makes it the same way, but 
                        somehow the tea always tastes better after our 
                        discussions. 

           The men smile and laugh, humoring him.
                                 ABDEL FATTAH WASEM (CONT’D)
                        But never as pure as it tastes in the Land of Khilafah, 
                        praise be to Allah.

           He turns to AFZAAL, 21, lanky and wide-eyed.

                                 ABDEL FATTAH WASEM (CONT’D)
                        Afzaal, your letter was very moving. I would like to 
                        offer you the honor of delivering our next gift.

           Only Idris seems to notice the flash of fear on Afzaal’s face 
           that he quickly hides behind a furrowed brow.

                                 AFZAAL
                        Thank you, Mr. Wasem.

                                 ABDEL FATTAH WASEM
                        Idris will hand off the gift to you and explain the 
                        details of its presentation.

                                 IDRIS
                        Inshallah, Abdel Wasem.

           Idris watches Afzaal embrace each brother, smiling too hard.

           EXT. PARIS - BOBIGNY BANLIEUE - NIGHT

           Graffiti-covered housing projects huddle around a freeway off-
           ramp. A trash fire in an abandoned industrial lot. 

           INT. IDRIS’ BOBIGNY APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Idris opens the door and leads a nervous Afzal inside. He 
           can’t hide his surprise at how barren the place is: 
           threadbare couch, blank walls.

                                 AFZAAL
                        You live for the cause.

                                 IDRIS
                        Are you insulting my taste in decorating?
                             (then)
                        I can never tell -- red pillows, blue pillows.  Accent 
                        wall? I’m a lost cause.

           Afzal realizes he’s joking. Idris hands him the elegantly 
           wrapped, shoebox sized gift. Afzal notes the perfectly tied 
           gold bow.
                                 IDRIS (CONT’D)
                        My mother made me wrap all the presents during 
                        Eid-ul-Adha.

                                 AFZAAL
                        I’m not sure I deserve this honor. A Shaheed shouldn’t 
                        have doubts.

                                 IDRIS
                        Doubt is a gift. It allows us to question our beliefs and 
                        come to stronger convictions. But, your heart led you 
                        here for a reason.

                                 AFZAAL
                        And the money?

                                 IDRIS
                        After you deliver the gift, it will go to your parents 
                        every month, enough to cover the hospital bills. Allah 
                        will provide for you and we will provide for them. 
                        You’re a good son Afzaal. I wish Allah had blessed me 
                        with one like you.

           INT. IDRIS’ APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Idris makes a call as he watches Afzaal out the window 
           getting into his Volvo on the street below. 

                                 IDRIS
                        Six o’clock. Stade de France. White Volvo. You’ll have 
                        what you need to bring them all in.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LENA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           We see Lena through the lens of a phone screen. This is an 
           Instagram story or similar. She’s still wearing her hijab. 
           She’s dealing with too many emotions to even talk at first.

                                 LENA
                        So, they just announced that the 
                        state is not pursuing charges 
                        against the three guys who attacked 
                        my friend and left her in a coma. 
                        Due to “insignificant evidence”.

                        with NOTHING. This is the America 
                        we live in, people. 

           She fights back emotions, finding strength in her anger.

                        And just standing by and being sad 
                        and doing nothing means you’re part 
                        of the problem. I don’t want to 
                        live in a country that treats its 
                        citizens’ bodies and souls like 
                        garbage. Where doctors prescribe 
                        addictive drugs that lead you to 
                        kill yourself. Where kids are so 
                        angry and depressed that they’re 
                        gunning their classmates down. 
                        Where our leaders claim to stand 
                        for freedom and democracy all the 
                        while bombing innocent civilians in 
                        the Middle East including schools 
                        full of children and standing by 
                        while dictators slaughter their own 
                        people. And then our government 
                        acts like anyone who stands up to 
                        us is evil. 
                             (a beat)
                        Every day, I pray to Allah to give 
                        me the strength to fight. Turning 
                        the other cheek doesn’t work when 
                        the other side has bombs and ‘the 
                        law’. We have to take a stand. We 
                        have to face our fears and deepen 
                        our faith in Allah and fight for 
                        the world we know he wants for us, 
                        inshallah. By any means necessary. 

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LENA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena smiles as the LIKES and COMMENTS stream in on the video, 
           little floating HEARTS of support filling the screen.  

           INT. ALABAMA HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           Lena walks down the hall, this time in her hijab. The cliques 
           of kids who ignored her before stare and whisper. This time, 
           she’s confident and calm with no desire to enter their world. 
           EXT. RURAL ALABAMA/INT. BUS - AFTERNOON

           Lena rides the bus, wearing her hijab. People eye her 
           nervously. Out the window she notices things in the landscape 
           she hadn’t seen before like the content of the billboards 
           they drive past every day: 

           JESUS IS THE ANSWER - With a massive Jesus on the cross.

           ANTI-RACIST IS A CODE WORD FOR ANTI-WHITE

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER

           Lena puts the MAIL on the kitchen table and flips through it.  
           There’s a thick ENVELOPE addressed to her. She opens it. It’s 
           TWO INTERNATIONAL AIRPLANE TICKETS.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LENA’S ROOM - LATER

           We’re CLOSE on a computer screen. MOHAMMED, early 20s, 
           Jordanian, smiles from a video chat. He’s attractive. His 
           bright hazel eyes sparkle above his well groomed beard.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Almost. There’s a little bit of  
                        hair by your right eye.

           We reveal he’s talking to Lena, who is wearing a NIQAB. Only 
           her BRIGHT BLUE EYES showing. She tucks the rogue strand of 
           blonde hair into the black veil.

                                 LENA
                        Oops.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        How does it feel?

                                 LENA
                        It feels powerful. Is that weird? I 
                        feel like if I wore it out no one 
                        would mess with me.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        No, they would not. I like to see 
                        your beautiful face, but now I feel 
                        like I can really get to know you, 
                        without distractions. 

                                 LENA
                        That’s what all the boys say.
                                 MOHAMMED
                        Really?

                                 LENA
                        No. 
                             (then)
                        I’m smiling. Can you tell I’m 
                        smiling?

                                 MOHAMMED 
                        Yes. In your eyes.
                             (then)
                        So did you get my gift?

                                 LENA
                        I did. You shouldn’t have spent all 
                        that money. I still don’t know what 
                        I’m going to do.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        It was worth it. To help you make 
                        your decision. You’re worth it. 

           There’s a KNOCK on her door. Lena SLAMS the computer shut and 
           pulls off the niqab, shoving it under the bed. Jeanne opens 
           the door a second later, eying her mussed hair.

                                 LENA
                        Why knock if you’re just gonna come 
                        in anyway?

                                 JEANNE
                        Whatever you’re doing ain’t nothin’ 
                        I haven’t seen before.

                                 LENA
                        That’s not the point. What?

                                 JEANNE
                        Can you please go through those 
                        boxes in your mom’s room this 
                        weekend. I found a tenant who wants 
                        to rent it out. I’ve been waiting 
                        on you.

                                 LENA
                        Why do we have to rent her room? 

                                 JEANNE
                        I don’t see you covering any bills 
                        around here.
                                 LENA
                        I applied to a bunch of places. 
                        They weren’t hiring.

                                 JEANNE
                             (re: her messy hair)
                        Weren’t hiring you. Can’t even take 
                        the time to comb your hair. You 
                        should be focusing on school 
                        anyway. You wanna go through them 
                        now? We can do it together.

                                 LENA
                        I’m kind of busy with some stuff. 
                        I’ll do it this weekend, I promise.

           Jeanne wants to say more but nods and leaves. Lena opens her 
           computer and types SORRY into her chat window with Mohammed. 

           A FACETIME call comes through from a contact with a ROARING 
           LION as her avatar and the handle UMM LAYYIN. Lena accepts. 
           UMM LAYYIN is an enthusiastic force of nature in her mid 20s. 
           She’s of Middle Eastern descent and speaks with a Scottish 
           accent with Arabic thrown in. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Asalaam alaikum, ukhti! I knew 
                        you’d hit it off with Mohammed. 
                        Pleaaaase come to Sham so we can 
                        hang out all the time! 

                                 LENA
                        I want to... We’ve only talked 
                        three times, though. That’s insane!

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Woman, that’s how it is here. Three 
                        times is a lot! I swear on god’s name, I 
                        met my husband the day I married 
                        him!

                                 LENA
                        Seriously?

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        And it’s awesome, praise be to Allah. 
                        That’s the thing about marrying 
                        someone for their religion. You lift 
                        each other up. Allah comes first 
                        and everything falls in place from 
                        there. So many interracial 
                        marriages.

                        People from different cultures, 
                        devoting themselves to each other.

                                 LENA
                        That’s amazing. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        We need strong women like you here, 
                        raising little fighters and 
                        lionesses. It’s tough, I’m not 
                        gonna lie. But we’re the backbone 
                        of this society. Without us it’s 
                        just a bunch of boys playing war. 
                        We create the world they’re doing 
                        it all for. We inspire them. Hey, I 
                        found something I want you to see.

           She sends a VIDEO. Lena clicks on it and it fills the screen.

           EXT. ARABIAN PENINSULA - DAWN

           A gorgeous time-lapse sunrise cascades across the desert. 
           Deep, resonant male voices SING a HYMN in ARABIC.

           A group of WOMEN, draped in black, brandishing machine guns 
           move gracefully across the landscape.

           This is a recruitment video for “The Organization”, targeting 
           young women. The singing continues as we cut to --

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                        I came to Sham because, as a human 
                        being and as a Muslim, I could not 
                        stand idly by and watch innocent 
                        people be slaughtered. 

           EXT. WESTERN CITY - DAY

           Young people walk through an upscale shopping center, past a 
           leg-less VETERAN in a wheelchair begging for change.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                        I could no longer stand to live 
                        surrounded by hypocrisy.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           We see the BACK of a girl, sitting on a park bench.
                                 YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                        But I found myself alone in my 
                        desire for justice. No one else saw 
                        the pain of the world as I did.

           NATURE MONTAGE:  

           The camera pans across gorgeous snow-covered mountains, clear 
           lakes and ancient ruins set against purple sunsets.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Until I made my hijrah.

           The video ends on a FAMILY with animation of a PARADISE 
           expanding from their image. A strong, handsome FIGHTER, his 
           adoring, FULLY VEILED wife, with a Kalishnikov on her back, 
           and two adorable children playing at their feet.

           Off Lena, watching with longing.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Lena reads the Qur'an next to Sepideh’s bed side. She’s still 
           in a coma. Nousha and several other women are also there. 
           Lena feels a hand on her shoulder. It’s Roshni. He gestures 
           for her to come with him.

           INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

           Roshni and Lena drink tea at a table.

                                 ROSHNI
                        You’ve been a very good friend to 
                        Sepideh, Lena. 

                                 LENA
                        She’d do the same for me.

                                 ROSHNI
                        I notice you’re still wearing a 
                        hijab. Arin said you’ve been 
                        wearing it at school.

                                 LENA
                        I wear it a lot. I... recently 
                        converted to Islam. Reverted. 

                                 ROSHNI
                        That is a big decision. You haven’t 
                        come back to the mosque with us.
                                 LENA
                        My grandma kinda flipped out when 
                        she found out I went. Figured it 
                        was best to keep the peace. I met 
                        some Muslims online who started 
                        answering my questions. I met a lot 
                        of amazing people actually.

           Roshni looks concerned.

                                 ROSHNI
                        You know there’s a lot of bad 
                        information online too. It’s best 
                        to make sure you are getting a lot 
                        of perspectives. If you ever want 
                        to talk to Nousha or me--

                                 LENA
                             (too quickly)
                        I know. Thanks.

                                 ROSHNI
                        This is a hard time. We all need 
                        faith right now. Your grandma is 
                        very active in her church. Have you 
                        thought about going with her? 

                                 LENA
                        Yeah. I used to go with her. And I 
                        used to believe all of it. But then 
                        I started asking questions and it 
                        all fell apart. Then I read the 
                        Qur'an and it made so much more 
                        sense. God doesn’t want people to 
                        rot in hell. If you’re a sinner 
                        when you die, you’re punished, but 
                        you can still learn and go to 
                        heaven. And Jesus isn’t the son of 
                        God, he’s a prophet, like Mohammed 
                        and all the prophets from all other 
                        religions. Islam actually brings 
                        people together. I don’t know why 
                        more people don’t talk about that.

                                 ROSHNI
                        And yet you are choosing not to 
                        talk about it with your grandma.

                                 LENA
                        She’s a lost cause.
                                 ROSHNI
                        I believe it was Jesus who asked us 
                        to act as he would act. Would he 
                        think she was a lost cause?

                                 LENA
                        No.

                                 ROSHNI
                        Your Grandma loves you. And she 
                        loves God in her own way. Sepideh 
                        wouldn’t want the fact that you are 
                        exploring your faith to separate 
                        you from your Grandma. Talk to her 
                        about it. Maybe it’s something that 
                        can bring you together.

           Off Lena, really taking this to heart.

           INT. AFZAAL’S VOLVO - EVENING

           The brightly colored gift from Idris bounces on the passenger 
           seat. Afzaal grips the steering wheel, his palms sweating. 
           Through the window we see a busy Paris street and signs 
           pointing towards the Stade de France stadium.

           INT. AFZAAL’S VOLVO/EXT. STADE DE FRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Thousands of SOCCER FANS flow into the stadium. Afzaal parks 
           in the loading zone - blinkers on. He’s breathing heavily, 
           watching a TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and his DAD walk into the 
           stadium. The gift sits innocently next to him. 

           INT. DGSE HEADQUARTERS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The DGSE is France’s foreign intelligence service. Together 
           with several other bureaus and officials, they make up 
           France’s counter-terrorism organization. 

           A live feed of Afzaal’s car is playing on several large 
           screens around the room. A very different looking Idris, 
           decked out in ‘office causal’, watches the operation go down 
           with a group of colleagues.

           VIVIAN BOYER, early 50s, Idris’ droll but pragmatic 
           supervisor approaches him. She and Idris are close.

                                 VIVIAN
                        This really gonna be your last run with the circus?  I 
                        can’t believe we’re losing you.
                                 IDRIS
                        If I don’t hear the words Allahu Akbar for twenty 
                        years it’ll be too soon. I haven’t been allowed to shave 
                        in a year and a half. I forgot what my chin looks like.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I thought you might keep the beard. Kind of rugged.

                                 IDRIS
                        Renée gave me two conditions for moving back in: no 
                        more undercover assignments. No more beards.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Task master.
                             (then)
                        I’m happy for you. After all you’ve been through... 
                        Relationships are not my strong suit.

                                 IDRIS
                        They’re an acquired taste.

                                 VIVIAN
                        You sure you’re not gonna miss it?

                                 IDRIS
                             (re: TV screen)
                        After this, the men who took my son will finally face 
                        the consequences. Now I need to focus on my family. 
                        They don’t get to take that too.

           Vivian smiles and nods. 

           INT. AFZAAL’S VOLVO/EXT. STADE DE FRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Afzaal takes a last look up at the crowded stadium, then 
           reaches for his phone.

                                 AFZAAL
                        Allah forgive me.

           Suddenly, DGSE AGENTS in black swat gear EXPLODE from 
           everywhere - guns drawn. Afzaal is PULLED from his car, arms 
           raised, unbelieving. 

           EXT. STADE DE FRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           DGSE agent PAUL GUILLEMAN handcuffs Afzaal who lies prostrate 
           on the cement, looking both pained and relieved.
                                 GUILLEMAN
                        Whose side do you think Allah’s on now? 

           Suddenly, the crowd of onlookers behind Guilleman is ENGULFED 
           IN FLAMES as an ACTUAL BOMB EXPLODES at the entrance to the 
           stadium. Guilleman is thrown forward into the street as it 
           fills with smoke, screaming and blood. 

           INT. DGSE HEADQUARTERS - CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Idris stares at the screen in disbelief as the team around 
           him erupts into chaos.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LENA’S ROOM - LATER

           Lena sits on her bed, hunched over her computer. She has 
           multiple online conversations going on with groups of girls 
           with KITTEN avatars, ROARING LIONS or ARABIC WRITING. 

           She retweets a MEME of a hijabi in a jacket that says “HIJAB. 
           MY RIGHT. MY CHOICE. MY LIFE”. Her tweet immediately gets 
           five likes and a retweet. It feels good. She pulls out her 
           own scarf. It’s time.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Lena, in her hijab, sits across from Jeanne who seems amused.

                                 JEANNE
                        If you’re wearing that to get a 
                        rise out of me it’s not gonna work. 

                                 LENA
                        I’m wearing it because the Qur'an 
                        says we should dress modestly.

                                 JEANNE
                        You also gonna walk six steps 
                        behind your husband and strap a 
                        bomb to yourself if he tells you to 
                        blow up the Piggly Wiggly? 

                                 LENA
                        You think this is funny?

                                 JEANNE
                        I think it’s predictable. You’re a 
                        teenager. You’re supposed to do 
                        stupid things.
                                 LENA
                        I thought maybe we could use this 
                        as an opportunity to talk about how 
                        both of our religions talk about 
                        loss. There’s a lot of similarities-

                                 JEANNE
                        What do you think this is, the 
                        United Nations? This is Alabama.
                             (then)
                        Your mother used to pull stunts 
                        like this all the time. 

                                 LENA
                        This isn’t a stunt.

                                 JEANNE
                        Brought home a black boyfriend 
                        once. I didn’t say a thing! Came 
                        home crying to me two weeks later 
                        with a black eye. Didn’t need me to 
                        tell her to stick to her own kind 
                        after that. You’ll come to your 
                        senses.

                                 LENA
                             (under her breath)
                        You are so ignorant.  

                                 JEANNE
                        Do not talk to me like that. You 
                        can waltz down the highway to hell 
                        if you want to, but you will 
                        respect me as long as you’re living 
                        in this house. 

                                                     JEANNE (CONT'D)
                           LENA
           Maybe I don’t want to live in 
           your house.
                                              You’d think that raghead 
                                              religion’d have something to 
                                              say about young women holding 
                                              their tongue. 

                                 LENA
                        I think the Bible has that covered.

                                 JEANNE
                        I will pray for you. After twenty 
                        years of fighting the devil out of 
                        your mother, that’s about all I 
                        have left in me.
                                 LENA
                        You didn’t fight for her. You hid 
                        your nose in your Bible so you 
                        didn’t have to stop your husband 
                        beating your kids and worse. Why do 
                        you think your son is in jail and 
                        your daughter was a drug addict?

                                                      LENA (CONT'D)
                          JEANNE
           You don't know a damn thing 
           about it.
                                              Your devotion to God is a 
                                              joke.

                                 JEANNE
                        My devotion to God is the only 
                        reason you’re standing here. Your 
                        mother wanted to abort you and I 
                        wouldn’t let her. And this is what 
                        I get in return. 

           Lena stands there, reeling, then flees to her room. Jeanne 
           wrestles with her guilt and pain.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LENA’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Lena fondles the TICKETS. She should just fucking go, 
           shouldn’t she? Birmingham to Paris. Paris to Urfa, Turkey. 

           INT. DGSE OFFICES - BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Idris and Vivian walk down the concrete hall towards an 
           interrogation room.

                                 VIVIAN
                        The bomber was Jeroen Fawaz, we have him on 
                        CCTV footage crossing the intersection right before 
                        the attack.

                                 IDRIS
                        I know him. He was in the group. But he was new. A 
                        recruiter in Syria brought him to us. A woman.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Umm Layyin. Yes. We found another cell in his room. 
                        One we hadn’t tapped. Based on those texts, it seems 
                        they knew we infiltrated.

                                 IDRIS
                        They knew it was me?
           This guts Idris. The work he dedicated himself to for the 
           past year crumbling at his feet. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        I don’t know. Turns out the recruiter, Umm Layyin, 
                        she had her talons in Jeroen’s sister too. We caught her 
                        in the apartment on her way to the airport. Claims 
                        she didn’t know about the attack but got scared 
                        when her brother didn’t come home for a few days. 
                        Guilleman’s been talking to her. She’s been 
                        cooperating.

           She opens a door and ushers Idris in.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They enter a small dark room. Through a two-way mirror we see 
           Guilleman talking to SABEEN, 17, French-Algerian. Her eyes 
           are red from crying. An unopened coke sits in front of her. 
           They speak French.

                                 GUILLEMAN
                        She talked your brother into killing innocent people. 
                        You think she has your best interests at heart?
                             (no answer)
                        “If anyone slew a person, it would be as if he slew 
                        the whole people, and if anyone saved a life, it would 
                        be as if he saved the life of the whole people” - Al-
                        Qur’an 5:32.

           Sabeen is affected by the verse.

                                 SABEEN
                        You don’t know what it’s like in the 93. My brother 
                        worked hard, not like all the gangbangers. He got 
                        good grades. He applied for thirty jobs. But every 
                        employer turned him down because he’s from the 
                        Banlieue. They tell us we’re French. We have to do 
                        everything they say. I have to take my head scarf off 
                        at school. But when we turn around and ask for 
                        equality, they spit in our face.

           Idris gestures for a TECH to give him the microphone to speak 
           into Guilleman’s earpiece.

                        Ask if the recruiter’s still planning on meeting her. 

           We see Guilleman ask and Sabeen nod, yes.
                                 IDRIS (CONT’D)
                        Then tell her she’s got a plane to catch. 

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - AFTERNOON

           Jeanne watches THE BACHELOR while ironing, feigning 
           disapproval. The bachelorettes squeal in excitement as The 
           BACHELOR surveys his options, deciding who will get his rose. 

           Lena comes home. She notices the door to her mother’s room is 
           open and the walls are bare.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - SHAUNA’S ROOM/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She enters to find the entire room has been stripped clean. 
           The closet is empty. Lena is horrified.

                                 JEANNE 
                        I finally went through it all. I 
                        saved a few of her earrings for 
                        you.

                                 LENA
                        I was going to do it! You couldn’t 
                        have waited a day?

                                 JEANNE
                        Waddaya want, a month of Sundays? 
                        Threw out your Ko-ran too while I 
                        was at it and that little rug.

                                 LENA
                        You fucking bitch!

                                 JEANNE
                        I don’t think Allah’d approve of 
                        that language.

           Lena stares at her in disbelief, then walks out the door.

                                 JEANNE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going? I’m doing this 
                        all for your own good! 

           INT. SEPIDEH’S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Nousha ushers Lena in. Sepideh is still in a coma. The 
           hospital bed and machines have merely been relocated. Lena 
           takes her friends hand, realizing this might be the last time 
           she sees her.
                                 LENA
                        Figured out what I’m gonna do. 
                             (then)
                        Love you.

           She kisses her on the cheek and hurries out.

           EXT. SEPIDEH’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Walking to the bus stop, Lena checks her backpack. The 
           tickets are still there. She quickens her pace, determined to 
           leave all of this behind her. 

           INTERCUT: CHARLES DE GAULLE / DGSE CENTRAL COMMAND - MORNING

           Sabeen walks through the dazzlingly lit terminal and makes 
           her way towards GATE 14A, flight to URFA, TURKEY

           SUPERTITLE: CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT, PARIS

           Behind her, Idris and Guilleman follow at a distance. They’re 
           dressed as tourists. Idris speaks to Vivian and her team at 
           DGSE Central command via an ear piece.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Any sign of the other recruit she mentioned?

                                 IDRIS
                        Looking...

           A FLIGHT ATTENDANT announces boarding. Sabeen gets in line. 
           Idris and Guilleman take a last look and fall in behind her. 

           Lena races through the terminal towards the gate, late from 
           her connecting flight. She gets in line behind a SYRIAN 
           FAMILY. Idris and Guilleman take a final look around as they 
           board, missing Lena, her blondeness hidden by her hijab.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Lena is squeezed into a window seat beside a YOUNG MIDDLE 
           EASTERN COUPLE. They are watching a movie on their laptop, 
           the woman’s head nestled on her husbands shoulder. Beside 
           them, Lena flips through photos on her phone of her and 
           Sepideh, loneliness weighing on her.
           INT. SANLIURFA AIRPORT - URFA, TURKEY - DAY

           Lena stares at the unfamiliar swath of humanity bustling 
           beneath bright red Turkish flags with white crescent moons.

           SUPERTITLE: SANLURFA AIRPORT, TURKEY

           As she makes her way towards the sliding glass doors, CAB 
           DRIVERS swarm her, shouting for her attention. She searches 
           the crowd, unnerved that so many of the women are hidden 
           under pillars of black fabric.

                                 A VOICE (O.C.)
                        Lena?

           She turns, hopefully, but it’s Sabeen. 

                                 SABEEN
                        Sabeen. Asalamu Aleikum. I’m 
                        meeting Umm Layyin too. Have you 
                        seen her? 

           Lena eyes her. Something about her cheeriness seems forced.

                                 LENA
                        Yeah. She didn’t tell me she was 
                        meeting anyone else.

                                 SABEEN
                        Well, here I am.

           Idris and Guilleman clear customs and push through the crowd 
           towards the two girls.

                                 IDRIS
                             (into earpiece)
                        She’s talking to another recruit. Waiting on the target.

           Guilleman moves closer to the girls but Idris holds him off, 
           not wanting to tip off whoever they’re meeting.

           Sabeen speaks quickly, a smile plastered to her face. 

                                 SABEEN
                        Someone followed us here. Don’t 
                        look. They’re behind me to the 
                        left. We have to lose them, so when 
                        I say go, run. OK?

                                 LENA
                        What?
                                 SABEEN
                        Go!

           Sabeen bolts for the revolving glass doors. 

                                 IDRIS
                        Shit!

           Idris and Guilleman take off after them. Lena sees them 
           barreling down. Sabeen was right! They really are being 
           followed. She takes off after Sabeen, slamming through the 
           doors moments before the agents.

           EXT. SANLIURFA AIRPORT - DAY

           Lena is blinded by the morning sun as she runs after Sabeen 
           through ARRIVALS. She senses Idris and Guilleman gaining. 
           Then suddenly she’s lifted off her feet. A door is opened and 
           she’s SHOVED into a waiting car. The agents scramble as the 
           SUV screeches away from the curb. 

                                 GUILLEMAN
                        Shit.

           Idris moves a couple hailing a cab out of the way and pushes 
           Guilleman in. They screech off, following the SUV. 

           INT. SUV - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena and Sabeen are thrown against the window as the SUV 
           veers out of the airport. 

                                 A VOICE (O.C.)
                        Asalamu Aleikum, ukhti.

           Lena turns, relieved to see Umm Layyin lean out of the 
           darkness of the back seat.

           INTERCUT: INT. CAB - DAY/ INT. DGSE CONTROL ROOM  - DAY

           Idris strains to keep an eye on the SUV through the dust-
           encrusted windshield as they weave through the city. 
           Guilleman argues with the terrified CAB DRIVER. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        What’s going on?

                                 IDRIS
                             (into earpiece)
                        They’re in a black SUV. We’re tailing them. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 IDRIS (CONT'D)
                        Except this cab driver is about to shit his pants.
                             (to cab driver in Arabic)
                        Here’s 300 lira. You get 300 more when we get to 
                        where we’re going.

           Idris throws money at the terrified driver.

                                 VIVIAN
                        We don’t have anyone covering you. Turn around. It’s 
                        over. 

                                 IDRIS
                        We’re practically on top of them.

                                 VIVIAN
                             (to Tech Analyst)
                        Get me a lock on his cell signal and a visual. 

                                 TECH ANALYST
                        Got him.

           We see the SUV from an airborne DRONE’S POV as the car cuts 
           through the outer limits of the city and out into the desert.

                                 TECH ANALYST (CONT’D)
                        Private oil refinery to the East, Organization-

                                 VIVIAN
                             (to Idris)
                        If they go West, try to cut them off before the market. 
                        Do not follow them in.

           INT. SUV - DAY

           Lena marvels at seeing her friend in the flesh. But Umm 
           Layyin is not her usual bubbly self. Her eyes are on the rear 
           view mirror and she barks an order in Arabic to the driver.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Turn right up here and take the back route to the 
                        market near the border.
                             (to Sabeen)
                        Who was following you?

                                 SABEEN
                        I don’t know. I saw two men staring 
                        at us in the airport and I got a 
                        bad feeling.
                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Did you know they were following 
                        you in Paris?

                                 SABEEN
                        No! I swear. If I did, I wouldn’t 
                        have gotten on the plane.

           Umm Layyin studies her, suspicious.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Passports and phones. 
                             (off Lena’s look)
                        They can use them to track you. 
                        Even when they’re off.

           Lena hands her passport and phone over. Sabeen does too, but 
           Umm Layyin clocks her hesitation.

           The SUV turns right towards the market. Umm Layyin checks the 
           rearview mirror. Nothing. Then the CAB reappears, making the 
           turn as well. Her face darkens as she pulls out her cell.

           INT. CAB - MOMENTS LATER  

           The DRIVER is panicked. Idris is trying to convince him to 
           keep driving.

                                 IDRIS
                        Well, then call someone who wants our money.

                                 DRIVER
                        I’m not stopping at that market. The Organization 
                        has control of that market.

                                 IDRIS
                        If the SUV pulls in, drop us at the front.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        You have a death wish.
                             (under his breath)
                        Idiot.

           EXT. TURKEY - MARKET - DAY

           DRONE POV: The SUV turns into the dirt parking lot of an 
           outdoor market. It’s a patchwork of multi-colored stalls and 
           human targets. The cab stops abruptly at the entrance.

           ANGLE ON: Idris and Guilleman exiting the cab. They do their 
           best to cross the lot surreptitiously and approach the SUV. 
           Suddenly the car screeches into motion, nearly running them 
           over. They barely dodge it as they catch sight of Umm Layyin, 
           Sabeen and Lena disappearing into the stalls. They follow.

           INT. DGSE HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Vivian and her team watch Idris and Guilleman disappear into 
           the maze of canopies from the DRONE POV on the screen.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Idris, get out of there. We don’t have eyes on you.

           EXT. TURKEY - MARKET - DAY

           IDRIS’ POV: He’s just able to keep sight of Lena’s bright 
           blue head scarf as he and Guilleman gain some ground.

                                 IDRIS
                             (to Vivian)
                        We almost have them.

           LENA’S POV: She follows Umm Layyin through a river of 
           brightly painted bowls and spices. She hears a commotion 
           behind them and sees Idris and Guilleman gaining ground.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        We’re almost there. Stay close.

           For Idris and Guilleman, the market is an obstacle course of 
           carts and animals. People shout at them as they knock wares 
           asunder. In Umm Layyin’s wake, however, the girls flow 
           effortlessly through the crowd like water. 

           But when they round a corner, Lena is panicked to find them 
           facing a concrete wall at the end of the row. Umm Layyin 
           continues, unfazed. 

           Idris and Guilleman round the corner moments later, barreling 
           down on them. At the last minute, Umm Layyin leads them 
           through a curtain behind a stall and they are swallowed -- 

           INT. DESERT COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

           -- by cool darkness into a room of stone.

           EXT. TURKEY - MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

           Idris and Guilleman burst through the same stall only to find 
           a locked wooden door. The try to break through in vain.
                                 IDRIS
                        They’re gone.

           INT. DESERT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena and Sabeen follow Umm Layyin through the shadowy 
           compound, past a courtyard open to the sky and into --

           INT. DESERT COMPOUND - BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           -- a sparse room filled with wooden bunks. Two SOLDIERS move 
           a bed to the side of the room. They then open the TRAP DOOR 
           beneath, revealing the entrance to an underground tunnel.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        This is how we cross the border, 
                        Inshallah. Don’t look so nervous, 
                        woman. This is the way to Paradise.

           Lena takes a deep breath and slides down into the hole. 

           INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Before her stretches a long narrow tunnel lined with wooden 
           beams and dim electric lights. It seems to go on forever, 
           sloping down into the darkness.

           Above, she hears Umm Layyin and Sabeen ARGUING in Arabic. She 
           moves back into the light of the hole but can’t see what’s 
           happening. Umm Layyin appears above her.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Go, I’m coming behind you. Go!

           Lena grits her teeth and walks into the abyss. Suddenly 
           there’s a thump of someone landing in the tunnel. Lena’s 
           relieved to see Umm Layyin, illuminated by a flash light.

                                 LENA
                        Where’s Sabeen?

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        She had reservations. It’s OK, I’m 
                        right behind you. It’s sort of fun, 
                        right? Like a Nancy Drew novel. 

           Lena stiffens, but decides to accept the soothing confidence 
           of Umm Layyin’s tone. A knot begins to form in her belly as 
           she realizes she no longer has any other choice.
           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - NIGHT

           Jeanne sits on her couch staring at the same Sudoku puzzle 
           she’s been staring at for an hour. It’s 9pm. She finally 
           picks up her CELL PHONE and texts Lena: WHERE ARE YOU? 

           The display shows that at lest the last seven texts have been 
           Jeanne to Lena: WHERE ARE YOU? Jeanne can’t stand it anymore. 
           She gets up.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LENA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeanne rifles through Lena’s desk drawer and starts going 
           through her closet. She finds her COMPUTER hidden under a 
           pile of sweaters.

           She opens it and starts clicking around. She finds a PHOTO of 
           WOMEN IN NIQABS burning their PASSPORTS. She sees the LIST of 
           past calls to Mohammed and Umm Layyin, CHAT CONVERSATIONS. 
           She sees the BROWSER TAB for directions to the BIRMINGHAM 
           AIRPORT. A chill of realization begins to creep over her.

           INT. INTERNET CAFE - ISTANBUL - DAY

           Idris hunches over a computer at an Internet cafe. The 
           muffled sound of gunfire emanates from the earphones of 
           throngs of teenage boys playing video games around him.

           He speaks to Vivian and her team on his phone and refers to 
           several databases and Twitter archives.

                                 IDRIS
                             (into phone)
                        Looks like the other recruit was Lena Alder from 
                        Gardendale, Alabama. Only other single female on 
                        the flight. Had multiple exchanges with Umm 
                        Layyin on Twitter in January before they switch over 
                        to ChatApp. I called her high school. She hasn’t shown 
                        up for two days. They referred me to a grandmother.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I’ll reach out to my contact at the CIA. 

                                 IDRIS
                        Don’t do that. We involve the Americans, they’ll blow 
                        up six city blocks and miss the target. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        What target is that?
                                 IDRIS
                        We have a once in a lifetime opportunity to track a 
                        recruiter who’s radicalized dozens if not hundreds of 
                        French citizens and Americans. This is our chance to 
                        take out the pied piper.   

                                 VIVIAN
                        How do you expect to do that? No one’s been able to 
                        ID a woman on the street in Raqqa to target. If 
                        nothing else, a burka is a fabulous disguise. 

                                 IDRIS
                        Almost all foreign recruits contact their families at 
                        least once after they arrive. More once they realize 
                        they’re not exactly in Allah’s paradise. This girl and 
                        Umm Layyin are close. If I can coach the 
                        grandmother, she could lead us to Umm Layyin.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Then what? You go in and take her out? A 
                        parliamentary committee’s been set up. They’re 
                        investigating me and the agency about what went 
                        wrong with the stadium bombing. Neither of us can 
                        afford to take any chances with protocol right now. 

                                 IDRIS
                        The Organization has media centers where they’re 
                        systematically recruiting Western youth. If this 
                        recruit can track Umm Layyin for us, we can take 
                        them all out.
                             (a beat as she thinks)
                        You’re not authorizing me to do anything I haven’t 
                        done before. 

                                 VIVIAN
                        I don’t want you to make this personal. It was a 
                        miracle you were able to track down your son, let 
                        alone bring him back. We don’t have The Almighty 
                        on our pay roll.  

                                 IDRIS
                        This isn’t about bringing her back. She’s a terrorist. 
                        We use her to find the target, that’s it. Last time was 
                        a mistake, it was personal. Let me make up for that.

           After a pause.
                                 VIVIAN
                        OK.  Commissioner has it out for me anyway. Might 
                        as well make his job easy. It’s both our funeral. 

           Off Idris, smiling at her begrudging blessing.

           EXT. NORTHERN SYRIA - RAQQA - DAY

           A dusty 4X4 cuts through the dessert. It approaches an 
           ancient city, one that had blossomed into a modern metropolis 
           by 2013, only to be thrown back into the dark ages. 

           INT. 4X4 - CONTINOUS

           Lena and Umm Layyin now wear their niqabs and eye veils. 
           Through the thin black fabric, Lena watches nervously as they 
           approach an armed checkpoint. 

           A dozen guards are nestled into the regal but crumbling stone 
           gate to the city. A massive black billboard exalts The 
           Organization in bright white Arabic writing. 

           The 4x4 pulls into the lane for civilian and military 
           vehicles. Oil tankers and trucks inch forward in another lane 
           nearby. A SOLDIER in fatigues and a black mask over his face 
           taps the window for their driver to lower it.

                                 SOLDIER
                        IDs.

           The driver hands over papers, including Lena’s PASSPORT. The 
           Soldier scrutinizes Umm Layyin and Lena. 

                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        We need to check the women. Pull over there.

           The driver pulls over and parks beside a wall boasting a 
           MOSAIC of PRESIDENT ASSAD, his face smashed. 

           EXT. RAQQA NORTHERN CHECKPOINT - DAY

           The Soldier ushers Umm Layyin and Lena behind the wall and 
           into a tent serving as a makeshift female checkpoint.

           INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Two WOMEN in full niqabs greet them. Lena follows Umm 
           Layyin’s lead, removing her niqab. The pillars of blackness 
           stare down on them like the hooded fates of Greek mythology.
                                 WOMAN
                             (calling out)
                        Approved.

           INT. 4X4/EXT. RAQQA CITY PROPER - DAY

           They drive into the city proper. Lena stares out the window 
           at the still-burning debris of bombed-out modern high rises 
           mixed with the aging rubble of 12th century ruins. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Assad bombs us by day. The West 
                        bombs us by night, but we continue 
                        to grow in strength.

                                 LENA
                        From the rubble we will build a 
                        paradise.

           Despite the wreckage, traffic bustles through roundabouts and 
           down palm tree lined streets. Bearded men and niqab clad 
           women with children weave in and out of stores. 

           This occupied city is still striving for normalcy despite 
           their murderous oppressors. The Organization’s black flag 
           appears and reappears like a warning sign at every turn.

           The 4X4 pulls up in front of a small sand-colored domestic 
           property, the Maqqar, or Female Dormitory, where women new to 
           the The Caliphate await being matched with a husband.

           INT. MAQQAR - ENTRYWAY/HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING

           Lena clutches her backpack as she enters the sparse but 
           pleasant compound. A bouquet of lavender stands on a table by 
           the doorway. She follows Umm Layyin down a narrow hall.

           DAMIA, 24, Malaysian, her face a moonscape of acne scars, 
           pokes her head out from a room with several bunk beds. Umm 
           Layyin takess Lena’s backpack from her and hands it to Damia.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Damia, take this for our new sister 
                        and make her a bed for the night.

           Damia nods as Lena and Umm Layyin continue down the hall.

                                 UMM LAYYIN (CONT’D)
                        Some of the sisters here made their 
                        hijrah even without a mahram. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 UMM LAYYIN (CONT’D)
                        It takes us a bit to find them a 
                        match They live here in the 
                        meantime.

           INT. MAQQAR - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As they enter the dining room, they’re enveloped in the 
           chaotic chatter of a group of young women setting a long 
           table for dinner.

           All the young women wear hijabs and Western clothes: jeans, 
           polos, sweaters. Damia joins the other women who are all of 
           Middle Eastern descent. They include AZIZAH, 24, British, 
           MANAR, 18, Tunisian and SENAIT, 21, Swedish. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Good evening, ladies. Allah, by his grace, has sent 
                        us a new sister. Lena joins us in 
                        our blessed Land of Khilafah all 
                        the way from America. 

           Their eyebrows raise.

                                 UMM LAYYIN (CONT’D)
                        Alhamdulillah, she will only be with us 
                        for tonight. Tomorrow she will 
                        marry her mujahid. Let us all 
                        continue to praise Allah with every 
                        action so that he may provide the 
                        same for all of us. Make her feel 
                        welcome and let us humbly break 
                        bread together, Bismillah.

           Lena gingerly takes a seat as the women erupt into gossip. 

                                 SENAIT
                             (to Damia)
                        Meanwhile, I’ve been here for two 
                        months and I’m so bored I started 
                        braiding my hair... down there.

                                 DAMIA
                        THAT will be a surprise for your 
                        mujahid on your wedding night.

                                 AZIZAH
                        Just tell him all the girls in 
                        Sweden do it like that.

           Lena watches, envious of their camaraderie but secretly proud 
           she has something they want.
                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Senait if your hands are so idle I 
                        have an abaya that needs to be 
                        hemmed. No braids please.

           The girls snort with laughter. Senait goes beet red.

                                 UMM LAYYIN (CONT’D)
                        Let us pray.

           Umm Layyin begins the Du’a prayer. They all fall silent and 
           reverent. Lena closes her eyes and lets the warmth of the 
           prayer comfort her in this strange place. Afterward, Aziza 
           grabs Lena’s plate and starts to fill it with food.

                                 AZIZAH
                        Lena, have you ever had Kousa 
                        Mahshi? Manar prepared it tonight 
                        and it doesn’t even smell like wet 
                        dog this time.

                                 MANAR
                        I was making it how my mom taught 
                        me. Boil it to death.

                                 SENAIT
                        Ugh. Infidels cannot cook mahshi.

                                 AZIZAH
                             (to Lena)
                        I’ll show you how to make it 
                        tonight. Men here go crazy for it.

                                 SENAIT
                             (re: Azizah)
                        She’s already been married once.

                                 AZIZAH
                             (genuinely)
                        May he rest in peace. May we be reunited 
                        in Jannah.

                                 LENA
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 AZIZAH
                        Don’t be. This is the fate we all 
                        wish for our mujahid, Alhamdulillah.

           This catches Lena off-guard. The realities of her likely 
           widowhood hadn’t hit her until this moment. 
           Suddenly the room is ROCKED by an ear-splitting explosion. 
           Cookware SMASHES. The girls SCREAM. The air is thick with 
           dirt and smoke. A mortar must have hit a few buildings away.

           Lena ducks under the table but sees Umm Layyin and Aziza run 
           out to the street. She realizes the other women are already 
           transforming the room into a makeshift hospital.

           Umm Layyin and Azizah return, carrying the bloody bodies of a 
           mother and child. Damia hands Lena large pieces of cloth to 
           rip up for bandages. Lena watches Azizah deftly treating the 
           child’s wounds, cooing to him. 

                                 DAMIA
                        She was a doctor in England. Had a 
                        really nice flat and everything. 
                        Gave it all up to come here. 

                                 LENA
                        She’s amazing.

                                 DAMIA
                        I don’t think I’d have come if I 
                        had all that.

                                 LENA
                        I’m sure you would have. 

                                 DAMIA
                        Would you? 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Lena, get more water from the 
                        kitchen.

           She does, grateful for the interruption.

           EXT. WATERFRONT - ISTANBUL - DAY

           Idris searches the bustling city square. Tourists and 
           families mingle among the street food stalls. A band busks.  

           Idris approaches one of the vendors, OMAR, late 60s, Afro-
           Turk, with a striking resemblance to Idris. He’s serving 
           sweet corn and chestnuts at a stall with a red and white 
           awning. Idris smiles a greeting. The man stares at him for a 
           moment, then goes back to serving his customers. 

                                 IDRIS
                             (in Turkish)
                        Dad, can we talk somewhere for a bit? 
                                 OMAR
                        I close at seven.

           EXT. ISTANBUL SQUARE - LATER

           Idris and Omar sit on a bench holding uneaten kebab 
           sandwiches. The teenage buskers still play nearby. 

                                 IDRIS
                        You were supposed to open your shop. What 
                        happened to the money I sent you?

                                 OMAR
                        There were people who needed it more than me.  I 
                        gave it as my zakat, and yours.

                                 IDRIS
                        I don’t need you to pay off Allah to save my soul.

                                 OMAR
                        You’re right. Only you can do that. But I’ve been 
                        praying for you, anyway. You’re in pain and your 
                        pride is keeping you from healing. Your pride has 
                        always gotten in your way. You think you blame 
                        Allah for these things that have happened to you, for 
                        Kamal being recruited by those murderers, but who 
                        you really blame is yourself.

           Idris bristles but tries not to show it.

                                 IDRIS
                        I forgot. People come for your corn but they stay for 
                        the psychoanalysis. This is why you need a shop, so 
                        you can charge by the hour.

                                 OMAR
                        I don’t need a shop. I need my son.
                             (then)
                        When your mother wanted to take you to France, I 
                        said go. I thought this was the best thing for your 
                        education and then you would come back. Maybe 
                        that was a mistake. You’ve become like them. You 
                        think faith itself is the enemy.

           Idris stays silent, knowing his father won’t like his answer.  

                                 OMAR (CONT’D)
                        There was a bombing here last week, down the 
                        street. Forty people died.  Last month, a hundred.

                        We are your people. We are God fearing Muslims and 
                        we are being massacred.

                                 IDRIS
                        I know.

                                 OMAR
                        Maybe when you’re done protecting the French, you’ll 
                        come back and protect your people.

           Off Idris, ashamed. 

           INT. RAQQA MOSQUE - ANTEROOM - DAY

           A pilar of white, sparkling fabric moves towards a full 
           length mirror. In the reflection we see it’s Lena, dressed in 
           her wedding abaya and the tight white cap that goes under her  
           niqab. She fondles the delicate fabric.

                                 LENA
                        It’s so beautiful. Is it too much?

           Umm Layyin leans into the reflection beside her.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        It’s your wedding day, woman! This 
                        is when you get to make Mohammed 
                        ache with gratitude for the breadth 
                        of Allah’s gifts to him.

           Umm Layyin ties the shimmery white wedding niqab beneath 
           Lena’s eyes, places a jeweled pendant on her forehead 
           finishing the wrapping of the veil.

                                 UMM LAYYIN (CONT’D)
                        Have you chosen your kunya?

                                 LENA
                        Umm Ambar. For the slave who became 
                        a general.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Beautiful.  It’s time, girl. You 
                        nervous?

                                 LENA
                        Yes. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        You should be. Mohammed is even 
                        more handsome in person. 
           They actually giggle.

                                 LENA
                        I’m here for his faith.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        I know. But it doesn’t hurt.
                             (giggles)
                        But seriously. You have nothing to 
                        be afraid of. You’re home now. ‘Fear 
                        Allah, and you have nothing else to fear in this life.’

           Lena smiles, soaking in Umm Layyin’s promise.

           INT. MOSQUE - ANTEROOM - DAY

           Hand on her back, Umm Layyin, now also wearing her full 
           niqab, leads Lena into a small, dark paneled room. Two red 
           cushioned chairs flank a table boasting a massive ledger. 

           The IMAM is mid argument with a soldier, HAMID, 21, with a 
           patchy beard and wild eyes that seem to be trying to leap out 
           of his skull and make up for their foot difference in height.

           Lena can’t understand them but is unnerved by the anger in 
           their exchange. Umm Layyin says something that makes the Imam 
           shift uncomfortably, then gesture for Lena to take a seat.

           A door on the other side of the room opens. Mohammed, shorter 
           and stockier than he appeared on Skype but with the same 
           handsome face, enters. He’s accompanied by his cousin Sami, 
           tall and ominously serious. He walks with a slight limp. 

           Through the white mesh of her wedding niqab, Lena watches 
           Mohammed transform the energy in the room with gregarious 
           charm as he greets the Imam.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Sorry we’re late, Imam Tarek. My superiors were 
                        arranging a gift to help towards the broken windows 
                        you sustained last month. 

           He offers a package to the Imam who takes it, tentatively. 

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        This is my cousin, Sami. He’ll be my representative.

                                 SAMI
                        Second cousin. Hello, Imam Tarek.
                                 IMAM
                        And you’re aware that your fiance, Umm Ambar has 
                        no representative?

                                 MOHAMMED
                        It’s unfortunate, yes, but when you’re born to kafir in 
                        the land of Satan you have to be cut some slack, by 
                        the grace of Allah. Am I right?

           Hamid snorts down what might have been a chortle. Mohammed 
           takes his seat and fixes his gaze intently on Lena.

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        As-salamu alaykum, Umm Ambar. That’s a 
                        very beautiful kunya.

                                 LENA
                        Walalaykumu s-salam. Thank you.

           Lena can barely breathe but manages an answer, one of the few 
           Arabic words she feels comfortable with.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Are you going to take off the 
                        niqab?

                                 LENA
                        Oh! Sorry.

           She does, blushing. Their eyes meet and she feels tears 
           welling at how earnest and kind his face seems to be.

                                 IMAM
                             (to Lena)
                        Since you do not have a representative repeat after 
                        me. “I have given away myself in Nikah to you, 
                        Mohammed Halabi.”

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Repeat after him. “I have given away myself...”

                                 LENA
                        I have given away mysaf...

                                 IMAM
                        No, ‘myself’

                                 MOHAMMED
                        She doesn’t understand. Skip it. She accepts. Sami?
                                 SAMI
                        I accept the Nikah on behalf of Mohammed Halabi, 
                        who has appointed me.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        I’ll see you at our new home, my wife.

           He signs the ledger quickly, winking at her.

                                 IMAM
                        What about the Khutba?

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Next time!

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Such a charmer!

           As they leave, Sami looks at Lena with a stern, searching 
           intensity that sends shivers up her spine.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - DAY

           Lena sits stiffly on a couch in a tidy apartment next to 
           ZEINAH, 27, Sami’s older sister. She’s polite, though seems a 
           bit thrown by the whole situation.

           Female neighbors and family members mill around, waiting for 
           the men. They eye Lena but do not approach. The women are not 
           currently wearing face veils, though they have them at the 
           ready for when it becomes a mixed gathering. 

           Zeinah’s three children run laps back and forth between her 
           and the appetizers on the table.

                                 LENA
                        They’re so cute. Mohammed is your 
                        cousin, right? How long has he 
                        lived with your family here?

           Zeinah chooses her words carefully, keeping a smile and 
           looking around to clock who might understand English.

                                 ZEINAH
                        Since the Organization came to the 
                        city. We didn’t know him very well 
                        before that.

                                 LENA
                        But he helped you keep your 
                        apartment downstairs, right?

                        housing to fighters’ families.

                                 ZEINAH
                        He did.
                             (after an awkward pause)
                        What part of America are you from?

                        Alabama. The South.

                                 ZEINAH
                        Ah. Like To Kill a Mockingbird. 

                                 LENA
                        Yeah. Exactly. Your English is so 
                        good. Where did you learn it?

                                 ZEINAH
                        At university. I was a literature 
                        teacher. Before.

           Lena waits for her to elaborate on what she means, but she 
           doesn’t. Nearby a neighbor, DUA, 50s whispers to Zeina and 
           Sami’s mother, FATIMA, 50s in the adjoining kitchen. 

                                 DUA
                        First your fanatical nephew and now this. She must 
                        be even more crazy than him to come here from the 
                        West. She could be schizophrenic or something. She’ll 
                        murder us all in our beds, as if we aren’t dealing with 
                        enough.

                                 FATIMA
                        I feel very sad for her.  Whatever she’s come from 
                        cannot be pleasant to choose this life. 

                                 DUA
                        Or she’s a spoiled brat looking to profit off our misery.
                             (off Fatima’s look)
                        I’m sorry. It’s all such a farce. Allah is weeping upon 
                        this mess of haram.

                                 FATIMA
                        May he forgive us all and what we do to survive this. 

           They hear the banging of drums and singing from the hallway 
           as the men approach, delivering the husband to his new wife 
           in the traditional Arada wedding procession. They enter.
           Lena watches as Mohammed hugs and greets the guests. It’s 
           like a strange, slightly terrifying dream. Then he finds her 
           and winks and she wonders if maybe everything will be OK.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mohammed and Lena sit on the bed of a sparse room filled with 
           an odd combination of religious books and stuffed animals. 
           Mohammed caresses her face and kisses her, the first time 
           either of them has kissed anyone. It’s tender if ungainly. He 
           turns her and unzips her dress. She can’t believe this is 
           happening and shudders with anticipation. 

           What happens next is a lot like most of our first time. 
           Mohammed is clumsily attentive, Lena submissive and 
           forgiving. Then he starts to lose himself and there’s an 
           awkward loneliness to the proceedings. 

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           They are in bed. Mohammed strokes her face.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        I have a gift for you. A wedding present. 

           He goes to the closet and brings back new sheets for the bed 
           and a massive white KALASHNIKOV.

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        It’s big gun for my little 
                        muhajirah. It’s for killing infidels.  Follow me.

           He sits behind her, helping her hold it. He puts her finger 
           on the trigger and moves the gun as if he’s shooting.

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        Pow! Pow! Pow! What do you think?

           He aims it at a stuffed cartoon BEAR on the bookshelf. 

                                 LENA
                        It’s very shiny, but I don’t need a 
                        gun. No guns. I came to take care of 
                        you and help people while we build 
                        the Caliphate. Umm Layyin said I 
                        would get training in first aid.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        That’s good. But to help people you 
                        have to not be dead. Here, you’ll 
                        be good at it. Pow! Take that, infidel!
                                 (MORE)
                                 MOHAMMED (CONT'D)
                             (smiling)
                        You don’t have to kill anyone. But 
                        you should have it to protect 
                        yourself. Also, tomorrow I’m going 
                        to fight near Deir Ezzor. I might 
                        be gone for a week so I need a 
                        photo to remember you by. Here.

           He grabs his phone and snaps a photo of her. She smiles.

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        Now....

           He throws open her robe, shoves the gun in her hands and 
           snaps another photo. 

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        Much better.

           She sits there, shocked as he kisses her on the cheek and 
           points to the clean bedsheets.

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        Make the bed. Zeinah will show you 
                        how to clean the sheets tomorrow.

           He heads to the bathroom. Lena stays shell-shocked, holding 
           the brutal, glistening gun.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeanne is madly GOOGLING when her CELL RINGS. It’s an 
           international number. She answers, hopeful.

                                 JEANNE
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                 A MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello. Is this Jeanne Alder?

                                 JEANNE
                        Who wants to know?

           INTERCUT: INT. ISTANBUL HOTEL - NIGHT

           Idris talks on his cell, looking out his window. The golden-
           lit mosques of the city glow brightly in the night.

                                 IDRIS
                        My name is Idris Abdullah. I’m an 
                        intelligence officer in France.

                                 IDRIS (CONT'D)
                        I know this may come as a shock, 
                        but we believe your granddaughter 
                        traveled to Syria yesterday to join 
                        an extremist organization.

                                 JEANNE
                             (covering)
                        Now why in creation would she do 
                        somethin’ like that?

                                 IDRIS
                        I’m not sure, ma’am. We have 
                        surveillance footage of her 
                        boarding a flight to Turkey from 
                        Paris and eye witnesses that saw 
                        her traveling with a recruiter to a 
                        safe house. I’ve emailed you a 
                        photo so you can confirm.

           Jeanne clicks on her email. There’s the PHOTO.

                                 IDRIS (CONT’D)
                        Were you aware she was talking to 
                        people online in Syria, ma’am?

                                 JEANNE
                        Why are you callin’ me? If any of 
                        this is true, shouldn’t I be 
                        talkin’ to the F.B.I.?

                                 IDRIS
                        I wouldn’t recommend that. Your 
                        government doesn’t look kindly on 
                        people who join terrorist 
                        organizations. If you want to see 
                        your granddaughter alive or outside 
                        a maximum security prison in the 
                        next twenty years, I suggest you 
                        keep this between us.

                                 JEANNE
                        Are you threatening me?

                                 IDRIS
                        I didn’t mean it like that. I’m 
                        trying to help you. The recruiter 
                        who targeted Lena is very active in 
                        France. We believe Lena can lead us 
                        to her, but we need to contact her. 
                        She may reach out to you. If she 
                        does, we need you to try to get as 
                        much information out of her as 
                        possible.

                        If she’s willing to help us, then 
                        we may be able to help her return 
                        to the U.S. Did she leave behind a 
                        laptop or a cell phone?

           Jeanne is silent, trying to process all this.

                                 IDRIS (CONT’D)
                        Miss Alder, I know what you’re 
                        feeling. Unfortunately, I’ve been 
                        through it myself.

                                 JEANNE
                        You have no idea what I’m feeling.
                             (then)
                        If she’s gone and done this, then 
                        she’s made her bed with the devil. 
                        I can’t help you, I’m sorry.

                                 IDRIS
                        Ma’am, please. If not for her--

           She HANGS UP on him, angry, heartbroken and shaking.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

           Lena helps Fatima, Mohammed’s aunt, prepare Freekeh with 
           Chicken for dinner. Zeinah cuts onions while her kids play in 
           the living room. They speak in English and Arabic.

                                 FATIMA
                        Pull the skin off the chicken like this. Then cut it.

           Lena attempts it, badly.

                                 ZEINAH
                        You didn’t cook in America?

                                 LENA
                        My grandma did most of it.

           A pang of homesickness hits her. All those meals she took for 
           granted. She’s cut her finger. Blood gets on the chicken.

                                 FATIMA
                        Careful!

                                 LENA
                        I’m sorry.
                                 ZEINAH
                        You’d think you would have 
                        practiced before you came here to 
                        be a mujahideen housewife.

           Lena doubles her effort, embarrassed. She hardly expected her 
           greatest challenge here to be cooking. Zeinah softens.

                                 ZEINAH (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be fine. Repetition teaches even a 
                        donkey. I’ll come help you until you 
                        get the hang of it. How long did 
                        Mohammed say he would be gone? 

                                 LENA
                        Two weeks. Thank you. I’m sure you 
                        have a lot of better things to do. 

                                 ZEINAH
                        Not really.

           Before Lena can decipher this response, the door opens and 
           Sami limps in. He kisses his mother, then turns to Lena.

                                 SAMI
                        As-salaam 'alaykum, Umm Ambar. I am to 
                        drive you to Umm Layyin. She’s 
                        requested a meeting with you.

                                 LENA
                        Is it OK if I go?

                                 ZEINAH
                        I think we’ll manage.

           INT. CAR/EXT. RAQQA - DAY

           Lena sits in the backseat as Sami drives her through the hazy 
           city. She wears her full niqab, only her eyes showing. She 
           watches the world through the tinted windows, everyday life 
           bursting forth from the war-ravaged city.

           Next to a store, two old MEN converse near a wall splattered 
           with dry blood. A FIGHTER and his WIFE walk out of a bakery 
           carrying steaming bread, cuddling their child.

           Sami stares out at the road, ignoring her. His icy demeanor 
           has started to annoy her. She attempts a conversation.
                                 LENA
                        Are you a fighter too?
                             (louder)
                        Are you a mujahideen?

                                 SAMI
                        Take that thing off. I can’t 
                        understand you. 
                             (re: her hesitation)
                        I’m your cousin. It’s not haram. 
                        They can’t see you through the 
                        window.

           She takes off the veil, begrudgingly.

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        What did you say?

                                 LENA
                        I asked if you’re a mujahid like 
                        Mohammed?

                                 SAMI
                        No. I have a limp.

           They turn a corner into a traffic circle around a public 
           square where a MAN is being crucified by a clock-tower. He’s 
           SCREAMING. An OFFICIAL reads the man’s crimes to a literally 
           captive audience. Lena is horrified.

                                 LENA
                        What is he saying?

                                 SAMI
                        That he raped his daughter. 

                                 LENA
                        Oh. In America he’d probably get 
                        away with it.

                                 SAMI
                        I know him, actually. He’s a 
                        graphic designer. The Organization 
                        offered him a job making logos a 
                        month ago and he turned it down. I 
                        guess they’re relieved about that 
                        now, seeing as he’s a pedophile.

           Is he being sarcastic? He notices her staring at him.

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                             (re: niqab)
                        You can put that back on now.
           EXT. RAQQA OLD SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

           Sami and Lena park in front of a concrete compound near a dry 
           soccer field. Lena is happy to see kids playing there. She 
           watches as one of them staggers and falls down, writhing. 

                                 LITTLE BOY
                        Death to infidels!

           The kids cheer. She realizes they’re playing war. 

                                 SAMI
                        Go ahead. Her office is at the end 
                        of the hall. I’ll wait.

           INT. OLD SCHOOL BUILDING - DAY

           Lena enters a long hallway with classrooms on either side. 
           She starts walking, then hears noises through a door that’s 
           ajar. She peeks into -

           INT. OLD SCHOOL BUILDING - COMPUTER CENTER - DAY

           - a faded yellow former classroom full of WOMEN sitting at 
           computers. This is central command for The Organization’s 
           social media recruiting empire. She sees one of the hijabis 
           Skyping with a TEEN speaking English somewhere in the world. 
           She notices an empty seat in front of a computer. She’s about 
           to sit down when a HAND grasps her shoulder.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Umm Ambar. Come with me.

           INT. OLD SCHOOL BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

           Lena follows Umm Layyin down the hall to her office.

                        The computer lab is for our sisters 
                        who have volunteered to spread the 
                        word about the Caliphate to other 
                        young women around the world. Like 
                        I did for you. Is that something 
                        you’re interested in?

                                 LENA
                        Maybe.

           She opens a door, ushering Lena into--
           INT. OLD SCHOOL BUILDING - UMM LAYYIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           -- a former school administrator’s office transformed into 
           Umm Layyin’s den. The Organization’s BLACK FLAG hangs on the 
           wall as well as a poster of a lioness and a Persian rug. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Sit, please! Tell me everything. Is 
                        your husband happy with you?

                                 LENA
                        I think so. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                             (smiling)
                        And are you happy with your 
                        husband?

                                 LENA
                        It’s been fun.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        As you know, a muhajirah’s most 
                        important job is to keep her 
                        muhajid happy and strong for the 
                        fight. But you’re very special to 
                        the Organization. Allah, Bithnillaah, 
                        has given the emirs a vision of a 
                        way you can help the caliphate even 
                        more. Have you heard of Al Khansaa?

                                 LENA
                        No.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        She was the greatest female poet in 
                        history. She lived at the time of 
                        Mohammed, peace be upon him and converted 
                        to Islam just like you. She was 
                        especially admired for her verses 
                        celebrating her brothers and all 
                        four of her sons who fell in battle 
                        in the name of Allah. The 
                        Organization, may Allah protect them, 
                        founded a female brigade in her 
                        honor. These women, the Al Khansaa, 
                        help educate our people and enforce 
                        Allah’s laws within the caliphate. 
                        I’m taking over supervision there 
                        next week.

                        I hope you don’t mind, but I shared 
                        with The Organization your mother’s 
                        struggle with addiction and your 
                        passion for saving others from that 
                        kind of suffering. They thought 
                        this work might be perfect for you, 
                        at least until you start a family.

                                 LENA
                        I want to do whatever I can to help 
                        the state. I have been going a 
                        little stir crazy. I didn’t realize 
                        Mohammed would be gone so much.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        He’s very brave. Always 
                        volunteering for the front lines. 
                        We’ll have to get his blessing, but 
                        I’m sure he’ll see what a great 
                        asset you would be for them. 

           Lena nods, beginning to feel excited.

           INT. RAQQA FORMER CHRISTIAN CHURCH - DAY  

           HEROIC ISLAMIC MUSIC BLASTS as we see a montage of propaganda 
           PHOTOS and VIDEO FOOTAGE of women in black brandishing 
           kalashnikovs, interrogating citizens and pointing their 
           fingers to the sky to honor Allah. 

           We pull back to reveal Lena and a group of young women, many 
           of them foreign, watching the presentation on a screen hung 
           in a vaulted stone Christian church. The walls show signs of 
           violence. The stained glass windows have all been over-hung 
           with The Organization’s flag.  

           During the above, a tall, commanding woman, UMM RASHA, 
           lectures the diverse group of foreign women in English.

                                 UMM RASHA
                        To live as Allah wishes we must 
                        abide by Sharia. A suggestive 
                        abaya, a cigarette, a man’s shaven 
                        face... They may seem like careless 
                        infractions. But they are a cry for 
                        help. They are a sign that this 
                        person’s connection to Allah is 
                        broken. Their Imam is thirsty. 
           INT. RAQQA CHRISTIAN CHURCH - LATER

           In the same room Lena and her fellow recruits run drills, 
           loading, assembling and disassembling their guns as Umm Rasha 
           paces among them. They wear hijabs, their faces uncovered.

                                 UMM RASHA
                        You are Al Khansaa! You are the 
                        gardeners of our caliphate. You 
                        nurture the souls in Allah’s garden 
                        and prepare them for Janna. But to 
                        bloom in its full glory, a rose 
                        must be clipped.

           Lena swiftly reassembles her gun and ends the drill in sniper 
           position, high on the feeling of power the skill gives her. 

           She hears Umm Rasha SLAP a RECRUIT and chide her in Arabic. 

                                 UMM RASHA (CONT’D)
                        You put the clip in backwards, you idiot. Twenty 
                        lashes if you mess it up again. Go!

           During the next drill, Lena feels Umm Rasha’s eyes on her. 

                                 UMM RASHA (CONT’D)
                        Umm Ambar. Your form is very good.
                             (then)
                        Turn to me. Perform your drill.

           Lena does, confused. The other women in the room stare.

                                 UMM RASHA (CONT’D)
                        With conviction!

           Lena performs the drill again, this time staring down Umm 
           Rasha as if she were the enemy. Umm Rasha looks pleased and 
           snaps a PHOTO with her iPHONE.

                                 UMM RASHA (CONT’D)
                        Good.
                             (to the group)
                        Again, reload!

           She snaps another photo.

           MONTAGE: We zoom out and see the photo go viral across social 
           media and private messaging sites: Twitter, Facebook, 
           Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, all originating with an 
           account labeled UMM AMBAR. 
           The posts are accompanied by anti-western slogans. The photos 
           include one from the Al Khansaa training and one of Lena next 
           to Mohammed on their wedding day. “Make your hijrah to Shaam, 
           fisabilillah! Love awaits you!”

           INT. WALMART - DAY

           Jeanne is marking sale items in the home improvement aisle. 
           She funnels all the rage she feels into the SLAP of the sale 
           tag applicator. She checks her CELL PHONE in her uniform 
           pocket. No texts from Lena. No calls. SLAP. SLAP. SLAP.

           Her eyes land on the SPRAY PAINT section.

           EXT. SEPIDEH’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Jeanne parks next to the driveway. She gets out and starts 
           spray painting the beginning of “MUSLIMS” on the garage. 
           Hearing the noise, Roshni comes out.

                                 ROSHNI
                        What are you doing? Stop it! 
                        Nousha, call the police!

                                 JEANNE
                        Go ahead and call them. I want 
                        everyone to know who you are, you 
                        terrorist son of a bitch.

           Roshni tries to take the can away from her. They struggle. 

                                 NOUSHA
                        Roshni! Stop. 

           He does, realizing it will only look bad for him. 

                                 ROSHNI
                        Please! Get off our property. 

                                 JEANNE
                        You brainwashed my granddaughter. 
                        She’s the only thing I had left and 
                        you took her from me!

                                 ROSHNI
                        Mrs. Alder? If this is about her 
                        head scarf, I told her to discuss 
                        that with you. 
                                 JEANNE
                        Don’t give me that bullshit. I see 
                        right through you. You and your 
                        family come here, benefit from 
                        everything the God damn liberals 
                        keep handing out to you, all the 
                        while you’re corrupting our 
                        children and sending them to fight 
                        your dirty holy war.

                                 ROSHNI
                        Please, Mrs. Alder, What are you 
                        talking about? Where is Lena?

           Jeanne stares at him, her anger hardly receding, but 
           realizing he truly doesn’t know.

           INT. SEPIDEH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           Roshni and Jeanne sit at the table, untouched tea in front of 
           them. Jeanne is slightly embarrassed but still angry.

                                 ROSHNI
                        So this man said he could help her?

                                 JEANNE
                        She doesn’t want to be helped. 
                        She’s made her decision.

                                 ROSHNI
                        She could not possibly have known 
                        what she was getting into. 
                             (then)
                        If she calls you, what are you 
                        going to do?

                                 JEANNE
                        She’s not gonna call me. And if she 
                        does it’ll be to rub my face in it. 

                                 ROSHNI
                        Not if she’s in danger.

           The reality of Lena’s situation hits Jeanne. The panic and 
           guilt she’s been suppressing begins to rise.

                                 JEANNE
                        They told me not to go to the 
                        F.B.I, that if I do and she comes 
                        back, she’ll go to prison.
                             (after a beat)
                        She’s not a terrorist.
                                 ROSHNI
                        No, she’s not. From what I’ve read 
                        these people are very good at 
                        hiding the true nature of their 
                        group. They prey on young, lonely 
                        people looking for a purpose.

                                 JEANNE
                        These people. These Muslims.

                                 ROSHNI
                        These people are killing Muslims. 
                        Who do you think most of their 
                        victims are? One point six billion 
                        Muslims in the world and this tiny 
                        group have hijacked our religion. 
                        Do you find your beliefs 
                        represented by the KKK?

           Jeanne sets her jaw. He knows he’s not gonna win her over. 
           Roshni copies something from his phone onto a piece of paper. 

                                 ROSHNI (CONT’D)
                        There’s a group I read about. It’s 
                        for families of children who have 
                        been targeted by extremist groups. 
                        Maybe it would be useful.

           Jeanne takes it warily.

                                 JEANNE
                        Thank you.

                                 ROSHNI
                        If she calls us, I will try to get 
                        information out of her and call 
                        you. I think we should trust this 
                        French agent. Try to help him. It 
                        might be her only way out.

           Jeanne sees Nousha comes out of Sepideh’s room, bringing 
           washcloths from bathing her back to the bathroom. She leaves 
           the door ajar and Jeanne can see Sepideh’s gaunt body.

                                 JEANNE
                        I didn’t know the gravity of the 
                        situation with your daughter. I’m 
                        sorry. 

                                 ROSHNI
                        Thank you. It’s in God’s hands now. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)

                        I know you also understand the 
                        indescribable pain of losing a 
                        child. 

           Jeanne gives a quick nod then finally lets the weight of her 
           guilt wash over her.

                                 JEANNE
                        I shouldn’t have done that to your 
                        garage. I try to be a good 
                        Christian.
                             (a beat)
                        I feel like god is punishing me. I 
                        don’t think I can take it anymore.

                                 ROSHNI
                        I feel the same, sometimes.
                             (a beat)
                        But then I remember Job. 
                             (Re: her look)
                        He’s in both our books. Even when 
                        we feel like we’ve lost everything 
                        and God has forsaken us, if we put 
                        our faith in him, we’ll find the 
                        strength to go on.

           Jeanne is humbled by this, despite herself.

           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Jeanne arrives home to her empty house, Roshni’s words still 
           resonating with her. She makes a decision and dials her cell.

                                 IDRIS (O.S.)
                        Mrs. Alder?

                                 JEANNE
                             (into phone)
                        She left her computer here. There’s 
                        some messages and things on it that 
                        might help you out.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - DAY

           Through Lena’s veil we see the elegant lobby of a former 
           government building. She TRIPS on her long abaya as she makes 
           her way up the several stairs from the entry to the 
           glistening tiled main floor. She heads for a commotion of 
           women’s voices coming from a door off the lobby.  
           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - WOMEN’S ANNEX - CONTINUOUS

           Lena enters the cramped administrative room that serves as 
           the brigade’s main office. She’s surrounded by fellow brigade 
           members, chatting happily.

           In this annex, the women can wear only their hijab. In the 
           lobby they must cover everything but their eyes. In the 
           street they must wear an additional eye veil.

           Umm Layyin calls out assignments. She sees Lena arrive.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Umm Ambar, join Umm Burhan’s group 
                        for the Tel Abyad District today. 
                        They’ll show you how to patrol the 
                        market. Anyone who didn’t pick up 
                        their pay yesterday, see Umm Sayid.

           Lena approaches a tall woman waving her over to her group. 
           This is UMM BURHAN, 24, a commanding German convert. 

                                 UMM BURHAN
                        Asalaam alaikum, Umm Ambar. Umm 
                        Layyin must like you. Tel Abyad 
                        Market is the best assignment.

           Another senior member, UMM FIRAS, 23 Malaysian, chimes in.

                                 UMM FIRAS
                        Everyone offers you samples. 

                                 LENA
                        That’s nice.

           Umm Firas and Umm Burhan crack up.

                                 UMM BURHAN
                        Everyone is very nice to us. You’ll 
                        be with Umm Aalee. She’s speaks 
                        Arabic well and knows the city.

           She refers to NOOR, aka Umm Aalee, 19, Syrian, quiet. Next to 
           her, Lena looks confident.

                                 NOOR
                        Hi.

           Lena smiles, unsure whether she’s drawn the short straw. Umm 
           Burhan hands her a black headband with white Arabic writing. 
           The other women are wearing them around their foreheads.
                                 UMM BURHAN
                        Put this on so they know you’re Al 
                        Khansaa.

           INT. AL KHANSAA VAN - DAY

           Lena and Noor ride in the van with Umm Burhan and Umm Firas, 
           their guns at their sides.

                                 UMM BURHAN
                        Don’t let anyone intimidate you. 
                        You’re a direct enforcer of The 
                        Organization’s laws.

                                 LENA
                        And Allah’s above him, Maa shaa Allah.

                                 UMM BURHAN 
                        Obviously, Alhamdulillah. They have to 
                        do what you say.

           EXT. TEL ABYAD MARKET - DAY

           The grey van with AL KHANSAA written in Arabic on the side 
           stops at the entrance to a busy city-center market. Passerby 
           quicken their pace as the women, fully veiled, disembark.

                                 UMM BURHAN
                        Umm Firas will show you how it’s 
                        done. Then you’ll continue up that 
                        side of the street together, good?

                                 LENA
                        Good.

           Noor just nods. As they follow Umm Firas towards a bakery, 
           Lena notices people crossing the street to avoid them. 

           INT. BAKERY - MOMENTS LATER

           As the three women enter, the BAKER, late 30s, stands up 
           immediately. They speak Arabic.

                                 BAKER
                        Good morning, ladies. Please have some fresh bread.

           Umm Firas accepts the bread, handing it to Noor.

                                 UMM FIRAS
                        Thank you, sir, peace be upon you. Have you had any 
                        troubles to report to The Organization?
                                 BAKER
                        Yes, it’s been hard to get my flour shipment. The truck 
                        was delayed two days.

                                 UMM FIRAS 
                        Well that is expected in a time of war, isn’t it?

                                 BAKER
                        Yes.

           Umm Firas prods Lena.

                                 LENA
                        May we check your kitchen for items that might 
                        tempt one to displease Allah?

           He opens the curtain to the back for them immediately.

                                 BAKER
                        Of course. 

           Lena walks through --

           INT. BAKERY - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           -- into the small kitchen lined with baking ovens. She smells 
           the fresh baking bread and begins to open cabinets, finding 
           nothing extraordinary. Then she hears shouts from the street.

                                 UMM BURHAN (O.C.)
                        Al Khansaa! Assistance please.

           INT. BAKERY - CONTINUOUS

           Lena passes the worried Baker as she follows the girls out 
           onto the street.

                                 LENA
                        Thank you. Allah loves those who rejoice in living as 
                        he wishes.

           EXT. BAKERY - MOMENTS LATER

           She joins Noor who is watching Umm Burhan and Umm Firas pull 
           a STORE OWNER by the arms into the street.

           They throw the man to his knees. Umm Burhan shoves SOMETHING 
           in his face, screaming. She turns to the gathering crowd.
                                 UMM BURHAN
                        This man was hiding wine in his shop. Let his eighty 
                        lashes be a lesson to you. Allah abhors alcohol. It is 
                        the gateway to all evil! And we, Al Khansaa shall 
                        paint Raqqa as Allah’s paradise on Earth, even if the 
                        brush strokes are in blood. 

           Umm Firas WHIPS HIM. He screams, begging for mercy. Noor turn 
           away. Lena does too, but then forces herself to watch, trying 
           desperately to justify what she’s seeing.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - DAY 

           The bathroom at the brigade is a private space where the 
           women often remove their veils. Noor splashes water on her 
           face. Lena exits a stall and washes her hands next to Noor.

                                 LENA
                        Why did you turn away from the man 
                        being punished?

           Noor hesitates, unsure how to answer.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        He was preying on addicts. He’s 
                        ruining their lives just to make 
                        money off them. He deserved to be 
                        punished. 

                                 NOOR
                        Of course. But after twenty lashes, 
                        I don’t think he would have done it 
                        again. I thought twenty was enough.
                             (then)
                        See you upstairs.

           Off Lena, conflicted. 

           INT. SAMI’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Sami drives Lena home from the Brigade. They’re in an area 
           without much foot traffic. It’s hot and stuffy in the car.

                                 LENA
                        Can I open the window a little?

                                 SAMI
                        A little.

           She opens it a few inches. Their awkward silence has become 
           routine so she’s surprised when he strikes up a conversation.
                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        You think your family’s worried 
                        about you?

                                 LENA
                        My grandma’s probably glad I left. 
                        My mom’s dead. That’s it.

                                 SAMI
                        I’m sorry.
                             (then)
                        How did she die?

                                 LENA
                        She overdosed on heroin. But it 
                        wasn’t her fault. She got this back 
                        injury and the doctor gave her 
                        OxyContin which is pretty much 
                        heroin and she got addicted. It’s 
                        all pretty easy to get over there. 
                        Her dad was an alcoholic. That’s the 
                        Land of Kafir. 

           He gives her a strange look and goes back to his silent self.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Zeinah mentioned your father passed 
                        away too.

                                 SAMI
                        Passed away. He was killed. 

                                 LENA
                        By the regime?

                                 SAMI
                        Yes. At the beginning of the 
                        revolution. He used to organize 
                        protests, peaceful protests against 
                        the government. They were killing 
                        thousands of people. Nobody had any 
                        rights. He stood up to them. So 
                        they took him in the middle of the 
                        night and we never saw him again. 
                        He was one of my favorite people.

                                 LENA
                        I’m sorry. Do you think he’d be 
                        glad that the Organization is here 
                        now? That they’re trying to build 
                        something better? 
           She doesn’t ask with conviction. She’s genuinely asking him. 
           His eyes pierce her through the rearview mirror.

                                 SAMI
                             (after a beat)
                        I think there are other people he 
                        would have preferred. 

           Before Lena can ask more, he pulls into an industrial yard 
           off the main street.

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        I have to make a stop.

           INT. SAMI’S CAR/ EXT. INDUSTRIAL YARD - DAY

           The yard is full of trucks and tankers. Sami points to one.

                                 SAMI
                        I drive this tanker North every 
                        month to the oil fields. A friend 
                        is helping me fix the breaks.

           He parks next to a tanker where a grease-covered young man 
           MAALOUF, 21, affable, emerges from beneath the tanker’s cab. 

           Lena watches Sami get out and chat with Maalouf, then hand 
           him a box. He says something that makes Maalouf laugh, then 
           embrace Sami. Lena watches them, realizing how little she 
           knows about Sami and that she wishes she knew more.

           EXT. RAQQA - NIGHT

           The city is dark except for the flicker of candles in 
           apartment windows and mortar fire in the distant hills.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - LIVING/DINING ROOM - EVENING

           Mohammed is back from his battle and the family is having 
           dinner. They speak in Arabic with some English. The 
           electricity is out and the table is lit by candles.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        The second city we liberated, they were so happy to 
                        see us. The regime had been starving them out and 
                        we were handing bread to everyone. There were old 
                        women waving scarves out the windows, smiling.
                                 ZEINAH
                             (under her breath)
                        They won’t be allowed to do that anymore. 

                                 MOHAMMED
                        What was that, Zeinah?

                                 ZEINAH
                        Nothing.

           Little Mahmoud senses the tension. 

                                 MAHMOUD
                        Aunt Ambar, thought I rode a chicken today. I told 
                        her no! I rode my bike. I’m too big to ride a chicken!

           The family chuckles, grateful for the distraction. The words 
           for ‘bike’ and ‘chicken’ in Arabic are practically the same.

                                 LENA
                        But in America everyone rides chickens.

           They laugh a bit more.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Your Arabic is getting better already.
                             (mimicking her accent)
                        I like that American accent.

                        Mahmoud is a very good teacher. Very strict.

                                 MAHMOUD
                        Yes! I tell her, if you don’t get this word right I’ll 
                        crucify you in the square!

                                 ZEINAH
                        Mahmoud. We don’t say things like that.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Why not? He’s old enough to make a joke like a man?

                                 ZEINAH
                        He’s not a man. He’s a little boy.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Enough! It’s by my blessing that you are still living 
                        here, out of respect for my uncle. But I don’t have to 
                        be so nice, remember that.
           Zeinah’s daughter, MAYA 5, stifles a whimper. Zeina takes her 
           hand and squeezes it reassuringly, putting on a smile. 

                                 ZEINAH
                        Is everybody finished?

           She starts to clear the dishes. Lena follows her lead, trying 
           to please, but Mohammed is out of sorts now.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        And who’s been cleaning the 
                        apartment while I’ve been gone? 
                             (to Zeinah)
                        You’ve been picking up her slack, 
                        now my wife thinks she’s so 
                        important?

                                 LENA
                        They told me you gave them your 
                        blessing.

           He grunts.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        I clean when I get home.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Just don’t be the carpenter  who --- 
                        what’s the phrase Sami?

                                 SAMI
                        Don’t be the carpenter who let his 
                        door fall off.

                                 MOHAMMED
                             (to Lena)
                        Right. You’re instructing women on 
                        how to behave under Sharia so don’t 
                        forget those lessons yourself. 

           Lena nods, trying to hide her anger and embarrassment.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Lena and Mohammed have sex. She tries to stroke his hair. He 
           pulls her hand away and pins her so she can’t move. He 
           finishes quickly and loudly, then flops over and stares at 
           the ceiling. They listen to the faint clatter of street noise 
           outside and the distant boom of bombing. He looks sad.

                                 LENA
                        Are you upset about something?
                                 MOHAMMED
                        No. I’m sorry I snapped at you.

                                 LENA
                        I understand. 
                             (then)
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Before I came here, I lived with my 
                        eight brothers and sisters in two 
                        rooms. Even with the bombs, it’s 
                        very quiet here.

                                 LENA
                        I lived in the countryside. I 
                        thought it was too quiet.

           He pulls off the CONDOM and drops it into the trash can.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we shouldn’t use those 
                        anymore.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Why?

                                 LENA
                        I didn’t come here to patrol the 
                        city with a gun or whip people. I  
                        I came to help build the country 
                        with you. We could start a family. 
                        They’d let you be home more. It 
                        would be fun.

           Mohammed stares at her sadly for a moment, like he might 
           divulge a secret, then his look swiftly hardens again. 

                                 MOHAMMED
                        That’s not what they want right 
                        now.

           Off Lena, an unsettling feeling rising in her.

           EXT. RAQQA TOWN SQUARE - DAY          

           Noor and Lena are on patrol. They see a WIFE walking with her 
           HUSBAND. Her eyes are uncovered. Lena and Noor share a look.

                                 NOOR
                        I’ll go.

           Noor approaches them. Lena stands behind her for support.
                                 NOOR (CONT’D)
                        Sister, excuse me, please. I can see your eyes. This is 
                        haram.  Please don’t spit in Allah’s face like this after 
                        all the blessings he’s given you. 

                                 WIFE 
                        Oh. I’m sorry sister. My veil ripped.

                                 NOOR
                        I understand. But please go home and change or I’ll 
                        have to fine you twenty dollars.

                                 HUSBAND
                        We have one more stop to make, then we’ll go home. 
                        She’s my wife, I’ll allow her to dress as I see fit. 

                                 LENA
                        Sir, it’s unfair to other men to tempt them by allowing 
                        them to see your wife’s eyes. It pushes their souls 
                        away from Allah. We’re trying to build a pure society 
                        here for your children..

           He gets in her face, or rather her veil.

                                 HUSBAND
                        You don’t care about my children. Don’t ever speak to 
                        me about my children.

                                 LENA
                        Please stop or I’ll report you to The Organization.

                                 WIFE
                        Sisters, our son just died in a bombing. We’re 
                        mourning him. My husband is not thinking correctly. 
                        We’ll go home right now. 

                                 HUSBAND
                             (to Lena)
                        Are you an American? Are you a fucking American? 
                        It’s not enough for you to bomb innocent children from 
                        the sky while you pretend to make the world safer. 
                        Now you have to join the murderers who have taken 
                        over our city? To hold innocent Muslims at gunpoint? 

           He’s screaming in her face. People are staring.

                                 LENA
                        Don’t scream at me or I’ll shoot.
           She points her gun at the HUSBAND like she practiced in her 
           drills. He takes no notice.

                                 HUSBAND
                        I spit on you! I spit on your 
                        country. You and The Organization 
                        are working together to destroy us. 
                        You have taken our city from us. 
                        You have taken our religion from 
                        us. How can we bear it? Where is Allah!? 

           He lunges for the gun. She instinctively flips it in defense, 
           RAMMING the buttstock against him. 

           The man falls to the ground, spitting blood. She hit him 
           HARD. His wife SCREAMS. Lena is horrified. She backs away, 
           his words reverberate in her conscience.

           EXT. RAQQA STREET - LATER 

           Lena is shaking as she and Noor walk back to the market. They 
           pass an INTERNET CAFE. Lena realizes what it is. She feels a 
           pang of desperation.

                                 LENA
                        Can we stop here?

                                 NOOR
                        I don’t think we should.

           Lena ignores her and enters. Noor follows, nervously.

           INT. INTERNET CAFE - CONTINUOUS

           The place is almost deserted. Organization guards stand in 
           every corner. Lena approaches the OWNER at the counter.

                                 LENA
                        How much for five minutes to send one email?

                                 OWNER
                        The cafe is for official Organization business, ma’am.

                                 LENA
                        I’m a member of Al Khansaa. 
                             (to Noor)
                        Will you tell him I just want to 
                        email my grandmother?
                                 SOLDIER
                             (British accent)
                        No ladies allowed here. No personal 
                        emails. Get back with your team. 

           Lena and Noor hurry out.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - WOMEN’S ANNEX - LATER

           Lena is gathering her belongings to go home when Umm Layyin 
           approaches her.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Can I speak with you a moment?

           She ushers her into her new office, which adjoins the annex. 

           INT. UMM LAYYIN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Umm Layyin keeps her smile wide but Lena senses the slight 
           menace in her voice.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        As you know, part of building the 
                        caliphate is purifying the souls of 
                        its citizens. Unfortunately, there 
                        are traitors among us. They use 
                        Satan’s creation, the Internet, to 
                        send falsified photos and lies to 
                        the foreign press to turn the world 
                        against us. That means more bombs, 
                        more children die. This is why we 
                        do not allow foreign correspondence 
                        anymore in the Internet cafes.

                                 LENA
                        I didn’t know. I’m sorry. 

           A chill washes over her. Umm Layyin has eyes everywhere. To 
           Lena’s surprise, Umm Layyin opens a drawer and pulls out a  
           cell phone. It has a white cover with an orange kitten on it. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        But Paradise lies at the feet of 
                        mothers. And grandmothers. You 
                        should have a chance to say goodbye 
                        so you wont be tempted to use 
                        unholy means in the future. See if 
                        she’ll give you her blessing.

                                 LENA
                        OK. Thank you.
                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Dial zero zero one, then the area 
                        code and the number. 

           Lena realizes there is no way to make the call unmonitored. 
           She dials.

           INT. WALMART - CEREAL AISLE - LATE NIGHT

           Jeanne re-stocks in the deserted cereal aisle. She feels her 
           phone vibrating in her pocket. It’s an INTERNATIONAL number. 
           She answers, her hands shaking.

                        I miss you too, sweetheart. Please 
                        tell me where you are.

                        I didn’t tell you I was going.

                                 JEANNE
                        I understand.

                        Who’s the lucky man? What’s his 
                        name exactly?

           Jeanne scrambles for paper and a pen to write things down.
                                 LENA
                        Mohammed Alomari. He has a YouTube 
                        Channel called The Truth if you want 
                        to see him. We live in Raqqa. I 
                        work a patrol near a place called 
                        Tel Abyad Market. It’s very pretty. 

           Lena feels Umm Layyin’s eyes on her.

                        love you and to ask for your 
                        blessing. 

                                 JEANNE
                        I don’t know who made you do this 
                        but I want you to know that you are 
                        welcome home anytime. I’m sorry I 
                        made you feel like that wasn’t the 
                        case. There’s a man--

           -- CLICK. The call CUTS OUT. Lena stares at the phone, her 
           mind racing with all the things she wanted to say. She hands 
           it back to Umm Layyin, trying to hide her emotions.

                                 LENA
                        The signal cut out.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Sometimes that happens. A miracle 
                        you were able to reach her at all. 
                        Praise be to Allah. I’m glad you were able 
                        to say goodbye.

           Lena shoots her a quick smile.

           INT. WALMART - BACK STORAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeanne bursts through the rubber doors, phone to her ear.

                                 JEANNE
                        She told me where she works.

                                 IDRIS (O.S.)
                        See? I told you she’d call. Send me 
                        what you know. I’ll head out for 
                        the border in the morning.

           Off Jeanne feeling a glimmer of hope.
           EXT. NORTHERN IRAQI KURDISTAN - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           A 1981 Chevy Malibu drives a dirt road cutting through an 
           impressionist’s canvas of green and grey shrubs dotted with 
           bright orange trees. The low-lying landscape laps at a 
           looming ridge of low mountains. When the Malibu enters the 
           peaks’ shadows, it stops.                                                                                                                                               

           INT. MALIBU - CONTINUOUS

           The driver meets Idris’ gaze through the rear view mirror.  

                                 DRIVER
                        You sure you don’t want me to drive you further 
                        South? It’s a longer route but this part of the range is 
                        full of PKK soldiers. 

           Idris hands him a fistful of dinar as he gets out.

           EXT. IRAQI KURDISTAN - MOUNTAIN PASS - LATER

           Covered in dirt and nettles, Idris makes his way over the 
           remnants of a recent rock slide. Ahead, beyond the mountain, 
           the cry of river birds. Idris quickens his pace towards them.

           EXT. IRAQI KURDISTAN - TIGRIS RIVER DELTA - CONTINUOUS

           Idris emerges from the pass, looking out on the rocky river 
           basin of the placid Tigris. This is the border between Iraq 
           and Syria and more specifically Iraqi Kurdistan and Rojava, 
           the Kurdish controlled area of Northern Syria.

           He hears something. He surveys the low tree line. Then he 
           sees it: an electrical wire, its synthetic transgression 
           barely noticeable, but now clearly connecting two huts.

           He stiffens. Then WHIPS around, pulling his gun, only to find 
           himself face to face with a semi-circle of SOLDIERS, both men 
           and women, AK-47s drawn. 

           He locks eyes with a fierce FEMALE SOLDIER, early 30s, her 
           thick brown hair clenched into a long braid. After a tense 
           moment suddenly she lowers her weapon.

                                 FEMALE SOLDIER
                        You should have called first, I 
                        would have baked a pie.

           They smile and he and the woman, ARA, embrace. The others 
           lower their weapons, confused.
           INT. PKK MOUNTAIN OPERATING BASE - LATER

           Idris, Ara and several other PKK soldiers including GAZIN, 
           20s friendly, his expressive eyebrows constantly rising in 
           jest and LOLAN, 30s, mustached and quiet, share a dinner of 
           grape leaves, pickles, and thick flatbread.

           The hut is encircled in woven palm fronds. Sleeping bags lie 
           nearby on the red rubber mat of a floor. Through the door, 
           Idris can see an ALL FEMALE BATTALION running drills. 

                                 ARA
                        It’s more difficult than the last 
                        time you crossed. The border patrol 
                        used to just turn us back, now they 
                        shoot to kill. We learned that the 
                        hard way. Gazan will cross with us. 
                        He has a granny across the border 
                        who needs a visit.

                                 IDRIS
                        Loyal grandson.

                                 GAZIN
                        Very loyal. Granny’s an arms 
                        dealer. Wouldn’t want to cross her.

                                 IDRIS
                        You sneak across the border to help 
                        the Americans fight terror, then 
                        smuggle their weapons back so you 
                        can create terror of your own.

                                 ARA
                        God helps those who help 
                        themselves. Americans have a funny 
                        view of who deserves justice.  We 
                        want our own state. That’s all.

                                 IDRIS
                        I saw my father in Istanbul. He 
                        said maybe when I’m done protecting 
                        the French, I’ll come back and 
                        protect them. 

           An awkward pause, but Ara smiles it off with grace.

                                 ARA
                        Too bad for me. You already know 
                        all my hide outs. Till then, my 
                        enemy’s enemy is my friend.

           They eat, listening to the female fighters outside. We see 
           them running drills through the wide stitching of the hut.
                                 ARA (CONT’D)
                        Maryam, my youngest sister joined 
                        this year. My mother is always 
                        going on about how having five 
                        girls to marry off is such a 
                        headache. I told her, ‘Don’t worry. 
                        Funerals are cheaper’.   

           She chuckles. Idris watches one of the young women, her face 
           filled with passion for her cause. He wonders how many more 
           young people are going to die before this is over.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - EVENING

           Lena comes home from the brigade, stripping off her veil, her 
           hijab, her abaya. It’s like she’s trying to shed the horrors 
           of the day, but the weight lingers. 

           Suddenly she hears a THUMP and muffled WHIMPERING from the 
           bedroom. Moments later, Mohammed appears, barely looking at 
           her, and disappears into the bathroom.

                                 LENA
                        I didn’t know you were back. I’ll 
                        start dinner.

           He reappears.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Don’t bother. I don’t like how you 
                        cook. I bought us a servant. Show 
                        her what you want and she’ll do it. 
                        I’ll be back later. She’s to stay 
                        in the closet if anyone else is 
                        around.

           He refers to the hallway closet where a blanket has been 
           thrown inside. Lena can’t believe what she just heard. She 
           makes her way cautiously to the bedroom.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Huddled in the corner is a WOMAN, early 20s, her sandy brown 
           hair a mess and her dress ripped. She sobs.

           Lena goes to her and realizes there are scratches where she’s 
           bleeding on her face and back. She leads her into the 
           bathroom --

           -- and washes the still shaking Woman’s face, pulling out a 
           small FIRST AID KIT to apply ointment and a bandage. The 
           Woman keeps repeating something over and over in KURDISH. Her 
           BRIGHT GREEN EYES appealing to Lena.

                                 LENA
                        I don’t understand. I’m sorry. I’m 
                        sorry. I’m sorry for all this.

           INT. SAMI’S CAR - THE NEXT MORNING

           Sami notices Lena’s sullen, red eyes. 

                                 SAMI
                        Why so glum, fashion police? Oil 
                        embargoes got you down?

                        Who?

                                 LENA
                        Mohammed. He raped her.

                                 SAMI
                        Ah. You seem surprised. 

           Lena tries to contain her anger.

                                 LENA
                        You’re not surprised?

                                 SAMI
                        They’re Yazidis, a religious 
                        minority from Sinjar. They captured 
                        thousands of them. They sell them 
                        right out of your building.

                                 LENA
                        I’ve never seen them do that.

                                 SAMI
                        Well, we see what we want to see. 
           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - MORNING

           As Lena walks towards the annex, she notices for the first 
           time, a hallway leading to another large room. She walks 
           towards it. Through the open door she can see a group of 
           uncloaked WOMEN ages 7-35, chained together. A YOUNG FIGHTER, 
           23, walks the line, surveying his choices like a sadistic 
           version of The Bachelor. The terrified women blink under the 
           florescent lights as if they’ve been kept in darkness.

           EXT. TEL ABYAD MARKET - DAY

           Lena and Noor walk their patrol in silence. Shopkeepers and 
           patrons begin to stream onto the street. They lay down rugs 
           and kneel. It’s Zuhr, the noon prayer. It would be beautiful 
           if everyone weren’t terrified. 

           Two Organization OFFICERS in crisp black uniforms push the 
           Baker out of his shop in front of the them.

                                 OFFICER
                             (Dutch accent)
                        He was hiding by the oven. 
                             (to the Baker)
                        May Allah forgive you. Get on your knees and pray.

           He pushes the Baker down onto the prayer position.

                                 BAKER
                        Please! I need to sell all my bread to afford your 
                        taxes. It will burn if I leave the shop now. I’ll have to 
                        close and you won’t get any money. 

                                 OFFICER
                        This isn’t about money. This is about Allah.

                                 LENA
                        Officer, please have mercy on him. He’s trying 
                        to be pious. Allah does not like 
                        the one who wastes food.

           The Officer SMACKS her across the face with his GUN. The 
           force knocks her to the ground. Noor does not help her. 

                                 OFFICER
                        How dare you tell me what Allah 
                        does and does not like, you whore. 
                        You’re American so you think you 
                        have the right to speak to me? I 
                        should kill you!
                                 BAKER
                        The bread is done. Please let me get it.

           The Officer is distracted from Lena as the Baker attempts to 
           get up. The Officer pushes him down again, then SHOOTS him in 
           the head. Blood spatters onto prayer rugs. People scream. 

           Lena’s head is spinning. She looks to Noor for help. For a 
           split second, she catches a glimpse of a phone in Noor’s 
           sleeve. She’s filming. Then it’s gone and Noor is helping her 
           up so they can get away.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - UMM LAYYIN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Lena, her face still bloody, sits sheepishly across from Umm 
           Layyin, who studies her.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        That was a stupid thing to do. The 
                        reputation of our group rests on 
                        your shoulders. You never raise 
                        your voice to a brother. You wait 
                        to be spoken to.

                                 LENA
                        Even when he’s acting against 
                        Allah?

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        I would be very careful, ukhti. 
                        Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, has 
                        blessed you with a privileged life 
                        here. But Allah, loves obedience. 
                        It would be a shame to see him take 
                        all this away from you.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - LATER

           Noor is with Lena as she washes the blood off her face. The 
           bathroom is empty except for the two of them, but Lena still 
           gestures for Noor to bend her head down to the running water.  
           The sound covers their whispers.

                                 LENA
                        I saw you filming.

                                 NOOR
                        What are you talking about?
                                 LENA
                        I saw you. They’ll kill you for 
                        that. What were you thinking?

                                 NOOR
                             (after a beat)
                        People need to know what’s really 
                        going on here.

           Lena realizes Noor is terrified, unsure which side she’s on.

                                 LENA
                        You’re braver than me.

           INT. SAMI’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Sami drives Lena home. Lena stares out at the broken city, 
           finally seeing it for the bloody police state that it is. Her 
           face is throbbing with pain. The car seems to be closing in 
           on her. She tries to cover her panic attack but Sami notices 
           and suddenly swerves onto a different street. 

                                 LENA
                        Where are you going?

                                 SAMI
                        I want to show you something. 

           They turn onto a highway along the sparkling Euphrates, 
           peaceful despite it all, and pull up along a stretch of dead 
           grass and trees. Benches stick up like tombstones alongside 
           the remains of a playground. The place is deserted. 

           EXT. BRIDGE PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Sami and Lena sit on the riverbank on the scorched grass, 
           hidden by what might have been part of an upturned dock. 
           Lena’s face is unveiled. She’s still trying to recover.

                                 SAMI
                        Our whole family used to come here 
                        in the summer for picnics. We’d 
                        play frisbee down there. One time 
                        my dad threw the frisbee so hard a 
                        guy in a fishing boat caught it and 
                        threw it back. 

                                 LENA
                        That’s amazing.
                                 SAMI
                        That my dad was so bad at frisbee? 
                        Yes it was.  

           She laughs despite herself.

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        And that bench was where he got 
                        arrested for the first time. He 
                        organized this huge protest. 
                        Thousands of people shouting 
                        ‘Freedom! Dignity! Justice!’
                             (after a beat)
                        So many people fought so hard for 
                        our city, and now this.

           She fights back her emotions.

                                 LENA
                        I didn’t come to ruin your city. 
                        I’m sorry. I just want to go home.

                                 SAMI
                        Things were bad where you were so 
                        you came here. Now things are bad 
                        here so you want to go home. I 
                        thought you wanted to fight for 
                        something.

                                 LENA
                        How can I fight for anything? I’m a 
                        prisoner!

                                 SAMI
                        Hardly. There are people a lot 
                        worse off than you doing a lot 
                        more.

           She nods, ashamed. He looks at her for a long time. Then...

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        There’s a resistance group, people 
                        working against the regime and to 
                        get information and people out.

                                 LENA
                        I think my partner at the brigade 
                        is part of it.

                                 SAMI
                        If you think that, then tell her to 
                        be more careful or she’ll end up 
                        hanging off a bridge. 
                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        I work with them. And I think I can 
                        get them to help smuggle you to the 
                        border. The Organization uses 
                        photos of you for propaganda. 
                        You’re like American candy, leading 
                        the lambs to slaughter. If we can 
                        get you out and you speak out 
                        against this place, all the better.

                                 LENA
                        I will. I promise. 

                                 SAMI
                        But maybe you can help us first.

                                 LENA
                        OK.

                                 SAMI
                        If you tell anyone any of this, 
                        we’re all dead. You have to act as 
                        devout as the day you got here. 
                             (she nods)
                        The Yazidi women in your building, 
                        their families are organizing. We 
                        made contact with them the last 
                        time I went North. Keep your eyes 
                        open. Don’t arouse suspicion, but 
                        see if you can figure out who has 
                        the keys to where they’re being 
                        kept. If you can do that, we might 
                        be able to get them out, God willing.

                                 LENA
                        Thank you. 

                                 SAMI
                        The odds are not very good for 
                        this. I understand if you are 
                        soured on religion, but we’re 
                        probably going to have to pray. 

           They share a smile. If only they’d known each other in 
           another time and place.  

           PRE-LAP: A choir sings the hymn, “There Is a Fountain Filled 
           With Blood”
           INT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - ALABAMA - DAY

           Jeanne sits in her regular seat listening to the choir. 
           Usually she finds solace here, but as she looks around at the 
           raptured or self-righteous faces, she realizes no one here 
           could possibly understand what she’s going through.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME - BIRMINGHAM - LATER

           Jeanne sits uncomfortably with three mothers, ASQA, Pakistani 
           American, still in her business suit. NANCY, Caucasian, 
           nervous, wearing sweats, and TYRA, African American, wearing 
           a hijab, a warm grace about her. This is her home. TWO MORE 
           MOTHERS, one Dutch, one Indian Skype in. This is a support 
           group for women who have lost children to The Organization.

           Jeanne eyes a wall scroll with Arabic writing on it over the 
           fireplace. A spread of hummus and dates sits untouched.

                                 NANCY
                        I guess it started after my husband 
                        died. Bobby was ten. All he wanted 
                        to do was play on the computer. He 
                        stopped hanging out with his 
                        friends, wouldn’t talk to me. I 
                        tried everything... therapy, 
                        changing schools, discipline, no 
                        discipline, cutting carbs.

           The women murmur a laugh.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Last year when he told me he 
                        discovered the Quran I thought, 
                        it’s a miracle! He started to act 
                        different. Kinder to me and his 
                        brother. He seemed happy. 

           The other mothers nod, knowingly.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to encourage him so I 
                        started reading about Islam. I 
                        thought it was very beautiful. I 
                        even arranged for us to go to a 
                        mosque together. But when we went, 
                        he said he didn’t like the way they 
                        practiced. That it was blasphemous. 
                        Some of the things he said were 
                        very dark. I should have known 
                        something else was going on but I 
                        was afraid to challenge him on it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I was scared he’d shut me out 
                        again. Then one day he was gone.
                             (after a pause)
                        He called me a few times and I 
                        begged him to come back. But I 
                        don’t think it was really him 
                        anymore. He died outside... 
                        ‘Aleppo?’... two months ago. I got 
                        a text from someone of a photo of 
                        his body. They told me they were 
                        taking his phone.

           Tyra, the de-facto leader, looks on encouragingly. Jeanne 
           stares at her hands.

                                 TYRA
                        Thank you for sharing, Nancy.

                                 NANCY
                        One more thing. It’s funny. I 
                        started going back to that mosque. 
                        The people were so nice and I 
                        needed something after he was gone. 
                        What they talk about at the 
                        services, I feel like I see what 
                        the son I knew was drawn to about 
                        Islam. I wish that had been enough 
                        to heal whatever pain drove him to 
                        do this.

           Off Jeanne, overwhelmed by compassion and guilt.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lena lies in bed alone, staring into the darkness, thinking. 
           Suddenly she hears the sound of the door and jagged sobs. 

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Lena comes out to find Mohammed, covered in blood, sobbing 
           angrily as he tries to treat his wounds in the bathroom. The 
           Yazidi Woman looks on from her makeshift bed in the closet.

                                 LENA
                        Mohammed.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Get out!
           INT. RAQQA - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lena gathers bandages, ointment and scissors from a box.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lena returns, determined. Mohammed gives in as she gently 
           removes his bloody jacket and treats his wounded arm.

                                 LENA
                        Why didn’t you go to the hospital?

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Too many people. They were overwhelmed.

           Lena wraps the wound like she saw Azizah do in the maqqar.

                                 MOHAMMED (CONT’D)
                        Hamid died right next to me. There 
                        weren’t enough doctors.

                                 LENA
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        We’re fighting for Allah.  When is it enough? 
                        Allah, have mercy on us.

           She gives him water. He seems so vulnerable.

                                 LENA
                        Mohammed, I believe in the 
                        Caliphate, but do you ever wonder 
                        if the Organization is the one who 
                        should lead it?

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Who else is going to lead it, you?

                                 LENA
                        They’re corrupt. They’re murdering 
                        people. There has to be another 
                        way.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Which way? The regime’s way? Gas 
                        innocent children? Or the “peaceful 
                        protesters” who stand around like 
                        sheep to be slaughtered? Which way 
                        are you talking about?
                                 LENA
                        I don’t know. I was just asking.

           His wound has bled through the bandage. She reaches out to 
           change it but he SMACKS her away. 

                                 MOHAMMED
                        You should shut up about things you 
                        don’t know about. 

                                 LENA
                        You haven’t seen what they--

           He SHOVES her out the bathroom and throws her on the floor. 

                                 MOHAMMED
                        I told you to SHUT UP! You need to learn 
                        to submit to your husband! 

           He kicks her, then kicks her again.

                                 LENA
                        Stop it! 

                                 MOHAMMED
                        You think you’re so righteous. 
                        You’re nothing! I’m fighting to protect the 
                        caliphate. You’re a worthless slut. 

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Mohammed is gone. Lena lies on the bed as the Yazidi Woman  
           treats her wounds. 

                                 LENA
                        Thank you.

           The woman gives her an unsmiling nod. Lena puts her hand on 
           her chest then gestures to the woman.

                        I’m Lena. What’s your name?

                                 YAZIDI WOMAN
                        Hadiya.

           They hear the door SLAM, followed by the sound of CHILDREN. 
           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - LIVING/DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Hadiya comes out to investigate and finds Sami and a group of 
           CHILDREN playing in the living room. One of them SCREAMS 
           playfully, jumping off the couch.

                                 SAMI
                             (in Kurdish)
                        Sorry to bother you. I’m a friend.

           Her face lights up, realizing he speaks some Kurdish. Before 
           she can respond, Sami is drawn into a tickle fight and 
           succumbs to the attacker. Lena limps out behind Hadiya.

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        Joram, Neema, Aaliya, say hello to Umm Ambar and 
                        her friend. 

                                 JORAM, NEEMA AND AALIYA
                        Hello.

                        Hello.

           The children continue their tickle-tag, jumping out at each 
           other from around the drapes.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Are these friends of Mahmoud?

                                 SAMI
                        They’re orphans. They live in an 
                        abandoned building, South of here. 
                        I liked that you had a job because 
                        I’d bring them here to wash and 
                        eat. I try to keep them away from 
                        the Organization recruiters.

           Hadiya interjects with a STREAM OF KURDISH. Sami’s ANSWER 
           seems to overwhelm her with emotions. 

                                 LENA
                        What did she say?

                                 SAMI
                        She has a daughter who was also 
                        taken. She’s hoping she’s still at 
                        the brigade. I told her we’re going 
                        to try to get her out. She’ll be 
                        able to show us where they are.

                                 SAMI
                        There’s an Organization rally in 
                        three days. Mohammed will attend 
                        and there should be less security. 
                        I’ll bring you there in the tanker, 
                        as if I’m heading to the oil 
                        fields. If we can make it inside 
                        the brigade, we’ll load them all 
                        into the tanker, God willing, then 
                        drive North. I have friends at the 
                        checkpoints.

                        What about me? I’ll come back. This 
                        is my city.

                        thought it would be full of people 
                        like you.

                                 SAMI
                        There are many people here better 
                        than me. And with Allah’s blessing, we’ll 
                        continue to fight.

           INT. BIRMINGHAM MOSQUE - ENTRYWAY - DAY

           Jeanne steps inside the mosque’s women’s entrance just before 
           Friday Prayer. Dozens of WOMEN are slipping their shoes into 
           cubbies. She’s wary. They smile at her warmly. 

                                 A WOMAN
                        Did you come to visit? The prayer 
                        room is right up here.

           Jeanne follows her up the stairs.

           INT. BIRMINGHAM MOSQUE - PRAYER ROOM - LATER

           The woman hands Jeanne a scarf from a basket, which she puts 
           on, wanting to be polite. She sits in a chair at the back of 
           the room. The women settle themselves in rows on the floor to 
           pray and watch the Imam’s Friday sermon on the TV and through 
           the vast window into the main room below.
                                 IMAM
                        How beautiful that Allah is waiting 
                        to forgive you for every sin you 
                        have committed, even the ones for 
                        which you cannot forgive yourself. 
                        Our first step is to admit our 
                        faults to Allah. To weep with him. 
                        To ask him for absolution. After 
                        this, you will find you are able to 
                        grant yourself grace. 

           This resonates for Jeanne, despite herself.

           EXT. TIGRIS RIVER - NIGHT

           The moonless night is calm over the fast moving but glass-
           flat river. The cacophony of crickets camouflage the sound of 
           Lolan wrenching an inflated rubber raft from the underbrush. 

           At the water’s edge, Idris, Ara and Gazin pile into the boat. 
           Lolan silently launches them into the water, then boards. 
           They dig in with their paddles. The flow of the Tigris is 
           forceful and they move swiftly downstream. Idris can just 
           make out the distant bank when they hear SHOUTS in FARSI.

           They paddle faster, keeping their heads low. A moment later a 
           SEARCH LIGHT illuminates the side of the boat. They DUCK as a 
           RALLY OF GUNFIRE explodes the water around them and PUNCTURES 
           the side of the boat. It HISSES and begins to DEFLATE. 

                                 LOLAN
                        Keep paddling!

           Using the deflating raft as a shield, Gazin and Ara return 
           fire, blinded by the searchlight. Idris and Lolan paddle fast 
           behind them. They make headway, but the boat is sinking. 

           Gazin is HIT in the shoulder and topples into the water with 
           a cry. He’s pulled downstream. Idris dives in after him. 

           INT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Illuminated by the ripples of the searchlight, Idris makes 
           out Gazin’s body as it surges downstream. He struggles 
           towards him, wrenching him skyward moments before he hits a 
           rock. Idris uses the boulder to send them towards shore.
           EXT. TIGRIS RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           They burst from the water, Idris dragging Gazin against the 
           current. Just as he’s tiring, Ara appears on shore, looping 
           an arm around Gazin. 

           Lolan is still on their boat, firing at the patrol, 
           distracting them. Then his body topples backwards into the 
           water. Moments later, the now silent patrol boat floats by.

           INT. AL- KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - MORNING

           Lena walks towards the Annex for work, trying to do 
           reconnaissance without arousing suspicion. She sees a STOCKY 
           GUARD enter the lobby from the hall leading from where she 
           saw the Yazidi Women sold. He is followed by a fighter 
           holding onto a WOMAN in a niqab.  

           The Stocky Guard goes into an office off the lobby. Lena 
           moves so she can see in. She sees the Stocky Guard get out 
           DOCUMENTS and open a cabinet full of KEYS. 

                                 UMM FIRAS
                        What are you looking at?

           Lena realizes she’s been standing suspiciously still in the 
           center of the Lobby. But before she has to answer they hear 
           SCREAMS coming from the Annex.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - WOMEN’S ANNEX - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena and the other brigade members rush in to find Noor 
           letting out a whimper as Umm Burhan wrenches her arms behind 
           her. Umm Layyin stands above her, holding Noor’s cell phone.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Allah will curse your lie with seventy thousand 
                        angels. Who were you taping for?

                                 NOOR
                        No one. It’s just a hobby.

           Umm Layyin slaps her and she cries out.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Liar!

           Umm Layyin narrows her eyes as she sees Lena.
                                 UMM LAYYIN (CONT’D)
                        Umm Ambar. Your partner’s been 
                        caught with contraband. Have you 
                        seen her filming on patrols with 
                        you? 

                                 LENA
                        No. I would have reported her.

                                 UMM BURHAN
                        All the text messages are deleted. 
                        She couldn’t be more suspicious. 

           Umm Layyin takes the whip down from where it hangs on the 
           wall. It’s long with two leather lashes. She turns to Lena.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        It seems that Noor has decided to 
                        spit in the face of all Allah’s 
                        Earthly blessings. But perhaps you 
                        can save her from the fiery pits of 
                        Jahannam. Twenty lashes for the 
                        cell phone, thirty for the lie. 
                             (to Noor)
                        And that’s before I turn you in to 
                        The Organization.

           Lena stares at the whip being thrust at her. How could she 
           possibly do this. Noor stares at her in defiance, then closes 
           her eyes in prayer, at peace.

                                 NOOR
                        Do it. Allah, Thank-you for everything you have 
                        given me. I love you and I always will. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                             (to Lena)
                        Do you want to join her? BEGIN!

           Shaking, Lena brings the whip DOWN on Noor’s back. Noor 
           SCREAMS. Lena fights back tears. Umm Layyin glares at her. 
           She brings the whip down AGAIN and AGAIN. Some of the women 
           smirk, others lower their eyes. 

                                 UMM LAYYIN (CONT’D)
                        Harder! You must BEAT Shaitan out 
                        of her.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Lena’s hand shakes as she chops an onion, preparing a small 
           dinner with Zeinah and Fatima. 
           Mohammed plays with Mahmoud in the living room. Lena stops 
           and closes her eyes, trying to erase what happened at the 
           brigade from her mind.

                                 ZEINAH
                        Are you alright?

                                 LENA
                        Yeah. Sorry. Just the onion.

           She wills herself to keep chopping. Zeinah and Fatima speak 
           in hushed tones. Lena tries to make out what they’re saying. 

                                 FATIMA
                        He was supposed to be here an hour ago.

                                 ZEINAH
                        You know Sami, he takes his time. He’s careful.

                                 FATIMA
                        What if someone stopped him?

                                 ZEINAH
                        You have to go to three stores before you can find 
                        things these days. He’s just late.

           Then they hear the door. It’s Sami. They stare at him in 
           shock. His beard is completely gone.

                                 ZEINAH (CONT’D)
                        No... 

                                 SAMI
                        Zeinah.

                                 LENA
                        What’s happening?

                                 ZEINAH
                        He’s going to be a suicide bomber.

           The world seems to stop. But Mohammed is coming over and Lena 
           knows she has to hide her emotions.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        Woah, cousin, congratulations! Praise 
                        be to Allah, this is an incredible day. 

                                 FATIMA
                        You can’t do this. Not to my son. 
                                 SAMI
                        Mama, you’re going crazy. I volunteered, remember? 
                        It’s an honor to give my life for Allah.

           Lena and Zeinah bring the tea. Lena searching Sami’s face for 
           some sort of sign that everything will be OK, but he merely 
           shoots her an empty brief smile.

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        You’ll get money every month. I’m worth way more 
                        dead to you. Please don’t cry, mama.

                                 MOHAMMED
                             (harshly)
                        Stop it, auntie. Or Allah will take offense.

           It’s a threat and Fatima knows it.

                                 MAHMOUD
                        What’s going on?

                                 MOHAMMED
                        It’s a great day! 

           He chases Mahmoud into the living room, picking him up and 
           tickling him. The family has a moments to speak freely.

                                 ZEINAH
                        I never understood why you agreed 
                        to work with them. With your bum 
                        leg, what did you think they’d ask 
                        you to do?

                                 SAMI
                        They didn’t give me a choice. Plus 
                        the borders were open then. I 
                        thought the money would be useful 
                        for you if you were able to leave.

                                 FATIMA
                        Speak Arabic!

                                 SAMI
                        Mama, I promise you. Everything will be alright.

           Mohammed is coming back and Sami again puts on a smile.

                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                             (playfully)
                        And after all seventy virgins is a lot.
                                 ZEINAH
                        Sami.

           Mohammed laughs and slaps him on the back.

                                 SAMI
                        What? I’ll be able to fly in paradise, so my leg won’t 
                        be an issue. No virgin will be neglected.

                                 ZEINAH
                        When do you get to leave?

                                 SAMI
                        Tomorrow morning.

           Lena draws her strength from Zeinah, keeping her smile. 
           Everything has fallen apart.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lena lies awake in bed, her mind racing. Mohammed snores 
           beside her. Suddenly she hears a rustling in the kitchen.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena comes out to find Sami doing something in the kitchen. 

                                 LENA
                        Sami.

                                 SAMI
                        Shhhh.

                                 LENA
                        Why are you doing this? What about 
                        Hadiya and the other women?

                                 MOHAMMED (O.C.)
                        Lena?

                                 LENA
                        I’m getting water. Would you like water?

           Sami gives her a sad, tender look.

                                 SAMI
                        May Allah fulfil the purpose of your journey.  

           Sami taps the flour tin.
                                 SAMI (CONT’D)
                        Don’t forget the flour in your 
                        ataiyef tomorrow.

           He leaves. Lena listens. Mohammed seems to have gone back to 
           sleep. She grabs the flour tin. Inside are Sami’s CELL PHONE 
           and the KEYS to the tanker. She quickly dials the cell. It 
           attempts to connect... But the call fails. She tries again. 
           FAIL. No reception. 

           Lena hears the bedroom door and is able to hide the phone 
           just in time to round the corner and offer Mohammed a glass 
           of water. He pushes it away and disappears into the bathroom. 

           Hadiya shoots Lena a concerned look from her closet. Lena 
           can’t bring herself to meet her gaze.

           EXT. TEL ABYAD MARKET - DAY

           Lena and her new partner, Umm Burhan, are on patrol. Lena 
           walks like a zombie, passing by the first store.

                                 UMM BURHAN
                        Umm Ambar! What’s wrong with you? 
                        Pay attention. 

                                 LENA
                        Sorry.

           They turn into the bakery.

           INT. BAKERY - CONTINUOUS

           Umm Burhan checks the shelves as Lena approaches the BAKER’S 
           SON, early 20s, who now runs the bakery.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        May I check your kitchen for items that might tempt 
                        one to displease Allah?

           He nods and she moves swiftly into the kitchen/storeroom.

           INT. BAKERY - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Lena heads straight for the back and hides behind a shelf,  
           pulling out SAMI’S CELL. It has bars. She holds her breath 
           and dials. IT RINGS. 
           INT. JEANNE’S HOME - JEANNE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jeanne jolts awake and searches madly for her ringing cell.

                                 JEANNE
                             (into cell)
                        Hello? 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN LENA AND JEANNE

                                 LENA
                        Gramma? I don’t have a lot of time. 
                        I just wanted to say I love you. 
                        I’ve been really really stupid. I 
                        was trying to come home but I don’t 
                        think that’s going to work out now.

                                 JEANNE
                        Lena, listen to me. Someone is 
                        coming to help you. 

                                 LENA
                        What?

                                 JEANNE
                        His name is Idris. He’s from the 
                        French government. Can I text this 
                        number? 

                                 LENA
                        Yes.

                                 UMM BURHAN (O.S.)
                        Umm Ambar?

           Lena hangs up, her heart racing. She rounds the corner, right 
           into Umm Burhan. 

                                 LENA
                        All clear.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - AFTERNOON

           Lena immediately branches off from the rest of the returning 
           women, heading quickly for the bathroom.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena searches the stalls then runs to LOCK THE DOOR behind 
           her. She turns on the water for sound cover and pulls out the 
           CELL. Jeanne has TEXTED A NUMBER. 
           Lena moves to the window, searching for bars, then DIALS.

           EXT. Y.P.G BASE CAMP - NORTHERN SYRIA - DAY

           Idris, his leg bandaged, is smoking outside a medical tent in 
           a Syrian Kurdish camp in a bombed but recently liberated 
           city. He answers his phone immediately.

                                 IDRIS
                        This is Idris.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN LENA AND IDRIS:

           She almost can’t believe he picked up.

                                 LENA
                        This is Lena. My grandma gave me 
                        your number. She said you can help 
                        me.

                                 IDRIS
                        I can. If you can also help me.

                                 LENA
                        With what?

                                 IDRIS
                        Three o’clock tomorrow, you’ll pass 
                        a man fixing a telephone pole on 
                        your route down Tel Abyad street. 
                        As you walk by, keep your hand by 
                        your side, but point one finger at 
                        the sky. He will hand you a small 
                        package containing a white square. 
                        You’re to secure that to Umm 
                        Layyin’s abaya without her 
                        noticing. If you do that, I can 
                        help you. 

                                 LENA
                        That’s impossible. I have a 
                        partner. And if they see me do any 
                        of that they’ll kill me.

                                 IDRIS
                        If you don’t do it, that same man 
                        will walk into your headquarters, 
                        tell them you’ve been spying for 
                        the resistance and they’ll kill you 
                        anyway. This is an opportunity for 
                        you to come back home. You’re a 
                        wanted terrorist, Lena. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 IDRIS (CONT'D)
                        Did you ever think about that? The 
                        minute you cross the border, you’re 
                        a fugitive. France could grant you 
                        amnesty, but only in exchange for 
                        your cooperation.

           Someone tries the bathroom door. It’s locked. Lena flinches 
           as they start BANGING.

                                 LENA
                        OK. On one condition.

                                 IDRIS
                        What’s that?

                                 LENA
                        Do you know how to drive a tanker?

           INT. DGSE HEADQUARTERS - VIVIAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Vivian sits at her desk talking to Idris on the phone.

                                 VIVIAN
                        How many women?

           EXT. SYRIAN DESERT /INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - DAY

           Idris, dressed in a khaki repair man’s uniform drives East 
           towards RAQQA. He talks on his cell.

                                 IDRIS 
                        About twenty. At least five kids.  There’s a Yazidi 
                        rescue organization planning to meet them outside 
                        near the border.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN VIVIAN AND IDRIS:

                                 VIVIAN
                        Should help her amnesty proposal. We’ll have 
                        embassy diplomats waiting for you .

                                 IDRIS
                        If she’s able to plant the tracker, we’ll leave 
                        tomorrow tonight. I’ll text if we make it past the last 
                        checkpoint.

                                 VIVIAN
                        The US might even let her go home if she’s willing to 
                        provide the CIA with intel. 
                                 IDRIS
                        We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.
                             (then)
                        I have to go.

           The enormous BLACK FLAG of The Organization appears on the 
           horizon. He hides his cell. As he approaches the checkpoint, 
           housed in the double stone arches of the former toll both, 
           ARMED GUARDS in black flank the van. 

           He rolls down his window and hands the GUARD a SERVICE ORDER 
           complete with Organization logo

                                 IDRIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m fixing telephone poles on Mansour Street. Here’s 
                        my contact at Diwan al-Khadamat. Some second 
                        cousin of Al Baghdadi is getting testy that he can’t 
                        call his mother in Istanbul. Sqeaky wheel... 

                                 GUARD
                        I need to call this in and check.

           Idris nods. The guard makes a call from the checkpoint booth, 
           staring at Idris. Idris picks his teeth. The guard talks to 
           someone, then hangs up and approaches.

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        He says they need you on 23rd of February Street too. 
                        And I need to check your van.

                                 IDRIS
                        Be my guest.

           EXT. RAQQA ORGANIZATION CHECKPOINT - DAY

           Idris stands next to the guard as he throws open the back 
           doors of the van. It’s just electrical supplies and a TWELVE-
           PACK of Coca Cola. The guard takes the soda, closes the doors 
           and nods for Idris to be on his way. 

           INT. RAQQA MOSQUE - DAY 

           Sami, clean shaven, dressed in a white robe, performs the 
           Zuhr afternoon prayer with a GROUP OF SHAVED MEN also clad in 
           white. They rise. ABU AL HUSAYNE, 50s, a kind-eyed, 
           potbellied emir with a long grey beard, smiles at Sami and 
           leads him into an adjoining courtyard. 
           EXT. RAQQA MOSQUE - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The two walk together along a low pool lined with tiles.

                                 ABU AL HUSAYNE
                        Your cousin spoke very highly of you, so we are 
                        honored to give you this opportunity. I’m sorry your 
                        preparation’s been so rushed. Our intelligence is only 
                        good for so long. Your mission will take place tomorrow 
                        morning at the Galatasaray Market.

                                 SAMI
                             (surprised)
                        In Istanbul.

                                 ABU AL HUSAYNE
                        A contact in the Turkish government came through. 
                        We have an opening to assassinate their head of 
                        counter intelligence. You’re to kill the maximum 
                        number of kufir while also taking out our target. 
                        You’ll stop in Sayerova to pick up the explosives then 
                        cross the Bosphorous Bridge in the morning. It’s a long 
                        journey. You leave in one hour. 

                                 SAMI
                        Thank you for your trust with a mission of such 
                        importance.

           Abu Al Husayne smiles and nods.

           EXT. TEL ABYAD STREET - DAY

           Lena and Umm Burhan, are on their patrol. Umm Burhan is 
           chastising a woman. Lena is grateful that a full niquab makes 
           it easy to hide her anxiety.

                                 UMM BURHAN
                        If you love Allah, sister, do not let us catch you out 
                        without an escort again.

           Lena sees the man in khaki work clothes fixing the telephone 
           pole ahead of her. Idris. She and Umm Burhan begin walking 
           towards him. Lena hesitates, then points her finger at the 
           sky. He doesn’t seem to be looking at her.

           She passes. Nothing happens. She starts to turn to look 
           behind her when --
                                 UMM BURHAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey! 

           Lena freezes. Then she sees Umm Burhan is talking to a woman 
           leaving a shop.

                                 UMM BURHAN (CONT’D)
                        Sister, please. Where are your gloves? That’s a fine. 

           Lena breathes a sigh of relief and then feels something in 
           her pocket. For a moment she pulls it out and we see it - a 
           white plastic square - then she shoves it back out of sight.

           As Lena and Umm Burhan return from their patrol, taking off 
           their veils. Lena searches the room.

                                 LENA
                             (to Umm Firas)
                        Where’s Umm Layyin?

                                 UMM FIRAS
                        She left a few minutes ago. 

           Lena re-clips her veil and runs back out. Umm Firas stares 
           after her, surprised by her urgency.

           EXT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER 

           Lena bursts from the brigade and sees a niqab clad woman 
           walking down the street with a TALL MAN. She races after her, 
           touching her arm.

                                 LENA
                        Umm Layyin?

                                 WOMAN
                        Sorry, no.

                                 LENA
                        Excuse me.

           She sees another WOMAN getting into a 4X4. 

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Umm Layyin?

           The Woman SHUTS the door. People are staring. Several 
           SECURITY GUARDS begin to approach her. Lena starts to panic. 
           Someone touches her arm.
                                 A VOICE (O.C.)
                        What on earth are you doing?

           It’s Umm Layyin.

                                 LENA
                        I just... I... wanted to ask for 
                        your forgiveness. I should have 
                        noticed if Noor was acting 
                        inappropriately. She was my 
                        partner. We’re supposed to 
                        strengthen each other’s iman. I 
                        feel ashamed that I failed her. And 
                        you. It’s been weighing on me.

           Lena does her best to seem distraught, hugging Umm Layyin and 
           surreptitiously slipping the SQUARE into her abaya.

                                 UMM LAYYIN
                        Oh, Ukhti, you don’t need my 
                        forgiveness. Only Allah’s. Make dua 
                        and ask for his mercy. Remember, no 
                        matter how dark we may believe our 
                        souls to be, if we offer salaah al-
                        tawbah we are never too ugly for 
                        Allah.

           Lena nods, hating her. 

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Hadiya and Lena cook in the kitchen, the table set for 
           dinner. Mohammed exits the bedroom. 

                                 MOHAMMED
                        What’s the hold up? There’s two of 
                        you! I told you there’s a rally 
                        tonight. I’m going to be late 
                        because of you.

                                 LENA
                        No, it’s done, see?

           She brings the pan over to the table and scoops the Kousa 
           Mahshi onto the plates.

                                 MOHAMMED
                        I’m sick of Kousa Mahshi.

                                 LENA
                        I’m sorry. We won’t make it again.
           Mohammed shovels down his food. 

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Lena folds laundry. She winces hearing muffled cries from the 
           bedroom. Mohammed emerges, zipping up his fly, grabs his bag 
           without looking at her and leaves. The moment the door shuts, 
           she springs into action.

           INT. RAQQA APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She runs to Hadiya’s aid. Then she retrieves the cell phone 
           and keys she hid in the back of a drawer along with two 
           niqabs.

           EXT. RAQQA APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Lena and Hadiya exit the building. The city is dark as most 
           of the electricity is out.

           They hear voices rounding the corner and slip into the 
           shadows just as two SOLDIERS pass. A pillar of black isn’t 
           the worst thing to wear to move through the city undetected.

           Lena leads them across the street to Idris’ ELECTRICAL VAN. 
           Hadiya almost screams when Idris rounds the corner. He opens 
           the back of the van and gestures for them to get in. Lena 
           nods to Hadiya and they both get in. He shuts the door, 
           enveloping them in darkness.

           EXT. RAQQA STREETS - NIGHT

           The van drives with its lights off through the city, which 
           itself is pitch black except for the low glow of candles 
           behind curtained windows. 

           In the distance, they hear a throng of male voices singing a 
           nasheed. The rally is close to the Al Khansaa headquarters.

           EXT. RAQQA SQUARE - NIGHT

           An open circle 20 yards across has been roped off for the 
           festivities. A hundred men and boys are packed around its 
           edges, sitting in plastic chairs, standing, craning to see. 

           The nasheed blasts from the speakers. An Emir at a long white 
           table at the center of the circle sings into a microphone. 
                                 RECORDING (V.O.)/CROWD
                             (singing)
                        The Islamic State was established 
                        With the blood of the truthful....

           Young boys wiggle to the front for a better view. Some men 
           seem deeply moved, holding their kalashnikovs to the sky, 
           eyes closed. Others look like they’re forced to be there.

           EXT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           The van is parked on a side street next to the brigade. They 
           watch the PATROLMAN pass the FROSTED GLASS SIDE DOOR of the 
           building as he circles the perimeter. 

                                 IDRIS
                        It takes him about four minutes per 
                        round. When he reaches the front 
                        stairs, follow me.

           Lena nods. The PATROL MAN passes the stairs and the three of 
           them hurry across the empty street, moving as one. Idris 
           pulls a pin from his pocket and jimmies the lock open. 

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - WOMEN’S ANNEX - CONTINUOUS

           They enter the annex and hurry out into the lobby.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           They watch the glass entry doors, waiting for the Patrolman 
           to pass. He stares in as he does, surveying the empty lobby. 
           As soon as he’s gone, Lena leads them to Azzam’s office.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           She rummages in the cabinet where she saw Azzam put the keys. 
           Nothing. She tries the desk drawer and FINDS THEM.

                                 LENA
                             (gesturing to Hadiya)
                        We’ll follow you.

           Hadiya nods and leads them back out into the lobby.
           EXT. RALLY - NIGHT

           The singing continues as the Emir walks to the center of the 
           circle. Teenagers wave enormous black flags back and forth. 

                                 EMIR
                        Because of your devotion to Allah and your fear of 
                        Allah, you have brought about the Caliphate! We 
                        will spill the blood of every infidel,
                        From here to Jakarta to Washington DC!

           The CROWD cheers. Men fire their kalashnikovs into the air.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS

           Hadiya leads them into a hallway off the lobby, then down a 
           flight of stairs to the BASEMENT. They follow her with only 
           the light of Idris’ CELL PHONE to the last door.

           Lena tries the key. It doesn’t work. Idris waits for a round 
           of gunfire from the rally and SHOOTS the lock off. They hear 
           SCREAMS from inside.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The women stand against the far wall, terrified. Hadiya runs  
           straight to an EIGHT-YEAR-OLD-GIRL with the same piercing 
           GREEN EYES.

                                 HADIYA
                             (in Kurdish)
                        Everyone be quiet. These people are going to help us. 
                        They’re going to get us out of the city. Follow them. 
                        Don’t make a sound.

           The women nod and follow Hadiya and Idris, eyeing them with 
           curiosity and suspicion. Lena brings up the rear.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           The women wait at the top of the stairs. Hadiya and Idris 
           watch for the PATROLMAN to pass, then leads everyone across 
           to the annex.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - WOMEN’S ANNEX - CONTINUOUS

           As they enter, they can hear the NASHEED from the rally.
                                 EMIR (O.C.)
                        Takbir!

                                 CROWD (O.C.)
                        God is great!

           The crowd unleashes another round of GUNFIRE. Idris watches 
           for the PATROLMAN and gestures for them to wait.

           EXT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           The Patrolman rounds the corner of the building next to the 
           entrance, then stops right in front to listen to the rally.

                                 EMIR (O.C.)
                        Say it louder! Takbir!

                                 CROWD (O.C.)
                        God is great!

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - WOMEN’S ANNEX - CONTINUOUS

           The Patrolman begins to pass, then stops right in front of 
           the door, listening to the Nasheed.

           EXT. RALLY - NIGHT

           The emir stabs his kalashnikov into the sky.

                                 EMIR
                        Takbir!

                                 CROWD
                        God is great!

           Young boys point one finger at the sky and shout, the most 
           passionate of all. An TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY has a gun he raises.

           EXT. AL KHANSAA BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           Close on the Patrolman craning to see the rally around the 
           buildings. Then he hears a COUGH.

           INT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - WOMEN’S ANNEX - CONTINUOUS

           It was Hadiya’s Daughter. She looks to her mother, terrified.
           EXT. AL KHANSAA HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           The Patrolman gets out his gun and points it at the door.

                                 PATROLMAN
                        Who’s there? Come out or I’ll shoot.

           He fumbles for his keys and starts to open the door. As 
           gunfire explodes from the rally, the guard’s body is riddled 
           with bullets and he falls to the ground. 

           The door swings open revealing Idris, gun in hand. Hadiya 
           leads the women past the dead body and across the street. 

           Idris unlocks the van. Hadiya and Lena help the women in. 
           It’s tight. Idris SHUTS the doors behind them.

           EXT. RAQQA STREET - NIGHT

           The van drives back the way it came, lights off as the sounds 
           of the rally fade into the distance.

                                 RECORDING/CROWD (O.C.)
                        Oh Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, 
                        You terrify your enemies. 
                        Beautiful virgins are calling.
                        Enroll me as a martyr.

           EXT. INDUSTRIAL YARD - NIGHT

           Close on the MANHOLE on top of the oil tanker as Idris 
           unscrews it. He drops a thick MOVING BLANKET into the hole, 
           then gestures for Hadiya, waiting on the oil tanker’s ladder. 

                                 IDRIS
                        You have to jump.

           She looks at him, terrified, dips her feet into the darkness 
           and lowers herself down. 

           INT. TURKISH WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           There’s a THUD as the final neatly packed cube of explosives 
           is placed in a hidden compartment at the bottom of a FLORISTS 
           VAN. The TWO MEN who have been loading the van now begin to 
           replace the false floor. 

           Sami stands nearby, his HANDLER tightening the vest he wears 
           lined with red tubes of explosives.
                                 HANDLER
                        Very basic. You will martyr yourself, God willing, with 
                        this switch when you are close to the target. Be very 
                        careful to keep your hands away from it until it is 
                        time. The button is very sensitive.

           Sami nods. The handler pours SHRAPNEL into Sami’s pockets.

                                 HANDLER (CONT’D)
                        Your bones also work as shrapnel. Alhamdulillah, he 
                        created us in the most perfect way to fight in his 
                        name.

                                 SAMI
                        Surely, Allah is the best of planners.

           Sami sees that the two Men are now filling the van with 
           BUCKETS OF TULIPS covering up the false floor.

           EXT. OUTER NORTHERN RAQQA - NIGHT

           The oil tanker makes its way out of the city proper into the 
           darkness of the countryside.

           INT. TANKER - NIGHT

           Lena watches Hadiya sing softly to her Daughter. A low 
           metallic boom resonates every time they hit a bump in the 
           road. Hadiya sees Lena staring and shoots her a smile, not of 
           gratitude, but of compassion, maybe pity. Lena realizes she’s 
           been staring at their loving embrace with longing.

           EXT. NORTHERN AL-RAQQA CHECKPOINT - NIGHT

           A black flag flies above the checkpoint, which consists of 
           several pick-up trucks emblazoned with The Organization’s 
           logo. The dark road is illuminated with floodlights.

           Two soldiers with AK-47s across their chests examine an 
           American M-249 SAW. They are NAJJAR, 24 and RAMSES, 17. 
           Ramses practices swinging the machine gun onto his shoulder.

                                 NAJJAR
                        No, like this. 

           Najjar shows him expertly.
                                 NAJJAR (CONT’D)
                        You can’t let the cartridges tangle. There’s a lot of 
                        them. I killed, like, 150 kafir in Al-Bab with this. 

                                 RAMSES
                        That’s impossible.

                                 NAJJAR
                        Why would I lie to you? Practice and next time you 
                        can boast about all the kafir blood you spilled.

           They see the tanker approaching the checkpoint. Najjar hands 
           Ramses the M-249 and approaches the road. Ramses practices.

           INT. TANKER/ EXT. NORTHERN AL-RAQQA CHECKPOINT - NIGHT

           Idris blinks at the bright lights. Just beyond them sits a T-
           62 MAIN BATTLE TANK pointed directly at the oil tanker. Idris 
           grinds to a halt and soldiers flank them. He gets out.

                                 NAJJAR
                        Papers.

           Idris hands them over.

                                 NAJJAR (CONT’D)
                        Where you headed? 

                                 IDRIS
                        Al-Tabqa for a pick-up. 
                             (re: the time of night)
                        I hate traffic.

           Najjar raises his eyebrows and studies him.

                                 NAJJAR
                        I’ve never seen you on this route.

                                 IDRIS
                        I’m the office guy, but my partner is sick.

                                 NAJJAR
                        Who’s your partner?

                                 IDRIS
                        Sami Al-Kabir. I can call him if you want.

                                 NAJJAR
                        The gimp! Good guy. You ever had his mother’s 
                        baklava?
                                 IDRIS
                        Too many times. It’s too sweet for me. 

           Najjar hands back the papers. 

                                 NAJJAR
                        More for me.
                             (then)
                        Unfortunately, we have to search your tank. 
                        Someone’s been smuggling artillery to the Kurds 
                        through here. Can’t be too careful. 
                             (calling out)
                        Ramses! Go up and check out this tanker.

           Ramses sets down the gun and climbs the ladder, his AK-47 
           still on his back.

           INT. TANKER - CONTINUOUS

           Lena and the women sit huddled at the front of the tanker, 
           listening to the metallic CLANG of Ramses’s footsteps. The 
           manhole cover begins to unscrew. Lena gets in position to 
           open fire if necessary. 

           EXT. NORTHERN AL-RAQQA CHECKPOINT - CONTINUOUS

           Ramses, on the top of the tanker stares down into the 
           darkness. He can’t see anything. He puts his legs into the 
           manhole and lowers himself down.

           INT. TANKER - CONTINUOUS

           There’s a low metal BOOM as he lands. He hears the cock of 
           Lena’s gun first, then sees the women. Lena gets ready to 
           shoot, though that would hardly save them. Hadiya looks at 
           him pointedly and puts her finger to her lips. 

                                 RAMSES
                        May Allah fulfil the purpose of your journey. 

           Lena recognizes the phrase. It’s the same one Sami said to 
           her the night he left. This must be his contact.

                                 RAMSES (CONT’D)
                             (shouting upward)
                        No weapons. Lift me out.

           A rope is let down into the tanker. He’s hoisted out. They 
           breathe a collective and silent sigh of relief.
           EXT. NORTHERN AL-RAQQA CHECKPOINT - NIGHT

           Najjar waves the tanker forward. Ramses’s eyes lock with 
           Idris for a moment as he walks back to the tent.

           EXT. NORTHERN SYRIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

           They’ve stopped for fresh air. By the roadside are fields of 
           wild lavender. Lena watches the women stretch their legs, 
           kiss the ground, hold each other and cry. Hadiya and her 
           daughter pick flowers. Idris makes a call.

           INT. DGSE CONTROL ROOM  - DAY

           Vivian and her TEAM are assembled. The drone strike targeting 
           Umm Layyin and her network is going down simultaneously. 

                                 TECH ANALYST
                        Target is heading for the media center.

           Vivian picks up her vibrating cell.

                                 VIVIAN
                             (into phone)
                        Idris?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN IDRIS AND VIVIAN:

                                 IDRIS 
                        I’m gonna need about 30 hamburgers.

           Vivian smiles, hearing his voice.

                                 VIVIAN
                        I’ll have them buy out the nearest McDonalds.
                             (then)
                        The Red Cross has connected with the Yazidi 
                        organization. There’s also a camera crew. 

                                 IDRIS
                        Never miss a press opportunity.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Should I call the grandmother? She’s probably 
                        waiting on pins and needles.

           Idris watches Lena, alone in the fields of flowers.
                                 IDRIS
                        I’d wait.

           EXT. OIL TANKER - DAY

           We see the tanker racing down the highway from above. The 
           manhole has been removed to allow in fresh air, and through 
           it we see Hadiya staring up at the morning sky.

           EXT. NORTHERN SYRIAN COUNTRYSIDE/INT. OIL TANKER CAB - DAY

           Lena now rides next to Idris. She watches the countryside go 
           by. She thinks about Sami, Zeinah, Mahmoud.

                                 IDRIS
                        Sad to leave the Caliphate?

           She gives him a disparaging look.

                                 LENA
                        No. But there are people there who 
                        deserve to get out more than me.

                                 IDRIS
                        Well, life’s not fair, is it?

           EXT. AKCAKALE BORDER CROSSING - TURKISH BORDER - DAY 

           DIPLOMATS from the French Embassy, SEVEN YAZIDI FAMILIES, RED 
           CROSS WORKERS, BORDER SECURITY and TURKISH POLICE all wait 
           under the blue border sign that reads “Akçakale Gümrük”. They 
           watch where the road disappears over the crest of a hill 100 
           yards away, waiting for the tanker. 

           An INTERN with the diplomats holds a camera -- sending 
           footage back to Vivian and her team at DGSE.

           INT. DGSE HEADQUARTERS - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Vivian and the team watch the palpable excitement of the 
           crowd via the live footage stream.

           INT. OIL TANKER CAB - DAY

           Lena and Idris rumble up a low grade hill.
                                 IDRIS
                        You had things you were running 
                        away from, all reasons you came 
                        here. Won’t they still be there 
                        when you get back? 

                                 LENA
                        Probably. But you can’t keep 
                        running away when things aren’t the 
                        way you want them to be. You have 
                        to try to fix them. Someone here 
                        taught me that.

           As they lumber up a large hill, something occurs to Lena.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        When you came to get your son, did 
                        he want to go back?

                                 IDRIS
                        When I found him, he was in jail. 
                        The Organization suspected him of 
                        being a spy. He was beaten. They 
                        starved him. I bribed the guard who 
                        was watching him. When I brought 
                        him home he cursed them, talked 
                        about how they had forsaken him. 
                        How this place wasn’t what they 
                        said it was. Then things changed.  
                        One day he told me he thought Allah 
                        had sent me to save him so that he 
                        could complete his jihad in “the 
                        land of Kafir.” 

                                 LENA
                        Why would he say that?

                                 IDRIS
                        Once you’ve felt unquestioning 
                        conviction, it’s hard to go back to 
                        a life full of questions. Having 
                        purpose is very addictive. 

           As they crest the hill, Lena sees the border. Black vans and 
           a row of men dot the gated wall 100 yards ahead. This is not 
           the border crossing where French Intelligence is waiting. 

                                 LENA
                        Where is he now?
                                 IDRIS
                        He blew himself up at a gas station 
                        in Marseille, along with seven 
                        other people. I blame myself for 
                        that.

           The are closer now and Lena can see the unsmiling faces of 20 
           armed TURKISH POLICE OFFICERS and blue-jacketed CIA AGENTS.

                                 LENA
                        You know I would never do that...

           INT./EXT. RAS AL-AYN BORDER CROSSING - TURKEY/SYRIA - DAY

           As Idris brings the tanker to a stop, the police form a semi-
           circle around the tanker cab, guns raised. Several CIA AGENTS 
           approach Lena’s side of the cab. She looks to Idris, stunned.

                                 LENA
                        I would never do that!

           One of the AGENTS opens her door and grabs her arm, 
           forcefully. Lena can’t believe what’s happening as she’s 
           pulled out of the cab and handcuffed.

                                 CIA AGENT
                        Lena Kaminsky, under the 
                        jurisdiction of the United States 
                        of America, you are under arrest 
                        for providing material support 
                        and/or resources to a foreign 
                        terrorist organization, as 
                        specified under U.S. Code 2339B.

                                 LENA
                        Idris! What about the women? 

                                 IDRIS
                        I’ll take them to their families. 

           They begin to lead her towards one of the vans. Lena looks to 
           him, pleading but he turns away, burying any emotion under a 
           uniform solemn gaze. She watches in horror as he closes the 
           cab door, starts the engine and drives away. 

           INT. DGSE HEADQUARTERS - CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Vivian watch the footage of the waiting families, news crews

           Guilleman tracks Umm Layyin on another set of screens. They 
           watch the progress of a drone over the shoulder of the ARMY 
           SERGEANT controlling it.

                        On your say.

                                 VIVIAN

           Sami sits in a middle seat, his fellow fighters sitting

           The van on the bridge EXPLODES. Sami has activated his

           Arms of fire lap for a moment at the bridge’s vaulted steel 
           wires then resign themselves to smouldering in the wreckage.
