                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        Or maybe it’s simply that one night 
                        — you know which night — that was 
                        just a hell of a lot of fun.

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - LOBBY - SUNSET - SEQUENCE

           Back in the Palmer House, Ardis carries her BRIEFCASE through 
           the lobby and up the central staircase.

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        Come on, you can tell me, there’s 
                        nothing to be embarrassed about. 
                        The scene playing in your head 
                        right now — that’s who you are.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY - SEQUENCE

           POV: We kick a SOCCER BALL down the grass as a line of PRE 
           TEEN GIRL DEFENDERS — in uniforms — line up against us... But 
           we expertly maneuver the ball around them and FIRE it past 
           the GOALIE.

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        Even now, to recall this moment is 
                        to be reminded of your truest self.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT - SEQUENCE

           POV: On a moonlit bed, we gaze across the sheets at a WOMAN’S 
           DARK HAIR nestled upon the pillow beside us. We admire the 
           curve of her bare shoulder as she tosses restlessly.

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        So whatever it is, really picture 
                        it. Squeeze that feeling, suck it 
                        into your lungs. Like you’re 
                        suffocating and this memory, this 
                        singular transcendence, it’s the 
                        only thing keeping you alive.

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - LOBBY - SUNSET - SEQUENCE

           Ardis turns past the gilt-bronze torchieres —

           — And enters the elegant LOBBY BAR.

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        You got it? Okay. Now...
                             (beat)
                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        ... How much would I have to pay 
                        you to give it up?

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - LOBBY BAR - SUNSET

           In the intimate hotel bar, Ardis sits across from her new 
           client:

           RICHARD FITZGERALD — 50, square as they come, has the kind of 
           money that makes him accustomed to hotels like this one.

                                 RICHARD
                        ... People go for that? They sell?

                                 ARDIS
                        And they sell me something so 
                        unique and precious that they 
                        cannot believe they let it go.

                                 RICHARD
                        High quality... “mems.”

                                 ARDIS
                             (re: “mems”)
                        Richard, you can be honest with me: 
                        Is this your first time?

                                 RICHARD
                        Is it that obvious?
                             (off her look)
                        I met your — colleague — Zeke. He 
                        told me that you were the person to 
                        talk to...

                                 ARDIS
                        Did Zeke explain to you how this 
                        works?

                                 RICHARD
                        I read an article. The Style 
                        section.

                                 ARDIS
                        The technology was developed by the 
                        Defense Department. To remove 
                        traumatic memories from soldiers 
                        with PTSD. But then people 
                        realized, you could do more than 
                        suck a memory out. You could pop it 
                        in someone else’s head. His brain 
                        would incorporate it, as if it’d 
                        happened to him.
                                 RICHARD
                        But the mems aren’t reproducible. 
                        The chemistry is too complicated. 
                        Only a human brain can create a 
                        memory.

                                 ARDIS
                        They covered all that in the Style 
                        section?

                                 RICHARD
                        The point is, in order for one 
                        person to gain a memory, someone 
                        else has to lose it.

                                 ARDIS
                        What business did you say you were 
                        in again?

                                 RICHARD
                        Investment banking.

                                 ARDIS
                        Lot of Marxists in investment 
                        banking?

           ON RICHARD: Point taken.

                                 RICHARD
                        I don’t suppose there are a lot of 
                        Marxists in your business either.

           ON ARDIS: Touché.

                                 ARDIS
                        Richard, I don’t mean to be rude, 
                        but before we can continue there’s 
                        something I need to hear you say 
                        out-loud. Just once. Will you say 
                        the magic words for me?

           ON RICHARD: Nervous.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m not a cop.

           ON ARDIS: Gauging... She believes him.

                                 ARDIS
                        Thank you. Now: How may I be of 
                        service?
                             (no response)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARDIS (CONT'D)
                        You want some common, “I had a 
                        threesome at Burning Man” — well 
                        Zeke could’ve sold you that. But he 
                        sent you to me, which means that 
                        you are in the market for 
                        something... Bespoke.

           ON RICHARD: Reticence.

           ON ARDIS: She’s seen this look before.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Nothing you say will blush my 
                        virgin cheeks.

           He instinctively fiddles with his wedding ring.

           Ardis notices.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        It’s not cheating. You’re 
                        remembering someone else getting 
                        whatever it is that you’re not. A 
                        younger woman? A man?

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s not a man.

                                 ARDIS
                        Then a woman who has a taste for 
                        something that your wife doesn’t?

                                 RICHARD
                        I’ve never cheated on my wife.

                                 ARDIS
                        Do you watch porn?
                             (no response)
                        Do you ever think about those 
                        women, when you’re in bed with your 
                        wife?

           ON RICHARD: Doesn’t make eye contact.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        What about ex-girlfriends. One-
                        night-stands from your misspent 
                        20s. All the women you’ve known who 
                        responded to your touch with so 
                        much more enthusiasm. When you’re 
                        with your wife, whose tongue do you 
                        imagine thrilling at the taste of 
                        your skin?
           ON RICHARD: Startled by her boldness.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        So what’s the difference?
                             (beat)
                        A good day, a bad day, the real 
                        lover beneath you, or the distant 
                        echo of someone else’s half-
                        remembered orgasm... It’s all in 
                        your head.

           ON RICHARD: There is something about her that makes him want 
           to tell her things...

                                 RICHARD
                        ... I want to be hurt.

                                 ARDIS
                        Tell me.

                                 RICHARD
                        Just to feel someone else in 
                        control for — I love my wife. 24 
                        years, two kids, and I still love 
                        her, you have to understand. But 
                        she’s so good and polite and — I’ve 
                        never had to beg.

                                 ARDIS
                        Tell me.

                                 RICHARD
                        To be tied down. To be controlled. 
                        I want someone to leave bruises.

           ON RICHARD: He can’t believe he just say that out loud.

           ON ARDIS: She can.

                                 ARDIS
                        There is a collective I work with. 
                        Conceptual artists. They do things 
                        to each other. Then try on each 
                        other’s memories of the 
                        proceedings. Sometimes, the really 
                        special ones, they’ll trade to me 
                        for rent money.

                                 RICHARD
                        I wouldn’t really do that. With a 
                        stranger. For real.
                                 ARDIS
                        Oh honey. There’s no such thing as 
                        real. There’s only this...

           She reaches out and affectionately taps his forehead.

           ON RICHARD: Even the small touch of this woman feels nice.

                                 RICHARD
                        You have it with you?

           Ardis places her BRIEFCASE on the table.

                                 ARDIS
                             (re: briefcase)
                        Maybe we should go someplace a 
                        little more comfortable.

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - LUXURY SUITE - MINUTES LATER

           In the hotel’s MOST EXPENSIVE SUITE, Ardis opens up her 
           briefcase, REVEALING a series of curious objects:

           1) A strange, futuristic SYRINGE. Nicknamed a “spike.”

           2) ROWS of MEDICAL VIALS. In each vial floats a murky orange 
           liquid.

           Plus one object that is decidedly more familiar:

           3) A GUN.

                                 ARDIS
                             (re: the equipment)
                        Do you know how this stuff works?

                                 RICHARD
                        The Style section.
                             (re: futuristic syringe)
                        You call that a “spike”.
                             (re: vial)
                        The orange color comes from a 
                        chemical called Tetralazine. It 
                        helps the brain soak up the mem.

           ON ARDIS: Very good.

           She removes the syringe and a vial from the case.

           ON THE VIAL: A handwritten label on which Ardis has noted the 
           contents as a series of coded symbols.
                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                             (re: vial)
                        Is that it?

           She nods, and shows him her phone, which has a BITCOIN
           TRANSACTION app on it.

           Richard looks at the price on Ardis’ phone.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        That’s a lot of money.

                                 ARDIS
                        The best things in life are free. 
                        The second best are very, very 
                        expensive.

           ON RICHARD: Fuck it. He can afford it.

           He waves his own phone near hers, and both phones DING 
           simultaneously, completing the transaction.

           She gestures to the bed. Richard sits on the edge.

           She loads the mem vial into the spike and places the spike 
           against the back of Richard’s head.

           Finds the spot, right where the spinal column meets his

                        You ready?

           Richard nods, and Ardis INJECTS THE LIQUID INTO RICHARD’S 
           BRAIN — 

                                   FLASHES OF IMAGERY: 

           POV: We raise our arm over our head as a YOUNG WOMAN ties our 
           wrist to a bedframe.

           POV: We peek down at our unclothed (male) body as the Young 
           Woman affixes straps to our ankles.

           POV: We watch the Young Woman run a LEATHER PROD across our 
           nipples.

                                   BACK TO THE HOTEL: 

           Ardis continues slowly injecting the liquid into Richard.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        At first, it feels like you’re 
                        watching television.

                        ... I was at a bar... But that was 
                        a year ago... She invited me 
                        back...

                                 ARDIS
                        Rest. And when you wake up... They 
                        say that naked is the best 
                        disguise.

                                 RICHARD
                        What?

                                 ARDIS
                        William Congreve. 17th century. “No 
                        mask like open truth to cover lies 
                        / For to go naked is the best 
                        disguise.”
                             (beat)
                        Rest. 

           Ardis walks to the door, then turns and to take one last look 
           at her newest client.

           ON ARDIS: The oddest unplaceable expression as she watches 
           him sleep. Is that... recognition?

           Recognition of what?

                                                         FADE TO WHITE.

                                                            FADE UP ON:

           EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - NIGHT

           Night falls on near-future Chicago.

           The glittering skyline is almost identical to that of 2017 — 
           but with a few GLEAMING NEW SKYSCRAPERS.

           A light coat of AUTUMN RAIN begins to wash the dirty streets 
           in a smooth sheen.

           EXT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT BUILDING - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           Rain taps against a stylish glass apartment building along 
           the lake.
                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: Our toes DIG INTO perfectly white sand as we gaze out at 
           a CARIBBEAN OCEAN, the water radiating the strangest shade of 
           blue...

                                         REVEAL:

           INT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ardis COMES TO at the sound of the DOORBELL.

           She’s on her couch, a mem vial in one hand, a spike in the 
           other. She’s groggy, the newly inserted memory just bonding 
           with her brain. She’s wearing the same clothes she was in the 
           previous scene.

           DING DONG.

           She tries to shake off the memory-bonding wooziness as she 
           moves through the apartment, which is Spartan in its 
           minimalism. The only signs of human life are the used VIALS 
           OF MEMORIES that have accumulated on the floor.

           She opens the front door to reveal:

           MASON RUSSELL, 40, a southern gentleman unburdened by remorse 
           about turning to a life of crime.

                                 MASON
                        I have the best idea.

                                 ARDIS
                        Mason. What’re you selling?

                                 MASON
                        Selling? It’s Saturday night. I 
                        thought we might go out, have a few 
                        cocktails, make some new friends — 

                                 ARDIS
                        — I’m busy —

           Mason enters, making himself at home —

                                 MASON
                        For someone who deals in other 
                        people’s sex lives, you’re awfully 
                        reluctant to have one your—

           — But he NOTICES all the used mem vials lying around.
                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                             (re: used vials)
                        — I taught you better than this.

                                 ARDIS
                        Were there lessons?

                                 MASON
                        “Never get high on your own 
                        supply.” That was lesson #1.

                                 ARDIS
                        That was Biggie.

                                 MASON
                        Does he deal on the west side?
                             (off her look)
                        You promised me you quit. Again.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m not using. I’m just... 
                        dabbling.

                                 MASON
                             (re: vials)
                        Which mem were you dabbling today?

                                 ARDIS
                             (genuine)
                        I don’t know.

           Mason digs around in the pile of used mem vials.

                                 MASON
                             (holding up a vial, reads 
                              the encoded label)
                        Is this the beach thing? I had a 
                        buyer lined up for that. Corporate 
                        exec, too busy for a vacation — 
                        easy money.

           ON ARDIS: A slight smile as she recalls the implanted memory.

                                  BACK TO THE APARTMENT:

                                 ARDIS
                        It felt so peaceful.
                                 MASON
                        It wasn’t you.

                                 ARDIS
                        It is now.
                             (beat)
                        What’re you selling?

                                 MASON
                        A night out!
                             (off her look)
                        You really think the only reason 
                        I’d come see you on a Saturday 
                        night is to sell you something?

                                 ARDIS
                        Yes.

                                 MASON
                        ... Well if you’re looking to buy, 
                        it does happen to be the case that 
                        I’ve come across a mem.

           He removes a MEM VIAL from his pocket.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        My clients prefer a hint of danger, 
                        but since bedsheet intrigues are 
                        your specialité de la maison — I’ll 
                        split the sale.

                                 ARDIS
                        What is it?

                                 MASON
                        Have a peek.

           ON ARDIS: Fine.

           She takes the vial then grabs her briefcase, from which she 
           removes her spike.

           She sits down with the vial and the spike...

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                             (re: spike)
                        May I?

           ... Ardis nods, and Mason gets behind her —

           — And INJECTS THE MEMORY INTO THE BACK OF ARDIS’ HEAD.

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

                        All right, that’s enough... I’m 
                        pulling it out before it bonds with 
                        you...

           Mason quickly PULLS THE MEMORY BACK OUT OF ARDIS’ HEAD.

           The vial refills with the murky orange liquid.

                                  BACK TO THE APARTMENT:

           Ardis shakes it off, the memory of rooftop sex fading from 
           her consciousness like a dream in the morning light.

           Mason holds up the vial: The mem is safely back inside.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Pretty hot, right?

                                 ARDIS
                        Men don’t really do it for me.

                        That’s just something you say so I

                             (off her look)
                        Whatever, even you can see the 
                        value in that man. 

                                 ARDIS
                        He’s that singer.

                        Something tells me that you know a

                        dollar to remember having been his

                                 ARDIS
                        60/40 — on consignment.

                                 MASON
                        Fuck you, consignment. How do I 
                        know you’re not just gonna spike it 
                        into your own head?

                                 ARDIS
                        Not my type.
                             (off his look)
                        What is it, honey? You don’t trust 
                        me?

                                 MASON
                        No.

           ON ARDIS: “Oh well then.”

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        ... You are such a cunt. 50/50, 
                        consignment.

           Ardis nods, takes the vial from him.

           She goes to her case, opening it to REVEAL:

           EVERYTHING IS THERE... EXCEPT THE GUN.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... My gun.

                                 MASON
                        What?

                                 ARDIS
                        It’s gone.

                                 MASON
                        You can’t remember where you put 
                        it?
                             (off her look)
                        Ardis, what is the point of being a 
                        drug dealer if you spend all of 
                        your money on drugs?

                                 ARDIS
                        How is it any different than booze, 
                        girls, whatever you’re into? We’re 
                        all just buying memories.
                                 MASON
                        My memories are actually mine.

                                 ARDIS
                        What’s in my head is “actually” me, 
                        Mason. You know how I can tell?

           Ardis puts the new mem vial in her case, then shuts it.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Because I remember.

           I/E. SELF-DRIVING TAXI - CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           Ardis rides in the back of a SELF-DRIVING TAXI. Most of the 
           other cars on the road are self-driving, but not all.

           She looks out the windows at Saturday night in Chicago — 
           revellers abound, everyone in search of the latest highs. The 
           freshest fixes. The timeliest thrills.

           ON ARDIS: Nothing she hasn’t seen a thousand times before.

           The self-driving taxi deposits Ardis outside of an old, 
           fucked-up apartment building in Garfield Park.

           Ardis gets out of the taxi and enters —

           INT. DILAPIDATED BUILDING - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           She climbs the stairs and knocks on an apartment door.

           The door opens to REVEAL:

           WENDELL JONES — 80s, pancreatic cancer.

           Ardis presents him with a stack of PRE-PAID CREDIT CARDS.

                                 ARDIS
                        Thanks for the memories.
           INT. DILAPIDATED BUILDING - WENDELL’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Around the apartment, we can see that Wendell is a bit of a 
           hoarder. He doesn’t leave the apartment much.

                                 ARDIS
                        I still owe you for Aruba.

           As Wendell counts the money, Ardis looks over the MEMORABILIA 
           on his walls.

           ON THE WALLS: Family photos of Wendell and his DAUGHTER, his 
           GRANDKIDS, his long-gone WIFE.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        How’re the grandkids?

                                 WENDELL
                        Grace wants me to come live with 
                        her in Phoenix.

                                 ARDIS
                        Yeah?

                                 WENDELL
                        You ever been to Phoenix?

                                 ARDIS
                        Yeah.

                                 WENDELL
                        You sure it was you?

           Ardis pauses on one of the photos...

           ON THE PHOTO: It’s Wendell and his wife on the same white-
           sand beach that Ardis was on in the memory she’d injected.

                                 ARDIS
                        Where is this? I was there, I...

           Wendell comes over, sees what she’s looking at.

           ON WENDELL: Looking at the beach. Confused.

                                 WENDELL
                        ... I don’t remember.

           They exchange a look. They both realize that her memory of 
           the beach must have originally been his.

                                 WENDELL (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been spiking again. One of 
                        my pulls.
           ON ARDIS: “None of your business.”

                                 WENDELL (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to ask you... What was the 
                        last mem you pulled from me?

                                 ARDIS
                        Why?

                                 WENDELL
                        I was on the phone with Grace, and 
                        she said — it was the littlest 
                        thing, but I realized — I don’t 
                        remember the day she was born.
                             (she doesn’t react)
                        Did I sell you my memory of the day 
                        my daughter was born?

           ON ARDIS: How exactly does one answer this question?

                                 ARDIS
                        Yes.

                                 WENDELL
                        Oh Jesus. Jesus. What was it like? 
                        Was she crying? How was her mom? 
                        What hospital was it?

                                 ARDIS
                        I don’t know.

                                 WENDELL
                        Ardis — you gotta give it back.

                                 ARDIS
                        It’s gone.

                                 WENDELL
                        I’ll buy it back.

                                 ARDIS
                             (re: pre-paid cards)
                        I already sold it to a colleague.

           Wendell looks at the pre-paid cards in his hand, realizing: 
           This is his cut.

                                 WENDELL
                        Who has it now? Who remembers 
                        Gracie?

                                 ARDIS
                        I have no idea.
                                 WENDELL
                        You just sold it to someone — 
                        anyone — doesn’t matter who it is?

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m just the middleman.

                                 WENDELL
                        You tricked me into it.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m not a fucking hypnotist.

                                 WENDELL
                        You took the most precious and 
                        special thing I have — and you sold 
                        it to somebody with more money in 
                        the bank.

                                 ARDIS
                        And now your grandkids have a shot 
                        at college. You sold your past to 
                        pay for your future. You knew what 
                        you were doing.

           ON WENDELL: His disgust turns to pity.

                                 WENDELL
                        Do you know what you’re doing?

           ON ARDIS: This is business. Pure and simple.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Leaving.

           Ardis walks to the door and EXITS —

           I/E. SELF-DRIVING TAXI - GARFIELD PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           — Ardis SLAMS the door shut as she enters another SELF-
           DRIVING TAXI.

                                 SELF-DRIVING TAXI (VOICE)
                        Good evening! Please place your 
                        eyes in front of the screen to 
                        confirm your identity.

           ON ARDIS: What did he expect from her? She’s no different 
           from anyone else trying to make a living in a fucked up 
           world.

           She leans forward, putting her eyes in front of the screen.
                                 SELF-DRIVING TAXI (VOICE) (CONT’D)
                        Ardis Varnado. Where would you like 
                        to go this evening?

           EXT. BENEATH NORTH AVENUE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The taxi leaves Ardis off at a desolate area beneath the 
           North Avenue Bridge.

           In the distance, the tall buildings of downtown gleam in the 
           moonlight.

           Her taxi drives off, as from the opposite direction she hears 
           the SOUND OF TIRES ON DIRT —

           — And turns to see an ENORMOUS BLACK SUV approaching.

           The SUV’s windows are tinted. Bullet-proof glass. Doors and 
           roof are armored.

           The SUV comes to a stop, and TWO BODYGUARDS — Chinese, 
           professional — get out.

                                 ARDIS
                        I have an appointment with Mr. 
                        Wing.

                                 BODYGUARD #1
                        Turn around.

           Ardis hands her case to one of the bodyguards, while the 
           other one PATS HER DOWN...

           ... They don’t find a weapon, but they do find her wallet and 
           phone.

                                 BODYGUARD #2
                        No phones.

           Bodyguard #2 holds on to Ardis’ case and phone, while 
           Bodyguard #1 takes out a SPIKE from his jacket.

           Bodyguard #1 holds his spike beside Ardis’ head.

                                 ARDIS
                        Couldn’t you guys use a metal 
                        detector or something?

                                 BODYGUARD #1
                        Ready?

           ON ARDIS: “Yeah.”
                                 BODYGUARD #1 (CONT’D)
                        Are you wearing a wire?

           Before she can answer, the Bodyguard INSERTS THE SPIKE INTO 
           HER BRAIN —

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: Getting dressed in the morning, we catch a glimpse of 
           ourself in the mirror —

           — We’re Ardis, half-clothed, and we have no wires, recording 
           devices, or weapons in sight.

                                   BACK TO THE BRIDGE:

           Ardis’ eyes flutter as the memory leaves her brain.

           The Bodyguard takes the spike and places it against the head 
           of his partner —

           — Then INJECTS ARDIS’ MEMORY INTO BODYGUARD #2.

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: We — Ardis — glimpse ourself in the mirror, half-
           clothed, no wires or weapons.

                                   BACK TO THE BRIDGE:

           Bodyguard #1 pulls the memory right back out of Bodyguard 
           #2’s head.

           ON BODYGUARD #2: A little woozy.

                                 BODYGUARD #2
                        She’s clean.

           BODYGUARD #1 USHERS Ardis into —

           INT. ARMORED SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Ardis slides into the back of the SUV, where she meets:

           MR LARRY WING — 29, Chinese, Australian accent, the confident 
           young heir to a massive criminal empire.

           His armored SUV is equipped with TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAYS, a 
           HALF KITCHEN — a family of 5 could live back here for a week.

           Bodyguard #1 hands Larry Wing the freshly removed mem of 
           Ardis getting dressed.
                                 LARRY WING
                             (re: mem vial)
                        You want this back?

                                 ARDIS
                        I’ve seen it before.

           Wing POURS THE MEM into the sink. Washes it away, the orange 
           liquid swirling in the drain.

                                 LARRY WING
                        You could’ve bought spikes or Tetra 
                        from any of my guys.

                                 ARDIS
                        Word on the street is that you’re 
                        expanding.

                                 LARRY WING
                        ... What have you heard? Those 
                        words on the street?

                                 ARDIS
                        That you’re on the cusp of 
                        something big. New crews, new 
                        transpo lines... You know exactly 
                        how much money I’m bringing in for 
                        you, Mr. Wing. I think it’s time I 
                        moved off the street and up to a 
                        position that’s a little more — 
                        appropriate.

           ON WING: Considering her proposition.

                                 LARRY WING
                        “Appropriate...”
                             (thinks)
                        Do you know, when my father first 
                        told me that he wanted to expand 
                        the family business into mems, I 
                        was against it. High barrier to 
                        entry, inelastic supply.

                                 ARDIS
                        Is that what they said at Wharton?

                                 LARRY WING
                        Hong Kong School of Business. But 
                        then your government made it 
                        illegal — and suddenly we were in a 
                        position to corner the market on a 
                        disruptive technology. We have the 
                        potential to be corrugated steel in

                        To be color television in 1950. 
                        Ardis, it is 1980, and this could 
                        be crack cocaine!
                             (beat)
                        Which means I need to be very 
                        careful about who I entrust with a 
                        management position. There is no 
                        place for anyone... Unreliable.

           ON ARDIS: What does he mean by that?

                                 LARRY WING (CONT’D)
                        If I checked, how much Tetra would 
                        I find in your bloodstream right 
                        now?

           ON ARDIS: Fuck.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m quitting.

           ON WING: Yes, yes. He’s heard that before.

                                 LARRY WING
                        I’m grateful to Zeke for bringing 
                        you into my organization. You’re 
                        the best salesman I have — so when 
                        you start conducting yourself like 
                        a professional, we can have a 
                        conversation about your 
                        professional future.

           ON ARDIS: This is not a man to whom one presses an argument. 
           He can have her killed anytime he wants, for any reason.

           She opens the door —

           EXT. BENEATH NORTH AVENUE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Ardis exits the armored SUV —

           — And Bodyguard #1 hands her back her phone and her case.

           ON ARDIS: She’s going to quit. Any day now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           A woman we’ll come to know as DEA SPECIAL AGENT LUCIA DIAZ — 
           30s, the modern face of graduate-educated, hyper-professional 
           federal law enforcement — walks through the hotel lobby.
           She carries a PAPER COFFEE CUP.

           The lobby is pretty sparse at this hour, but Agent Diaz finds 
           a UNIFORMED COP talking to the CONCIERGE.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (to Cop)
                        I’m looking for the senior 
                        detective on the scene?

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                        Upstairs. 
                             (re: coffee cup)
                        Did you get him his almond milk?

           Agent Diaz just sighs and heads to the ELEVATOR BANK.

           She enters an elevator —

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - HALLWAYS - SECONDS LATER

           — And then exits onto the top floor.

           She walks down the hall and enters —

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - LUXURY SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           — Based on the wallpaper and the fixtures, we recognize this 
           as the same luxury suite in which we first saw Ardis and her 
           new client Richard Fitzgerald...

           ... Only as Agent Diaz enters, we see that now it’s SWARMING 
           WITH COPS.

           An EVIDENCE TEAM takes prints, scanning glass surfaces with 
           IR beams.

           Agent Diaz flashes her badge, moving past the cops and into 
           the bedroom, where she finds a CPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE — 60s, 
           son of a son of an Irishman — standing over the bed.

           REVEAL:

           There’s a dead body on the bed.

           Blood sprayed everywhere.

           ON THE BODY: It’s Richard Fitzgerald.

           Two gunshots to the chest.
                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (to Homicide Detective)
                        Are you the senior detective?

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                             (re: coffee cup)
                        Thank you, sweetheart. 

           He takes the cup from her hand, sips.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t almond milk.

           In response, Agent Diaz flashes her BADGE.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Special Agent Diaz. DEA. I’m gonna
                        need control of the scene.

           The Homicide Detective gives her a once-over.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        I don’t see that happening.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (to Forensics Tech)
                        ... What’s your name?

                                 FORENSICS TECH
                        Pete.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Pete, what happened to the dead guy 
                        on the bed?

                                 FORENSICS TECH
                        He got murdered.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        My detective’s intuition tells me 
                        this might be a murder scene. Did 
                        you recover the weapon?

           The Forensics Tech hands her a GUN IN A PLASTIC EVIDENCE BAG.

           ON THE GUN: It’s identical to the one from Ardis’ case.

                                 FORENSICS TECH
                        We ran the prints. They belong to a 
                        mem dealer named —

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        — ”Ardis Varnado.” Low level. 
                        Couple busts, no jail time.

                             (off their looks)
                        When you ran the prints, it lit up 
                        my desk. Because if you scroll down 
                        her sheet, you’ll see she’s a KA of 
                        one Larry Wing.

           The Forensics Tech does just that on his tablet — and sees 
           that Diaz is correct.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        “Larry Wing” — as in, the Wing 
                        family?

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Larry Wing is the target of a 
                        major, long-time DEA operation. I 
                        have permission from DOJ to roll up 
                        your murder into my op.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        What’s the status of your op?

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Classified.
                             (re: the other cops)
                        How many of these guys do you 
                        trust? Because I don’t know them.
                             (off his look)
                        I’m not trying to jam you up, and 
                        I’m not trying to say my dick is 
                        bigger. It isn’t. But if Larry Wing 
                        finds out she murdered a client, he 
                        will put her in the river by 
                        morning — and then you’ve got two 
                        bodies on your docket. Or you can 
                        make this shit-show my problem.

           ON THE HOMICIDE DETECTIVE: What’s he gonna do?

           The Detective hands her back the coffee cup.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                             (to Forensics Tech)
                        Pete? Enjoy your night.

           Diaz and Pete the Forensics Tech eye each other warily.

           The Homicide Detective walks to the door, passing the 
           windows.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE (CONT’D)

                        Oh, and FYI... You got flies on 
                        your shit.
           Ardis freezes, the image of Richard Fitzgerald inches from 
           her face.

           She turns up the volume —

                                 LOCAL NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
                        ... Richard Fitzgerald, a local 
                        investment banker, was found 
                        murdered this evening at the Palmer 
                        House Hotel.

           ON ARDIS: What the fuck?

                                 LOCAL NEWSCASTER (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        Our sources with the police say 
                        that the mem byproduct Tetralazine
                        was found in Fitzgerald’s blood 
                        stream.

           ON THE TV: More drone footage of the hotel. A replay of Agent

                        illicit businesses surrounding them 
                        have —

                                 SELF-DRIVING TAXI (VOICE)
                        Good evening! Please place —

           Ardis quickly GETS OUT OF THE TAXI —

           EXT. NORTH AVENUE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           Walking quickly away from the taxi, she pulls out her phone 
           and makes an encrypted call...

           ... The line on the other end RINGS, but no one answers.

                                 ARDIS
                             (into phone)
                        Zeke. The client you sent to me is 
                        dead. What the fuck is happening? 
                        Call me. ... No, fuck it, I’m 
                        coming over.

           She hangs up.

           ON ARDIS: Whatever is going on, it is very, very bad.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT BUILDING - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

           Outside Ardis’ apartment building, a SWAT TEAM POURS out of a 
           VAN —

           — They take positions by the front door —

           — Agent Diaz, in tactical gear, forms the point of the 
           tactical phalanx —

           — And on Diaz’s HAND SIGNAL —

           — The SWAT team follows her into the building —

           INT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           — Flooding through the lobby and around the elevators —

           INT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

           — Before using a BATTERING RAM to knock down Ardis’ door —

           INT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT - MAIN AREA - CONTINUOUS

           — And then BURSTING into Ardis’ apartment.

           Diaz and the SWAT team spread through the room, guns leading 
           the way...

           ... But they find few signs of life...

           ... Save all of Ardis’ MEM VIALS by the couch.

           Diaz looks over the empty vials — there’s a lot of them.

           ON DIAZ: She picks up a vial, staring at it. Her suspect 
           isn’t just a dealer — she’s also a user.

           DING! The sound of a new VOICE MESSAGE appears on all of 
           Ardis’ interconnected DEVICES. (TV, computer, etc — in the 
           near future you’ll be able to read text messages on your 
           microwave screen if you want to.)

           Diaz HITS PLAY on one of the appliances.

                                 DEVICE (VOICE)
                        Message from: Zeke Gerry.

                                 ZEKE (VOICE)
                        Ardis! Did you fucking kill that 
                        guy? What is wrong with you? 
                                 (MORE)
                        Look, I don’t care what you did but 
                        you better not fucking come here.

           The message clicks off.

           ON DIAZ: She pulls out her TABLET and scrolls down Ardis’ 
           police file, finding her known-associate “Zeke Gerry...”

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - WEST LOOP - NIGHT

           The West Loop is full of people at this hour. The crowded 
           bars spilling out into the streets.

           Ardis moves quickly through the crowd, finding her way to 
           Zeke’s SIX-STORY APARTMENT BUILDING.

           She enters —

           INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           — Climbs the central stairwell to the fourth floor —

           — KNOCKS on Zeke’s door —

           — But the door SWINGS OPEN at her touch.

           ON ARDIS: That’s strange.

                                 ARDIS
                        Zeke?

           She enters —

           INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - ZEKE’S APARTMENT

           The apartment is low-end cool, red-brick walls, Bohemian chic 
           — but even in the dark, Ardis can see that...

           ... It’s been TOTALLY RANSACKED.
           ... The only light coming from the open fridge door and the 
           twinkle of the city through the windows...

           ... Ardis moves through the LIVING ROOM...

           ... Past the KITCHEN...

           ... And finally in the BEDROOM...

           ... The bed is overturned... Nightstands upside down...

           ... An odd, black splotch on the white wall...

           ... Ardis FLICKS ON THE LIGHT SWITCH:

           REVEAL: The wall behind her head is sprayed with blood.

           ON ARDIS: She doesn’t see it yet, slowly looking around 
           and...

           ... She tries not to gasp.

           She moves toward the bloody wall, to the other side of the 
           bed...

           ... And finds ZEKE’S BODY on the floor.

           His face has been TORN UP, eyes poked out with something 
           sharp. Throat punctured.

           Next to his body is a BLOOD-SOAKED SPIKE.

           ON ARDIS: Holy fuck, somebody murdered him with his own 
           spike.

           But she quickly gets herself together: Time to think fast.

           She pats down his bloody corpse.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your phone...

           But it’s not on him.

           She looks around the room —

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        ... Where did you put your phone...

           — But no luck.

           All she finds is a TABLET that dropped beneath the 
           nightstand.
                                 ARDIS
                        Delivery!

           INSIDE THE LOCKED APARTMENT:

           We see an OLD WOMAN peek out the key hole at Ardis — whose 
           friendly smile is not exactly convincing.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Bullshit.

           ON THE SIXTH FLOOR LANDING:

           Ardis turns away — but there’s nowhere else for her to go.

           ON THE FOURTH FLOOR LANDING:

           Diaz gets to Zeke’s door, notices it’s open.

           She draws her gun...

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        DEA! I’m coming in.

           INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - ZEKE’S APARTMENT

           Diaz enters...

           ... Sweeping the dark apartment for signs of life...

           INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL

           Ardis takes this opportunity to DASH DOWN THE STAIRS —

           — Past the fourth floor landing —

           INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - ZEKE’S APARTMENT

           — Diaz is staring at Zeke’s dead body when she hears the 
           CREAK OF FLOORBOARDS from the stairwell —

           — Diaz turns and runs to the stairs —

           INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL

           — Ardis keeps running down the stairs, now on the third floor 
           landing —

           — Diaz comes out onto the fourth floor landing, gun leading 
           the way, looks down —
           — And sees...

           ... A UNIFORMED COP LOOKING UP FROM THE GROUND FLOOR.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (calling down stairwell)
                        Did anyone come down?

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

           The Uniformed Cop looks up — sees the gun in Diaz’s hand.

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                             (re: gun)
                        What’s wrong?

           The Cop DRAWS HIS GUN TOO.

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:

           Ardis freezes. Neither Diaz nor the Cop can see her. She’s 
           trying not to make a sound.

           ON THE FOURTH FLOOR:

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (calling down stairs)
                        Stay down!

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                        Do you need back-up?

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:

           Ardis has no weapon and there’s a cop above, a cop below. 
           What can she do?

           ON THE FOURTH FLOOR:

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Officer, I’ve got a body up here, I 
                        need you to seal the exits.

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

                                 UNIFORMED COP
                        A body? O’Connor has the door, you 
                        need back-up.

           He starts walking up the stairs...

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:
           Ardis tries to quietly retreat up the stairs...

           ON THE FOURTH FLOOR:

           ... But Diaz, pissed, starts walking down the stairs...

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:

           ... Ardis is completely trapped...

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

           ... The Uniformed Cop is getting closer to Ardis...

           ON THE FOURTH FLOOR:

           ... Diaz is getting closer from the other end...

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:

           ... Ardis can’t go up, can’t go down...

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

           ... The Uniformed Cop is rounding the corner to Ardis’ 
           landing...

           ON THE FOURTH FLOOR:

           ... Diaz is feet away herself...

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:

           ... Ardis has to do something...

           ... So she...

           ... LEAPS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE STAIRWELL.

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

           ARDIS USES HER CASE TO BREAK HER FALL —

           — As she LANDS with a painful THUD a story below the Cop.

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:

           The Uniformed Cop turns at the sound.

           ON THE FOURTH FLOOR:

           So does Diaz.

           Both Diaz and the Cop RACE down the stairs...
           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

           Ardis picks herself up, dazed and bruised from the fall —

           — Grabs her case —

           — Just as the Uniformed Cop arrives —

           — But Ardis KNOCKS the gun from his hand —

           — And with a quick, expert SET OF MOVES SHE SENDS HIM TO THE 
           FLOOR with a broken shin —

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR:

           Diaz leaps down the stairs two at a time —

           ON THE FIRST FLOOR:

           — As Ardis takes off down the back of the hall, toward the 
           rear of the building —

           — Diaz gets to the first floor, trains her gun at Ardis —

           — Who finally makes it to the rear door just as —

           — The door OPENS FROM THE OUTSIDE, REVEALING:

           — The SECOND UNIFORMED COP, inches from Ardis’ face.

           Ardis spins around —

           — But there’s Diaz, gun pointed at Ardis from the other end 
           of the hallway —

           — So Ardis turns back to the Second Uniformed Cop and, as 
           he’s drawing his gun, she —

           — PUSHES HIM OUT INTO —

           EXT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           — Ardis and the Second Uniformed Cop TUMBLE out into the 
           alley —

           — Where Ardis SWINGS HER CASE AT THE DOORKNOB BEHIND HER —

           — Breaking it off, ruining the mechanism so the door can’t 
           open.
           INT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Inside, Diaz runs to the door, struggles with the knob —

           — No luck —

           — So she KICKS the door —

           — But it won’t budge. The fucker is made of steel.

           EXT. ZEKE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - BACK ALLEY - SAME TIME

           Ardis uses her case to KNOCK THE GUN from the Second Uniform 
           Cop’s hand —

           — But as they struggle he KICKS her case —

           — SMASHING IT OPEN on the pavement —

           — VIALS and SPIKES clattering to the ground —

           — As the Second Uniformed Cop and Ardis FIGHT.

           Finally, she’s able to get the gun out of his hand and DRAG 
           HIM TO THE GROUND —

           — Pressing his face to the pavement while she holds his arm 
           behind his back, a knee against his shoulder-blades.

           ON ARDIS: She needs to take him out of the picture.

           She reaches across the pavement and grabs the Cop’s gun —

           — Which she presses against the back of his skull.

           ON ARDIS: She doesn’t want to kill him.

           Is there any other way to incapacitate him?

           Yes, there is.

           She drops the gun and REACHES FOR HER SPIKE —

           — And with one hand loads it with the FIRST VIAL SHE FINDS —

           — Then, holding him down with her knee, she FORCIBLY INJECTS 
           THE MEMORY INTO THE BACK OF THE COP’S HEAD.

           ON THE COP: Struggling, but can’t move.

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:
           POV: In a rooftop pool, a HANDSOME MAN glides over to us and 
           playfully lifts our bikini top over our head... 

                                    BACK TO THE ALLEY:

           Ardis holds the Cop still while continuing to inject the 
           memory...

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: We begin to HAVE SEX with the Handsome Man, but as we 
           look down at the water we briefly glimpse our reflection...

           ... REVEAL: We have become the Second Uniformed Cop.

           We can see that our hands are now the Cop’s as we grab for 
           the Handsome Man, tugging him closer, passionately...

                                    BACK TO THE ALLEY:

           ON THE SECOND UNIFORMED COP: An odd peacefulness taking over 
           his face as the memory bonds with his consciousness.

           Ardis stands, leaving the syringe stuck in the Cop’s head.

           He MOANS and WIGGLES as his brain soaks in the memory, but he 
           doesn’t get up.

           Ardis looks around: At one end of the alley is a BUSY STREET. 
           At the other end is a WOODEN FENCE.

           Ardis turns to the busy street —

           — But Agent Diaz appears at the lip of the alleyway.

           ON ARDIS: Fuck.

           She spins and RUNS to the wooden fence, starts to climb —

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Stop!

           — Diaz runs closer —

           — But as Ardis gets to the top of the fence —

           — Diaz stops running, points her gun at Ardis —

           — Ardis, at the top of fence, looks Diaz right in the eyes.

                                 AGENT DIAZ (CONT’D)
                        Ardis Varnado!

                        Warrant came through for the 
                        traffic cams.

           Diaz turns to find the Forensics Tech handing her a TABLET.

           ON THE TABLET: Live feeds from TRAFFIC CAMS all over the 
           city. The cams are automatically performing AI-based FACIAL 
           RECOGNITION on the feeds, hunting for Ardis’ face.

                        She walks in front of a red light — 
                        buenas noches.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        What about me made you think you 
                        should say that in Spanish?

                             (she’s fucking with him)
                        Relájate, amigo.

           She turns her attention back to the tablet.

           ON THE TABLET: Traffic cam footage of PEDESTRIANS walking 
           around Chicago at night...

           Their faces getting SCANNED by the software... 

           TRAFFIC CAM FOOTAGE:

           A desolate street, on which a solitary pedestrian shuffles 
           along, the person’s face tilted down, away from the camera...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER - EAST RANDOLPH - SAME TIME

           The same street, where we REVEAL:

           The pedestrian is Ardis. As she walks quickly, she keeps her 
           head down to avoid detection by the traffic cams.

           As she gets to the edge of the river, she starts to slow. 
           Takes long, deep breaths as she collects her bearings.

           Takes a long look over the churning black water below.

           ON ARDIS: She is so fucked.
           But just as she starts to get her breath back —

           — TWO DRONES ZOOM OVERHEAD.

           Ardis DUCKS, turning away from their cams. 

           She looks up: The drones keep flying. They didn’t spot her.

           Not this time.

           ON ARDIS: She’s gotta get off the street.

           INT. BATHROOM - DIVE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ardis bursts into a DIVE BAR’S single-occupancy bathroom, 
           locking the door behind her.

           She reaches into her jacket pocket and takes out...

           ... Her phone.

           Tosses it into the toilet.

           Reaches down and takes out...

           ... Her wallet. ID, credit cards.

           Tosses them into the toilet. No use for any of those.

           Reaches one more time and finds...

           ... Her spike.

           She stares at it. Checks the loaded vial, shaking it to see 
           if there’s any more liquid inside — there isn’t.

           ON ARDIS: Should she throw the spike out?

           No — instead, she sits down on the closed toilet lid...

           ... And with a deep breath, she places the spike to the back 
           of her own skull, preparing to pull a mem.

           ON ARDIS: Closes her eyes, thinks very carefully about what 
           she wants to remove.

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: We stare at the gruesome sight of Zeke’s dead body.

                                 RETURN TO THE BATHROOM:

           Ardis pulls the memory from her head —
                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: The horrific image fades into white nothingness...

                                 RETURN TO THE BATHROOM:

           ON ARDIS: Finishes pulling the mem from her head, lays down 
           the spike with a woozy sigh of relief.

           It’s gonna be okay. If she doesn’t remember it, it never 
           happened.

           So what now?

           EXT. STATE ST BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Ardis walks over the STATE STREET BRIDGE.

           She’s keeping her head low, eyes on her feet.

           TRAFFIC CAM FOOTAGE:

           Ardis walking across the bridge — but the cam can’t make out 
           her face.

           EXT. LOFT BUILDING - WICKER PARK - NIGHT

           Ardis walks through Wicker Park to a LOFT BUILDING. It’s a 
           four-story former factory turned into something between an 
           artist’s commune and a 24-hour rave.

           She enters —

           INT. LOFT BUILDING - WICKER PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, TATTOOED ARTISTS are smoking and drinking in the 
           halls. Some are 15, some are 50, everybody is fucked up.

           Ardis walks the halls, past all of the various loft spaces, 
           all the doors open as everyone lives here communally —

           — She moves through the debaucherous tableau and into —

           INT. LOFT BUILDING - 2ND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           On the 2nd Floor, a bunch of FUCKED UP KIDS notice Ardis, who 
           doesn’t really belong — 

           — but that said, no one else does either.
                                 ARDIS
                        Where’s Nev?

           The kids stare at her, sizing her up: Who is she?

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        ... Do I look like a fucking cop?

           ON THE KIDS: Well, no...

           Ardis walks around the loft, past MORE KIDS...

           But no luck until —

                                 GIRL WITH MANY PIERCINGS
                        The fuck do you want with Nev?

                                 ARDIS
                        Where is he?

           The Girl With Many Piercings instinctively LOOKS DOWN A 
           HALLWAY, then tries to hide it.

                                 GIRL WITH MANY PIERCINGS
                        I don’t know.

           Ardis brushes past her to the hallway —

                                 GIRL WITH MANY PIERCINGS (CONT’D)
                        You better not be a cop!

           DOWN THE HALLWAY:

           Ardis comes to a quiet corner where she finds who she’s 
           looking for:

           NEV COLE — early 20s, but he’s bought and sold three 
           lifetimes worth of memories. His grip on reality is... loose.

                                 ARDIS
                        I need cash. A burner. Prepaid

                        Since when do I owe you a favor?

           Suddenly, a CRASH from downstairs. Somebody dropped a bottle.

           Nev JUMPS. Scared.

                                 ARDIS
                        Settle down, tough guy.
                                 NEV
                        Been jumpy ever since I got back.

                                 ARDIS
                        Syria?

                                 NEV
                        Yeah.

                                 ARDIS
                        Nev. You were never in fucking 
                        Syria.

                                 NEV
                        Bullshit.

                                 ARDIS
                        Car bomb, right? Kills the guy next 
                        to you? Blood and pieces of 
                        intestine all over your helmet?

           ON NEV: Yeah...

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        A marine got rid of that one. I 
                        bought it, sold it to you. Because 
                        you grew up in Highland Park and 
                        you always wanted to know what it 
                        was really like in the shit.

           ON NEV: Was he really never in Syria? The memory feels so 
           real.

           He looks around, touches the wall, the window, trying to 
           remind himself of what’s real.

                        — Cash, burner, cards. I don’t have

                        — Wrong again. I sold you that 
                        memory for two grand.

           ON NEV: No way.

                                 NEV
                        Serious?

           ON ARDIS: “Serious.”

                                 NEV (CONT’D)
                             (sadly)

                        Caitlin?

           INT. LOFT BUILDING - WICKER PARK - MINUTES LATER

           Ardis walks back down the hall as she slips some PREPAID 
           CREDIT CARDS, a BURNER PHONE, and a GUN into her jacket 
           pockets.

           She walks past the Girl With Many Piercings, who looks down 
           the hall, then back to Ardis suspiciously.

                                 GIRL WITH MANY PIERCINGS
                        ... WHAT’RE YOU DOING WITH MY 
                        BOYFRIEND?!

           ON ARDIS: Did she lie? Sure. But what’s real anyway?

           EXT. CITY STREETS - LOGAN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Ardis moves through the crowded streets, keeping her head 
           down —

           — When TWO DRONES FLY OVERHEAD —

           — Ardis SPINS into an alley to avoid them —

           — And the drones keep flying straight ahead.
           ON ARDIS: That was close.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COCKTAIL BAR - LOGAN SQUARE - NIGHT

           Mason ENTERTAINS a BACHELORETTE PARTY of YOUNG WOMEN at an 
           elegant cocktail bar. Penis hats, pink sashes, the whole 
           thing.

                                 MASON
                        ... Yesterday is history, tomorrow 
                        is a mystery, but today is a gift — 
                        and that’s why we call it the 
                        present. But you know what? I can 
                        give you yesterday too. 20% off.

           As the girls leans in, intrigued, the BARTENDER hands Mason 
           another drink.

                                 BARTENDER
                        From the woman at the end of the 
                        bar.

           Mason looks: There is no lady at the end of the bar.

           He looks down at the drink, and finds a message written on 
           the napkin:

           “MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM”

                                 MASON
                             (to Bartender)
                        The lady at the end of the bar... 
                        Was she attractive?

           INT. COCKTAIL BAR - MEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mason enters the MEN’S ROOM —

           — And someone SLAMS him against the wall —

           — Locking the door behind them.

           He turns and we REVEAL:

           It’s Ardis.

                                 MASON
                        ... Christ! Okay I’m glad you’re 
                        here, I’ve got a group of young 
                        ladies who —
                                 ARDIS
                        — This morning, I get a call from 
                        Zeke. Had a new client, thinks I 
                        might be able to hook the guy up. I 
                        do. Now the client is dead. And so 
                        is Zeke.

                                 MASON
                        What? Christ... He owes me money.

                                 ARDIS
                        Somebody is setting me up. I need 
                        you to help me figure out who.

                                 MASON
                        Ardis, of course. You’re my best 
                        friend and there’s nothing I 
                        wouldn’t do for you.
                             (beat)
                        Are you fucking high? Get out of 
                        here.

                                 ARDIS
                        I know you have a CPD source. Get 
                        me a copy of the police file.

                                 MASON
                        No.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’ll give you half my clients.

                                 MASON
                        If Zeke’s dead and you’re in jail, 
                        I’ll get all your clients.

           ON ARDIS: There is something kind of perversely pure about 
           Mason’s unabashed commitment to his self-interest.

           Time to try another tack.

                                 ARDIS
                        If the cops find me, they’re going 
                        to start looking for my accomplice.

                        You are my known associate. You got 
                        me staked in the business. 
                        Witnesses saw us together tonight.

                        No one saw us together tonight.

                                 ARDIS
                        I walk out that door and make eyes 
                        at the bartender again — and yeah, 
                        somebody has.

                        you’ll tell the cops I did?

           ON ARDIS: Bingo.

                        were right not to trust me.

           FOOTAGE of the city.

           ON THE TABLET: Various WOMEN crossing intersections are

                             (re: “conniption”)
                        Is CPD homicide entirely staffed by 
                        the elderly?

                                 ASAC THORNE
                        You roll into town, set up shop on 
                        some top-secret op against Larry 
                        Wing, fine. But now that op entails 
                        taking over one of their 
                        investigations, spending all night 
                        chasing a low-level dealer who was 
                        dumb enough to pop a civilian — it 
                        does beg a certain question.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        What’s the question?

                        Neither do I. But they are rabid 
                        fucking dogs, and unless you toss 
                        them a little meat, they are gonna
                        growl.

                        Last week, we intercepted chatter 
                        in Shenzen. A courier is being sent 
                        to Chicago — with some very high-
                        value information in his head.

                        What information does the courier 
                        have?

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        If I knew that, I wouldn’t be out 
                        here looking for him.

           ON THORNE: Taking stock of Diaz. Putting it together.

                        So your plan is to grab this

                        bullshit immunity on a murder beef,

                        Couple years back, Larry Wing pops 
                        up in Chicago. The little psycho is

                        street guys, new hire — guy starts 
                        ratting. Good intel... Until Wing 
                        checks the guy’s memories. Guy 
                        comes back with his cock cut off, 
                        balls sewn into his open mouth. 
                        Even if you find this girl — even 
                        if by some miracle she can lead you 
                        to the courier — what anatomical 
                        impossibility do you think Larry 
                        Wing will perform on her?

           ON DIAZ: Is she playing a fast and loose game with Ardis’ 
           life? Yes.

           But the stakes are worth it.

                        If she can take me to the courier — 
                        then I don’t a shit what Wing does 
                        to her.

                        manhunt for some street dealer who 
                        they’ll try to use against you.

           ON LARRY: He’s fucked this up, and he knows it. But he can 
           still lead the family to glory.
           The Security Chief sighs. Looks at his collection of weapons.

                                 SECURITY CHIEF
                        If you are looking for her, then so 
                        are the Shays. Your father would 
                        like to make quite sure that we 
                        kill her before they do.
                             (to Bodyguard #1)
                        Why don’t we take young Mr Wing 
                        home? I’ll continue my long 
                        tradition of cleaning up after him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. 24-HOUR DINER - ROOSEVELT ROAD - NIGHT

           Ardis sits alone at a back booth in a 24-hour diner.

           She cradles a cup of coffee, keeping her head down, trying 
           not to attract notice from the other patrons.

           Every booth is equipped with its own TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY on 
           the wall, for ordering, displaying ads, putting songs on the 
           jukebox.

           ON THE DINER DISPLAY: Nightly news photos of Richard 
           Fitzgerald... And a photo of Ardis.

           Ardis stares at her photo on the news — the curious sensation 
           of watching herself on a TV.

                                 MASON (O.S.)
                        Sweetheart, you are done for.

           Ardis looks up as Mason slides into the seat across from her.

                                 ARDIS
                        What’d you get?

                                 MASON
                        You’re welcome.

           He takes out his PHONE, shows her the POLICE FILE on his 
           screen.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Your missing gun? Well, it fired 
                        two bullets into Richard 
                        Fitzgerald. And then was found 
                        beside his body. With your prints 
                        on it.
                                 ARDIS
                        So someone stole my gun. Knew when 
                        I was meeting with Richard. Went in 
                        after.

                                 MASON
                        And then this person also stabbed 
                        our friend Zeke to death with his 
                        own spike?

                                 ARDIS
                        Richard was a first-timer. Zeke was 
                        the only person who knew when and 
                        where we were meeting — so the 
                        killer must have been trying to 
                        cover his tracks.

                                 MASON
                        Maybe — but this wasn’t Richard 
                        Fitzgerald’s first time.

                                 ARDIS
                        What?

           Mason shows her CHEMICAL DATA in the file.

                                 MASON
                        Decayed Tetralazine in his system. 
                        Enough for three lifetimes worth of 
                        memories. Richard’s brain had been 
                        rewired six-ways-from-Sunday before 
                        you ever got to him.

           ON ARDIS: What the fuck?

                                 ARDIS
                        He told me it was his first time.

                                 MASON
                        Ardis Varnado, are you suggesting 
                        that someone using illegal 
                        narcotics lied about it? Heavens.

                                 ARDIS
                        I know how to read a client, okay? 
                        He wasn’t lying. Somebody removed 
                        his memories — of removing his 
                        memories.

                                 MASON
                        Why?

                                 ARDIS
                        ... I don’t know.
                                 MASON
                        May I propose a simpler 
                        explanation?

                                 ARDIS
                        Who do you think killed Richard?

           ON MASON: Stares at her. “You.”

           ON ARDIS: “No... No. No. No. No.”

                                 MASON
                        People do things.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m not saying I’m a saint. But I 
                        am not a killer.

                                 MASON
                        You’re a fucking drug dealer whose 
                        brain is half-full of the illegally 
                        obtained memories of strangers.

                                 ARDIS
                        I met Richard at the hotel. Made 
                        the sale. And then I left.

                                 MASON
                        Are you sure?

                                 ARDIS
                             (she’s not)
                        Yes.

                                 MASON
                        Just like you were sure you it was 
                        you on the beach?

           ON ARDIS: “Cheap shot.”

                                 ARDIS
                        Why would I kill a man I’d never 
                        met before?

                                 MASON
                        Maybe you had. Maybe you two shared 
                        something that neither of you 
                        wanted to remember.

                                 ARDIS
                        So I removed my memory of murdering 
                        him? And Zeke?
                                 MASON
                        You’re right — you would never
                        respond to an unpleasant situation 
                        by rewiring your brain.

           ON ARDIS: Did she do this? Could she do this?

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        I suggest Mexico, then Ecuador, 
                        then I don’t —

                                 ARDIS
                        — No.

                                 MASON
                        “No”?

                                 ARDIS
                        If Wing thinks I killed a client — 
                        a civilian — that will not be good 
                        for business. He’ll find me. 
                        Anywhere.
                             (beat)
                        The only way out of this alive is 
                        to clear my name.

                                 MASON
                        ... When I met you, you were 
                        detoxing so hard that you didn’t 
                        know up from down. You’d pulled so 
                        many of your own mems that your 
                        brain was swiss cheese. Filled it 
                        with god knows what. You’ve been 
                        spiking on and off ever since. I’m 
                        not sure that you’re the most... 
                        capable person for determining the 
                        truth.

           ON ARDIS: Is this really all she is? A fucked up, unreliable 
           addict?

                                 ARDIS
                        I can do this, Mason. I have to.

           ON MASON: Is there a part of him that actually... likes her?

           EXT. 24-HOUR DINER - ROOSEVELT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Ardis and Mason exit the diner, heads low to avoid cameras.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Whoever set me up had to know 
                        exactly when I was meeting Richard. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARDIS (CONT'D)
                        And where. The killer had to be 
                        connected to me — to Richard — and 
                        to Zeke.
                             (beat)
                        So what’s the connection?

                                 MASON
                        The only two people who would know 
                        are unhelpfully dead.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... There’s someone else who might 
                        know how we’re connected.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - GOLD COAST - NIGHT

           Richard Fitzgerald’s HOUSE is as tasteful and elegant as the 
           tree-lined street on which it lies.

           Ardis and Richard approach from the darkness, finding the 
           name “FITZGERALD” on the mailbox.

           They look up at the house: A light on upstairs.

                                 MASON
                        I don’t imagine the Lady Fitzgerald 
                        will be keen to help you out.

           In response, Ardis produces the GUN she got from Nev.

                                 ARDIS
                        Wait here.

                                 MASON
                        I’m glad to see we’re finally 
                        embracing the outlaw lifestyle.

                                 ARDIS
                        Not exactly.

           She tucks the gun into the front of her pants, in plain 
           sight, the way cops do as she —

           I/E. FITZGERALD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ardis walks right up to the front door and RINGS THE BELL.

           INSIDE:
           EMMA FITZGERALD — 40s, silk nightgown — sits by the side of 
           the bed, unable either to sleep or to stop her crying. This 
           is the worst night of her life.

           Emma’s heartsick reverie bursts at the sound of the bell.

           Confused, she goes downstairs to investigate.

           OUTSIDE:

           Ardis waits as Emma OPENS THE DOOR.

           Ardis and Emma get a good long look at each other...

           ... Nope. No recognition. They’ve never met.

           But Emma cannot fail to notice the gun at Ardis’ waist.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m Detective Lynne. May I come in?

           Emma instantly softens and lets Ardis in —

           INT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           — As they enter, Emma CLOSES the door behind them.

           Locks it.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        Your colleague said the evidence 
                        team was coming.

                                 ARDIS
                        That’s right.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        In the morning.

                                 ARDIS
                        This case is a priority.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        Sorry, do you want some coffee or 
                        something?

                                 ARDIS
                        That’d be great.

           Ardis follows Emma into —
           INT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Emma starts making coffee from a near-future version of those 
           (detestable) Keurig machines.

                                 ARDIS
                        I hate to ask this, Mrs. 
                        Fitzgerald, but did your husband 
                        ever inject mems before?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        Are you kidding? I already told the 
                        other detective — err, Agent? My 
                        husband was not that kind of man.

           Emma presses buttons and the machine HUMS and BUZZES, but no 
           actual coffee seems to be coming out.

                                 ARDIS
                        Friends? Relatives? Did he know 
                        people who were users?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        Of course not.

           She keeps fiddling with the frustrating machine. No success.

                                 ARDIS
                        What about you?

           Emma stops. Glares at Ardis.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        Pardon?

                                 ARDIS
                        Did he tell you he was going to the 
                        Palmer House Hotel tonight?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        No.

                                 ARDIS
                        You didn’t know where he was? What 
                        he was doing?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        Let me explain something: Richard 
                        did not do drugs. He did not 
                        consort with people who do drugs. I 
                        tried to get him to smoke pot with 
                        me once and you know what he said? 
                        “

                        It makes me sleepy.” For God’s 
                        sake, my husband was the squarest 
                        man I’d ever met.

           ON ARDIS: Emma is telling the truth. This is a dead end.

           EXT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME TIME

           Outside, Mason watches the house, growing impatient...

           ... When he gets a TEXT MESSAGE...

           ON MASON’S PHONE: “DEA looking for Wing courier. High-value 
           mem. Won’t tell us contents.”

           ON MASON: His CPD source is worth the money he’s getting paid 
           tonight.

           When just then Mason hears a SIREN in the distance...

           ON MASON: Shit.

           He stands up, ready to run...

           ... When the SIREN fades away into the distance.

           Mason looks back up to the windows: Ardis better hurry.

           INT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

           Ardis looks around the kitchen as Emma continues fiddling 
           with the Keurig unit...

           .... When Emma’s PHONE RINGS.

           She ANSWERS and we —

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT - MAIN AREA - SAME TIME

           Agent Diaz is on the other end of the call.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        Mrs. Fitzgerald? It’s Agent Diaz. 
                        Did I wake you?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (into phone)
                        No. Your colleague is here.
                                 (MORE)
           ON ARDIS: Turns from the fridge to Emma. Can’t let herself 
           react to either her name or the calendar.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        I don’t think so.

                                 ARDIS
                             (re: calendar)
                        Mrs. Fitzgerald?

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        Your husband never mentioned her?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (into phone)
                        I’d remember that name. Did Ardis 
                        Varnado kill my husband?

           ON ARDIS: Keeping her face perfectly still.

                                 ARDIS
                             (re: calendar)
                        What is this? UA 457?

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        We have a warrant out for her 
                        arrest.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (into phone)
                        Who is she?

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        We believe that she deals mems.

           ON EMMA: Taking this all in.

           ON ARDIS: Trying not to appear frantic. But she needs to know 
           what those numbers are.

                                 ARDIS
                        Mrs. Fitzgerald, is this a flight 
                        number? Was your husband on an 
                        airplane recently?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (hand over the phone)
                        What? Oh. Yes, that’s just his 
                        flight from Shenzen.
                                 ARDIS
                        Your husband just returned from 
                        Shenzen?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        He goes to Shenzen every month.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        Pardon, what did you say?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (into phone)
                        Oh I was just talking to your 
                        colleague.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        Did you say “Shenzen?”

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (into phone)
                        Yes, my husband goes every month 
                        for work, he just got back — why 
                        are you both asking me this?

                           ARDIS
                                                       AGENT DIAZ
                                                (into phone)
           Was there anything strange 
           about this trip?
                                              Was there anything out of the 
                                              ordinary about this trip?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (both into phone and to 
                              Ardis)
                        No. Like I said, he went every 
                        month. Same flight. Clockwork. He 
                        sent me a loopy email from the 
                        plane this time — I think he took 
                        too much Ambien — but other than 
                        that it was perfectly — You know 
                        what, maybe you two should just 
                        talk to each other if you’re going 
                        to ask me the same questions.

           Emma extends her phone towards Ardis.

           ON ARDIS: Staring at the phone...

           ... How can she talk her way out of this?

                                 ARDIS
                        That’s all right.
                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        Mrs. Fitzgerald, will you put my 
                        colleague on the phone? 

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (to Ardis)
                        She wants to talk to you.

           ON ARDIS: Hand sliding nearer to her gun in case this gets 
           ugly...

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Tell her that CPD homicide sent 
                        me. I have orders to report only to 
                        them.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        My husband is dead and you people 
                        are bickering about some 
                        bureaucratic rule?

                                 ARDIS
                        We’re doing the best we can.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (into phone)
                        She says she can only report to 
                        homicide. 

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                             (into phone)
                        Assholes. 

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (to both Diaz and Ardis)
                        This is insane. You people — is 
                        someone going to figure out who 
                        killed my husband?

                           ARDIS
                                                       AGENT DIAZ
           I’m sorry.
                                                (into phone)
                                              I’m sorry.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m gonna let you get some rest.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                             (into phone)
                        Your colleague is leaving.

                        Tell my “colleague” not to remove 
                        any evidence — I’ll be there in 10 
                        minutes.

           IN THE FITZGERALD HOUSE:

           Emma HANGS UP. Looks at Ardis.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        She’ll be right here.

                                 ARDIS
                        I have to go.

           INT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Emma Fitzgerald shows Ardis to the door.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        Why did Ardis Varnado kill my 
                        husband?

                                 ARDIS
                        I promise you, I’m going to get to 
                        the bottom of what happened 
                        tonight.

           A DING from Emma’s phone.

           Emma looks at it.

           ON THE PHONE SCREEN: A message from Agent Diaz.

           It’s a PHOTO OF ARDIS from her police file.

           And a message: “Do you recognize this woman?”

           ON EMMA: “Holy fuck the woman in front of me is the killer.”

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        ... Excuse me, I forgot something 
                        in the kitchen.

           ON ARDIS: At the door, turning back to look at Emma. Is 
           something going on?

           Emma tries to casually walk back to —
           INT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           In the kitchen, Emma moves to hit REDIAL on her phone... 

           ... When she HEARS A CLICK from the doorway.

                                 ARDIS (O.S.)
                        Don’t do it.

           Emma turns to find Ardis, in the doorway, pointing a gun at 
           her.

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        I don’t have any drugs. I have some 
                        jewelry. Take anything you want.

                                 ARDIS
                        The cops can’t know what we talked 
                        about.

           ON ARDIS: How can she keep Emma quiet?

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Sit on the couch.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - A MINUTE LATER

           Emma sits perfectly still on the living room sofa.

           REVEAL:

           Ardis and Mason stand in front of her. Mason is pointing 
           Ardis’ gun at Emma. Ardis is holding a SPIKE.

                                 ARDIS
                             (to Emma)
                        Think about tonight. You couldn’t 
                        sleep, I came in, we talked — think 
                        about that memory.

                                 MASON
                        Think about the wrong memory and 
                        I’ll shoot you.

           Ardis holds the spike to Emma’s head.

                                 ARDIS
                        Ready?

           ON EMMA: Scared. And yes.
                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: We toss and turn in Emma’s bed, unable to sleep.

           POV: We get up at the sound of the doorbell.

           POV: We open the front door to find... Ardis.

                                 BACK TO THE LIVING ROOM:

           Ardis EXTRACTS Emma’s memory of Ardis’ visit.

           Emma, groggy, slumps over on the sofa.

           Ardis holds up the vial containing the memory.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Now she can’t tell the cops a 
                        thing.

                                 MASON
                        Test it. Make sure it’s the right 
                        one.

           Ardis places the spike to her own head and quickly INSERTS 
           THE MEMORY INTO HER BRAIN.

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: We get up at the sound of the doorbell.

           POV: We open the front door to find... Ardis.

           Grimacing as if tasting rotten food, Ardis EXTRACTS the 
           memory right back out again.

           Shakes it off as she POCKETS the vial with Emma’s memory.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... I hate it when you’re in them. 
                        Looking at yourself.

                                 MASON
                        Can we skip your existential crisis 
                        and get out of here?
           EXT. ALLEY BEHIND FITZGERALD HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ardis and Mason exit out the back, running down the dim 
           alley...

           ... AS DIAZ’S COP CAR SPEEDS ACROSS THE ALLEYWAY, ACROSS THE 
           STREET IN FRONT OF THEM —

           Ardis TUGS Mason back into the alley, out of Diaz’s sight —

           — As Diaz’s car PULLS AROUND in front of the Fitzgerald 
           House.

           INT. FITZGERALD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Emma Fitzgerald AWAKENS on the sofa at the sound of the 
           DOORBELL. Groggy and confused, she answers the door to 
           find...

           ... Agent Diaz.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Where is evidence collection?

                                 EMMA FITZGERALD
                        What are you talking about?

           Diaz takes in Emma’s confusion...

           ... And realizes what happened.

           ON DIAZ: MOTHERFUCKER.

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. EL TRAIN - NORTH SIDE - NIGHT

           Ardis and Mason ride on an EL TRAIN, which doesn’t seem to 
           have changed at all since about 1990 — save for the VIDEO ADS 
           on every available surface.

           At this hour, they’re the only passengers left on the train.

                             (reading from his phone)
                        ... United Airlines flight 457, 
                        from Shenzen to Chicago, landed at 
                        6:46 this morning.
                             (beat)
                        I don’t get it.
                                 ARDIS
                        Your CPD source said that they’re 
                        looking for a courier, right? Well, 
                        I think we found the courier.
                             (beat)
                        Richard.

                                 MASON
                        Why would a banker agree to be a 
                        courier for the Wing family?

                                 ARDIS
                        Maybe because the Wings had a gun 
                        to his head.
                             (beat)
                        Whatever mem the Wings had in 
                        Shenzen, it was valuable. Maybe 
                        they had to get rid of it. Fast. 
                        The Shay family was on their tail. 
                        So the Wings find a civilian — 
                        somebody who makes regular trips 
                        back and forth, won’t be suspicious 
                        — and they grab him. Inject the 
                        memory by force. “Keep this in your 
                        head for 12 hours or we’ll kill 
                        your family.” Richard’s wife said 
                        he sent her a strange email from 
                        the plane! It wasn’t Ambien — he 
                        had a mem in his head that his 
                        brain was having a hard time 
                        wrapping itself around.

                                 MASON
                        Then he lands... And Larry Wing has 
                        Zeke pick him up from the airport.

                                 ARDIS
                        Zeke takes Richard to the hotel, 
                        removes the mem, removes his memory 
                        of any of this even happening — and 
                        then calls me. Zeke knew that 
                        Richard would wake up in 
                        withdrawal—

                                 MASON
                        — Or he even planted the idea in 
                        Richard’s head —

                                 ARDIS
                        — Gave him a mem of wanting to buy 
                        a mem —
                                 MASON
                        — So that Richard would meet with 
                        you —

                                 ARDIS
                        — And then Zeke could set me up for 
                        his murder.

           ON MASON: This explains a lot, doesn’t it?

           Well, except for one not-so-little detail...

                                 MASON
                        ... So who killed Zeke?

           ON ARDIS: That is an excellent question.

                                 ARDIS
                        Someone hunting for the mem.

                                 MASON
                        Who?

                                 ARDIS
                        ... The person who took Zeke’s 
                        phone.

                                 MASON
                        Who took Zeke’s phone?

           ON ARDIS: A new idea forming.

                                 ARDIS
                        Let’s find out.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SECLUDED BENCH - LINCOLN PARK - MINUTES LATER

           Ardis and Mason sit on a secluded PARK BENCH.

           She places her burner phone on the bench. Hits SPEAKERPHONE.

                                 MASON
                        ... You’re just going to call up

                                 ARDIS
                             (points)
                        Look: We’ll call on public wifi. 
                        It’ll take him a minute to find our

                                 MASON
                        And in that minute, you’d like 
                        to...

                                 ARDIS
                        Do what I do.
                             (beat)
                        Make a deal.

           She hits DIAL on the phone...

           ... RINGING on the other end...

           ... Another long RING...

           ON ARDIS: This is either the most brilliant idea she’s ever 
           had, or the most suicidal.

           ON MASON: This is definitely a bad idea.

           ... And another RING...

           ... Before...

                                 VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
                             (male, French accent)
                        ... Bonjour?

           ON ARDIS & MASON: Well. Fuck.

                                 ARDIS
                        My name is Ardis Varnado.

           A long pause on the other hand.

                                 VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
                        How may I help you this evening, 
                        Miss Varnado?

                                 ARDIS
                        You’re looking for something. But 
                        you don’t have it.

                                 VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
                        What makes you think I don’t have 
                        it?

                                 ARDIS
                        ... If you had it, you’d hang up 
                        right now.

           Another long pause.
                                 VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
                        My people said you were the clever 
                        one. I’d like to meet somebody so 
                        clever.

           ON MASON: Shakes his head — “absolutely fucking not.”

           ON ARDIS: Looks at Mason. Then down at the phone.

                                 ARDIS
                        How do I know you’re not going to 
                        kill me?

                                 VOICE (ON SPEAKER)
                        Because like you said... I’m 
                        looking for something. And I don’t 
                        have it... Yet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - WEST SIDE - NIGHT

           Ardis and Mason wait in a nearly empty parking garage.

           It’s quiet, eerie — since most cars are self-driving, these 
           old parking structures don’t get as much use as they once 
           did.

                                 MASON
                        This is fucking bananas.

                                 ARDIS
                        Mason, think about it: Whoever this 
                        is, he’s been one step ahead of me 
                        all night. If he wanted to kill me, 
                        I’d already be dead.

                                 MASON
                        Or maybe he just had a couple of 
                        things higher up on his to-do list.

           But before they can argue more, they hear the SOUND OF TIRES 
           AGAINST PAVEMENT coming from the floor below...

           ... They turn, and look into the darkness...

           ... As the sound gets louder...

           ... And an ARMORED SUV approaches them.

           But this armored SUV is a different model than Larry Wing’s — 
           this is somebody else.
           This armored SUV pulls up right in front of Ardis and 
           Mason...

           ... And the rear passenger door SWINGS OPEN.

           Ardis and Mason stare at the open door: They can’t see what’s 
           inside.

           ON MASON: Takes a step back, puts his hands in the air.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        No fucking way.

           ON ARDIS: Here goes nothing.

           She takes a deep breath and ENTERS —

           I/E. SECOND ARMORED SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, it’s about the same size and quality of accoutrements 
           that were in Larry Wing’s armored SUV, only the design is 
           different. More practical, less ostentatious.

           Ardis finds herself sitting next to THREE BODYGUARDS...

           ... As she turns to face...

           ... A MAN who we will come to know as MR PHILLIP SHAY — 40s, 
           Korean, French accent.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        Well that was dramatic.

                                 ARDIS
                             (recognizing his face)
                        You’re Phillip Shay.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        If Larry Wing knew you were 
                        speaking to me, he’d have you 
                        killed.

                                 ARDIS
                        Then let’s add another item to the 
                        list of things we have in common. 
                        Larry Wing would like to kill us 
                        both.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        ... I came to Chicago to buy a 
                        memory.
                                 ARDIS
                        Then you’ve come to the right 
                        woman.

           ON SHAY: Gauging her.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        Here’s my quandary: Yesterday, I 
                        got a call from your colleague, 
                        Zeke. At Wing’s behest, he’d 
                        removed a mem that Richard 
                        Fitzgerald had carried in his head 
                        from Shenzen — but Zeke, he was an 
                        unscrupulous man. He offered to 
                        betray Larry Wing and sell the mem
                        to me instead. My people arrived at 
                        his apartment, but the negotiations 
                        did not go smoothly.

                                 ARDIS
                        Your people killed him.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        But he wouldn’t tell where he’d 
                        hidden the mem. This is the problem 
                        with turncoats — you just can’t 
                        trust them. Do you know where the 
                        mem is?

                                 ARDIS
                        I can find it.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        Because you’re the clever one?

           ON ARDIS: Unreadable.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY (CONT’D)
                        And what will it cost me if you do?

                                 ARDIS
                        Get me out of here. New name, new 
                        identity — protect me from Wing. 
                        Pay me whatever you were paying 
                        Zeke.

           ON SHAY: Thinks for a moment... Then nods.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        ... Oh, but if you find this mem
                        and you give it to Larry Wing 
                        instead of to me — that would not 
                        be good.
                                 ARDIS
                        Understood.

           She turns to leave...

           ... Then turns back to Shay.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        What’s in the mem?

           But Phillip Shay just LAUGHS.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        Zeke didn’t tell you?

                                 ARDIS
                        When would he have told me?

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        When you killed Richard.

           ON ARDIS: What?

           ON PHILLIP SHAY: Noticing her confusion.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY (CONT’D)
                        Oh dear... Zeke said you were 
                        unreliable, but he did not say it 
                        had gotten this bad.

                                 ARDIS
                        Why would I kill Richard?

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        Zeke couldn’t do it all alone. He 
                        needed the cops to think Richard’s 
                        death was just a drug deal gone bad 
                        — so he asked a fellow dealer to 
                        help. You.

           ON ARDIS: Trying not to let him see how much this information 
           is fucking with her head.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY (CONT’D)
                        The deal we just made — that’s 
                        exactly what he told me you’d want. 
                        I agreed to those terms yesterday.
                             (beat)
                        You don’t remember? 

                                 ARDIS
                        ... I’ll be in touch, Mr. Shay.

           She EXITS —
           EXT. PARKING GARAGE - WEST SIDE - MOMENTS LATER

           A few seconds later, Shay’s armored SUV drives off...

           ... Leaving Ardis and Mason alone in the parking garage.

                                 MASON
                             (re: her expression)
                        What happened?

           ON ARDIS: Like someone has died. Only that someone is any 
           illusion of her own innocence.

                                 ARDIS
                        Let’s go.

           She brushes him off, walking away into the darkness.

           ON MASON: What the hell happened in there?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FLATIRON LOFT BUILDING - WICKER PARK - NIGHT

           The Security Chief enters the industrial loft building.

           INT. FLATIRON LOFT BUILDING - 2ND FLOOR - MINUTES LATER

           In a private second-floor loft, the Security Chief meets 
           with...

           ... Nev and the Girl with Many Piercings.

                                 NEV
                        Is it true what they say about you 
                        guys?

                                 SECURITY CHIEF
                        What guys?

                                 NEV
                        When you join the Wing family, they 
                        pull out every memory in your life 
                        that doesn’t have to do with 
                        murder. One of you gets hurt, 
                        retires — you take that guy’s 
                        kills, put them in your head. All 
                        you know in the world is killing.

           ON THE SECURITY CHIEF: A perfectly unreadable expression.
                                 SECURITY CHIEF
                        You reached out. Do you know where 
                        Ardis Varnado is or not?

                                 GIRL WITH PIERCINGS
                        She fucking tricked him. That bitch 
                        is gonna get what she deserves.

                                 SECURITY CHIEF
                        Where is she?

                                 NEV
                        I sold her a burner. You can trace 
                        the GPS.

           Nev writes a PHONE number on a slip of paper.

           The Security Chief reaches over to take it...

           ... But Nev pulls the paper back.

                                 NEV (CONT’D)
                        I want something in return.

                                 SECURITY CHIEF
                        How much?

                                 NEV
                        I don’t want money... I want to 
                        kill someone.
                             (off his look)
                        Not for real. But I want to know 
                        what it feels like. You have so 
                        many memories of killing in your 
                        head — you can spare one.

           ON THE SECURITY CHIEF: This is a unique request.

                                 SECURITY CHIEF
                        ... Deal.

           Nev passes the Security Chief the paper with the phone number 
           on it, and then takes out a spike.

           Hands the spike to the Security Chief.

           The Security Chief looks at the spike. Thinks.

           And in a flash, the Security Chief pulls out a gun and SHOOTS 
           THE GIRL WITH MANY PIERCINGS.

           Nev jumps up —
           ON NEV: Woozy... Imagining himself killing his girlfriend... 
           The murder weapon now literally in his own hand... Drifting 
           into sleep...

           And with that, the Security Chief LEAVES.

           EXT. FLATIRON LOFT BUILDING - WICKER PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           The Security Chief walks away from the loft building as a 
           pair of COP CARS rush to the scene of the 9-1-1 call.

           The Security Chief enters the burner number into his phone, 
           pulls up ENCRYPTED GPS DATA.

           ON THE SECURITY CHIEF’S PHONE: A map of Chicago. And a dot 
           showing him exactly where Ardis is.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EL TRAIN - SOUTH SIDE - NIGHT

           As Ardis and Mason ride south on another EL TRAIN, she stares 
           out the window at the city skyline.

           ON ARDIS: Thinking about what she’s become.

           ON MASON: Seeing how distraught she is.

                                 MASON
                        ... You didn’t do it.
                             (off her look)
                        Maybe Zeke lied to Shay. Maybe Shay 
                        lied to you. Maybe there was a big 
                        conspiracy! Whatever — you’re not 
                        the killer.

                                 ARDIS
                        I like you better when you’re mean.

           Mason removes a spike from his pocket and hands it to her.

                                 MASON
                             (re: spike)
                        Pick a story that appeals and tell 
                        yourself that.

           ON ARDIS: Staring at the spike.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Do you know why I started 
                        pulling?
                                 MASON
                        No.

                                 ARDIS
                        Neither do I.
                             (beat)
                        It’s easier to leave out the parts 
                        you don’t like. To make excuse 
                        after excuse. “I’m just dabbling.” 
                        “I can stop anytime.” “I’m just a 
                        middleman.” But it’s bullshit. Just 
                        because you tell yourself a story 
                        about who you are — that doesn’t 
                        make it true.

           The train ARRIVES at the station.

           Ardis stands...

           ... And hands the spike back to Mason.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

                                 MASON
                        For what?

                                 ARDIS
                        To remember.

           EXT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - HUMBOLDT PARK - NIGHT

           Ardis and Mason stand across the street from the “FRESH 
           START” SOBER LIVING FACILITY — a three-story clinic where 
           addicts come to detox under clinical supervision.

                                 MASON
                        ... Why would Zeke stash the mem in 
                        a detox clinic?

                                 ARDIS
                        Because this is where he got his 
                        supply.
                             (off Mason’s curious look)
                        Addicts come in, detoxing, and Zeke 
                        offers them a trade — he’ll sneak 
                        them pills, booze, whatever they 
                        want — and all it costs them is a 
                        few of their most precious 
                        memories.

           ON MASON: That’s fucking dark.
                                 MASON
                        How do you know that?

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Because that’s what he did to 
                        me.

           Mason looks at Ardis, putting it together.

                                 MASON
                        When I met you — your brain all 
                        hollowed out — Zeke introduced us. 
                        That’s how you knew him — rehab?

                                 ARDIS
                        Which is how I know where he keeps 
                        his stash.

           Ardis and Mason enter the lobby, where they’re stopped by a

                        Agent Diaz?

           He hands her his phone.

                        Got a call from a security guard at

                        in there 10 minutes ago.

           Diaz takes the phone as we —

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - 3RD FLOOR - NIGHT

           Ardis and Mason walk down the hallway on the 3rd floor, shoes 
           clicking against the tile floors.

           The design of the facility reflects the hopes of its patients 
           — pristine white, open floor plan, opaque glass dividers 
           instead of doors. Patients sleep in private rooms down the 
           hall, but the central areas are there to encourage bonding. A 
           sense of community.

           It’s dark up here, deathly quiet. We hear Ardis’ and Mason’s 
           footsteps on the tile floors.

           As they turn a corner, they run into...

           ... A DAZED PATIENT.

                                 DAZED PATIENT
                        ... Who are you?

                                 ARDIS
                             (feigning hurt)
                        You don’t remember me?

           ON THE PATIENT: Mortification. This happens to him a lot...

           He turns away, heading down another hall, as Ardis and Mason 
           find...

           A KITCHEN:

           Where Ardis approaches the microwave.

           Ardis hits a series of BUTTONS on the microwave —

           — And a secret COMPARTMENT opens up behind it.

           From the compartment, Ardis removes...

           ... A BRIEFCASE.

           She sets the case on the table, and as Mason watches, she 
           opens it to...

           ... REVEAL: DOZENS AND DOZENS OF MEM VIALS.

           ON ARDIS: Bingo.

                                 MASON
                        ... Which one is it?

                                 ARDIS
                        Only one way to find out.

           Ardis removes her spike from her jacket —

           — And loads it up with the vial.

           Hands it to Mason, who does the honors —

           — INJECTING THE MEM INTO ARDIS’ HEAD.

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: We are in some kind of laboratory, FILLED WITH NANOMETER 
           TOUCH-SCREEN DISPLAYS...

           ... Orange liquids in huge jars...

           ... And on all of the displays: chemical formulas.

           But as we stare at the displays —

           — GUNFIRE sprays across the vials, destroying them —

           — Someone is attacking the laboratory, shooting everything —
                                    BACK TO THE SCENE:

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.

           Mason PULLS THE MEMORY OUT of Ardis before it bonds with her.

                                 MASON
                        What is it?

           Ardis, woozy, leans against the wall, setting her gun down on 
           a nearby table.

           She takes the mem vial from Mason, stares it at.

           ON ARDIS: This little orange vial is worth an unimaginable 
           fortune. And now she understands why.

                                 ARDIS
                        A chemical formula. It’s like 
                        Tetra, but... Fuck.

                                 MASON
                        A formula for what?

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Reproducing mems.

                                 MASON
                        You can’t reproduce mems. Only a 
                        human brain can make...
                             (off her look)
                        ... Fuck.

                                 ARDIS
                        If we could make copies — water 
                        them down, mass produce them — mems
                        would be so much cheaper. More 
                        addictive. We’ve been selling 
                        cocaine — and this is the formula 
                        for crack.

           ON ARDIS & MASON: Realizing how off-the-charts valuable this 
           formula is.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Mason... Wing’s lab was attacked. 
                        Shay’s people, probably. That’s why 
                        everyone needs this thing so badly 
                        — this mem is the only remaining 
                        record of the formula.

           Mason takes out a cell phone.
                                 MASON
                        I’m calling Wing.

                                 ARDIS
                        No.

                                 MASON
                        You trust Shay? We’ll get a better 
                        deal from Wing.

                                 ARDIS
                        We’re giving it to the cops.

           ON MASON: Say fucking what?

                                 MASON
                        Your brain has been through a lot 
                        tonight — you’re confused. Hand me 
                        the vial.

           ON ARDIS: A resolve forming.

                                 ARDIS
                        No. The cop who’s chasing me — she 
                        said she could help. I can make a 
                        deal with her if I turn on Wing.

           ON MASON: His frustration turns to disappointment.

                                 MASON
                        Ardis, please be reasonable about 
                        this.

           He PICKS UP HER GUN FROM THE TABLE —

           — And points it at her.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Give me the vial and I can get you 
                        out alive.

           ON ARDIS: Staring at Mason... The gun...

           ... Realizing that there is precisely one more piece to this 
           puzzle:

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Shay was right. Zeke needed 
                        another dealer to help him. To kill 
                        Richard. But it wasn’t me.
                             (beat)
                        It was you.
           ON MASON: “No shit.”

           The Lobby Guard is showing the monitors to Diaz.

                                 LOBBY GUARD

                        ... Where are they...

           But then Diaz sees something on a different monitor...

           ... ON THE MONITOR:

           A DELIVERY TRUCK enters the building’s loading dock...

           ... And out of the truck descends...

           ... The Security Chief.

           The Security Chief pulls a gun from his coat.

           ON DIAZ: Shit is about to get heavy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mason points his gun at Ardis as she holds the vial.

                                 ARDIS
                             (putting it all together)
                        You stole my gun. Took it from my 
                        case while I had your mem in my 
                        head.

           INT. ARDIS’ APARTMENT - MAIN AREA - SEQUENCE

           From earlier this evening, Ardis INSERTS Mason’s rooftop-
           groupie-sex memory —
           — And Mason dashes over to her case and steals her gun.

           At the end of that scene, Ardis walks over to the case, opens 
           it — and is shocked to find the gun missing.

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        And then you used it to shoot 
                        Richard.

           INT. PALMER HOUSE HOTEL - LUXURY SUITE - NIGHT - SEQUENCE

           At the Palmer House Hotel, Richard sleeps in the bed...

           ... When Mason enters and uses Ardis’ gun to SHOOT RICHARD 
           TWICE IN THE CHEST.

           Mason then drops the gun on the floor for the cops to find.

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        That was Zeke’s plan, wasn’t it? 
                        Steal the mem — then make everyone 
                        think that I’d done it. Wing. The 
                        cops. He told Shay that I was in on 
                        it.

           Ardis and Mason in the diner, as he first suggests that she 
           was the one to kill Richard.

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)
                        You even convinced me.

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - 3RD FLOOR - NIGHT

           Back to Ardis and Mason on the 3rd Floor.

                                 MASON
                        Zeke’s plan? You think he knew you 
                        well enough to come up with this?

                                 ARDIS
                        You weren’t his accomplice. He was 
                        yours.

                                 MASON
                        But he fucked up, hid the mem... 
                        and now you found it!

                        This is even better — all we have 
                        to do is take the mem back to Wing, 
                        blame everything that happened 
                        tonight on Zeke, and we walk away.

                             (re: gun)
                        ... I have leverage.

           ON ARDIS: Looking at where they are. Thinking about the 
           number of new addicts this formula will create.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... No. 

           Ardis takes a slow, defiant step backwards.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        I’m giving it to the cops.

                                 MASON
                        What is wrong with you? We give 
                        that vial to Wing and he’ll clean 
                        up your murder charge. You can sit 
                        on an island somewhere, spiking 
                        yourself with mems of any life you 
                        want.

                                 ARDIS
                        At the cost of how many others?

           Ardis takes another defiant step backwards...

           ... Mason follows, gun trained on her...

                                 MASON
                        What — “lives”? We ruin people’s 
                        lives every day for a percentage!

                                 ARDIS
                        Not anymore.

           Another step back...

           EYE CONTACT BETWEEN THEM AND —

           — MASON FIRES THE GUN ABOVE HER HEAD.

           Ardis freezes.
           ON MASON: Fuck.

           He CHASES after her —

                                                                CUT TO:

           In the lobby, Agent Diaz has just pulled the fire alarm to 
           save Ardis.

           She watches Ardis run from Mason on the security monitors.

                        Get the patients out of here.

           Diaz runs to a STAIRWELL —

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - 3RD FLOOR - SAME TIME

           On 3, Mason HUNTS Ardis across the open-floor facility.

           It’s dark, empty. Flashing RED LIGHTS from the fire alarm. A 
           twinkle from the distant skyscrapers through the tall 
           windows.

           Ardis, unarmed, SNEAKS from hall to hall, keeping low to the 
           ground, hiding.

           Mason stalks her through the eerie, red-white-red-white 
           gloom.

           IN THE DARKNESS:

           The Security Chief emerges from a STAIRWELL.

           He joins the hunt.

           ELSEWHERE ON THE FLOOR:
           Agent Diaz appears from another STAIRWELL.

           She quietly joins this four-way dance...

           Mason, Diaz, and the Security Chief silently stalk Ardis 
           through the facility.

           Ardis, the only one without a gun, is just trying to escape.

           Ardis moves towards an exit...

           ELSEWHERE ON THE FLOOR:

           Diaz sees a shape moving through the darkness...

           ... Is it Ardis? Or the Security Chief? Should she fire?

           BACK TO ARDIS:

           Nearing the exit...

           ... But the Security Chief is too close...

           ... She slowly creeps back the other direction...

           Is anyone getting out of this alive?

           EXT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - HUMBOLDT PARK - SAME TIME

           On the street outside, a SWAT TEAM arrives —

           — Surrounding the main entrance —

           — As PATIENTS stream out of the lobby.

           Our tense, four-way hunt continues as...

           ... Ardis gets near another FIRE EXIT, only to turn a corner 
           to find...

           MASON.

           They see each other.

           He FIRES —

           — And Ardis LEAPS behind a table.

           ELSEWHERE ON THE FLOOR:
           Diaz and the Security Chief both hear the gunshot —

           — And come running.

           BEHIND THE TABLE:

           Ardis crouches as MORE GUNSHOTS pin her down.

           ON MASON:

           Firing at the table. Angry. Can’t believe it’s come to this.

           BEHIND THE TABLE:

           How can Ardis get out of this?

           Well, she can FLING THE VIAL DOWN THE HALL.

                                 ARDIS
                        You want it? Go fetch.

           ON MASON: Shit. He dashes down the corridor after it...

           BEHIND THE TABLE:

           Ardis gets up —

           — Starts to go to the exit —

           ... When the Security Chief appears in front of her. Mere 
           inches from her face.

           Ardis is just fast enough to get the gun out of his hand —

           — But not fast enough to stop him from PUMMELING THE EVER-
           LOVING-SHIT OUT OF HER.

           ACROSS THE FLOOR:

           Mason finds the vial on the floor —

           — Pocketing it when —

           — BANG.

           A bullet lands beside him and he TURNS:

           Mason is under fire from Diaz.

           BACK TO ARDIS & THE SECURITY CHIEF:

           The hand-to-hand combat between Ardis and the Chief is quick, 
           brutal, and she doesn’t remotely stand a chance.
           BACK TO DIAZ & MASON:

           Diaz and Mason trade gunshots.

           BACK TO ARDIS & THE SECURITY CHIEF:

           Well, this isn’t going any better, is it?

           Looks like he just broke one of her ribs.

           BACK TO DIAZ & MASON:

           Mason is finally able to race away from Diaz.

           She’s about to give chase, when she hears SOUNDS OF THE 
           SCUFFLE between Ardis and the Security Chief.

           ON DIAZ: Which way should she go? To Mason, or to Ardis?

           BACK TO ARDIS & THE SECURITY CHIEF:

           The Security Chief SMASHES Ardis to the floor, takes hold of 
           his gun, raises it to shoot her...

           ... When...

           ... BANG.

           The Security Chief is shot in the back.

           REVEAL: Diaz stands behind him.

           Diaz fires again, two more shots to his chest —

           — And the Security Chief goes down. Dead.

           Ardis looks up at Diaz — who just saved her life.

                                 AGENT DIAZ
                        Listen —

           — BANG.

           Before Diaz can say anything, a BULLET LANDS IN HER CHEST, 
           and she falls to the floor.

           Ardis turns to see Mason behind her, FIRING blindly in their 
           direction as he makes a break for the nearby EMERGENCY EXIT —

           — As Ardis lies bleeding on the floor, her face inches from 
           Diaz’s, who starts BURBLING UP blood from her punctured lung.
           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

           Mason dashes down the stairs —

           — Hiding the gun in his coat —

           — As he bursts out into —

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           In the lobby, Mason joins the other PATIENTS who are fleeing 
           the building —

           — As they pass the entering SWAT Team —

                                 MASON
                        She’s upstairs! She has a gun! 

           The SWAT Team — who, let us remember, have no idea who Mason 
           is, since the police never connected him to Ardis — help 
           Mason and the patients out of the building —

           — Before they take to the stairs —

           — A THREE-MAN TEAM going up each staircase.

           There is no way out for whoever is left alive up there.

           EXT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - HUMBOLDT PARK - NIGHT

           Once outside, Mason SLIPS AWAY from the arriving COPS amidst 
           all the commotion.

           Mason walks casually away from the building...

           ... And pulls the vial from his pocket.

           ON MASON: He’s gotten away with it.

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - 3RD FLOOR - SAME TIME

           Slowly, painfully, Ardis stands, wiping the blood from her 
           nose...

           ... And then she picks up the Security Chief’s gun.

           Ardis stands above Diaz, weapon trained on her in case Diaz 
           makes any sudden moves.

           ON DIAZ: Losing ounce after ounce of blood, she reaches into 
           her jacket pocket —

           We return to a shot from our opening sequence:

           TEEN GIRL DEFENDERS — in uniforms — line up against us... We 
           expertly maneuver the ball around them and FIRE it past the

                        If you’re remembering this, then 
                        you’re taking it all back in. What 
                        we had. What we gave up.

           ... But the memory continues and we turn to the crowd, to see 
           our DAD applauding. We run up to our Dad...

                                 ARDIS (V.O.)

           From our opening sequence:

           earned DIPLOMA. We look into the Administrator’s 
           congratulatory face as we shake hands...

           ... Only now the memory continues on and we turn to the crowd 
           see that this is a DEA ACADEMY GRADUATION CEREMONY.

                        Our partner.

           And standing right behind us at graduation?

           The newly christened Agent Diaz.

           All the happy memories we saw in the opening?

           They were Ardis’.

           Diaz looks wearier, the routine of this wearing her down.

                        You’re using.

                                 ARDIS
                        Ardis is using. She wakes up after 
                        these sessions in withdrawal — her 
                        brain is full of holes — she needs 
                        to fill them. 

                                 AGENT DIAZ

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - 3RD FLOOR - NIGHT

           And finally we return to Ardis in the present, spike against 
           her head.

           ON ARDIS: Eyes fluttering open. She remembers everything.

           She knows she’s a cop again.

           She’s groggy, struggling to keep it together. Trying to hold 
           on to what’s real as her brain rewires itself to her new 
           (old?) identity —

           — But the sound of Diaz GASPING for breath brings her back to 
           the moment.

           Ardis turns to Diaz...

           ... Just as DIAZ’S EYES CLOSE.

                                 ARDIS
                        No. No. No. No.

           Ardis frantically tries applying pressure to the bullet hole 
           in Diaz’s chest —

           — But it’s no use —

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Fuck fuck fuck fuck —

           — And with a final gasp, Diaz dies.

           ON ARDIS: Just as she’s learned how much Diaz means to her, 
           Diaz is dead. Seconds after regaining her old life, it’s been 
           taken from her.

           But Ardis has little time to mourn, as a THREE-MEMBER TEAM OF 
           SWAT GUYS arrives on the floor.

                                 SWAT MEMBER
                        Freeze! Hands behind your head!

           The three SWAT Members surround Ardis, a triangle of 
           automatic weapons pointed at her.

           She puts her hands up.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’m a cop.

                                 SWAT MEMBER
                        Hands behind your head! Get on the 
                        floor!
                                 ARDIS
                        You have an officer down here. The 
                        man responsible is fleeing the 
                        scene. His name is —

                                 SWAT MEMBER
                        — Down! Now!

           The SWAT Members step closer —

           — One of them puts a hand on Ardis’ shoulder, pushing her 
           down to her knees.

                                 ARDIS
                        — His name is Mason Russell, six 
                        feet, brown hair, you have to call 
                        it in before he gets —

           — The SWAT Member KICKS Ardis in the back of her head —

           — And then as her face SLAMS against the floor, he DIGS his 
           knee into her back — 

           — Holding her down as he presses his gun to her temple.

           ON ARDIS: Can’t move. Can’t breathe.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Mason —
                             (gasp)
                        — You have to stop —

           She’s broken. Defeated. Beaten to a pulp for the second time 
           tonight.

           All she has to do is close her eyes, pass out, and worry 
           about getting herself out of jail in the morning.

           But across the floor, she sees Diaz’s dead body.

           Ardis’ face hardens into cold steel resolve. She wants to be 
           the hero of this story? Time to prove it.

           In a flash, Ardis performs a FEAT OF UNARMED COMBAT 
           ACROBATICS —

           — Taking two of the SWAT Team Members to the ground as she 
           DISARMS the third.

           Stealing his automatic weapon, she dashes across the floor to 
           the exit —

           — Pressing her ear against the door to hear THE SOUNDS OF 
           MORE SWAT MEMBERS COMING UP THE STAIRS.
           ON ARDIS: What to do?

           She opens the door —

           — And FIRES AT THE EMPTY STEPS RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER —

           A FLIGHT DOWN:

           The SWAT Members back off at the sound of gunfire, retreating 
           backwards...

           TOP OF THE STAIRS:

           Ardis places the gun across the steel bar of the fire door, 
           LOCKING IT FROM INSIDE.

           Then she runs to the OTHER STAIRS —

           — Opens the door and looks down: It’s clear...

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           ... Ardis BOLTS down the stairs as fast as she can...

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - 3RD FLOOR - SAME TIME

           On the 3rd floor landing, the SWAT Members TRY TO OPEN THE 
           FIRE DOOR that Ardis barricaded —

           — But it won’t budge. They’re stuck.

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - LOADING DOCK — LATER

           Ardis BURSTS from the stairwell out to the LOADING DOCK —

           — Where A UNIFORMED COP guards the exit.

                                 ARDIS
                             (feigning hysteria)
                        Oh my God help! Help!

                                 COP
                        Ma’am, are you okay?

           Ardis runs up to the Cop and DISARMS HIM —

           — Then SWIPES his GUN and PHONE while he’s on the ground—

           — She runs out to —
           EXT. ALLEY - HUMBOLDT PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Ardis runs away down a back alley.

           She’s out.

           But so is Mason. And the cops are on the hunt for her.

                        I don’t give a shit. I have your

           ON WING: This formula is worth more than anything Mason could 
           ask for.

           A self-driving cab deposits Mason outside an old ABANDONED 
           SLAUGHTERHOUSE in the “back of the yards” neighborhood — this 
           place has been a continuous slum since 1880. And it’s not 
           getting nicer anytime soon.

           Mason enters the abandoned slaughterhouse —

           INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           — To find that it’s not so abandoned after all:

           Inside, ENORMOUS TUBS OF ORANGE LIQUID have been stacked 
           floor-to-ceiling...

           ... The conveyor belts look new, ready to function again...

           ... And hundreds of boxes of MEDICAL VIALS line the far 
           walls.

           What was once a slaughterhouse for hogs is in the process of 
           being converted into a state-of-the-art mem factory.

           ON MASON: Wing isn’t wasting any time mass producing this 
           stuff, is he?

           Speaking of whom:

                        They used to slaughter hogs here.

           Mason turns to see Wing and his two bodyguards approaching.

           Wing’s armored SUV is parked behind them.

                        1890s. At its peak, 75,000 hogs a 
                        day. So many gallons of blood 
                        flowed into the river from this 
                        very spot that it made the water 
                        bubble all the way downtown — can 
                        you imagine that? Safety standards 
                        not being what they are today, if a 
                        workman’s finger got lopped off, 
                        packed in with the meat — well, the 
                        irony was that the worker’s own 
                        family was probably buying that 
                        very hunk of rotting pork! It’s 
                        what we’ve been doing ever since...

                        ... Feeding the animals to each 
                        other.

           Mason reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the vial.

                                 MASON
                        How many mems can you make at a 
                        time with this thing?

                                 LARRY WING
                        Enough to make the river bubble all 
                        the way downtown.
                             (beat)
                        Of course, the quality will suffer. 
                        Apparently the copies will get 
                        hazier — and more addictive. They 
                        start to fade or something. But 
                        memories, like hogs, are a 
                        renewable resource.
                             (beat)
                        Give me the vial, and I’ll wire the 
                        money into your account.

           Mason hands the vial to Bodyguard #1.

                                 MASON
                        It’s a living.

                                 LARRY WING
                             (to Bodyguard #1)
                        Test it.
           Bodyguard #1 takes out a spike, loads the vial into it, and 
           INJECTS IT INTO HIS BRAIN —

                                    FLASH OF IMAGERY:

           POV: We — Emma Fitzgerald — toss and turn in bed.

           POV: We get up at the sound of the doorbell.

           POV: We open the front door to find... Ardis.

                                BACK TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE:

           Bodyguard #1 quickly PULLS THE MEM OUT.

                                 BODYGUARD #1
                        No good. Some old lady.

                                 MASON
                        What?

           ON WING: Just nods. He was expecting this.

           The front door of the armored SUV opens...

           ... And Ardis steps out.

           (N.B.: Her left hand is now bandaged. Doesn’t seem too odd, 
           since she recently lost a fist fight, but this little detail 
           may prove more interesting in a moment.)

                                 ARDIS
                             (to Wing)
                        I told you he doesn’t have it. I 
                        do.

                                 MASON
                        How did...?

           Mason stares at her, figuring it out.

           INT. “FRESH START” SOBER LIVING - 3RD FLOOR - FLASHBACK

           Back at the facility, when Ardis was hiding behind the table 
           as Mason shot at her...

           ... Ardis takes the vial out of her pocket, ready to throw it 
           down the hall to distract Mason...

           ... When she feels ANOTHER VIAL in her pocket — takes it out 
           — realizes she still has Emma’s mem and THROWS THAT ONE 
           towards Mason —— 
                                 ARDIS
                        You want it? Go fetch.

           INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT

           Back to the slaughterhouse, where Mason glares at Ardis: 
           Fuck, she’s clever.

                                 LARRY WING
                             (to Ardis)
                        I’ll offer you the same deal I 
                        offered Mason.

                                 ARDIS
                        Unlike him, I took precautions. I 
                        don’t have the vial on me — but I 
                        know exactly where I hid it.

           From her jacket, she takes out a spike.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        All you have to do is pluck out my 
                        memory of hiding it. If I’m lying — 
                        kill me.

           ON WING: Fuck, she is really clever.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)
                        Unless I get a better offer.

           Suddenly, the GATES to the slaughterhouse door RAISE —

           — And MR SHAY’S ARMORED SUV DRIVES IN.

           The gates close behind the SUV as it pulls up beside them.

           Shay and THREE BODYGUARDS — armed to the hilt — get out.

           Wing’s two bodyguards point their guns at Shay and his three 
           bodyguards — who point their guns right back.

           Even Wing and Shay draw guns of their own.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        Miss Varnado, I’m beginning to 
                        think you enjoy these dramatic 
                        entrances.

           Everyone is pointing guns at everyone...

           ... As Ardis, unarmed, walks right into the center of the 
           Mexican stand-off.
           Wing and his guys on one side. Shay and his guys on the 
           other.

           Mason, with Wing’s people, is trying to figure out how anyone 
           is getting out of here alive.

           One of Shay’s bodyguards trains his gun on Ardis —

           — When Shay waves him off.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY (CONT’D)
                             (to his bodyguard)
                        No. She’s the only person here who 
                        you can’t kill.

                                 ARDIS
                             (taps her forehead)
                        You want to know where the vial is? 
                        I’m taking bids.

           ON WING: Are you fucking serious?

           ON SHAY: The balls on this chick.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                             (to Ardis)
                        Pick a number. It’s yours.

                                 LARRY WING
                             (to Ardis)
                        I can promise you that I won’t be 
                        outbid by this — thug.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                             (to Wing)
                        One econ class at university, and 
                        you’re Maynard fucking Keynes.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Hmmm, who should I sell the 
                        vial to? It’s a big decision.

           Ardis slowly, deliberately paces back and forth between the 
           two sides.

                                 LARRY WING
                        You want a promotion? You can have 
                        half of this town.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                        You can have all of it.
                                 ARDIS
                        ... Hmmm... Oh, I almost forgot — 
                        there’s one more interested party.

           From her jacket pocket, Ardis removes the COP’S CELL PHONE 
           that she stole...

           ... REVEAL: The phone is on.

           From outside, we hear the sounds OF POLICE SIRENS —

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - SAME TIME

           Outside, POLICE CARS speed towards the slaughterhouse from 
           every direction.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - SAME TIME

           ON WING AND SHAY: Hearing the sirens. The cops are on the 
           way.

                                 LARRY WING
                             (to Ardis)
                        This is not helpful.

                                 PHILLIP SHAY
                             (to Ardis)
                        For once, Larry and I are in 
                        agreement.

           Ardis looks back and forth between them, the sounds of sirens 
           growing louder.

                                 ARDIS
                        ... Well, I guess I better make a 
                        decision.
                             (beat)
                        Larry, I suppose loyalty counts for 
                        something. Transfer the money — 
                        right now — and the vial is yours.

           Ardis looks back at Shay, who is livid — but can’t shoot her 
           and risk losing the vial.

           Wing nods to his Bodyguard #2, who uses his phone to TRANSFER 
           THE MONEY.
                                 WING
                             (to Ardis)
                        Your turn.

                                 ARDIS
                             (re: Shay’s guns)
                        I’d feel more comfortable with one 
                        gun on me at a time.

           Wing gestures to his Bodyguard #1, who follows Ardis behind
           Wing’s SUV.

           So from above the layout looks like:

           [    SHAY   ]
                                    [  WING &  ]   [     ]   [    ARDIS   ] 

           [     &     ]
                                    [  MASON & ]   [ SUV ]   [      &     ]

           [  3 GUARDS ]
                                    [   GUARD  ]   [     ]   [    GUARD   ]

           Separated from the Mexican stand-off by the SUV, Bodyguard #1 
           points his gun at Ardis. 

                                 BODYGUARD #1
                        Let’s go.

           Ardis holds the spike up to her own head —

           — And REMOVES A MEMORY.

           ON SHAY: Trying to get a glimpse of what Ardis is doing.

           ON WING: Same.

           ON MASON: Cannot believe this is happening.

           Woozy, Ardis hands the loaded spike to Bodyguard #1.

                                 ARDIS
                        Enjoy.

                                 WING
                             (to bodyguard)
                        Check it.

           Bodyguard #1 keeps his gun on Ardis...

           ... While with his free hand he puts the spike to his head...

           ... He and Ardis make eye contact...
           ... ON ARDIS: Unreadable...

           ... And Bodyguard #1 INJECTS HER MEMORY.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DILAPIDATED APARTMENT BUILDING - WENDELL’S APARTMENT

           POV: 30 minutes ago, in Wendell’s apartment, we — Ardis — and 
           Wendell stare at a MIRROR. 

                                 ARDIS
                             (into mirror)
                        Wendell, will you tell the man who 
                        will remember this what you’re 
                        going to do the second you see the 
                        money has been transferred?

                                 WENDELL
                             (into mirror)
                        Close the account. And go see my 
                        grand-kids.

           We set the mem vial on a table, in plain view.

                                 ARDIS
                        And the vial will be right here, 
                        waiting to be picked up. Will you 
                        tell the man who will remember this 
                        where we are?

           INT. SLAUGHTERHOUSE - NIGHT

           Back at the slaughterhouse, Bodyguard #1 receives the mem—

                                 BODYGUARD #1
                        Got it.

           ON ARDIS: See? She was telling the truth.

           ON WING: Pleased.

           ON SHAY: Wants to kill all of these motherfuckers.

           ON MASON: Ardis is about to get away with his money.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        60/40.

           ON ARDIS’ SIDE:

                                 ARDIS
                        Deal.

           And with that...

           ... They both stand and FIRE AT EACH OTHER.

           Two bullets echo in the gloom.

           Both shots hit their targets.

           As both Mason and Ardis fall to the ground.

           Everything is still as ASAC Thorne and the Cops surround the 
           SUV...

           ... Forming a circle around Ardis’ and Mason’s bodies...

           ... Moving in on the two corpses...

           ... Until, at last...

           ... Ardis slowly sits up.

           REVEAL: The bullet went clean through her shoulder.

           She looks to Mason —

           — Who has a bullet in his heart.

           Mason is dead.

           The Cops converge around Ardis, ready to fire.

           She puts her hands above her head.

                                 ARDIS (CONT’D)

           ASAC Thorne stares at her: Is she telling the truth?

           He takes out his phone, accessing the classified file...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. RIVER BANKS - BEHIND THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAWN

           A short time later, the first blue tingle of dawn is just 
           starting to coat the city.

           Behind the slaughterhouse, plumes of cold grey mist waft up 
           from the river. Everything is murky and unfathomable.

           PARAMEDICS finish checking Ardis — she’s been through a lot, 
           but she’ll live.

           ON ARDIS: Who is she now? Who has she ever been?

           She’s approached by ASAC Thorne.

                                 ASAC THORNE
                        ... My name is ASAC Pat Thorne. 
                        It’s nice to meet you.

           Ardis nods.

                                 ASAC THORNE (CONT’D)
                        You need to go to the hospital.

                                 ARDIS
                        Yeah.

                                 ASAC THORNE
                        But there’s something we have to 
                        talk about first. I’m sorry. Can’t 
                        wait.

                                 ARDIS
                        What?

                                 ASAC THORNE
                        Thanks to you, the Wings just took 
                        a major hit. Which means that the 
                        Shays will be quick to take over 
                        their ground. And...

           ON ARDIS: And...?

                                 ASAC THORNE (CONT’D)
                        ... And your cover isn’t even 
                        blown.

           ON ARDIS: Realizing what he’s suggesting.
                                 ASAC THORNE (CONT’D)
                        As far as the Shays know, you’re 
                        the dealer who tried to sell out 
                        Wing — we charge you with Richard’s 
                        murder, you go on the run, reach 
                        out to them for help... You’re in a 
                        perfect position to infiltrate.

                                 ARDIS
                        You can pull out my memory of 
                        tonight. Send me back under.

                                 ASAC THORNE
                        I know you’ve given a lot already. 
                        Asking for more, is... But if we’re 
                        going to do this, best to do it 
                        now.

                                 ARDIS
                        I’d forget everything I’ve done. 
                        I’d forget who I really am.

           ASAC Thorne looks down at her classified case file, which we 
           can’t see.

                                 ASAC THORNE
                        You think this is who you really 
                        are?

           ON THORNE: “Maybe. Maybe not.”

           Thorne holds on to the unseen file and hands her a spike — 
           the choice is hers.

           Then he steps away, giving her some time to think.

           We stay on Ardis’ face. She stares at the spike. Grappling 
           with the decision.

           This is the real her, isn’t it? This is her real identity?

           Beneath it all, there is a person inside there... Right?

           As she thinks, the morning mist slowly drifts across her 
           face.

           Covering her up in an impenetrable grey fog.

                                         THE END
