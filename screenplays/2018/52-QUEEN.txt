                                      QUEEN

                            - A PERSONAL ESSAY" 

                                BY COREY RAE
           TIGHT ON FEET as they step inside a pair of PINK HIGH HEELS 

           WIDEN TO REVEAL the feet belong to what appears to be a YOUNG 
           GIRL (around 6) who is mid-shimmying into an oversized PINK 
           FLORAL DRESS.

           CLEVER FRAMING WILL KEEP THE YOUNG GIRL'S FACE A MYSTERY as 
           she struts--

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY 

           -- alone in her bedroom, and we hear a VOICE OVER narrate her 
           fierce, super model cat-walk. The voice over should be bubbly 
           and over-confident - the epitome of a teenage girl:

                                 TEENAGE GIRL (V.O.)
                        I grew up idolizing 90’s characters   
                        like Cher from Clueless, Elle Woods 
                        from Legally Blonde, and I dream of 
                        one day being like Carrie from Sex 
                        and the City... well, actually, I’m 
                        more of a Samantha t.b.h.

           As the Young Girl sashays back and forth we’ll get a tour of 
           her bedroom: dressers covered in BARBIE DOLLS, a lush bed 
           filled with beanie babies, lavender walls swathed in her 
           favorite MOVIE POSTERS noted above.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL (V.O.)
                        I just want so badly to be the “It 
                        Girl” of my high school. The Prom 
                        Queen...

           Young Girl sits at a VANITY, reaches for her favorite RED 
           LIPSTICK, and starts applying it to her lips as we finally 
           PULL BACK and see her FACE for the first time and REVEAL-- 

                                 COREY FKA TEENAGE GIRL (V.O.)
                        ... but that just never seemed like 
                        a real possibility to me.

           -- the Young Girl is actually what appears to be a YOUNG BOY 
           with short blonde hair. This is COREY WAGNER (at 6), and 
           we’ll soon learn that Corey is much more than meets the eye. 

           (NOTE: For clarity’s sake, until Corey transitions and 
           presents as female in this script we will use the masculine 
           pronouns of he/him/his for Corey. However, make no mistake, 
           Corey was born a Transgender Woman.)

           Suddenly Corey will hear a sound OFF SCREEN, and turn to find 
           in the BEDROOM DOORWAY-- 
           Corey’s older brother, MATTHEW WAGNER (around 8) is watching 
           Corey’s game of dress up with an unreadable expression. How 
           does he feel about his little brother dressing as a girl?

           REVEAL Matthew is holding SCISSORS behind his back, before he 
           smiles a devilish grin. He proceeds to snatch a Barbie Doll 
           from a dresser and cut its hair off, while Corey screams--

                                 COREY 
                             (calling off)
                        MOM!!!

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        My mom always said she wanted the 
                        white picket fence lifestyle. But 
                        instead, well, voila...

           Corey sits outside a KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM DOOR. He holds a 
           BARBIE DOLL and kicks his legs impatiently. PUSH PAST THE 
           CLASSROOM WINDOW AND FIND INSIDE--

           INT. KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM - SAME

           JUDY WAGNER (in her early 30’s) sits across from a 
           kindergarten teacher, MISS AUSTIN, who will soon learn that 
           Judy is a ferocious Mama Bear disguised as a 5 foot nothing 
           beautician with perfectly blown out blonde hair.

                                 MISS AUSTIN
                        This is serious. Corey has been 
                        trying on dresses, playing with 
                        dolls, and painting his nails. I 
                        asked Corey what he wants to be 
                        when he grows up, and do you want 
                        to know what he said?

           Off Judy’s silence, Miss Austin answers--

                                 MISS AUSTIN (CONT’D)
                        ... Prom Queen. Needless to say 
                        this is quite alarming behavior.

                                 JUDY
                        I don’t know what to say. I’m just 
                        very disappointed... in you, Miss 
                        Austin. 

           Miss Austin raises her eyebrows, surprised.
                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, if you ever tell my child 
                        what they can or cannot play with, 
                        or wear, or want to be - I will 
                        bury you in so much paperwork your 
                        head will spin. Got it?

           Judy tries to storm out, but can’t. REVEAL she is stuck, 
           struggling to get out of a TINY KINDERGARTEN CHAIR.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Post meeting, Corey and Judy sit in a booth for a pick me up 
           meal. Corey’s head is down as he fiddles with his Barbie, 
           sulking - feeling bad about himself. 

                                 JUDY
                        Y’know I was bullied when I was 
                        your age. People called me stupid 
                        and said I wouldn’t amount to 
                        anything. But all I ever wanted to 
                        be was a Mom, and I’m so lucky and 
                        grateful that I get to be your Mom.

           Corey looks up, peers into Judy’s eyes - making sure she’s 
           telling the truth.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        I want you to remember to always be 
                        yourself no matter what. Okay?

           Corey thinks. Then--

                                 COREY
                        Even if I wear my shirt like this?

           He rolls up his shirt so it looks like he’s wearing a BRA. 

                                 JUDY
                             (smiling)
                        Especially if you wear your shirt 
                        like that. But the thing is, I’ll 
                        have to wear it like that too.

           Judy rolls up her shirt like a bra too. They both giggle, 
           before an OLD WAITRESS plops down a CHOCOLATE SUNDAE in front 
           of them with a SLAM! 

           The Old Waitress glares at Corey and Judy. Shakes her head, 
           disapproving. Corey looks around the room to find--

           EVERYONE AT THE RESTAURANT STARING (A CHEF, A MAN AT THE 
           COUNTER, A FAMILY IN A BOOTH) - ALL uncomfortable.
           ON COREY taking their judgemental looks to heart.

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        I learned early on that my natural 
                        desires weren’t normal...

           INT. BATHROOM, TEMPLE - LATER

                                 STEVEN 
                        Do you feel like a man, Corey?

           COREY (now 13) shoots a look that says, NO. He pouts in his 
           BAR MITZVAH SUIT and TALLIT as his step-dad, STEVEN (40’s, 
           faded hunk) puts the finishing touches on his tie.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Corey.

                                 COREY
                        Thanks, Steven. 

           Steven was hoping for a warmer response, but shakes it off 
           before he exits the bathroom - giving Corey some privacy.

           Corey gets one last look in the mirror, and exhales, hating 
           his BOY WARDROBE. 

           He unbuttons his shirt and REVEALS that underneath his suit, 
           he’s wearing a PINK DRESS. Corey is like Clark Kent and the 
           dress is his Superhero Suit. 

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        ... so I decided to keep that part 
                        of me a secret as I got older. 

           WE PUSH IN TIGHT ON Corey’s striking GREEN EYES in the 
           MIRROR, as we--

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           TIGHT ON the same GREEN EYES, but four years later...

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - HALLOWEEN MORNING

           WE PULL BACK revealing COREY (now 17) sits at a desk, staring 
           into a mirror, drawing a self-portrait at an EASEL. 

           We get a long look at Corey now. Baby-faced. Shaggy blonde 
           hair. He appears to be a normal, cis-gender boy until he 
           brushes a strand out of his eyes. Corey has an unmistakable 
           feminine aura and energy that we’ll soon learn leads many 
           people to suspect that he might be gay. 
                                 HANNAH (O.S.)
                        Corey, what's your favorite type of 
                        porn? Is it lesbian, or is it anal? 

           REVEAL HANNAH GREEN (17, heavyset, Corey’s “girlfriend”) lays 
           in bed looking at PORN. Corey ignores, laser focused. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Hello. Mr. Artiste. Corey...

           Frustrated, Hannah rips out her headphones and blasts LOUD 
           MOANING to get Corey’s attention...

                                 COREY
                             (whips around)
                        What the hell, Hannah!? My parents 
                        will hear!  

           Corey dive bombs the bed, and playfully wrestles her to turn 
           it off. 

                                 HANNAH
                        They’ll just assume it’s us. Hell, 
                        maybe it should be?

           CAMERA may catch Corey’s uneasy look, before arriving back at 
           the self-portrait that depicts Corey as a GIRL, as we CUT TO:

           HIGH ABOVE SUBURBIA--

           The camera is a ghost soaring past the cookie cutter 
           Mcmansions and white picket fences of Short Hills, NJ.

                                 COREY (PRE-LAP)
                             (singing)
                        Each morning I get up I die a 
                        little! Can barely stand on my 
                        feet!

                                 JUDY (PRE-LAP)
                             (panicked)
                        Stop singing and focus on the road!

           INT. CAR - IN MOTION - HALLOWEEN DAY

           Corey belts QUEEN’S “SOMEBODY TO LOVE” as he drives with JUDY 
           (now in her late 30’s) in the passenger seat, bracing herself 
           for a crash, and Hannah in the back seat enjoying the wild 
           ride. (NOTE: QUEEN’S songs are the unofficial, extremely cost 
           prohibitive soundtrack to this film) 

           Corey and Judy argue while Corey drives erratically--
                                 COREY
                        Stop side seat driving, Mom!
                             (back to singing)
                        Take a look in the mirror and 
                        cryyyy!

                                 JUDY
                        You’re going to get us killed if 
                        you don’t focus!

                                 COREY
                        What’s the point of having my 
                        license if you’re going to 
                        micromanage me?

                                 JUDY
                        Stop sign - Stop sign - STOP SIGN!

           EXT. STREET - SAME

           Corey’s CAR blows past the STOP SIGN, and screeches to a halt 
           in the middle of the STREET, before the car lurches forward, 
           narrowly avoiding oncoming traffic. 

           INT. CAR - IN MOTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Corey continues driving as if nothing happened for a few 
           silent beats, while Judy fumes, and Hannah tries to keep a 
           straight face in the backseat.

                                 COREY
                        What? I totally paused.

                                 JUDY
                        You need to come to a full stop, 
                        Corey! What the hell?

                                 COREY
                        No, like Cher - “I paused.” Get it?

           Hannah busts up laughing. Meanwhile, Judy does not think this 
           is funny - at all. She crosses her arms, annoyed.

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        Fine! You drive if you’re going to 
                        be this controlling.

           Corey pulls over. They get out and switch places. 

           As Judy proceeds to drive, we should get the sense that this 
           isn’t the only part of Corey’s life where Judy likes to be in 
           the driver’s seat... 
           EXT. SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - HALLOWEEN MORNING

           Judy’s ACURA pulls into the DROP OFF LINE behind a long line 
           of DESIGNER CARS. This is the # 1 public high school in New 
           Jersey, as noted by a sign on the lawn, and it’s the type of 
           uber wealthy town where if you drive an Acura you’re 
           considered poor.

           INSIDE JUDY’S CAR--

           Judy ad-libs good-bye to Hannah who exits the car, while 
           Corey gathers his bag and a TRAY OF COFFEES, giving them one 
           last moment alone.

                                 JUDY
                        When are you going to let me put 
                        some highlights in your hair? You’d 
                        look so handsome with highlights,
                        Mr. President.

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        My mom starts off every morning 
                        telling me how handsome I am. I 
                        hate that word... handsome.

                                 COREY
                        I’m still campaigning, so don’t 
                        jinx me! 

           Corey, backpack slung over his shoulder, slams the door shut.  

           INT. ENTRYWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - HALLOWEEN MORNING

           TIGHT ON SASHA SALES (17, high school gorgeous, the ring 
           leader of the “It” Girls) as she hands out ELECTION PINS in 
           front of her CAMPAIGN POSTER. Her poster looks identical to 
           “Obama’s Change Poster”, only Sasha wears a revealing outfit 
           that highlights her ample cleavage. 

           Corey and Hannah approach Sasha, who is their close friend - 
           that they both secretly hate, because, like, High School.

                                 HANNAH
                             (fake)
                        Love the poster, Sasha! 

                                 SASHA
                             (faker)
                        Thanks, babe! Had to bring out the 
                        big guns if I wanted to beat your 
                        lover boy this year.
                                 COREY
                             (under his breath to 
                              Hannah)
                        She really brought out the big guns 
                        alright.

           Corey and Hannah share a smile before heading in opposite 
           directions, when Corey is greeted by ROBBIE LIPPMAN (17, a 
           chubby teddy bear). He’s Corey’s vice presidential running 
           mate, and a proud resident of the C-List at Short Hills High.

                                 ROBBIE 
                        How can you talk to Sasha after she 
                        started that rumor?

                                 COREY
                        She’s a friend, Robbie. And we 
                        don’t know it was her.

           Corey joins Robbie in front of their own CAMPAIGN POSTER. 
           They hand out their election PINS as they talk--

                                 ROBBIE
                        Don’t be naive. Remember in eighth 
                        grade when Sasha told everyone I 
                        had sex with a bowl of potato 
                        salad?

                                 COREY
                        Yeah. But that was true.

                                 ROBBIE
                        I told her that in confidence! 
                        People still call me Mayo Dick.

                                 COREY
                        Robbie, we’re going to win this 
                        election no matter what rumors are 
                        spread about us, and you want to 
                        know why? 
                             (Robbie shrugs, why?)
                        Because no one wants an idiot in 
                        charge of Senior Prom. Last week, 
                        Sasha left her car running for the 
                        entire day and nearly started a 
                        fire. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        That was endearing. 

                                 COREY
                        She got arrested for smoking weed 
                        in front of the police station.
                                 ROBBIE
                        It got expunged. 

                                 COREY
                        She sent naked pics to the wrong 
                        Brian. That Brian was her Dad!

                                 ROBBIE
                        That can’t be true.

                                 COREY
                        It is. So relax.

                                 ROBBIE
                        But, that rumor is killing us. 

                                 COREY
                        No one thinks we’re gay. I mean, I 
                        have a girlfriend for chrissakes!

                                 VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                        What are you two fags staring at?

           THE VOICE, HENNIE BURN (17, a jock who is cockier than he 
           should be) throws his arms around Corey and Robbie. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hennie, you can’t say fag anymore. 

                                 HENNIE 
                        Don’t be a little fag, Robbie. I 
                        hear you both ate each other’s 
                        little dicks this summer? 

                                 COREY
                        It’s a rumor, Hennie! Jesus! 
                             (lying)
                        The only thing I ate this summer 
                        was Hannah’s pus-say, ass-hole.

                                 HENNIE 
                        Bullshit. 

                                 COREY
                             (totally lying)
                        Swear to God. I am the champion of 
                        eating box now.

                                 HENNIE 
                        If that’s true, you are what you 
                        eat. A big-fat-vagina! See you fags 
                        at Neko’s tonight.

           Hennie saunters off. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        So Neko’s having a Halloween party 
                        tonight?

                                 COREY
                        Uh, yeah. It’s going to be super 
                        small. I’ll see if I can get you 
                        in, but I’ll have to pull strings.

                                 ROBBIE
                        No worries. I’m just going to stay 
                        in and study. Without VP on my 
                        resume, I might not even get into 
                        Rutgers.

                                 COREY
                        Relax, Robbie. We’ve got this!

           A few students wearing “SASHA SALES FOR PRESIDENT” PINS amble 
           by. Corey and Robbie exchange a nervous glance. 

           INT. MAIN OFFICE - HALLOWEEN DAY

           TIGHT ON THE TRAY OF COFFEES as Corey doles them out.

                                 COREY
                        Tall, skinny, caramel latte, Mo’.

           MONIQUE “MO” PEREZ (40’s, the Receptionist) takes her coffee.

                                 MONIQUE
                        Thanks, Handsome.

           Corey winces at handsome, before--

                                 COREY
                        So, any word on the competition? 

                                 MONIQUE
                        It ain’t looking good. Sasha Sales 
                        has 300 signatures.

                                 COREY
                        That bitch!

                                 DR. PITTS (O.S.)
                        Language, Mr. Wagner.

           DR. PITTS (50’s), the no-nonsense Principal, enters. She has 
           piercing eyes that peer through a mop of wild hair. 
                                 COREY
                        Apologies, Dr. Pitts. One black 
                        coffee for my favorite Principal. 

                                 DR. PITTS
                        Thanks, Corey. Do me a favor and 
                        take home our student handbook and 
                        review our language policy tonight.

           She studies his stylish outfit, particularly his DEEP V-NECK.

                                 DR. PITTS (CONT’D)
                        And while you’re at it, take a look 
                        at our dress code. Your shirt is 
                        basically touching your belly-
                        button. 

                                 COREY
                             (in jest)
                        Is my chest that distracting?
                             (off Dr. Pitts glare)
                        I’ll take a look at that handbook.

           INT. AP CALCULUS CLASS - HALLOWEEN DAY

           An AP CALCULUS TEACHER dozes off while the students take a 
           SCANTRON TEST. Corey lets an ENTIRE ROW of students lean over 
           to get a better look at his test. Corey turns and whispers--

                                 COREY
                        --Vote Wagner!

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        I had to get creative in order to 
                        beat Sasha Sales... 

           INT. HEALTH CLASS - HALLOWEEN DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        The wannabee, slutty cheerleaders 
                        needed help in Health Class...

           WANNABEE, SLUTTY CHEERLEADERS peek at Corey’s test sheet. 
           There’s a DIAGRAM OF “THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM” on the 
           CHALKBOARD in the background.
           INT. AP ITALIAN CLASS - HALLOWEEN DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        The cool Jews and the fantasy 
                        football loving Jews needed help 
                        with AP Italian...

           ONE ROW of stoner-type boys with flipped hair peek at Corey’s 
           scantron. ANOTHER ROW of boys wearing jerseys peek too.

           INT. AP GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS CLASS - HALLOWEEN DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        The Christian stoner lax players, 
                        and the Christian soccer jocks 
                        needed help in AP GOPO.

           ONE ROW of long haired DUDES lean over to get a look. ANOTHER 
           ROW of Brooks Brothers-esque soccer players, including 
           Hennie, lean over too.

           INT. AP BIOLOGY CLASS - HALLOWEEN DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        The “It” Girls all needed help in 
                        AP Bio, because they couldn’t 
                        remember anything aside from the 
                        outline of Mr. Shilp’s bulge. 

           TIGHT ON the LARGE OUTLINE of Mr. Shilp’s penis in his pants. 
           Corey’s eyes linger on Mr. Shilp’s bulge, while the “It” 
           Girls lean over to get a look at Corey’s test. 

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        But my talents weren’t limited to 
                        test answers...

           INT. AP ART CLASS - HALLOWEEN DAY

           We are underneath a DESK where TWO FEET are locked in a 
           FOOTSIE BATTLE. Nudging. Kicking. Stomping. Anything goes.  

                                 TEACHER (O.S.)
                        Wow, Neko. This is far and away 
                        your best work yet. I’m so proud of 
                        you! Neko. Neko?

           One FOOT kicks the shin of the other FOOT, HARD --

                                 NEKO (O.S.)
                        Ow!
           PULL UP to reveal that the foot on the losing end of the 
           footsie battle belongs to NEKO DEL FORNO (18, handsome to the 
           point of pretty), while the other belongs to Corey, sitting 
           next to him at the table. Neko looks like he should be an ass-
           hole but he’s actually a labrador retriever on the inside. 

           The hippy-dippy AP Art teacher, MRS HARTE, is mid-review of 
           NEKO’S ARTWORK in front of the CLASS. 

                                 MRS. HARTE 
                        Seriously Neko, you started this 
                        class drawing stick figures and now 
                        look at you.  

           Neko’s artwork are impressive STORYBOARDS drawn in pen. Neko 
           turns to Corey and smiles sheepishly. Dude has killer 
           dimples. Corey smiles back. Bites his lip. Bell rings. 

           INT. HALLWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - HALLOWEEN DAY

           Neko and Corey walk and talk, books in hand--  

                                 NEKO
                        I owe you big time.

                                 COREY
                        Not big time. Just your vote.

                                 NEKO
                        Seriously, those storyboards were 
                        dope. You have a gift my friend. 

           Neko pats Corey on the back. Corey blushes.

                                 COREY
                        It was all you. I just drew them 
                        how you said you wanted them. 

                                 NEKO
                        Well, I’ll vote for you under one 
                        condition. 

                                 COREY
                        Yeah, what’s that?

                                 NEKO
                        You have to be able to keep it a 
                        secret, because Sasha will cut off 
                        my balls if she finds out.

                                 COREY
                        I can keep a secret...
           That hangs in the air for a moment. 

                                 NEKO
                        Good. Anyway, I’ve gotta run. See 
                        you tonight. Remember the theme is 
                        movie characters. I’m a cinephile, 
                        so dress to impress-- 

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        Hey Stud!

           Sasha Sales interrupts their conversation and surprises Neko 
           with a JUICY KISS...

           ON COREY looking on longingly, before the other “IT” GIRLS 
           arrive on the scene, as we CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Corey, Hannah, Sasha, and the other “IT” GIRLS including 
           TAYLOR (mean because she’s insecure), and KEREN (understated 
           pretty, but ditsy) are mid-convo as they strut down the 
           hallway--

                                 TAYLOR
                        What if we went as the girls from 
                        Sex and the City? I could be 
                        Carrie. Corey could be our Mr. Big.

                                 SASHA
                        Get real, Taylor. You’re Samantha.

           Keren laughs. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Screw you, Keren. We all know you’d 
                        be Miranda. 

                                 KEREN
                        Hey! I like Miranda!

                                 SASHA
                        Or we could be Mean Girls?  
                             (pointed)
                        Corey, you could be the gay friend.

           The girls laugh at this mean spirited joke. Corey seethes. 
           Hannah notices, and diffuses the tension. Grabs Corey.

                                 HANNAH
                        No way! Corey’s my Aaron Samuels. 
           Hannah and Corey kiss in front of the other girls. It’s 
           forced.

                                 SASHA
                        Ewww get a room!

           The “It” Girls arrive outside “THE WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM”, 
           noted by a SIGN ABOVE THE DOOR. 

           PUSH IN ON COREY as he follows the “It” Girls through the 
           WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM DOOR--

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        The women’s locker-room is a 
                        magical kingdom...

           HIGH ANGLE VIEW OF THE “WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM”--

           AS WE CUE A BUSBY BERKELEY MUSICAL NUMBER IN TECHNICOLOR...

           GIRLS do an intricate choreographed dance in between the 
           LOCKERS as they change into MATCHING GYM OUTFITS and start 
           primping in synchronized movements. A LINE OF GIRLS put their 
           hair in high ponytails, snap on bras, and apply chapstick.

           The girls all form a CIRCLE around a QUEEN BEE who 
           demonstrates how to apply make-up in the MIRROR, she’s the 
           ultimate feminine ideal. The girls break apart to REVEAL--

           The QUEEN BEE is COREY AS A GIRL. The other girls raise Corey 
           HIGH ABOVE their heads, before we--

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Mr. Wagner! 

           SMASH BACK TO OUTSIDE THE WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM:

           ON COREY snapping out of his day-dream, when MS. MAZZA (40’s, 
           Female Gym Teacher) a conservative woman with short hair, 
           startles him, and blocks him from entering the DOOR.

                                 MS. MAZZA
                        Wrong locker room, Corey.

                                 COREY
                        Right. But could I just have like 
                        five minutes in there? We were all 
                        planning an orgy with oils and le 
                        Labo candles. 

                                 MS. MAZZA
                             (shaking her head)
                        Always the smart aleck, Wagner. 
           Corey trudges towards the MEN’S LOCKER ROOM.

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        The girls get paradise, meanwhile 
                        I’m relegated to the third level of 
                        hell...

           INT. MEN’S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

           COREY looks miserable sitting on a bench in the middle of the 
           locker room as PUBESCENT BOYS change into their work out 
           uniforms, and engage in “locker room talk” that we can’t 
           hear, but Corey doesn’t appreciate. 

           WE’RE IN COREY’S POV of arm pit hair, happy trails, tri-cep 
           muscles - all the signs of boys becoming men that Corey 
           doesn’t identify with. 

           Corey’s eyes linger on the chest of a HOT GUY, and tries not 
           to stare. Maybe the men’s locker room isn’t so bad?

           LATER - Only when the locker room is EMPTY, does Corey feel 
           comfortable changing into his gym outfit. 

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        After a long day, there’s only one 
                        thing that cheers me up...

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           A WONDERLAND OF COSMETICS are splayed out on a VANITY. Corey 
           puts the finishing touches on Hannah’s HALLOWEEN MAKE-UP, 
           before Hannah studies her reflection in the mirror.

                                 HANNAH
                        It looks like you put lipstick on a 
                        pig.

                                 COREY
                        Shuttup. You look gorgeous, bitch.  

           Hannah leans her head on Corey’s shoulder.

                                 HANNAH
                        I love you, Corey. I think I’m 
                        ready. 

                                 COREY
                        Agreed. Your outfit is on point.
                                 HANNAH
                        No, like... ready, ready. I want to 
                        lose my virginity tonight. To you.
                             (off Corey’s look)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 COREY
                        Nothing... I just never pictured 
                        losing my virginity in a Ferris 
                        Bueller costume. 

           Corey stares down at his FERRIS BUELLER COSTUME, replete with 
           the iconic Leopard Vest.

                                 HANNAH
                        But you’ll make me moan-
                             (fake orgasming)
                        Bueller, Bueller, BUELLER!

                                 COREY
                             (laughs, then--)
                        I was more of a Sloane Peterson 
                        fan.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, no pressure. I just think it 
                        could be fun.

                                 COREY
                             (uncomfortable)
                        No-yeah. I mean, yeah-no. Totally. 
                        I’d love to... Let’s do it.

           Hannah hugs Corey, ecstatic. ON COREY’S conflicted face, 
           before Hannah pulls away, and looks at her watch--

                                 HANNAH
                        Shit! I’ve got to get going. Sorry 
                        you can’t come to the pre-game. 
                        It’s just girls, y’know?

                                 COREY
                        It’s cool. Everyone would flip if I 
                        didn’t schmooze a little here 
                        first.

                                 HANNAH
                        Thanks for making me feel hot 
                        tonight. Sometimes I wish I had 
                        your cheekbones. You’d look so hot 
                        as a girl.  
           They both stare in the mirror. Corey blushes. Hannah gives 
           Corey a kiss on the head, before darting out. Corey stews at 
           the vanity, staring at himself. Thinking... before we CUT TO:

           LATER - Corey applies mascara in the vanity, a pro. He looks 
           in the mirror, make-up fully done. Frowns. Thinks. Darts out 
           of frame. Re-enters wearing a BLEACHED BLONDE WIG, fully 
           transforming into “REGINA GEORGE” for the evening.

           INT. STAIRCASE, WAGNER HOME - HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           The wall on the staircase is a shrine of FAMILY PORTRAITS. A 
           PINK HEEL struts by a PHOTO of Young Corey in a pumpkin 
           patch. 

           REVEAL Corey strutting down the stairs past his BABY PICTURES 
           with confidence, while-- 

           IN THE LIVING ROOM--

           We find what normally is a neat, shabby chic home decked out 
           in ELABORATE HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS and packed with mingling 
           PARENTS for a shindig - Corey’s parents are clearly popular.

           IN THE CROWD WE FIND - Judy (dressed as Sandy from Grease) 
           mid-conversation with Steven (dressed as Danny Zuko), BABA (a 
           silver-foxed Grandpa, dressed as James Dean in Rebel) and 
           GRANDMA (dressed as Anna Wintour, or maybe that’s just her 
           outfit). Their jaws drop as they catch sight of Corey walking 
           down the staircase, who is out of earshot--

                                 BABA
                        Remember when the Therapist told us 
                        to buy Corey more “boy toys”?

           Grandma elbows Baba.

                                 BABA (CONT’D)
                        Ow! What? What’d I say?

                                 STEVEN
                        Wow, Corey got your legs, Judy.

           Judy elbows Steven.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Ow! What? What’d I say?

           Corey walks up to the GANG, now in earshot. Strikes a pose. 
           (NOTE: We may notice other PARENTS exchanging curious glances 
           in the background)
                                 COREY
                        How do I look?

                                 BABA
                        What are you?

                                 COREY
                        Guess, Baba?

                                 BABA
                        Confused.

                                 JUDY
                        Dad!

                                 COREY
                        Guess again.

                                 BABA
                        Target practice.

                                 STEVEN
                        Baba!

                                 GRANDMA
                        Are you really going to let Corey 
                        go out in a skirt that short, Judy? 

                                 BABA
                        Or in a skirt period!?

                                 JUDY
                        It’s Halloween, relax.

                                 COREY
                        Yeah, people dress however they 
                        want. It’s funny. I’m Regina 
                        George.

                                 BABA
                        Vampires are funny. Ghouls are 
                        hysterical. My high school grandson 
                        still wearing dresses is--

                                 JUDY
                             (cutting Baba off)
                        Dad, enough. You’re not funny.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Corey, ignore this fossil. He’s 
                        kidding!

                                 BABA
                        I’m not kidding.
           Judy nudges Grandpa.

                                 BABA (CONT’D)
                        Ow! I guess I’m kidding.

                                 GRANDMA
                        Apparently he’s suffering from 
                        dementia. 

                                 BABA
                        Boys are forgetting how to dress, 
                        and I’m the one with dementia.
                             (off their look)
                        What? I’m kidding! I’m kidding! 

           Grandma takes a long sip of her chardonnay. Awkward silence. 
           Steven fills the void--

                                 STEVEN
                        You know I had to dress as a woman, 
                        disguising herself as a man, when I 
                        was cast as Rosalind in “As You 
                        Like It?” It was off-off Broadway, 
                        but I got some tremendous reviews.
                        You loved that show, Baba.

           The gang roll their eyes. Annoyed, Corey snatches the glass 
           of wine out of Grandma’s hand and chugs it down. 

           EXT. FRONT LAWN, WAGNER HOME - HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           The door whips open. Corey’s heels click on the pavement. 

                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        Corey, hold on--

           Corey spins around, as Judy exits the house and catches up. 

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you want a ride?

                                 COREY
                        I can walk.

                                 JUDY
                        You sure? It’s chilly out.

                                 COREY
                        I’m fine.

                                 JUDY
                        Sorry about Baba. He just had a 
                        little too much to drink. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        Are you sure you don’t want to 
                        maybe change into something else? 

                                 COREY
                        What do you want me to change into?

                                 JUDY
                        Nothing... I just...

           Judy would never say she’s worried about Corey getting 
           bullied for his outfit, so instead she goes with--

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        I just don’t want you to catch a 
                        cold is all.

                                 COREY
                        I’ll make sure to drink a lot of 
                        booze to warm me up then, Mom. 

           Judy is concerned for Corey, as she watches him strut away 
           into the night, past a MOM, DAD and their BUMBLE BEE DAUGHTER 
           ‘trick or treating’. 

           The Dad turns to check Corey’s ass out as Corey passes. Mom 
           catches Dad with an annoyed glance. Dad shrugs, what?

                                                               SLAM TO:

           INT. SUBURBAN MCMANSION - HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           We’re HANGING FROM THE CHANDELIER with a view of a raucous 
           Halloween costume party in full swing. 

           CAMERA dives down as the door whips open to find Corey.

           We’re on Corey’s face going through an emotional roller 
           coaster ride as he enters the party. We feel Corey’s 
           apprehension. Fear. Excitement. All Corey’s emotions morph 
           into joy as he realizes heads are turning.

           THE PARTY-GOERS react as Corey passes. They say things like 
           ‘Omg is that Corey!?’, ‘Looking good, Mr. President, or is it 
           MRS. PRESIDENT!?’ Some WHISTLE. Some CAT-CALL. While the 
           Partygoers all take it as a “joke” costume, we’ll get the 
           sense of just how much this validation means to Corey. 

           Corey approaches the “IT” Girls standing in a huddle by the 
           fireplace. Hannah is the first to recognize Corey--

                                 HANNAH
                        No fucking way!
           Hannah races to Corey and starts hopping up and down around 
           him, in celebration. She pulls Corey in close-- 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe how fucking good 
                        you look! Is it weird that I’m like 
                        way more turned on now?

           The other “It” Girls join them and ad lib how much they love 
           his costume, before--

                                 NEKO (O.S.)
                        Holy shit, Corey?! Is that you!?

           Corey whips around to find NEKO (dressed in an elaborate 
           MARLON BRANDO GODFATHER COSTUME). Neko claps. Corey shows off 
           the outfit. Sticks out his butt. 

                                 COREY
                        Are you impressed?

                                 NEKO
                        Mean Girls won’t make the Criterion 
                        Collection, but it’s certainly a 
                        guilty pleasure. Come play some 
                        pong with me? Be my Consigliere.

                                 SASHA
                        I thought I was your partner?

                                 NEKO
                        Babe, beer pong is a guy thing. 

                                 COREY
                             (half joking)
                        Then why am I allowed?

                                 NEKO
                        You know what I mean, Corey.

                                 COREY
                        Screw it, let’s do it.

           Neko and Corey dart to the beer pong table, leaving Sasha and 
           Hannah awkwardly sipping their cups, as we CUT TO:

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - Neko and Corey cheers after hitting a beer pong shot.

           - Corey sabers a bottle of champagne, and starts pouring the 
           bubbly into red solo cups. 

           - Corey wins a game of flip cup before the table cheers. 
           - Corey sits on a couch flirting with a DRUNK DUDE--

                                 DRUNK DUDE 
                        So where are you from, Gorgeous? 

           Corey can’t withhold a giggle, loving this moment. 

           Corey locks eyes with Neko across the room, who is watching 
           and getting a kick out of it too. Their eyes linger on each 
           other a beat too long. It’s clear they have chemistry.

           - ON SASHA pissed. 

           - ON HANNAH chugging a bottle of Jack Daniels by herself.

           - ON COREY grinning ear to ear. The belle of the ball.

           LATER - SAME

           Neko leans into Corey. Are they going to have a moment? 

                                 SASHA (O.S.)
                        Neko!

           They’re interrupted when Sasha throws her arm around Neko. 

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        I want to show you something... 
                        Upstairs. It’s top secret.

                                 NEKO
                        What’s top secret?
                             (beat, getting it)
                        Oh right, sorry Corey, we need to  
                        find the horses head in my parent’s 
                        bedroom. If you know what I mean?

           Neko winks and leads a confused Sasha upstairs. Corey watches 
           them longingly. Then looks around the room and sees BOYS and 
           GIRLS making out everywhere. COUPLES are starting to 
           disappear into other rooms. Suddenly, Corey hears a SMASH. 
           Hannah knocks over an end table, and wobbles over--

                                 HANNAH
                        Corey! Let’s go upstairs. I am 
                        going to blow your--

           Hannah gets up in Corey’s grill. Licks his face, before--

           INT. BEDROOM, SUBURBAN MCMANSION - LATE HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           Hannah is passed out in bed, snoring loudly. Corey tucks her 
           in. Sits at the edge of the bed. Thinks. 
           INT. SUBURBAN MCMANSION - LATE HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           The party is now a ghost town. Corey ambles toward the door, 
           heading home, when he hears--

                                 HENNIE (O.S.)
                        If it isn’t the King Fag himself.

           Corey turns to find Hennie rolling a joint on a couch, alone. 
           He’s dressed as Matt McConaughey in Dazed and Confused. 

                                 COREY
                        Hennie, I’m not in the mood.

                                 HENNIE 
                        Shouldn’t you be porking the pig 
                        right now?

           Corey stomps over in his heels and gets in Hennie’s face.

                                 COREY
                        Did you ever think that if you 
                        weren’t such an asshole you 
                        wouldn’t be all alone at two in the 
                        morning at a party?

                                 HENNIE
                        Chill out, dude. I’m joking. You’re 
                        too sensitive. 
                             (offering a joint)
                        You need a hit.

                                 COREY
                        ... Maybe.

                                 HENNIE 
                        Y’know, you actually look kind of 
                        hot as a girl.

                                 COREY
                             (sarcastic)
                        Um... Thanks. That’s the nicest 
                        thing you’ve ever said to me.

                                 HENNIE 
                        Seriously. I’d even bang you.

           Beat. Corey and Hennie share a look filled with surprised 
           sexual tension, before--
           EXT. SUBURBAN MCMANSION - LATE HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           Hennie and Corey make out intensely on the side of the ivy 
           covered house. Corey starts unbuckling Hennie’s pants, when--

                                 VOICE (O.S)
                        WHO’S THERE? 

           TWO PEOPLE enter the clearing so Hennie and Corey straighten 
           out their outfits trying to “act natural.”

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD, HENNIE? COREY!? IS THAT 
                        YOU!?

                                 HENNIE 
                             (panicked)
                        We were-- we were just smoking!

           The TWO PEOPLE start LAUGHING LOUDLY in disbelief.

                                 HENNIE (CONT’D)
                        Nothing happened! Shut up!

           Corey panics, and starts running away in his heels. Trips. 
           Splays out on the ground in the mud, SPLAT. MORE LAUGHTER, 
           before--

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           Corey sprints down the street, barefoot, holding his heels. 
           His face is anguished. He turns off the road, into a PARK 
           ADJACENT TO A TRAIN STATION--

           EXT. PARK - LATE HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           -- and comes to a stop at the edge of a small BRIDGE. Takes a 
           deep breath. Looks over the edge. Thinks. Corey is backlit by 
           the approaching lights of a train. The ominous TRAIN WHISTLE, 
           morphs into--

           INT. BATHROOM - FLASHBACK

           -- the WHISTLE of steam coming out of a faucet in a hot bath. 

           Young Corey, around Bar Mitzvah age, has a towel wrapped 
           around his head as he soaks in the tub. Corey is reading a 
           PEOPLE MAGAZINE with a cover that is of a MALE TO FEMALE 
           TRANSGENDER PERSON. Corey takes a deep breath, working up the 
           courage to do something...
           INT. YOUNG JUDY’S OFFICE - FLASHBACK CONTINUED

           Young Corey enters Young Judy's study in the BASEMENT. We 
           witness this moment from what feels like the corner of the 
           room, next to a blanket that says COREY’S BAR MITZVAH. Young 
           Corey shows Young Judy the People Magazine--

                                 YOUNG COREY
                        What do you think about this?

           Young Judy looks at the magazine cover and flips through it.

                                 YOUNG JUDY
                        What do you mean?

                                 YOUNG COREY
                        Do you think transgender is real, 
                        or are they just covering up being 
                        gay? 

                                 YOUNG JUDY
                        This is a real thing. I think they 
                        really have those feelings of being 
                        trapped in the wrong body.  

           Young Corey gets emotional. Sits down on Young Judy’s lap. 

                                 YOUNG COREY
                        Mom, I want to be a girl. 

                                 YOUNG JUDY
                        Are you sure? 

                                 YOUNG COREY
                        Yes. 

           Young Corey cries into Young Judy’s shoulder. She pulls Young 
           Corey in close...

           LATER - Young Corey wipes tears away, calmed by Young Judy’s 
           acceptance and unconditional love. 

                                 YOUNG COREY (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t tell anyone.

                                 YOUNG JUDY
                        I have to tell Steven.

                                 YOUNG COREY
                        Okay, but no one else! Especially 
                        not Matthew! 

                                 YOUNG JUDY
                        Okay, Sweetheart.
                                 YOUNG COREY
                        Do you think I’ll be able to go to 
                        High School as a girl?

                                 YOUNG JUDY
                        I don’t know if that’s possible, 
                        Corey. But we’ll see.

                                 YOUNG COREY
                        You always tell me to just be 
                        myself, but how can I be myself if 
                        I keep dressing like a boy?

           This is a tricky question for Judy to answer. She wants to 
           support Corey unconditionally, but she also wants to protect 
           Corey. Off Young Judy’s conflicted look, we--

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOOM - LATE HALLOWEEN NIGHT

           Corey is mid wiping off his Regina George make up. He wipes 
           off one side of his face first. Studies the result. HALF of 
           his face is “glammed up,” while the other HALF is now “boy 
           Corey.” Corey takes this in, and starts to tear up, before 
           his bedroom door creaks open, and Judy peaks her head in--

                                 JUDY
                        Corey? Are you okay?

           Judy clocks his smeared mascara and Halloween outfit caked in 
           mud - clearly not okay. 

           MOMENTS LATER - Judy leads Corey into bed and cuddles him. 

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           Corey lays his head on Judy’s chest.

                                 COREY
                        It just felt so good tonight to 
                        dress up Mom. And then it all got 
                        fucked up...

                                 JUDY
                        How? Talk to me.
                                 COREY
                        It doesn’t even matter... All I 
                        know is that every day feels like 
                        Halloween, and I’m tired of wearing 
                        a costume. I can’t do it anymore.  
                        I just want to be a girl already. 

                                 JUDY
                        I know, Sweetheart, I know. So I 
                        didn’t want to get you excited 
                        until I knew for sure, but I 
                        finally found a doctor who will see 
                        you.

           Corey’s eyes light up. He props up in bed--

                                 COREY
                        Are you serious!? 

           Judy smiles, and nods yes - excited too. Corey let’s out a 
           SQUEAL OF JOY and kicks his legs excited - Fuck yes!

                                 JUDY
                        I’m so, so sorry it’s taken this 
                        long. You know I’ve been trying my 
                        hardest--

                                 COREY
                        I know you have.

           They embrace, as we CUT TO:

           HIGH ABOVE SUBURBIA--

           Soaring over the Short Hills neighborhood again.

           We slowly pull back, until we pull back through the window of 
           a high-rise apartment building, and find COREY staring out 
           the window. He turns, and takes us on a brief tour of--

           INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           -- a zen apartment. Incense burns. Peaceful music hums. Corey 
           sits on a plush couch next to Judy, who rubs his back.

                                 COREY
                        So that’s my story. My mom found 
                        your company, and now we’re here. 
           REVEAL the Voice Over has been Corey telling his story to a 
           psychologist, DR. MARGIE DIME (50’s) sitting across from 
           Corey in a chair taking notes on a notepad. Margie has short 
           spikey hair, a sleeve of tattoos, and a deep, raspy voice.

                                 MARGIE
                        Thank you for being so open and 
                        honest with your story, Corey. It’s 
                        extremely helpful.

                                 COREY
                        After hearing everything, do you 
                        think I’m transgender? 

                                 MARGIE
                        Well--

                                 COREY
                             (interrupting)
                        Like am I a girl? Can I ever be a 
                        real girl? Is that really possible? 

                                 MARGIE
                        Well --

                                 COREY
                             (interrupting again)
                        I just have so many questions for 
                        you, like my mind is racing. 

                                 JUDY
                        Corey, let Dr. Dime speak.

                                 COREY
                        Oh shit, sorry. I’m sorry for 
                        interrupting. And for cursing. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Corey, this is a safe place. Feel 
                        free to curse all you want. Shit. 
                        Piss. Fuck. Mother Fuck. I don’t 
                        give a rat’s ass. 

           Judy’s eyes bulge.

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Also, feel free to interrupt me all 
                        you want. This time, our time 
                        together, is for me to listen to 
                        you, but more importantly it’s for 
                        you to listen to yourself. I sense 
                        you’ve been trying to ignore that 
                        voice inside you for some time now. 
           Corey takes this in. She’s right. 

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Yes, Corey you seem to fit the mold 
                        of a transgender person. Though 
                        everyone expresses it differently. 
                        Some children express their 
                        transgender identity as little kids 
                        by trying to cut off their genitals-

           Corey winces at the thought.

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Other transgender people express 
                        their identity when they’re way 
                        older. No two people’s transitions 
                        are the same. 

                                 COREY
                        So if I’m transgender, can I become 
                        a real girl with a vagina?

                                 MARGIE
                        Yes, you can become a girl with a 
                        vagina through sexual reassignment 
                        surgery. But it will be a long 
                        journey. We would have to start 
                        meeting once a week for at-least a 
                        year, and should also set you up 
                        with an endocrinologist. We’ll want 
                        to put you on hormone blockers as 
                        soon as possible.  

                                 JUDY
                             (pumping the breaks)
                        Um, are you sure it’s a good idea 
                        to start taking medication? I’ve 
                        read that you can get breast cancer 
                        from going on them, and Corey’s 
                        already on Adderall and a bunch of 
                        other stuff. 

                                 MARGIE
                        We’ll find the right plan that is 
                        safe for Corey.

                                 JUDY
                        Couldn’t we wait until the summer 
                        before college to be safe?
                                 MARGIE
                        I wouldn’t recommend that. Corey is 
                        clearly a late bloomer, which is 
                        lucky in your case, because she 
                        doesn’t have facial hair or chest 
                        hair, but her voice is starting to 
                        deepen and we’ll want to prevent 
                        the effects of male puberty. 

                                 COREY
                        Did you just say “her” and “she”?

                                 MARGIE
                        Yes I did. 

           Corey smiles. SHE likes it! (NOTE: From this point on in this 
           script Corey will be referred to using HER proper pronouns. 
           Now that SHE is transitioning and outwardly expressing HER 
           true gender identity, we will mark it as such in the script)

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Ultimately, Corey you’re going to 
                        have to choose to transition at a 
                        pace you feel comfortable with. 

           Corey and Judy are left with a lot to mull over, before--

                                 COREY (PRE-LAP)
                        Don’t stop me now! I’m having such 
                        a good time! 

           INT. CAR - IN MOTION - DAY

           Corey sings QUEEN’S “DON’T STOP ME NOW” with pizazz, while 
           Judy drives with one hand on the wheel, and the other biting 
           her cuticle nervously. THE MUSIC CARRIES OVER--

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey excitedly sketches at the drafting table, her happy 
           place. Corey sketches FASHION-STYLE DRAWINGS of her dreams of 
           the future: A SKETCH of her as a GIRL making out with a BOY. 
           A SKETCH of her trying on a flowing DRESS. A SKETCH of her 
           with a PROM TIARA. She smiles. 

           INT. WAGNER HOME - NIGHT

           Judy compulsively cleans her already immaculately clean home. 
           She vacuums, swiffers, organizes closets, makes sure her 
           bookcases are color coded. They are. There should be a manic, 
           restless quality to her tidying. 
           Judy straightens a BABY PICTURE OF COREY hanging on the wall. 
           We catch a glimpse of JUDY’S FACE in the reflection of the 
           glass. We’re not quite sure what Judy’s feeling now. Maybe 
           she’s not either, as we END MONTAGE:

           EXT. HANNAH GREEN’S MANSION - NIGHT

           Establishing shot. 

           INT. HANNAH’S MASSIVE BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey has just filled Hannah in on her gender identity, and 
           Hannah is not sure how to take it--

                                 HANNAH
                        You’re joking, right? You’re not 
                        serious.

                                 COREY
                        That would be a pretty messed up 
                        joke, Hannah. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Corey. Trust me. You’re not a girl.
                        You’re probably just gay. Stop 
                        being so dramatic.

                                 COREY
                             (not cool)
                        Hannah!

                                 HANNAH
                        What? I’m serious. You seem 
                        confused right now, so I’ll go easy 
                        on you, but let me clear something 
                        up, if you choose to start dressing 
                        as a “girl” it’s going to be the 
                        end of your social life.  

                                 COREY
                        ... I don’t care.

                                 HANNAH
                        You don’t care? Please. You care 
                        more than anyone about being 
                        popular.

                                 COREY
                        Not true.
                             (beat)
                        Okay, half true.
                                 HANNAH
                        I’m your best friend, Corey. Your 
                        girlfriend for chrissakes. I know 
                        you better than you know yourself. 
                        You love getting to go to parties, 
                        and gossiping with the “It” girls 
                        at lunch.

                                 COREY
                        So?

                                 HANNAH
                        So? You are going to be a pariah if 
                        this gets around, and you’re going 
                        to take me down with your crazy 
                        ass. Which is why I’m not going to 
                        let you do this to us. 

                                 COREY
                        Hannah, the wheels are in motion. 
                        I’ve waited for so long to be able 
                        to be my true self and I can’t go 
                        backwards now. People already know 
                        I hooked up with Hennie--

                                 HANNAH
                        Which I should be pissed about as 
                        your girlfriend!

                                 COREY
                        Oh please. Let’s stop living in a 
                        fantasy world. We both know that 
                        deep down you’ve been dating me to 
                        protect me, because you love me.

                                 HANNAH
                        Part of me thought that we would 
                        work out... Or hoped we would. But 
                        now that we won’t, I’m not going to 
                        let you commit social suicide, 
                        because, yes, I do love you. 

           Corey takes a serious beat.

                                 COREY
                        I don’t know how to be anymore 
                        clear than this Hannah. I’m a girl. 
                        I may have dressed as a boy, but 
                        I’ve always been a girl, and I know 
                        you’ve always known that.

           Hannah takes a deep breath. Thinks. Maybe she has known.
                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        You say you’re my best friend, but 
                        best friends are there for each 
                        other, and believe each other. 

           We may think that Hannah is won over, before she retorts--

                                 HANNAH
                        Is this some crazy way out of 
                        getting out of dating me? Because 
                        we totally don’t have to have sex. 
                        I can lose weight. Whatever you 
                        want. Just please, please don’t do 
                        this!

                                 COREY
                        I can’t fucking believe you right 
                        now!

           Corey storms out and SLAMS the door shut, as we linger on 
           Hannah’s conflicted face fighting tears.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Establishing Short Hills Main Street which consists of Bougie 
           shops, including SALON LA MODE, where Judy works. 

           INT. JUDY’S CAR - IN MOTION - MORNING

           Judy, driving, and Corey, in the passenger seat, park in 
           front of the Salon. Judy clocks Corey sulking.

                                 JUDY
                        So I thought it would be nice to 
                        have a girls day. You and me. We 
                        can play hooky, and give you a make-
                        over. Whaddya say?

           Corey smiles, needing to be cheered up. 

           INT. SALON LA MODE - AFTERNOON

           This is the rumor mill of Short Hills. We get quick snippets 
           of SOCCER MOMS gossiping while getting mani pedis, before 
           Judy and Corey enter the salon-- 

                                 JUDY
                        At ease ladies.
           Judy sets up at her beauty station, while Corey sets her 
           things down. The Soccer Moms observe Corey curiously. 

           Judy and Corey sit down at the SINKS, and Judy rinses Corey’s 
           hair. IT’S PART MASSAGE, PART CATHARTIC RELEASE... 

           LATER - Corey sits with FOILS in her hair as Judy does a 
           Soccer Mom’s make-up. Her name is SHARA. Shara chimes in--

                                 SHARA 
                        What are you doing out of school?

                                 COREY
                        Came down with a bad case of 
                        Senioritis.

                                 JUDY
                        Lies. I’m a terrible mother, Shara.

                                 SHARA
                        You’re fine. So are you going for 
                        the bleached blonde, teen heart-
                        throb look, Corey?

                                 COREY
                        Something like that...

                                 SHARA
                        Cool. Just don’t let the grades 
                        slip too much, or you won’t get 
                        into your first choice. Where are 
                        you going to school next year?

           Corey is about to speak, when Judy answers for her--

                                 JUDY
                        Corey’s thinking about going to NYU 
                        for fashion design. Corey’s an 
                        amazing designer. 

                                 SHARA
                        Oh... 

                                 COREY
                        I’m not crazy about NYU’s Design 
                        School though. I’m actually 
                        thinking about going to UCLA.

                                 JUDY
                        The west coast is out of the 
                        question, Corey. We’ve talked about 
                        this.
                                 COREY
                        Yeah, but why? UCLA is a better 
                        school than NYU.

                                 JUDY
                        You need to be close to home for--
                             (beat, looks at Shara)
                        Let’s just talk about this later...

           INT. JUDY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey, now with beautiful BLONDE HIGHLIGHTS, is mid trying on 
           Judy’s clothes in her walk in closet, wearing a blouse that’s 
           too tight, and bell bottom jeans that are too big. 

                                 JUDY
                        You’re going to need to be close 
                        for your appointments with Margie, 
                        and other doctors appointments once 
                        you start your hormone treatment.  

                                 COREY
                        They have doctors in California, 
                        Mom, and plus I can have calls with 
                        Margie. 
                             (re: the outfit)
                        Be honest, you hate it.

                                 JUDY
                        I love the pants, but the blouse is 
                        not very flattering. It makes your 
                        shoulders look broad. 

                                 COREY
                        I look like a linebacker.

                                 JUDY
                        You don’t look like a linebacker! 
                        Here try this. 

           As Corey tries on a new BLOUSE--

                                 COREY
                        I’m not going to apply early 
                        decision. I want to keep my options 
                        open.
                             (then)
                        Ugh, my ribs are too big for your 
                        clothes!

           Judy offers up a CARDIGAN--
                                 JUDY
                        I really don’t like the idea of you 
                        being that far away from home, but-- 
                             (re: Corey’s outfit)
                        Ooo! I like that! You look dainty!

                                 COREY
                        Hmmm, it’s missing something.

           Corey rummages in Judy’s immaculate closet, when Judy’s phone 
           RINGS... It’s Matthew, Corey’s brother, calling--

                                 JUDY
                             (into the phone)
                        What’s up, Matthew? I’m just here 
                        playing hooky with Corey.

           Corey pops out from inside the closet, and gestures: “Don’t 
           Tell Matthew!”

           Judy nods, and gestures: “okay, okay”.  

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                             (into the phone)
                        Love you, Matthew. Let’s talk 
                        later, okay?
                             (beat listening)
                        I know, we’ll see you so soon. Bye. 
                        Love you.

           Judy hangs up the call.

                                 COREY
                        I want to tell him in person over 
                        the holidays. 

                                 JUDY
                        You sure you don’t want me to let 
                        him know first, so he’s not 
                        surprised?  

           Corey nods, yes. Then heads back into the closet on a mission-  

                                 COREY (O.S.)
                        Found it!

           Corey comes out wearing a CHOKER. They both share a satisfied 
           look, as we CUT TO: 

           INT. JUDY’S CAR - THE NEXT MORNING

           Judy’s car comes to a stop on the drop off line. Corey is 
           wearing JUDY’S OUTFIT AND CHOKER and looks great. 
           (NOTE: Corey’s new outfit should be somewhat androgynous. Her 
           transition to full female wardrobe will take some time)

                                 JUDY
                        I love you, Corey. You look so...
                        Beautiful.

           Corey beams. This means the world to her.

           Judy brushes her hand through Corey’s hair. We may sense how 
           nervous Judy is for Corey, but she tries her best to hide it.

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Call me if you need anything today, 
                        Sweetheart, okay? Anything.

           Corey nods, appreciative. Takes a deep breath, and then--

           INT. ENTRYWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           -- enters Short Hills High apprehensively in her NEW WARDROBE 
           holding her tray of coffees. 

                                 ROBBIE (O.S.)
                        Hey Corey.

           Corey turns to find Robbie, who doesn’t blink an eye at her 
           outfit. 

                                 COREY
                        Hi Robbie.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Cool shirt!

           Corey gives Robbie a suspicious once over, unsure if he’s 
           being genuine or not.

                                 COREY
                        ... Thanks. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        I could never pull that off on 
                        account of my mane of chest hair. 
                        But you look aces. 

                                 COREY
                        Did you hear about what happened on 
                        Halloween? Is that why you’re 
                        acting so weird?
                                 ROBBIE
                             (lying)
                        Me. What? No? Something happened?

                                 COREY
                        I love you, Robbie, but you are a 
                        terrible liar. I’m surprised that 
                        you’re still talking to me. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Why wouldn’t I?

                                 COREY
                        You heard the rumors. There’s no 
                        way we’re winning the election. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        No. Maybe you’re right, but I 
                        didn’t really care about winning 
                        anyway. 

                                 COREY
                        Like I said, you’re a terrible 
                        liar. 

           Corey clocks STUDENTS gawking and whispering about her.

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        Well, here goes nothing. See ya 
                        later Robbie. 

           Corey struts down the hallway ignoring the gawkers, until--

                                 HENNIE (O.S.)
                        Corey!

           Corey turns to find Hennie, who’s pissed off.

                                 HENNIE (CONT’D)
                        We need to talk.
                             (noticing Corey’s outfit)
                        What the hell are you wearing?

           Corey rolls her eyes. Then strides down the hallway leaving 
           Hennie in her wake. Hennie hustles to catch up, as Corey 
           arrives at her LOCKER. Hennie leans in, talks in a whisper--

                                 HENNIE (CONT’D)
                        You need to tell people that we 
                        didn’t hook up.
                                 COREY
                        I’m not going to go around and lie 
                        for you Hennie. But I’m also not 
                        going to share my business either.

                                 HENNIE
                        But I’m not a fag, Corey! 

                                 COREY
                        Just because we hooked up, doesn’t 
                        mean you’re gay.

                                 HENNIE
                        Of course it does. You’re a dude.
                             (then vulnerable)
                        If my Dad finds out he’ll kill me. 
                        Please. 

                                 COREY
                        I’m not a dude, Hennie. 
                             (off Hennie’s confused 
                              look)
                        You’re still straight, but don’t 
                        project your insecurities on me.

           Corey slams her locker shut.

           INT. MAIN OFFICE, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           Corey doles out coffee to Monique, who stares at her new 
           outfit. Shocked, but acting natural. 

                                 COREY
                        Tall, skinny, caramel latte, Mo’.

                                 MONIQUE
                        Thanks, uh, Corey. 

           Dr. Pitts enters distracted. Corey hands her a coffee.

                                 COREY
                        And one black coffee for my 
                        favorite Principal. 

           Dr. Pitts stops in her tracks noticing the outfit, alarmed.

                                 DR. PITTS 
                        Thank you, Corey.  
                                 COREY
                        I wanted to let you know, I’m going 
                        to be dropping out of the 
                        presidential race so feel free to 
                        take my name off the ballot for the 
                        vote today. 

                                 DR. PITTS
                        That’s too bad, but thanks for 
                        letting us know.

           Corey exits, leaving Dr. Pitts stone-faced.

                                 MONIQUE
                        I don’t know if it’s up to code but 
                        Corey really pulls off that blouse, 
                        Dr. P. 

           INT. AP ART CLASS - DAY

           TIGHT ON TWO PAIRS OF FEET below a desk. There’s no footsie 
           battle this time. PULL UP to find Neko and Corey sitting as 
           far away from each other as possible. 

           Neko is clearly uncomfortable with Corey’s new wardrobe, but 
           trying not to show it so he pretends to be very interested in 
           what the teacher is saying. 

           Corey tries to make eye-contact with Neko. No dice. Neko’s 
           cold shoulder kills Corey, but she tries to hide it.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

           Corey ambles down the hallway when she spots the “It” Girls 
           in a huddle around HANNAH’S LOCKER. They immediately stop 
           talking as they see Corey approaching--

                                 COREY
                        Hi Guys!

                                 SASHA
                             (to the others)
                        We’ve gotta get to class. 

                                 KEREN
                        Hi, Corey.

                                 SASHA
                        Let’s go, Keren. Jesus!
           Keren who didn’t get the memo that they’re not talking to 
           Corey, realizes her mistake, and darts out with the other 
           girls. 

           Hannah is the last to leave. She’s frozen at her locker for a 
           conflicted beat, before she exits, leaving Corey alone.

           INT. AP BIOLOGY - DAY

                                 MR. SHILP
                        Human females have a homologous 
                        pair of X chromosomes...

           Mr. Shilp drones on in the background about Meiosis as the 
           “It” Girls WHISPER LOUDLY in the back of the classroom. They 
           are loud enough that Corey hears them sitting in the front.

                                 SASHA
                        What is Corey wearing?

                                 TAYLOR
                        It looks like his mom’s clothes 
                        from the 70’s.

                                 SASHA
                        He looks like a pirate.

                                 TAYLOR
                        A butt pirate. 

           The “It” Girls giggle, while Hannah looks tortured. 

           ON COREY clenching his fists.

                                 SASHA
                        You can see his nipples through 
                        that blouse. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        I know they’re super pointy.

           And with that Hannah snaps in her LOUDEST WHISPER--

                                 HANNAH
                        Don’t make fun of Corey’s nipples 
                        just because they’re nicer than 
                        your flat chest, Taylor!

           The It Girls gasp in unison at this outburst. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Honestly, I wish I had Corey’s 
                        pointy nipples. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I have goddamn dinner plates. You 
                        can eat off these bad boys. 

           Hannah shakes her breasts as the back of the classroom erupts 
           in laughter at her self-deprecating humor. Taylor storms out 
           of the room, upset. 

                                 SASHA
                        Not cool, Hannah. You know how 
                        sensitive Taylor is about her cup 
                        size. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t know! 

           Sasha makes sure Corey is listening, before she sticks the 
           dagger in--

                                 SASHA
                        Y’know you should get Corey to wear 
                        skirts so everybody can catch a 
                        glimpse of his junk. 

           STUDENTS around Sasha LAUGH. Corey can’t take anymore abuse 
           so she scoops up her things, and darts out of class--

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           -- sprints down the hallway--

           EXT. THE WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           -- and arrives at the The Women’s Locker Room. Corey lingers 
           outside for a moment, before she works up the courage to 
           enter the forbidden kingdom-- 

           INT. WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           -- and tiptoes inside. Much to Corey’s dismay, there is no 
           Busby Berkeley musical. Just a regular, old locker room.

                                 MS. MAZZA (O.S.)
                        Corey!? What are you doing in here?

           Corey’s interrupted by the gym teacher, Ms. Mazza.

                                 COREY
                        Sorry, I just needed a moment 
                        alone. 
                                 MS. MAZZA
                        There are no boys in the girls 
                        locker room, Corey. You know that. 

                                 COREY
                        I’m not a boy.

                                 MS. MAZZA
                        Don’t get smart with me! Do you 
                        want detention?

                                 COREY
                        Sure. Make my fucking day, Ms. 
                        Mazza!

           Ms. Mazza gasps, before we SLAM TO:

           INT. MAIN OFFICE, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Corey exits DR. PITT’S OFFICE. We may think she just got 
           detention, before Corey smirks at Ms. Mazza, who is waved in 
           by Dr. Pitts--

           INT. DR. PITTS OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Pitts stands behind her desk. Ms. Mazza paces around.

                                 MS. MAZZA 
                        He deserves detention. 

                                 DR. PITTS
                        He is a she, and she will be 
                        allowed to use the women’s locker 
                        room and restroom whenever she 
                        likes. Understood?

                                 MS. MAZZA
                        Sorry, but I know Corey and he is 
                        an entitled, drama queen.

                                 DR. PITTS
                        Corey is a good kid. And I’m taking 
                        this all very seriously. I had a 
                        long conversation with Corey’s 
                        Psychologist.

                                 MS. MAZZA
                        He’s lying. It’s an attention grab.
                                 DR. PITTS
                        Enough. We’re setting a meeting 
                        when all of Corey’s teachers are 
                        available and hopefully your 
                        attitude will have changed by then. 

                                 MS. MAZZA
                        I’m just going to say it, I don’t 
                        feel comfortable sharing a bathroom 
                        with him. I just don’t.

                                 DR. PITTS
                        Well, then you can use the staff 
                        bathroom. 

           Ms. Mazza rolls her eyes. This conversation isn’t over.

           INT. CLASSROOM, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - LATE AFTERNOON

           Corey, Judy, Dr. Dime, Dr. Pitts and all of COREY’S TEACHERS 
           sit in a circle for their meeting. 

                                 DR. PITTS
                        Thank you everyone for meeting 
                        under such short notice. I’m really 
                        grateful to you all for your 
                        support of our very brave student, 
                        Corey Wagner. I’m also grateful to 
                        Dr. Margie Dime for taking the time 
                        to educate and enlighten us all 
                        today.

                                 MARGIE
                        It’s my pleasure. 

                                 JUDY
                        Thank you everybody.

           Corey nods, thanks - not ready to speak up just yet.

                                 MARGIE
                        We’re going to be going over a lot 
                        today so everyone please feel free 
                        to ask any and all questions you 
                        may have. Remember, there are no 
                        dumb questions, only dumb students. 

           The teachers chuckle, expending their nervous energy.

           LATER - Margie stands in front of a WHITEBOARD with a list of 
           PRONOUNS. All of the TEACHERS appear open to Margie’s lesson, 
           except for MS. MAZZA who has her arms crossed, skeptical.
                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        When someone is referred to with 
                        the wrong pronoun, it can make them 
                        feel disrespected, invalidated, 
                        dismissed, and alienated. You 
                        should identify a Transgender Woman 
                        with She/Her/Hers rather than 
                        He/Him/His. Or you can use gender-
                        neutral pronouns like 
                        They/Them/Theirs if that’s what 
                        they prefer. 

           An old ENGLISH TEACHER, MISS BIRD, interrupts--

                                 MISS BIRD
                        That’s actually incorrect. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Sorry?

                                 MISS BIRD
                        Using plurals to refer to one 
                        individual is grammatically 
                        incorrect. 

           ON COREY following this frustrating exchange...

                                 MARGIE
                        And you are Mrs.?

                                 MISS BIRD 
                             (correcting)
                        Miss Bird. But you can call me 
                        Lucy.

                                 MARGIE
                        Okay, Mrs. Bird.

                                 MISS BIRD
                        No, Miss Bird. Or Lucy. 
                             (realizing)
                        Oh I see what you did there.

                                 MARGIE
                        Now that was an example of how 
                        frustrating it can be when someone 
                        misidentifies you. 

           Corey has finally had enough of listening, so she pipes ups-- 

                                 COREY
                        Let me clear this up for everyone, 
                        I would like to be identified by 
                        the pronouns She/Her/Hers. 
           Ms. Mazza scoffs at this. Everyone turns to her, so she tries 
           to rally them to her point of view-- 

                                 MS. MAZZA
                        If I asked to be called “Mrs. 
                        President” or “Your Majesty,” 
                        should you all have to do it? No. I 
                        mean, what if all of our students 
                        decide to become Drag Queens? It’ll 
                        be anarchy. No offence.

                                 COREY
                        Uh, some offence taken!

                                 JUDY
                        My daughter is not a drag queen!

           Judy rises out of her chair, mad as hell, and is held back by 
           Margie. Dr. Pitts chimes in to cool things down--

                                 DR. PITTS 
                        Ivana, let’s focus on making this a 
                        welcome environment for Corey and 
                        educating ourselves on gender 
                        identity issues.

                                 MS. MAZZA
                        This is all nonsense, and I think 
                        the Superintendent will agree with 
                        me.

                                 COREY
                        Maybe I should step outside and let 
                        you all--

           Before Corey can finish, Dr. Pitts gets in Ms. Mazza’s face--

                                 DR. PITTS
                        Ivana, Ron’s office is one hundred 
                        percent on board with what we’re 
                        doing here. The Board of Education 
                        is going to be crafting a new 
                        policy for Transgender students so 
                        if you don’t change your attitude, 
                        you could call yourself the Queen 
                        of England for all I care, but you 
                        won’t be working here. 

           Corey beams, impressed with Dr. Pitts’ unflinching support.  

                                 SASHA (PRE-LAP)
                        There’s going to be lot of changes 
                        around here...
           INT. AUDITORIUM - THE NEXT DAY

           Corey sits alone at the BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM away from the 
           other cliques of students, while Sasha Sales stands at a 
           podium. She’s mid-presidential acceptance speech. Dr. Pitts 
           sits in a chair behind her ON-STAGE--

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                             (into the mic)
                        I mean, I haven’t really looked 
                        into it, but I’m pretty sure I’m 
                        the first female president in 
                        student body history. 

                                 DR. PITTS
                             (without a mic)
                        That’s not true, Miss Sales.

                                 SASHA
                             (into the mic)
                        Well, we don’t know that it’s not-
                        not true, do we?

                                 DR. PITTS
                             (again, no mic)
                        Yes we do, Miss Sales. 

                                 SASHA
                             (into the mic)
                        Anyway, just by voting for me 
                        you’ve voted for change you can 
                        believe in, and most importantly a 
                        kick ass Senior Prom...

           BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM--

           Hannah ambles up to Corey, who is defensive, arms crossed. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Anyone sitting here?

           Corey shrugs, I dunno.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        May I?

                                 COREY
                        Be my guest.

           Hannah plunks down next to Corey.
                                 HANNAH
                             (chuckling to herself)
                        Change we can believe in. What a 
                        dumb-ass. 

           Corey can’t help but smile reluctantly.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 COREY
                        About what?

                                 HANNAH
                        It took me a hot second, but I want 
                        you to know I’m here for you. I’m 
                        sorry I was a bitch the other 
                        night. And today. You’re more of a 
                        girl than anyone I know. We’re in 
                        this together, alright? I love you, 
                        you sexy bitch.

                                 COREY
                        Love you too. Did you tell anyone 
                        about what I told you the other 
                        night?

                                 HANNAH
                        No! Of course not. I mean, everyone 
                        knows something’s up. All anyone 
                        can talk about is what you’ve been 
                        wearing. Some think you’ve come out 
                        of the closet after the Hennie 
                        incident. 

                                 COREY
                        I’m not gay!

                                 HANNAH
                        I know, I know.

                                 COREY
                        I don’t want to have to make some 
                        dramatic announcement that I’m 
                        transgender. I was just hoping 
                        people would catch on.

                                 HANNAH
                        I agree, and they will. 

           Corey and Hannah look back at Sasha, worried.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        ... I hope.

           TIGHT ON: THE POLICY PAGE of the TOWNSHIP BOARD OF EDUCATION 

                               5756 - Transgender Students 

           REVEAL Corey and Judy sit together at the COMPUTER scrolling 
           through the new Transgender policy page. Judy squeezes 
           Corey’s hand, excited for her daughter.

                             (turns to Judy)
                        LOL! What a crock of shit?

                                 JUDY
                        Corey! Shush. This is great!

           Corey continues to read aloud, which will be a VOICE OVER as 
           we CUE QUEEN’S “KILLER QUEEN” OVER THE FOLLOWING MONTAGE--

           INT. HANNAH’S MASSIVE CLOSET - DAY

           Corey and Hannah play dress up in her massive walk-in closet. 
           Corey tries on DIFFERENT OUTFITS. Hannah gives suggestions, 
           excitedly. They are having a blast. 

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “In furthering this goal, the Board 
                        adopts this Policy to ensure all 
                        students, including transgender 
                        students, have equal educational 
                        opportunities and equal access.”
                             (to Judy off-screen)
                        Fuck yes!!!

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           TIGHT SHOTS as Corey flips through MAGAZINES and tears out 
           wardrobe inspiration. We see FLASHES of photo-shopped, 
           anorexic models purporting to represent the “feminine ideal.” 
           We are on COREY’S EYES taking this in.

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “Gender identity means a student's 
                        deeply held sense or psychological 
                        knowledge of their own gender.” 
           Corey fills a corkboard with images, colors, styles, and 
           fabrics she envisions for herself, which then come to life as-

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “Transgender describes students 
                        whose gender identity is different 
                        from their gender assigned at 
                        birth...”

           INT. HALLWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL- DAY

           Corey struts down the hallway in OUTFITS THAT KEEP CHANGING, 
           indicating that time is passing. Corey is projecting 
           confidence as she walks in her carefully curated outfits, but 
           we may sense an insecurity simmering beneath the surface, as 
           she clocks the reactions of the STUDENTS AT THEIR LOCKERS--

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “Transgender students shall comply 
                        with the school district’s dress 
                        code requirements that corresponds 
                        with their gender identity.”

           The Wannabee, Slutty Cheerleaders gawk. The Cool Jewish Boys 
           and the Fantasy Football Loving Boys avert their eyes. The 
           Christian Stoner Lax Players, and the Christian Soccer Jocks 
           give Corey death stares. The “IT” Girls pretend Corey’s 
           invisible. 

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “The school district will honor the 
                        request to have the student 
                        addressed by a name or pronoun 
                        different from those associated 
                        with the student’s gender at 
                        birth.”

           Meanwhile, Dr. Pitts oversees them all sternly, a mother bear 
           looking out for her cub. 

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “Transgender students shall have 
                        access to locker room facilities

                        identity.” 

           INT. WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Corey enters the locker room to find GIRLS getting 
           uncomfortable every direction she looks. 
           Corey responds by putting on a fake smile, pretending it 
           doesn’t hurt her feelings, before she quickly ducks into a 
           BATHROOM STALL--

           INT. STALL, WOMEN’S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           -- and finds a brief moment of respite from an exhausting day 
           of being strong. She may want to cry, but won’t let herself. 

           INT. DR. PITT’S OFFICE - DAY

           Corey changes for gym class in Dr. Pitt’s office, not wanting 
           to change in the Women’s Locker Room anymore.

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “The school district will make 
                        available a reasonable alternative 
                        changing area for a transgender 
                        student, if requested.” 

           Corey waves ‘thank you’ to Monique at the receptionist desk, 
           appreciating this ‘alternative changing area.’

           EXT. BLEACHERS DAY - DAY

           THE TRACK TEAM jog in their dark windbreakers, as they WIPE 
           PAST FRAME REVEALING COREY drawing in her sketchbook on the 
           bleachers in a starkly contrasting PINK OUTFIT. 

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “Transgender students shall be 
                        permitted to participate in 
                        physical education classes in a 
                        manner consistent with their gender 
                        identity.”

           Corey watches Neko from afar, who stands next to a GIRL, and 
           talks flirtatiously. CLOSE ON the nape of the Girl’s neck, 
           her hair, her gym shorts. WE’RE ON COREY LOOKING JEALOUS...

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey stands in the mirror scrutinizing her NAKED BODY 
           (though we can’t see anything rated R). She checks her face 
           for rogue facial hairs. Studies her profile. Rubs her Adam’s 
           Apple, hating it. Sucks in her tummy. 

           Corey starts draping FABRIC on a MANNEQUIN. Uses a SEWING 
           MACHINE to adjust the ill-fitting clothing. She starts trying 
           the clothes on, TAILORING IT TO HER BODY.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “In the event a student no longer 
                        identifies with a previously 
                        asserted gender, a parent of the 
                        student must submit a letter...”

           Judy has a few of her close FRIENDS over to confide in them 
           about what’s going on with Corey. They are KAREN, CAROL, 
           DEANIE, and Shara, from the nail salon, who remains silent.

                                 KAREN 
                        What if he changes his mind? 

                                 JUDY
                             (correcting)
                        She. 

                                 CAROL
                             (ignoring)
                        What if he’s just gay and doesn’t 
                        want to live life as a gay man?

                                 DEANIE
                        What if it’s just a phase?

           Off Judy’s realization that her friendships might not last 
           through this experience... 

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        “The school district will not 
                        disclose a student’s transgender 
                        status unless required.”

           COREY’S FACEBOOOK PAGE is up. The PROFILE PICTURE is of Corey 
           as a BOY. She hasn’t updated her profile yet, and we’ll soon 
           learn why...

           Whoosh! Corey gets a FACEBOOK MESSAGE from her brother, 
           Matthew--

           Matthew’s Message: Hey Bro! What’s new? Can’t wait to see you 
           and catch up!!!

           ON COREY taking this in - so much is NEW. Corey scrolls 
           through Matthew’s COLLEGE PHOTOS. Matthew, now 20, is a 
           reformed nerd who is doing his best to play the part of “FRAT 
           BOY.” On the outside he’s the masculine, aggressive type who 
           might not understand his Transgender Sister. 
           ON COREY TOO AFRAID TO TELL HIM. We hear what Corey TYPES to 
           her brother as a VOICE OVER...

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        Nothing much is new. Just the 
                        usual. Partying with friends...

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Corey enters a SMALL HOUSE PARTY. She holds a RED SOLO CUP 
           and makes her way to the living room where she finds a HUDDLE 
           OF UNCOMFORTABLE GUYS who are clearly whispering about her. 
           They give her dirty looks. Hannah approaches Corey--

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m so sorry, but the guys are 
                        being complete dickwads and want 
                        you to leave.  

                                 COREY
                        What the actual fuck?

                                 HANNAH
                        They’re such immature ass-holes. 
                        Don’t worry I’ll get them to come 
                        around--

           SUDDENLY, A PARTY-GOER accidentally spills RED JUNGLE JUICE 
           all over Corey’s WHITE OUTFIT as we END MONTAGE:

                                 MARGIE (PRE-LAP)
                        So how do you feel? Is your 
                        transition playing out how you 
                        imagined?

           INT. MARGIE’S OFFICE - HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Margie sits across from Corey, wearing a chunky sweater over 
           a leggings. They are mid-session--

                                 MARGIE 
                        Or are these kids being little ass-
                        holes? Be real with me, Corey. 
                        Because I’ll come down there and 
                        knock them on their asses for you. 

           Corey smiles. We should get the sense that they’ve had a few 
           sessions in these past weeks and built up a rapport. 
                                 COREY
                        I haven’t gotten any death threats, 
                        or people shoving me into lockers. 
                        Nothing cliche like that...

                                 MARGIE
                        Setting the bar low there.

                                 COREY
                        Everyone has sort of been on egg 
                        shells around me though. It’s like 
                        I’m a leper. They’ve stopped 
                        inviting me to parties because it’s 
                        weird for the guys which is 
                        annoying. Like I’m not invited to 
                        the big Holiday kegger coming up.

                                 MARGIE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 COREY
                        It’s whatever. I have a lot on my 
                        plate this break anyway. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Why’s that?

                                 COREY
                        My brother, Matthew, is coming home 
                        from college for the first time, 
                        and he’s the only person who 
                        doesn’t know yet. 

                                 MARGIE
                        What’s your relationship with 
                        Matthew like?

           Off Corey thinking about this, we INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. JUDY’S OFFICE - SAME

           PUSH IN ON Judy at her desk on the PHONE with Matthew, who we 
           will HEAR through the phone but not see. Judy just finished 
           telling him about Corey’s transition--

                                 JUDY
                        Are you there, Matthew?

                                 MATTHEW (OVER THE PHONE)
                        ... Who else knows?

           Judy’s silence says it all - he’s the last one. Out of anger 
           and hurt, Matthew responds-- 
                                 MATTHEW (OVER THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to use the pronouns 
                        for him! I’m just not!

           We see Judy’s face is crushed by this reaction.

                                 JUDY
                        Matthew, you will if you want to 
                        continue to have a relationship 
                        with your sister... Hello? HELLO?

           Off Matthew hanging up, we CUT BACK TO THE SCENE:

           INT. MARGIE’S OFFICE - AS BEFORE

                                 COREY
                        Growing up I always felt like he 
                        was embarrassed by me. Now that 
                        he’s a college frat bro who knows 
                        how he’ll respond? Y’know?

                                 MARGIE
                        Is that why you’re nervous to tell 
                        him? You don’t know how he’ll 
                        respond?

                                 COREY
                        I just don’t want to scare him, you 
                        know? I love him. Should I wear 
                        “boy clothes” so he feels more 
                        comfortable? Or can I dress like 
                        this? Like me. The real me.

                                 MARGIE
                        Think about what you just said. You 
                        don’t want to scare him by being 
                        the real you. Corey, I want you to 
                        learn that it’s okay to put 
                        yourself first. You need to say 
                        fuck what other people think about 
                        you.
                             (loudly)
                        FUCK WHAT THEY THINK!

           Corey loves it, laughs.

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Say it with me - FUCK WHAT THEY 
                        THINK!

                                 COREY
                        Fuck what they think.
                                 MARGIE
                        No, louder --

                                 MARGIE / COREY (TOGETHER)
                        FUCK WHAT THEY THINK

                                 MARGIE
                        There you go. You’re never going to 
                        figure out who you are if you 
                        listen to all these fuckers. Even 
                        the ones you love. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WAGNER HOME - AFTERNOON

           HANNAH’S PORSCHE CAYENNE pulls into Corey’s driveway--

           INT. HANNAH’S PORCHE CAYENNE - SAME

           -- where Matthew’s YELLOW JEEP is currently parked. He’s 
           home. Hannah flicks off the engine, before she clocks Corey 
           freaking out in the passenger seat, staring at the Jeep.

                                 COREY
                        That’s Matthew’s car. He’s home. 
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck--

                                 HANNAH
                             (interrupting)
                        Corey, get a hold of yourself! 
                        Matthew isn’t going to care. He’s 
                        going to be super chill about the 
                        whole situation, and regardless - 
                        I’ll be right there with you.

           Corey takes a deep breath psyching herself up, before they 
           exit the car.

           EXT. FRONT DOOR, WAGNER HOME - AFTERNOON

           We hear MUFFLED YELLING coming from inside the house as they 
           approach the front door. Corey and Hannah share a look. It’s 
           clear the family is mid-argument inside. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Actually, maybe you shouldn’t go in 
                        there right now.

           Corey barrels open the door --
           INT. FAMILY ROOM, WAGNER HOME - SAME

           -- to find Steven playing the mediator between Matthew and 
           Judy. They abruptly stop talking as the door opens.

                                 COREY
                        Well, hello everyone!

           Matthew’s eyes go wide as he takes in Corey’s new wardrobe. 

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t stop on my account? What were 
                        you guys talking about? 

                                 JUDY
                        Corey, I was just --

                                 COREY
                        Y’know what Matthew? I knew you 
                        wouldn’t understand. This is why 
                        I’m telling you last. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        But--

                                 COREY
                             (cutting him off)
                        No, let me speak. I’ve always been 
                        worried about embarrassing you by 
                        being myself, and I’m done with it. 
                        I’m a girl. I’m a Transgender girl, 
                        and I don’t care what you or anyone 
                        else thinks. 
                             (beat, then loudly 
                              screaming Margie’s 
                              mantra)
                        FUCK WHAT THEY THINK!!!

           Matthew immediately starts to cry. He tries to stop, but that 
           only makes him cry more. Matthew is an ugly crier too!

           Awkward silence. Corey feels pretty shitty right now, but 
           still super mad. 

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make 
                        you cry.

                                 MATTHEW
                             (totally crying)
                        I’m... not... crying. Sorry, I just 
                        need a second.

           Matthew exits the room with snot hanging from his nose. 
                                 JUDY
                        What the hell, Corey? Go apologize 
                        to your brother!

                                 COREY
                        Screw that! He should apologize to 
                        me! Ugh!

           Corey storms off after Matthew, leaving Hannah left with 
           Steven and Judy.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, that went pretty well.

           EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Corey catches up to Matthew on the sidewalk but hangs back a 
           few feet sensing he needs space. Matthew finally plops down 
           on the side of the road. Corey sits down next to him.

                                 COREY
                        What’s going on Matthew? What are 
                        you thinking? Talk to me.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I’m fucking mad, Corey!

                                 COREY
                             (getting worked up again)
                        Well, excuse me! I’m sorry that my 
                        gender upsets you!

                                 MATTHEW
                             (explaining)
                        I’m not mad at you. I’m fucking mad 
                        at myself! As if I haven’t always 
                        known you were different. I mean, I 
                        guess I always just assumed you 
                        might be gay, but when Mom told me--

                                 COREY
                        Wait, Mom told you!? I can’t 
                        believe her!

                                 MATTHEW
                        No, I’m glad she told me. My gut 
                        reaction was horrible. I was so 
                        pissed you didn’t tell me sooner... 
                        I... I needed this past week to 
                        realize that it doesn’t matter why 
                        you waited, because this isn’t 
                        about me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                        But it’s time to make sure you 
                        never wait again, so I just want to 
                        say that even though I’m still 
                        upset you didn’t tell me sooner. I 
                        love you no matter what Corey. 
                             (Beat, thinks)
                        Also, I’m the farthest thing from 
                        embarrassed by you. Hell I look up 
                        to you, and always have, even 
                        though you’re my little sister. 

           Being called “Sister” for the first time means more to Corey 
           than Matthew could ever know.

           ON THEM walking off into the twilight as the brother and 
           sister they’ve always been, but truly embracing it for the 
           first time.

           INT./EXT. WAGNER HOME - NIGHT

           We see the WAGNER FAMILY through the WINDOW. They sit around 
           a dining table, all smiles. It looks like a Norman Rockwell 
           painting. Baba says a prayer as they light the first candle 
           on the MENORAH. 

           INT. LIVING-ROOM, WAGNER HOME - NIGHT

           The family opens up their HANUKKAH PRESENTS. Corey takes a 
           RED DRESS out of a fancy box. Measures it against her body. 
           Savors it. Gives Grandma and Baba a big hug. 

           INT. WAGNER HOME - LATER 

           The whole family sits around the couch watching Mean Girls 
           (it’s the Spring Fling ending scene, and Lindsey Lohan has 
           just won Queen).

                                 CADY/LINDSEY LOHAN  (ON THE TV)
                             (re: the crown)
                        So why is everyone stressing over 
                        this thing? It’s just plastic...

           ON COREY taking this scene in. Maybe she’s wishing for this 
           movie moment? Maybe she’s getting an idea? Corey’s reverie is 
           interrupted when she gets a text from Hannah--

           Hannah’s Message: This party is super lame, but wish you were 
           here :(

           -- and it totally kills Corey’s vibe. She frowns before--
           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - LATER AT NIGHT

           -- pulling up a FACEBOOK ALBUM for a HOLIDAY KEGGER on her 
           bulky DESKTOP COMPUTER. 

           She scrolls through pictures of the party. It’s similar to 
           the Halloween party, but with a Christmas tree and kids 
           wearing ugly sweaters. Corey is having serious F.O.M.O (”Fear 
           Of Missing Out” for the non-millienials reading).

           ON COREY lit by the computer screen, opening up her FACEBOOK 
           PAGE. She studies her Facebook Name: “Corey Wagner”

           Corey dives deeper into her “Basic Info” settings:

           PROFILE PICTURE: The picture of “Corey in Boy Clothes”

           GENDER: Male

           Corey thinks before changing her Profile Picture, to a 
           PICTURE “from Halloween in her Regina George costume as a 
           GIRL.”

           Corey changes her Gender to “Female.”

           Finally, Corey deletes “Wagner” and makes her name--

                                       “Corey Rae”

           Corey hits “Save,” and smiles satisfied.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARGIE’S OFFICE - HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Corey paces around the room. Margie sits patiently.

                                 COREY
                        So I’m re-branding myself. There’s 
                        Pepsi. There’s Coca Cola. And now, 
                        there’s, “Corey Rae.”

                                 MARGIE
                        I like it. Why do you think you 
                        need to “re-brand?”

                                 COREY
                        People just see me as this label 
                        now. Transgender Person. And that’s 
                        all I am to them. Spoiler alert Dr. 
                        Dime, the trans person doesn’t get 
                        invited to the party. I’m hoping 
                        Corey Rae will.
           Corey plops down on the couch, exasperated. 

                                 MARGIE
                        When you’ve described your 
                        classmates to me in the past you’ve 
                        said things like, “the It Girls”, 
                        “the Slutty Cheerleaders”--

                                 COREY
                             (correcting)
                        The Wannabee, Slutty Cheerleaders.

                                 MARGIE
                        Right. But those are all labels 
                        that you put on them too. 

                                 COREY
                        Aren’t you supposed to be on my 
                        side? Isn’t that what I pay you 
                        for?

                                 MARGIE
                        Is it?

                                 COREY
                        I’m kidding. Maybe you’re right. 

                                 MARGIE
                        I’m sure some of your classmates 
                        can’t be easily defined by that 
                        label you’ve put on them. 

                                 COREY
                        It’s just, I’m me. You know? I’m 
                        not defined by being transgender. 
                        I’ve never even met anyone who is 
                        transgender--
                             (beat, thinking)
                        Wait, unless... are you 
                        transgender?

                                 MARGIE
                             (smiles)
                        No, I’m not. 

                                 COREY
                        We’ve been talking so much about 
                        me, I haven’t even asked about you.

                                 MARGIE
                        That’s fine. I’m here to listen.
                                 COREY
                        I mean you’re this bad-ass doctor 
                        who has a sleeve of tattoos. Tell 
                        me about yourself. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Let’s focus on you, Corey. 

                                 COREY
                             (ignoring)
                        For instance that Hello Kitty 
                        tattoo. Why’d you get that? Were 
                        you like drunk in Vegas or 
                        something? You do not seem like the 
                        Hello Kitty type. 

           Margie touches the tattoo, smiles sadly. Corey doesn’t 
           notice.

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        Although maybe that’s kind of me 
                        labeling you, because why couldn’t 
                        you just be super freaking 
                        passionate about Hello Kitty?

                                 MARGIE
                        I got this tattoo to honor the 
                        memory of my daughter who passed 
                        away.

                                 COREY
                        Oh my god, I’m so sorry! 

                                 MARGIE
                        Thank you, it’s alright. It was 
                        many years ago now. 

                                 COREY
                        What was her name?

                                 MARGIE
                        Sahara... She was beautiful. She 
                        loved Hello Kitty.

                                 COREY
                        I would have liked her. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Yes. You would have. 
                             (thinks, then)
                        We conceived Sahara using my ex-
                        husband’s sperm, my egg, and my 
                        wife as the surrogate.
                                 COREY
                        Damn.

                                 MARGIE
                        Labels are limiting. Wife. 
                        Daughter. Gay. Straight. Bisexual. 
                        All labels that don’t solely define 
                        me. 

           Corey chews on that for a few moments. 

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to meet other people 
                        like you who don’t all fit neatly 
                        into some box. 

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Corey attends a TRANSGENDER SUPPORT GROUP in the basement of 
           a seedy looking church. They sit in folding chairs arranged 
           in a circle. Corey is a fish out of water in this group who 
           mostly appear to come from lower income communities. 

           We hear quick snippets of their stories, and it should feel 
           authentic, almost documentary-like. Their stories are of 
           struggle, abuse, and pain-- things Corey can’t fathom. 

                                 BLACK TRANS WOMAN 30’S
                        I was abused...

                                 WHITE TRANS MAN 50’S
                        ... when I was going stealth in the 
                        military, until they...

                                 LATINO TRANS WOMAN 60’S
                        ... kicked me out of my house...

                                 TRANS WOMAN 40’S
                        ... and raped me. 

                                 BLACK TRANS WOMAN 60’S 
                        ... but I pulled through it, ‘cause 
                        I’m a strong woman, and ain’t 
                        nobody gonna break my stride.

           The Group rowdily claps in solidarity. Finally, it’s Corey’s 
           turn to share. All eyes on her, and she’s scared shitless--

                                 COREY
                        Me? Um... Hi. I’m Corey Rae.

                                 THE GROUP (IN UNISON)
                        Hi, Corey Rae. 
                                 COREY
                        I don’t know what to talk about?

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        Just talk. This is a safe space. 

                                 COREY
                        Right. But after listening to you 
                        all, my struggles just feel a 
                        little trivial.

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        No experience is trivial. Speak 
                        your truth. 

                                 COREY
                        Okay. I mean, I’ve just been very 
                        lucky. My parents are super 
                        supportive. My family. The biggest 
                        complaint I have is that I feel 
                        ostracized by my friends. Like 
                        there was this big Holiday kegger 
                        that before my transition I totally 
                        would have been invited to, but now 
                        I get excluded and it’s unfair--

                                 EJ
                             (squeals obnoxiously)
                        HAH!

           REVEAL EJ JACKSON (about 6’4, 220 lbs., black Trans woman, 
           with a blonde wig). Ej’s laugh is distinct, almost regal. 

                                 EJ (CONT’D)
                        That is some trivial ass shit, 
                        Princess. HAH!

           The Group starts laughing. Corey is annoyed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM, WAGNER HOME - SAME

           Judy is listlessly sitting on the couch with Steven, watching 
           the news to pass the time before Corey gets home. Judy looks 
           up from biting her cuticles when a report grabs her 
           attention, “CAMPUS TRAGEDY: STUDENT TAKES HIS OWN LIFE”

           Judy perks up at the headline, raises the volume and we HEAR--

                                 NEWS REPORTER (ON THE TV)
                        This was a sad day at Rutgers 
                        University. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NEWS REPORTER (ON THE TV) (CONT'D)
                        Authorities have now identified the 
                        body of Tyler Clementi, a quiet 
                        freshman who took his own life 
                        after a sexual encounter with 
                        another man was secretly streamed 
                        online...

           Judy and Steven share a deeply concerned look, as they get 
           their own dose of the harsh reality the LGBTQ community 
           faces, before we CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           EJ stomps out a cigarette butt in her CHRISTIAN LOUBOUTIN 
           HEELS, before Corey ambles out of the Church.  

                                 EJ 
                        Wait up, Princess.

           Corey clocks EJ, gets defensive--

                                 COREY
                        Haven’t I taken enough crap for one 
                        night?

                                 EJ
                        Just so you know, I am draped in 
                        Givenchy. This is an authentic 
                        Chanel purse, and my shoes are 
                        Louboutin’s. You ain’t the only one 
                        who’s doing fine, Princess. 

                                 COREY
                             (impressed)
                        Damn, are those real Louboutin’s?

                                 EJ
                        Mmhmmm. Where you from anyway?

                                 COREY
                        Short Hills.

                                 EJ
                        I LOVE that mall. 

                                 COREY
                        Me too. 

                                 EJ
                        Do you and your little white 
                        privilege friends ever make it out 
                        to the city?
                                 COREY
                        What’s with the name calling? 

                                 EJ
                        I’m messing with you, Princess. 
                        Chill.

                                 COREY
                        Not really, no. 

                                 EJ
                        Well, I’m a promoter, and I throw 
                        bomb ass parties in the city for 
                        bomb ass people. Are you bomb ass, 
                        Princess?

                                 COREY
                        I don’t know what bomb ass means, 
                        but I take design classes at NYU so 
                        I go to the city a decent amount. I 
                        just don’t party in the city ever, 
                        and if you were listening earlier, 
                        you’d realize I’m not the hottest 
                        social commodity right now. 

                                 EJ
                        HAH!

                                 COREY
                        What’s funny?

                                 EJ
                        You wanna know why you’re a 
                        Princess? Because you think you 
                        need to be invited to a party. 
                        Bitch, if you were a Queen you’d 
                        know that you ARE the party with 
                        your little bomb ass. 

                                 COREY
                        Okay... 

                                 EJ
                        Seriously, I see potential in you. 
                        Take my number. Hit me up if you’re 
                        ever in the city and want to go 
                        out. It’d be a good time. 
           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey checks her FACEBOOK PROFILE PAGE. She has two new 
           “Friend Requests.” One from EJ JACKSON, which she quickly 
           accepts, and the other from a scruffy, cute guy in his mid-
           20’s, JACK GREENBERG.

           Corey doesn’t know who this is, but she’s intrigued. 

                                 COREY
                             (to herself)
                        Who are you?

           Corey clocks the “Mutual Friends” section, and sees that 
           SASHA SALES and TAYLOR are mutual friends so he checks out. 

           Corey clicks “accept.” Thinks. Then types a MESSAGE: Do we 
           know each other?

           Woosh! Almost instantaneously, Jack replies back with a 
           MESSAGE: No, but I’d like to get to know you :)

                        Corey?

           Corey almost falls out of her chair she’s so shocked--

                                 COREY
                        Jesus Christ, Mom. Please knock?

                                 JUDY
                        Sorry!

                                 COREY
                        It’s fine. What’s up?

                                 JUDY
                        Well, while you were at the support 
                        group, I actually spoke with a 
                        woman at human resources at NYU--
                             (Corey groans)
                        And she said we should be hearing 
                        back about regular decision in 
                        April. They also told me they’ve 
                        had transgender students in the 
                        past, and are extremely prepared--

                                 COREY
                        Mom! Do you need to broadcast it to 
                        the world!? I want to blend in next 
                        year. 
                                 JUDY
                        Don’t worry, they keep that 
                        information confidential. I can’t 
                        stress enough how important it is 
                        to make sure that there’s a safe 
                        environment for you next year. 

                                 COREY
                        Can we do this some other time 
                        please?

                                 JUDY
                        Sure, but we still need to discuss 
                        it and I want to hear about support 
                        group! I love you.

                                 COREY
                             (brushing her off)
                        Okay, okay. Love you too. 

           Corey focuses back on the computer screen, annoyed. So Judy 
           exits Corey’s room--

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           -- and leans for a moment against the wall. Judy, who has 
           always looked so put together up until now, looks worn down. 

                                 MARGIE (V.O.)
                        How have things been for you, Judy?

           INT. SALON LA MODE - RECENT FLASHBACK

                                 JUDY (V.O.)
                             (faux cheeriness)
                        I’ve been good... Busy.

           Judy taps her manicured nails at her beauty station. She’s 
           bored because she doesn’t have any clients. PULL OUT WIDER to 
           find that Judy is the only beautician in the bustling salon 
           without a customer. 

                                 MARGIE (V.O.)
                        I meant, how have you been since 
                        Corey started her transition? 

                                 JUDY (V.O.)
                        Oh. Right. Um... 
           INT. SUPERMARKET - RECENT FLASHBACK

           Judy pushes a cart down an aisle. She spots her friend and 
           client, Shara, from earlier-

                                 JUDY
                        Shara, hey!

           Shara pretends she doesn’t hear or see Judy, pushes her cart 
           out of view. Strange.

           INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK OUT AISLES - RECENT FLASHBACK

           As Judy heads toward the check-out aisle, she clocks Shara 
           getting her groceries bagged. Pulls her cart up behind her--

                                 JUDY
                        Shara!

           Shara turns, struggles to feign surprise. 

                                 SHARA
                        Oh, Judy... I didn’t uh...

                                 JUDY
                        How are you doing? 

                                 SHARA
                        Good! Busy. So busy with the, uh, 
                        the kids and their, everything, 
                        so... 

                                 JUDY
                        You haven’t come around the salon 
                        in so long, I was starting to worry 
                        about your greys. 

                                 SHARA
                        Oh-- Ha. That’s sweet of you. No, 
                        y’know what, I started just doing 
                        it myself from the box. 

           She grabs her bags from the cashier, and makes quick for the 
           exit, offering back over her shoulder:  

                                 SHARA (CONT’D)
                        Nice seeing you. 

           Judy watches her go... and then pursues. 
           EXT. SUPER MARKET, PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Shara puts her SUV in reverse and starts to back out when-- 

           She GASPS. Stops short. Judy is standing right behind the 
           bumper, manning her shopping cart. 

                                 SHARA
                        Judy?! 

           Judy leaves the shopping cart where it is and comes to the 
           driver’s side window, wild-eyed, perhaps a little unhinged. 

                                 SHARA (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing? You almost gave 
                        me a heart attack--

                                 JUDY
                        Why, Shara?! What did I do to you? 
                        What have I done to anybody? I call 
                        you, you don’t pick up. I email you 
                        about the food drive, you don’t 
                        respond-- 

                                 SHARA
                        Judy, please, I can’t do this right 
                        now--

                                 JUDY
                        WE ARE DOING THIS RIGHT NOW. I’m 
                        not letting you go anywhere until 
                        you talk to me.

                                 SHARA
                             (snaps)
                        I DON’T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH 
                        YOU, OKAY?!  

           Judy recoils from the shock of the outburst. Then lets her 
           continue. 

                                 SHARA (CONT’D)
                        What is the matter with you?! Your 
                        son needs serious mental help! And 
                        what do you do?! You indulge him! 
                        You indulge this sick FANTASY!-- 

                                 JUDY
                        Her. 

                                 SHARA
                        ... What? 
                                 JUDY
                        I have a daughter. And if I indulge 
                        her, it’s because she’s my child, 
                        and that’s what we do for our 
                        children, Shara. You’re no 
                        different. 

           Shara can’t suppress a laugh, even as tears come down her 
           face as she does it. 

                                 SHARA
                        I am nothing like you. Keep your 
                        son-- daughter, thing!-- away from 
                        mine.

           And with that, Shara lays on the gas, SLAMMING THROUGH JUDY’S 
           SHOPPING CART. It capsizes, groceries flying as Shara tears 
           off. 

                                 SHARA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (driving away)
                        Crazy! 

           Judy hauls after her, grabs a downed gallon of milk off the 
           asphalt and HURLS IT at the back of Shara’s SUV. It misses by 
           a long shot and EXPLODES on the ground-- a milk bomb. 

                                 JUDY
                        FUUUUUUCK YOUUU TOO!!! 

           She watches the SUV leave the parking lot and disappear down 
           the road. Chest heaving as she tries to regain composure. 
           Judy clocks the astonished bystanders. Mortified. 

           INT. MARGIE’S OFFICE - HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Judy sits across from Margie, forcing a smile. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Listen, Judy, I know when you’re 
                        out there, you put on your best 
                        face to be strong for everyone 
                        else. Especially Corey. But you 
                        don’t have to be strong here. For 
                        one hour I want you to just let it 
                        all go.

           Judy nods, okay. Getting emotional but trying not to show it.

                                 JUDY
                        I’ve done everything I can to 
                        protect Corey. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        And that includes shielding her 
                        from what’s been going on with 
                        me...
                             (deep breath, then)
                        The worst part isn’t the nasty 
                        calls or the fact that I’ve lost 
                        almost all of my regular clients. 
                        The worst part is that I cry every 
                        time I see an old picture of Corey 
                        as a boy. 

                                 MARGIE
                        You still keep those up in the 
                        house?

                                 JUDY
                        Whenever I see them I just break 
                        down and cry, because-- I’ve always 
                        made Corey feel comfortable being 
                        herself. Corey has always been a 
                        girl. But when you’re having a baby 
                        boy... you can’t help but imagine 
                        their life. Going to High School. 
                        Having girlfriends. College. 
                        Getting married. So I cry when I 
                        think about what could have been. 
                        I’m so happy for her, but in some 
                        ways, it’s been like an extended 
                        funeral for me this past year. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m mourning the loss of my son. 

           Judy can’t hold back hot tears now that stream down her face 
           as the guilt she’s kept bottled up explodes to the surface--

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        God, did I wait too long?! I mean, 
                        Corey told me in Middle School, for 
                        Chrissakes-- but she was so young 
                        and-- I didn’t know anything! None 
                        of the books were helpful...
                             (hysterical now)
                        I’m a bad mother.

           Margie gets closer to Judy and holds her hand.

                                 MARGIE
                        Judy. There is no book for this. 
                        There are no how-to’s. I know- I 
                        wrote most of them. 

           Judy laughs through tears. 
                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        All you have to do is take one look 
                        at your beautiful and courageous 
                        daughter to know that’s bullshit. 
                        You’re a wonderful mother.

           Judy needed to hear this. She’s hit with a wave of relief and 
           appreciation.

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Corey is becoming a full fledged 
                        woman now. More and more every day. 
                        It’s time for you to say goodbye to 
                        your son. And you should start by 
                        putting away those pictures.

           On Judy, knowing this to be true...  

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - WALK UP BUILDING - AFTERNOON 

           Judy and Corey wait to be buzzed into-- 

           INT. WAITING ROOM, ENDOCRINOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY

           -- the waiting room of the Endocrinologist’s office. It’s a 
           first floor Upper West Side walk up that’s been converted 
           into a doctors office. A TRANS WOMAN (50) and a TRANS MAN 
           (30) wait for their hormone treatment. Corey studies them.

           INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

           THE ENDOCRINOLOGIST, DR. WYLIE HEMBREE (70’s) examines 
           Corey’s testicles. 

                                 DR. HEMBREE
                        Cough for me.

           LATER - Dr. Hembree does a series of tests, including drawing 
           blood, before Corey and Judy sit together in DR. HEMBREE’S 
           OFFICE--

                                 DR. HEMBREE (CONT’D)
                        You may notice some sensitivity in 
                        your breasts in the coming weeks 
                        from your hormone treatment. Please 
                        let me know if anything feels 
                        swollen. Also, don’t be alarmed if 
                        you start to break out. 
                                 COREY
                        I’ll sacrifice getting a few 
                        pimples for a nice set of hooters 
                        any day.

                                 DR. HEMBREE
                        I just want to manage your 
                        expectations. You’re not going to 
                        grow breasts overnight.

                                 COREY
                        I know. Life isn’t a fairy-tale, 
                        but I’ll be a patient, patient.

                                 DR. HEMBREE
                        Love your attitude, Corey. 

                                 COREY
                        Thanks. I noticed some of your 
                        patients out there, and don’t take 
                        this the wrong way, but they don’t 
                        exactly pass. Is that what I can 
                        expect to look like from this 
                        treatment? Because if so I can kiss 
                        ever having a boyfriend goodbye.

                                 DR. HEMBREE
                        With your age and genetic make up, 
                        I’m confident you’ll be able to 
                        make a beautiful transition. Trust 
                        me, you’ll be batting away the boys 
                        with a stick when I’m through with 
                        you.

           Corey pops up and hugs the doctor, excited. Corey bear hugs 
           Judy, who smiles a sad smile. 

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey excitedly sits down at her computer, and starts 
           Facebook messaging Jack again. She types...

           Corey’s Message: I see we’re mutual friends with Sasha and 
           Taylor. How do you know them?

           Jack’s Message: Well, Sasha and I went on this teen tour 
           together a few years ago, and I met Taylor through Sasha.

           Corey takes another deep breath. Then types...

           Corey’s Message: Cool. Have you guys stayed in touch?

           Jack’s Message: Yeah. A little. She told me about you...
                                 COREY
                             (to herself)
                        Crap, crap, crap!

           Corey pops up out of her chair and freaks out. She paces 
           around the room. Sits back down. Types...

           Corey’s Message: What’d she say???

           Jack’s Message: She told me that you’re transgender.

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        Bitch!

           We see “Jack is typing...”  Corey waits a long, torturous 
           beat. 

           Jack’s Message: I think it’s cool. My parent’s are Lesbians, 
           so it’s super chill. People can be so close-minded sometimes, 
           but I think you’re really hot!

           Corey’s Message: Thanks :) You too!

           Jack’s Message: I’ve gotta hit the books, but let’s chat 
           soon. I’d love to get to know you more:)

           Corey starts doing a happy dance around the room. 

           EXT. SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           The cherry blossoms are blooming. Spring has sprung.

           INT. ENTRYWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

           Sasha sits at a table in front of a banner that reads, 
           “COMING SOON-- SENIOR PROM! NOMINATE YOUR KING AND QUEEN!” 

                                 COREY
                        Hey Sasha, when is the vote for the 
                        nominees?

                                 SASHA
                        Next week. Why? You thinking of 
                        running for Prom King?

                                 COREY
                        Not Prom King... no. Uh Sasha, 
                        also, random question but do you 
                        know Jack Greenberg?
                                 SASHA
                        Yeah. He’s my ex. 

                                 COREY
                        Your ex... Really?

                                 SASHA
                        We dated a little after we did a 
                        teen tour together. Why?

                                 COREY
                        Oh. We’ve just been talking a 
                        little... Online.

           Sasha freaks out.

                                 SASHA
                        What in the actual fuck? You’ve 
                        been talking to my ex?

                                 COREY
                        Super casually...

                                 SASHA
                        That totally breaks girl code, 
                        Corey. Ugh, get out of my face 
                        right now! 

                                 NEKO (O.S.)
                        What’s going on?

           Neko arrives on the scene--

                                 COREY
                        Nothing. I’m leaving.

           Corey storms away determined. Off Neko watching her go, 
           conflicted, as we CUT TO:

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey puts the finishing touches on a FACEBOOK SATUS: 

                                “COREY RAE FOR PROM QUEEN”

           She posts the status and gets 2 Likes immediately. One from 
           Hannah, and the other from EJ JACKSON. 

           EJ comments on the status: YASSS QUEEN! GET IT GURLLL!

           Corey laughs to herself at EJ’s comment, before stalking Jack 
           Greenberg’s PHOTOS. He’s marked as ACTIVE with a green dot. 
           ON COREY wondering why he isn’t liking her page right away, 
           when something surprising happens--

           She gets a LIKE from NEKO DEL FORNO. ON COREY intrigued.

           INT. MARGIE’S OFFICE - HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Mid-session with Margie--

                                 COREY
                        I know there’s a very low chance of 
                        me getting nominated because 
                        everyone thinks I’m some diseased 
                        freak, but screw it-- 
                             (loudly)
                        Fuck what they think!

                                 MARGIE
                             (smiles)
                        Good for you, Corey. I know you can 
                        accomplish anything you set your 
                        mind to.

                                 COREY
                        Me too. Well except maybe finding a 
                        boy date to Prom. I don’t know if I 
                        can accomplish that herculean feat.

                                 MARGIE
                        Why don’t you think you can find a 
                        cis-gender boy date to Prom?

                                 COREY
                        Because... I’m Trans.

                                 MARGIE
                        So?

                                 COREY
                        I can barely fit into clothes 
                        without altering them. Oh, and I 
                        have a penis. There aren’t many 
                        straight, Freddie Prince Jr.-types 
                        looking for that date.

                                 MARGIE
                        I could go on and on about how 
                        beautiful you are, but it all means 
                        nothing unless you believe it.

                                 COREY
                        Oh don’t get me wrong, Margie, I 
                        know how hot I am! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COREY (CONT'D)
                        I just don’t know if any of these 
                        high school boys will be able to 
                        see past the transgender of it all. 
                        That’s why I can’t wait for 
                        college. I need a fresh start.

                                 MARGIE
                        Soon enough. But in the meantime, 
                        try to enjoy what’s left of your 
                        senior year. Run for Prom Queen. Go 
                        make your wildest dreams come true. 
                        I just want to caution you that 
                        there’s more to life than finding 
                        some perfect Freddie Prince Jr. 
                        Prom Date.  

                                 COREY
                        Like what?
                             (Off Margie’s look)
                        I’m joking... Sort of.  I actually 
                        met a guy. Online. A college guy, 
                        and he seems to like me for me.

           Off Corey excitedly telling Margie all about Jack Greenberg 
           in MOS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AP ART CLASS - DAY

           Corey and Neko work on self-portraits next to each other. 
           Corey’s is fantastic, while Neko’s is Kindergarten level bad. 
           Neko leans over--

                                 NEKO
                        Your self portrait is gorgeous. 
                        Mine looks like it was painted by 
                        Monet’s drunk uncle. Or is it 
                        Manet?

           Corey gives Neko the cold shoulder. This olive branch is too 
           little, too late from Neko. He proceeds --

                                 NEKO (CONT’D)
                        I think maybe your portrait is 
                        better than mine, because you have 
                        a better subject. 
                             (leans in closer)
                        Congratulations on running for Prom 
                        Queen by the way. Sasha would kill 
                        me, but you’ve got my vote--
                                 COREY
                             (snapping back)
                        You’ve said a grand total of zero 
                        words to me these past few months, 
                        and now you’re suddenly all buddy, 
                        buddy and shit!? Fuck that!

                                 NEKO
                        I’m sorry, Corey. I’ve been a 
                        shithead, just like my portrait. 

           TIGHT ON Neko’s self portrait where he looks like he has 
           brown shit for hair. They both laugh, easing the tension.

           EXT. WALKWAY - DAY

           Corey and Neko walk and talk on an outdoor WALKWAY--

                                 NEKO
                        I’m sorry I’ve been so distant 
                        these past few months. I know 
                        things shouldn’t change, but it was 
                        hard for me to figure out what you 
                        being a girl means for our 
                        friendship. Y’know? I mean you were 
                        my “art-guy-friend” in my favorite 
                        class. I looked forward to coming 
                        everyday--

                                 COREY
                             (defensive)
                        And now you don’t because I’m 
                        trans?

                                 NEKO
                        No, no, no. It’s just when you 
                        became my “art-girl-friend,” it 
                        just made it different. It’s just 
                        different.

                                 COREY
                        How is art your favorite class 
                        anyway? You’re terrible.

                                 NEKO
                        I get to learn from the most 
                        talented person I know. 

                                 COREY
                        Now you’re just kissing my nice 
                        ass. I forgive you for being mute 
                        these past few months. It’s cool. 
                                 NEKO
                        No, seriously. I miss our 
                        friendship. Can we just restart? 
                             (reaching out his hand)
                        I’m Neko. 

                                 COREY
                        You’re a freak. We’re all good. 

           Neko keeps his hand outstretched. Holds her eye contact. 

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        Fine. I’ll humor you. I’m Corey 
                        Rae. 

           They shake hands. It’s a charged moment. 

                                 NEKO
                        Nice to re-meet you, Corey Rae. 

                                 COREY
                        If you actually care about getting 
                        better at art, you should come with 
                        me to these art classes I take in 
                        the city. I’ll sneak you in.

           Neko smiles broadly, he’s in.

                        You’re going on a date?!

           INT. JUDY’S BEDROOOM - DAY

           Corey is anxiously trying on outfits in Judy’s closet. Hannah 
           and Judy are there for support. They talk rapid-fire, because 
           Corey’s running late. 

                                 COREY
                        It’s not a date. He has a 
                        girlfriend! 

                                 HANNAH
                        Corey, he has a thing for you. It’s 
                        obvious.

                                 JUDY
                        Who is he? Do I know him? 

                                 COREY
                        Neko Del Forno. Ugh, I have nothing 
                        to wear! 
                                 JUDY
                        Why don’t I drive you both to the 
                        city? I’d like to talk to this 
                        Neko. See what his intentions are?

                                 COREY
                        Oh my god, Mom. No way!

           Corey tries on a SKIMPY DRESS.

                                 JUDY
                        You can’t wear that Corey. 

                                 COREY
                        Why? It’s yours, Mom.

                                 JUDY
                        Leave a little to the imagination 
                        will you? 

                                 HANNAH
                        That’s an outfit Neko will go back 
                        and wank it to later. If you don’t 
                        wank it for him on the train.

                                 COREY
                        Gross! He has a girlfriend, Hannah!

                                 JUDY
                        Hello, it’s me, Corey’s mother?
                        I shouldn’t be hearing this! 

                                 COREY
                        Then leave!

                                 JUDY
                        You’re in my closet! 

           Corey sits down and starts applying mascara, at Judy’s 
           vanity, when they hear a HONK!

                                 COREY
                        Crap! That’s him. 

           Corey takes one more look in the mirror, makes the duckface 
           that the girls make. Smiles satisfied. Kisses Judy.

                                 JUDY
                        Text me when you’re coming home. 
                        And no later than 11pm!

           Corey darts out of the room without a response--
           INT. LIVING ROOM, WAGNER HOME - DAY

           Judy and Hannah peak through the BLINDS. ANGLE ON - Corey 
           making her way across the front lawn and hopping into Neko’s 
           PICK UP TRUCK. Neko opens the door for Corey, a gentleman.

                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        Wow. He is handsome.

           ON JUDY concerned for her daughter who’s becoming a WOMAN.

           INT. NEKO’S CAR - DAY

           Neko turns on his car--

                                 NEKO
                        Wow, I love that dress. 

           Corey blushes as Neko fiddles with the radio. Lands on--

           QUEEN’S “SOMEBODY TO LOVE,” WHICH PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING--

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Neko parks in the train station parking lot. They exit and 
           amble up to the tracks.  

           INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

           Neko and Corey sit next to each other watching Short Hills 
           become a dot in the distance as the train hurtles toward THE 
           BIG APPLE. QUICK SHOTS ESTABLISHING: PENN STATION, SUBWAY 
           PERFORMERS, WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK, NEW YORK’S HUSTLE AND 
           BUSTLE, before:

           INT. NYU DESIGN CLASS - DAY

           Corey and Neko sit next to each other in a FIGURE DRAWING 
           CLASS. Corey is in the zone, drawing. Neko’s mouth is wide 
           open. REVEAL THE MODEL IS NAKED, ass flapping in the breeze. 

                                 COREY
                        You okay there, stud?

           Neko tries to act cool, but is overwhelmed.

           INT. STREET, MEATPACKING DISTRICT - LATER

           Corey and Neko walk and talk while eating HOTDOGS--
                                 NEKO
                        Y’know, Hennie told people that you 
                        molested him.

                                 COREY
                        What a lying prick. Oh and he has a 
                        tiny prick by the way.

                                 NEKO
                        He also told people... Do you have? 
                        ... Have you had...?

           Neko kind of motions to his hotdog. Corey gets the hint.

                                 COREY
                        Yes, unfortunately I still have the 
                        whole package 

                                 NEKO
                        I’m sure some guys are super into 
                        that. 

                                 COREY
                        I’m not interested in having sex 
                        until I have a vagina. But you’re 
                        right, guys are such perverts.

                                 NEKO
                        Myself included. I love eating 
                        Sasha out, like, I can’t get enough 
                        of it. But she never reciprocates. 

                                 COREY
                        Screw that! I can’t wait to be 
                        someone’s girlfriend and start 
                        sucking some D!  

           Neko nearly spits out his hotdog. Corey starts deep-throating 
           her hotdog in jest. She’s the Kobayashi of deep-throating.

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - MAGIC HOUR

           They sit on a bench overlooking the Hudson River mid-convo-- 

                                 NEKO
                        I feel like NYU is the perfect fit 
                        for you, no? That class was 
                        amazing. 

                                 COREY
                        I really want to go to school in 
                        California, but my mom will never 
                        let me be that far away from home. 
           Corey’s phone buzzes. Corey looks at her text.

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        Speak of the worrywart now: “When 
                        are you coming home?”  Relax, Mom.

                                 NEKO
                        Why do you want to live in LA so 
                        badly? 

                                 COREY
                        I just want to live in a place 
                        where no one knows me, and people 
                        don’t look at me like I’m a freak 
                        anymore.  

                                 NEKO
                        I don’t look at you like that.

           Corey looks at Neko, still unsure if he’s telling the truth.

                                 NEKO (CONT’D)
                        If you ended up in the city, 
                        hopefully I’d be here too. I 
                        applied to NYU for film.

                                 COREY
                        Really?

                                 NEKO
                        Don’t get too excited. They 
                        waitlisted me. 

                                 COREY
                        That’s still amazing, congrats!

                                 NEKO
                        Have you ever gone out in the city? 

                                 COREY
                        No. Even though we live so close, 
                        I’ve never really experienced it. 

                                 NEKO
                        Maybe you shouldn’t rule it out 
                        until you get a taste. We could go 
                        out tonight?

                                 COREY
                        I dunno. My mom would freak... 

           Corey’s phone buzzes and buzzes, before she turns it OFF. 
           INT. WAGNER HOME - SAME

           Judy, holds a MOVING BOX, while on the PHONE at the bottom of 
           the staircase.

                                 JUDY
                        She’s not picking up. Something’s 
                        wrong.

           Steven takes down a BABY PHOTO of Corey off the staircase 
           wall of photos. He walks down to Judy. 

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Should we drive to the city to 
                        check on her?

                                 STEVEN
                        Relax, Judy. Corey’ll be fine.

                                 JUDY
                        Don’t tell me to relax! I’M 
                        RELAXED!

                                 STEVEN
                        I see that. 

                                 JUDY
                        I just don’t know this Neko kid. 
                        What if he’s messing with Corey? 
                        Carrie-style? She could end up in 
                        the Hudson for all we know!

                                 STEVEN
                        You’ve been reading too many YA 
                        novels. He’s a perfectly nice kid. 
                        I remember him from Little League.

           Steven puts the photo in Judy’s MOVING BOX.

                                 JUDY
                        Don’t put that there. My box is 
                        labeled Pre through K. That box is 
                        1st through 6th.
                             (off his look)
                        What? I’m relaxed! Organization 
                        relaxes me.

                                 EJ (PRE-LAP)
                        YASSS QUEEN!!!
           EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Corey and Neko approach EJ standing on the sidewalk. EJ is 
           the leader of a group of intimidating looking NYC MODELS. 

                                 COREY
                        Hey, EJ! This is my friend, Neko. 

                                 EJ
                        Damn, you two are a smoking hot 
                        couple!

                                 COREY
                        Oh, no. We’re not dating!

                                 EJ
                        Just friends with benefits? I get 
                        it.

           Corey is about to chime in to correct EJ, when--

                                 EJ (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go my Queens! Allons-y!

           EJ leads the cavalcade of Models, Corey, and Neko past a LONG 
           LINE OF CLUB-GOERS, who are waiting in line to get in.

                                 EJ (CONT’D)
                        HAH! Look at these Plebeians!

           EJ struts up to the front of the VELVET ROPE. Makes small 
           talk with the BOUNCERS and MANAGER.

           Corey and Neko drink in this new experience. They spot THE 
           BOUNCER scrutinizing a YOUNG TEENAGER’S ID, clearly a fake. 
           The Bouncer sends the Young Teenager off the line. They also 
           notice, a COP CAR pull up alongside the club. TWO COPS talk 
           to one of the Bouncers. Corey approaches EJ--

                                 COREY
                        EJ, um, we don’t have Fake IDs, and 
                        my ID is of me as a boy. 

                                 EJ
                        HAH! When you go up to the bouncer, 
                        don’t wobble over there like a 
                        scared little bird. 

           EJ does an impression of Corey walking like a scared bird. 
           The models laugh.

                                 EJ (CONT’D)
                        Strut in like you’re the ruler of 
                        the free world. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EJ (CONT’D)
                        Be a confident Queen for me. Hand 
                        him your ID, and hopefully he 
                        thinks you’re worthy of getting in.

                                 COREY
                        Hopefully!?

                                 EJ
                        If you don’t, well, I can’t bail 
                        you out of prison. I’m not the 
                        Mayor.

           Corey looks at the Cops again, scared. Corey and Neko confide 
           in each other off to the SIDE--

                                 NEKO
                        What do you think? Do we risk it?

                                 COREY
                        Screw it.

           The Bouncers start letting EJ and crew in. Corey’s heart is 
           pounding in her neck as she approaches the Bouncers, but she 
           takes EJ’s advice and struts with confidence...

           THE BOUNCER SCRUTINIZES COREY’S ID. Dramatic beat, before--

           He hands it back to Corey and waves her in. Neko gets in too.  
           Corey and Neko are ecstatic, but try to keep their cool as 
           they enter the CLUB--

           INT. NYC CLUB - NIGHT

           -- and rock out to 80’s inspired techno music.

           LATER - AT THE BAR

           Corey and Neko, all smiles, try to get the BARTENDERS 
           ATTENTION, when a HANDSOME MALE MODEL locks eyes with Corey 
           from across the way. Corey looks around, unsure who he’s 
           looking at. EJ wraps her arms around Neko and Corey. 

                                 EJ
                        Damn, hottie over there wants your 
                        goodies, Princess!

                                 COREY
                        No way. Does he!?

                                 NEKO
                        I think so.
                                 EJ
                        Remember, Queen’s don’t buy their 
                        own drinks. Bat those eyelashes.

           Corey makes eye contact with the Handsome Model, bats her 
           eyelashes. It works. He smiles and pushes through the crowd.

                                 HANDSOME MALE MODEL
                        Can I buy you a drink, beautiful?

           Corey nods, yes. 

           LATER - Neko sips a beer, while watching Corey dance with the 
           Model. He’s impressed with her moves. The song comes to an 
           end, and Corey breaks it off with the Model. Heads to Neko. 
           Grabs his hand. Pulls him onto the DANCE FLOOR-- 

           NEKO AND COREY DANCE AND GRIND, UNINHIBITED...

           THE SOUNDS of a train hurtling along the track, before--

           INT. TRAIN - LATE NIGHT

           Neko is fast asleep with his head on Corey’s shoulder. Corey 
           notices passengers staring at them. Are they clocking her as 
           transgender? She’s not sure. Corey’s heart sinks as she spots-

           HENNIE BURN AND HIS WHOLESOME FAMILY all decked out in 
           RANGER’S GEAR having come from a game at Madison Square 
           Garden and waiting to exit the train. 

           Hennie locks eyes with Corey. Furrows his brow. He notices 
           Neko lying on her shoulder. Uh oh. The train DOORS OPEN. 
           Hennie’s family exits, as Neko stirs awake... 

           EXT. WAGNER HOME - NIGHT

           Neko pulls up in front of Corey’s House. 

                                 COREY
                        Thank you for the ride.

                                 NEKO
                        Of course. Thank you. That was a 
                        dope night. 

           Awkward beat. They lock eyes.

                                 NEKO (CONT’D)
                        Oh, by the way. I had a question 
                        for you...
           Is this it? Is he going to make the move?

                                 NEKO (CONT’D)
                        Could we maybe keep this a secret?

                                 COREY
                        What?

                                 NEKO
                        Like, could you not tell Sasha, or 
                        anyone about today? She’ll cut off 
                        my balls if she finds out. 

           Corey sinks a few inches in her seat, disappointed.

                                 COREY
                        Right, of course. No. I hadn’t 
                        planned on telling anyone.

                                 NEKO
                        Perfect. You’re the best. Night.

           EXT. FRONT LAWN, WAGNER HOME - SAME

           Corey may or may not notice that the LIGHTS are on downstairs 
           as she trudges along the walkway swimming in her thoughts.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, WAGNER HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Judy and Steven sit on the couch. Judy’s arms are crossed. 
           She pops up as soon as Corey enters--

                                 JUDY
                        Corey! Where have you been? Why 
                        didn’t you text me?

                                 COREY
                        Hi. Sorry, my phone died.

           Judy approaches Corey in the ENTRYWAY.

                                 JUDY
                        You could have texted from Neko’s 
                        phone or something.

                                 COREY
                        I lost track of time. It’s not a 
                        big deal.

                                 JUDY
                        It’s a very big deal. I was worried 
                        sick.
                                 STEVEN
                        You should have texted your mother.

                                 COREY
                        Thanks, Steven. Can I go to bed? 

                                 JUDY
                        No. You’re not getting off that 
                        easy. You need to be more 
                        responsible in the future. You 
                        don’t know the types of things that 
                        can happen to people like you.

                                 COREY
                        What do you mean, “people like me?”

                                 JUDY
                        Trans people. You have to be 
                        careful, Corey. 

                                 COREY
                        I’M TIRED OF BEING SO CAREFUL ALL 
                        THE TIME!

           Corey runs up the staircase past what used to be the shrine 
           of Corey’s boy photos, but is now noticeably EMPTY. 

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey sends a message to Jack on the computer...

           Corey’s Message: My parents are so annoying sometimes!!!

           Jack’s Message: Why, what happened?

           Corey’s Message: I went out with a boy in the city today, and 
           my parents were so over-protective, like I’m a baby. 

           Jack’s Message: Who’s the lucky guy?

           Corey’s Message: Can you keep a secret?

           Jack’s Message: Of course.

           Corey’s Message: It was Sasha’s boyfriend.

           It takes a while for Jack to respond. Corey freaks out.

                                 COREY
                             (to herself)
                        Now he thinks I’m a cold blooded 
                        bitch! Ugh!
           Corey’s Message: We didn’t do anything, I swear. We’re just 
           friends. But I think he has a crush on me. 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           TIGHT ON: JACK GREENBERG’S COMPUTER--

           WIDEN OUT from Jack and Corey’s conversation, and --

           REVEAL that SASHA SALES IS JACK GREENBERG...

           INT. SASHA SALES BEDROOM - SAME

           Sasha is sitting at her computer typing as Jack. She reacts 
           to the news that Neko went out with Corey without her 
           knowing.

                                 SASHA
                             (to herself)
                        That bitch.

           Sasha types...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Jack’s Message: Of course he does. You’re gorgeous.

           Corey’s heart melts. Meanwhile, our AUDIENCE’S heart should 
           be crushed knowing that Jack isn’t real.

           INT. ENTRYWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Corey enters school carrying her tray of coffees, and is 
           immediately greeted by Robbie--

                                 ROBBIE
                        Did it really happen?

                                 COREY
                        Elaborate, Robbie? I haven’t had my 
                        morning coffee yet.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Did you and Neko hook up?

                                 COREY
                        No? Where’d you hear that from!?
                                 HENNIE (O.S.)
                        Corey, how’s Neko’s cum taste--?

           Corey whips around, clocks Hennie’s smug grin, and grabs 
           Hennie’s junk - HARD. Pushes him up against a LOCKER, with a 
           strength and speed we didn’t know she had. 

                                 HENNIE (CONT’D)
                             (squirming)
                        Get off me... What the hell!?

                                 COREY
                        Are you going to stop spreading 
                        rumors, or do you want me to tell 
                        my good friend, Dr. Pitts, how 
                        you’ve been calling me a fag for 
                        years? I think that constitutes a 
                        hate crime.

                                 HENNIE
                             (red-faced)
                        This... really hurts.

                                 COREY
                        Stop spreading the rumor and I’ll 
                        let you go. 

           Hennie nods, okay. Corey releases him. Hennie curls over. 

                                 HENNIE
                        I really don’t care enough about 
                        your life to spread that rumor.

           Corey blows Hennie a sarcastic ‘thank you’ kiss, making him 
           uncomfortable, so he darts away.

           INT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY

           Corey hands Monique her coffee--

                                 MONIQUE 
                        I know you’re just learning, but 
                        someone really needs to teach you 
                        about Girl Code, Corey.

                                 COREY
                        It’s not true Mo’, Jesus! How do 
                        you even know about that rumor?

                                 MONIQUE
                        I know everything going on with 
                        your little, hormonal asses.
                                 DR. PITTS (O.S.)
                        Language, Monique.

           Dr. Pitts enters. Corey hands Dr. Pitts her coffee. 

                                 DR. PITTS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Corey. Someone is going 
                        to have to teach you about a thing 
                        we call--

                                 COREY
                        Girl Code! Oh my god. You know 
                        too!?

                                 DR. PITTS
                        I know everything.

           Corey looks at the box of BALLOTS labeled PROM NOMINATIONS.

                                 COREY
                        If you know everything, how am I 
                        looking as a nominee?

           Dr. Pitts glares at Corey, before we CUT TO:

           INT. COREY’S HOMEROOM - DAY

           Corey and Hannah sit anxiously awaiting the ANNOUNCEMENTS. 
           They both stare at a POSTER of “SASHA SALES FOR PROM QUEEN.”

                                 COREY
                        I’m screwed, aren’t I? I mean, I 
                        just pissed off the soon to be Prom 
                        Queen. 

                                 HANNAH
                        It’s just a stupid rumor that will 
                        blow over. And hey, you could be 
                        Queen just as easily as her.

           Corey rolls her eyes, skeptical, then props up in her chair 
           as we HEAR THE LOUD-SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS--

                                 MONIQUE (OVER THE SPEAKER)
                        ... and finally the nominees for 
                        Prom King and Queen are as follows:

           Corey braces herself for the worst.

                                 MONIQUE (CONT’D)
                        Sasha Sales...
                                 HANNAH
                        Shocker. 

                                 MONIQUE (OVER THE SPEAKER)
                        Nathalie Valle...

           NATHALIE, a PRETTY GIRL in the WANNABBEE, SLUTTY CHEERLEADERS 
           pops up in the back of the classroom. She does a cheer for 
           herself. The other cheerleaders clap.

           Hannah and Corey golf clap. Roll their eyes.

                                 MONIQUE (OVER THE SPEAKER) (CONT’D)
                        Keren Brender...

                                 HANNAH
                             (genuinely happy for her)
                        No way! Awesome!

                                 COREY
                        Go Keren!

                                 MONIQUE (OVER THE SPEAKER)
                        And lastly... Corey Rae.  
                             (beat, surprised)
                        Damn girl. Go Corey Rae!

           Corey is happily astonished. Hannah jumps up and down.

           All of the CLASSMATES are stunned. Hannah starts whistling.

                                 COREY
                        I can’t believe it worked. How did 
                        I get nominated?

                                 HANNAH
                        The rumor must have helped! People 
                        probably wanted to piss Sasha off 
                        or something-- 
                             (catching sight of 
                              something off screen)
                        Uh oh.

           Corey whips around to find Sasha Sales in the door window, 
           looking furious. The CLASS oo’s and ah’s. 

           INT. WOMEN’S RESTROOM - DAY

           Corey and Sasha are alone in the bathroom. Mano a mano.
                                 COREY
                        Listen, Sasha. Nothing happened, 
                        this is all just a big 
                        misunderstanding!

                                 SASHA
                        When Hennie told me he saw you and 
                        Neko I was pissed. So I confronted 
                        Neko--

                                 COREY
                        We didn’t do anything! 

                                 SASHA
                        --and he came clean. Told me 
                        everything...

                                 COREY
                        Told you what? 

           Sasha holds out her PHONE, and shows Corey--

           A TEXT MESSAGE CONVERSATION WITH NEKO

           TIGHT ON COREY devastated by what she reads...

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                             (reads aloud as Neko)
                        “I would never hook up with that 
                        cross-dresser, ever. Ew. Are you 
                        serious? Gross. No I was just 
                        hanging out with her to be nice...” 

           Sasha puts a faux-compassionate arm on Corey.

                                 SASHA
                        I believe you, Corey. I know you 
                        guys didn’t hook up or whatever. I 
                        mean, you’re not really his type. 

           Corey tries to mask her hurt. But it’s tough.

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        I know I shunned you for talking to 
                        my ex and breaking girl code 
                        before, but I want you to know I’m 
                        going to be the bigger person and 
                        forgive you. 

                                 COREY
                             (surprised)
                        ... Really?
           The Audience should suspect that Sasha is up to something, 
           but unsure what her end goal is here with Corey...

                                 SASHA
                        Yeah. I just realized I’ve been a 
                        bit of a bitch since you started 
                        dressing like a girl, or becoming a 
                        girl, or whatever you call it, and 
                        I wanted to say that I’m sorry.

           Corey isn’t quite sure if she buys Sasha’s apology as 
           genuine, but she’s willing to hear her out.

                                 COREY
                        ... Um, thanks. I appreciate it.

                                 SASHA
                        We’re all going to go Prom dress 
                        shopping this weekend, and the 
                        other girls insisted you come with. 
                        What do you say? You have the best 
                        style out of all of us. Would be 
                        nice to all be together again. 

           A well timed compliment will always win Corey over, and Sasha 
           knows it. Corey doesn’t suspect there’s any foul play going 
           on so she meets Sasha halfway. Finally embraces her apology.

                                 COREY
                        That actually sounds great. Let’s 
                        do it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FITTING ROOM - NEIMAN MARCUS - DAY

           The “It” Girls stand around trying on Prom dresses and 
           gossiping--

                                 SASHA
                        I can’t believe you’re going with 
                        Roger, Taylor. He’s balding.

                                 TAYLOR
                        It’s a widow’s peak. He’s really 
                        mature for his age. 

                                 SASHA
                        Barf.

           ON COREY enjoying being part of the girls again. Neko may 
           have turned out to be an ass-hole, but at least she has her 
           girl friends (she thinks).
                                 KEREN
                        Corey and Hannah, you guys should 
                        just go together!

                                 HANNAH
                        I would be down.

                                 SASHA
                             (scheming)
                        But Jack Greenberg told me you and 
                        him are getting close, Corey. Why 
                        don’t you just ask him out? 
                             (beat)
                        I swear I wouldn’t mind.

           The Audience should now realize Sasha’s plan is to trick 
           Corey into going to prom with the imaginary Jack Greenberg...

                                 COREY
                        I dunno. I mean, yeah, we’re close, 
                        but--

                                 HANNAH
                        Go with him! I’ll totally find 
                        someone else to go with, or just go 
                        alone with my fat self.

                                 SASHA
                        Don’t say that, Hannah! 
                             (trying to be nice)
                        You’re so beautiful for a big boned 
                        person.

           Hannah seethes, while Corey mulls over going with Jack.

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Corey types a message to Jack (Sasha), excited...

           Corey’s Message: I was nominated for Prom Queen, but I don’t 
           know if I can win without a date...

           Jack’s Message: You don’t have a date?

           Corey’s mouth curls into a smile. Is he catching on? Corey 
           types quickly...

           Corey’s Message: Nope...

                                 COREY
                             (to herself)
                        Take the hint! Take the hint!
           Jack’s Message: Corey Rae. It would be an honor and a 
           privilege to take you to Prom. Will you have me?

           Corey let’s out a SCREAM!!! We hear Judy sprint up the 
           stairs, and whip open the door--

                                 JUDY
                        What happened!? Are you okay!?

                                 COREY
                        I’m going to Prom with a boy! I’m 
                        going to Prom with a real boy!

           Corey and Judy hop around the room excited.

           INT. ENTRYWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 

           Corey, Hannah, and Robbie hand out fliers standing in front 
           of COREY’S PROM CAMPAIGN POSTER: COREY RAE FOR PROM QUEEN.

                                 HANNAH
                             (handing a flier)
                        Vote, Corey Rae.

                                 ROBBIE
                             (handing a flier)
                        Vote, Corey Rae.

                                 HANNAH
                        When are you meeting up with Jack 
                        tonight?

                                 COREY
                        7pm. I hope he doesn’t take one 
                        look at me and run for the hills.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Oh stop. He’s going to be super 
                        into you. I mean, you’re really 
                        beautiful, Corey. 

           Robbie blushes, embarrassed. 

                                 COREY
                        Thanks, Robbie. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. FAMILY ROOM, WAGNER HOME - DAY

           Corey whips open the door, and is ready to run up the stairs  
           to get dressed, when Judy blocks her pathway, excited. She 
           presents two THICK ENVELOPES from NYU and UCLA. 

                                 JUDY
                        Your acceptance letters finally 
                        arrived! Woohoo! Open them up!

           Corey doesn’t share Judy’s same enthusiasm.

                                 COREY
                        I’ll open them later. I need to get 
                        ready for my date.

                                 JUDY
                        Later? Come on. Humor me?

                                 COREY
                        I don’t even care. It doesn’t 
                        matter if I get in or not, because 
                        it’s never been about what I want, 
                        has it?

                                 JUDY
                             (taken aback)
                        Corey!

                                 COREY
                        I’m running late for my date. I 
                        need to get ready--

           Corey hops the steps two at a time, as Judy and Steven share 
           a concerned look at the bottom of the stairs.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Corey stands in the mirror in the RED DRESS her grandparents 
           gave her. She’s hyping herself up for the date--

                                 COREY
                        You are a badass Queen, and he’d be 
                        lucky to have you. You are a 
                        baddass Queen and he’d be lucky to 
                        have you...

           INT. STEVEN’S CAR - IN MOTION - DAY

           Steven drives Corey to her date. Corey is lost in thought, a 
           million things on her mind. Steven notices--
                                 STEVEN
                        How are you doing, Corey?

                                 COREY
                        Fine, Steven. Just fine.

                                 STEVEN
                        Steven. You have a way of making my 
                        name feel alien to me.

                                 COREY
                        I don’t mean to.

                                 STEVEN
                        Y’know, I’ve never wanted to 
                        replace your biological Dad, but I 
                        have helped raise you since you 
                        were three, and love you with all 
                        of my heart.

                                 COREY
                        I know that.

                                 STEVEN
                        Maybe. I dunno. I hope you feel 
                        that I love you unconditionally. No 
                        matter what choices you make in 
                        life. Even if you want to go to 
                        UCLA over NYU. 

           Corey looks up. He has her attention.

                                 STEVEN (CONT’D)
                        Your mom may like things a certain 
                        way. And that way is usually color 
                        coded and organized. But she always 
                        prefers the way where you are 
                        happy. So do what makes you happy 
                        in life, and it will make your Mom 
                        happy. Got it? We love you Corey. I 
                        love you.

                                 COREY
                             (loving)
                        You may not be my biological father 
                        but you’ll always be my Steven. 

           Steven may have wanted to be called Dad, but this still means 
           a lot to him. 

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        I love you too. 

           Steven pulls up to the FANCY RESTAURANT.
           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Corey sits at a table, alone. She slurps from an empty glass.

                                 WAITER (O.S.)
                        Would you like another shirley 
                        temple?

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           Meanwhile, the “It” Girls are HOT-BOXING Sasha’s BATHROOM 
           with a joint, and giggling about nothing in particular.

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m going to call Corey, and see 
                        how her date is going. 

           Sasha and Taylor exchange mischievous looks. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        I’m sure it’ll be interesting. 

                                 SASHA
                        Yeah...

           Hannah clocks Sasha and Taylor’s smiles. Thinks it’s weird.

           INT. SASHA SALES’ BEDROOM - SAME

           Hannah sits down at Sasha’s desk. She dials Corey on her 
           cell, while also turning on Sasha’s COMPUTER by accidentally 
           shaking the MOUSE. The phone RINGS as--

           HANNAH CATCHES SIGHT OF SASHA’S COMPUTER SCREEN, and finds--

           JACK GREENBERG’S PROFILE 

           Hannah’s eyes bulge. She hears Sasha and Taylor giggling in 
           the BATHROOM. 

           Hannah gets Corey’s voicemail. She keeps calling and calling, 
           as she scrolls through the computer conversations. No 
           response from Corey. 

           She discovers what we already knew, that SASHA IS “JACK 
           GREENBERG”...

                                 HANNAH
                        Shit. 

           Hannah gets up and busts--
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           -- into the bathroom, where Sasha and Taylor are still 
           giggling-- 

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t fucking believe you guys!

                                 SASHA
                        ... What?

                                 HANNAH
                        You know what.

                                 TAYLOR
                        We were just messing around. Relax.

                                 SASHA
                        It’s just a joke. Don’t tell Corey.

                                 HANNAH
                        How can two people who are so 
                        beautiful, be so fucking ugly on 
                        the inside?

           Hannah SLAMS the door shut--

           EXT. SASHA SALES’ HOME - NIGHT

           -- sprints out the front door, hops into her car, and peels 
           out of the driveway. The SOUND of burning rubber, becomes the 
           SOUND OF CRYING as we--

           INT. JUDY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           REVEAL Corey is sitting on Judy’s lap, having just found out 
           the terrible news. Corey is crying uncontrollably. Hannah and 
           Judy try to calm Corey down, but it’s not working. 

           CUE QUEEN’S “BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY” OVER THE FOLLOWING MONTAGE--

           INT. SHOWER - NIGHT

           Corey is taking a SHOWER, and is unable to stand without 
           holding onto the wall. We can tell she’s crying even though 
           the running water masks the sound.

           INT. DR. PITTS OFFICE - NIGHT

           Judy and Corey meet with Dr. Pitts--
                                 DR. PITTS
                        I’m so so sorry Corey. We take 
                        cyber-bullying extremely seriously. 
                        They’re going to be suspended for a 
                        week, and we’ll be scheduling 
                        meetings with their parents. The 
                        police are going to talk to you 
                        about potentially pressing 
                        charges...

           Dr. Pitts’ voice trails off as Corey looks off catatonic... 

           INT. AP CALCULUS CLASS - DAY

           A Soccer Jock talks with a Fantasy Football Lover--

                                 SOCCER JOCK
                        It’s so messed up. They made up 
                        some fake person, and asked her to 
                        Prom.

                                 FANTASY FOOTBALL LOVER
                        That is horrifying. Fuck.

           INT. HEALTH CLASS - DAY

           A Wannabee, Slutty Cheerleader talks with a Cool Stoner--

                                 WANNABEE SLUTTY CHEERLEADER
                        They did it for months.

                                 COOL STONER
                        Poor, Corey. That’s psychotic. 

           INT. HALLWAY, SHORT HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Sasha and Taylor, returning for the first time since their 
           suspension, trudge down the hallway with their heads bowed in 
           shame. As they walk ALL THE STUDENTS GIVE THEM DIRTY LOOKS. 

           THEY’VE NOW BECOME THE PARIAHS.

           ROBBIE stares them down, pissed the fuck off. He SLAMS his 
           locker as they pass. Then approaches--

                                 ROBBIE
                        How could you do that to her?

                                 SASHA
                        Leave us alone, Mayo Dick.
           Sasha looks around trying to rally support. But none of the 
           STUDENTS in the hallway laugh. They all are on Team Robbie.

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Corey is lying in bed. The mess around the room should 
           indicate that she’s been here for days. There’s a knock at 
           the door--

                                 JUDY
                        Corey, you have a visitor.

           Robbie enters the room with a bouquet of flowers. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Hi, Corey.

           He shuffles awkwardly in the doorway. Judy closes the door. 

                                 ROBBIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s been lonely this past week 
                        without you. We all miss you. 

           Corey turns to look at Robbie. 

                                 COREY
                        Please leave. I don’t need your 
                        pity, Robbie.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Pity?

                                 COREY
                        Yeah. I don’t need people feeling 
                        sorry for me because I’m a pathetic 
                        loser.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Loser? What? Corey, you are the 
                        coolest person I’ve ever met.

                                 COREY
                        That’s not saying much...

                                 ROBBIE
                        Seriously Corey. I’ve been in awe 
                        of you for as long as I’ve known 
                        you. You’re cool, you’re wicked 
                        smart, you’re funny, and well 
                        there’s just no other girl like 
                        you.

           Corey tries not to show how much this means to her. 
                                 ROBBIE (CONT’D)
                        I know you were looking to take a 
                        boy to Prom, and I thought why not 
                        me? Maybe I could be that lucky 
                        guy? What do you say?

                                 COREY
                        I love you, but please leave me 
                        alone Robbie.

           Robbie exhales, and exits. 

           EXT. BACKYARD, WAGNER HOME - DUSK

           Corey sits on patio furniture staring off, when her 
           meditative moment is interrupted-- 

                                 HANNAH (O.S.)
                        What the hell, Corey?

           ENTER Hannah who is ticked off.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I heard how you treated, Robbie. 
                        Not cool. 

                                 COREY
                        As if people care how I’m treated?

                                 HANNAH
                        Listen, I know what Sasha and 
                        Taylor did was messed up, but it 
                        doesn’t give you the right to be 
                        mean too. 

                                 COREY
                        How am I being mean?

                                 HANNAH
                        We’ve all been here for you this 
                        whole year. Your Mom, your family, 
                        Robbie, me. We’ve all supported 
                        you. And yet it’s still not good 
                        enough. You haven’t even called me 
                        since we found out about Sasha and 
                        Taylor. You shut me out. 

                                 COREY
                        There’s nothing to talk about. 

                                 HANNAH
                        This whole year has been about you-- 
                        Corey, Corey, Corey. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANNAH (CONT'D)
                        But have you given any thought into 
                        what anyone else is going through? 

           Corey looks up. Maybe she hadn’t.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I was in love with you 
                        Corey. I still am. You don’t think 
                        I’ve been going through some shit 
                        too? You were the only thing that 
                        made me feel okay about myself. The 
                        fact that this gorgeous, perfect 
                        guy, could like me. Gross, 
                        overweight, pathetic old me.

           Hannah’s internal pain hits Corey hard. She feels like shit.

                                 COREY
                        I’m so, so sorry I didn’t--

                                 HANNAH
                        Listen, it’s okay. I’m okay. It all 
                        doesn’t matter now. I’m just saying 
                        that it’s time to stop feeling 
                        sorry for yourself, because you’re 
                        surrounded by people who love you. 

           Corey starts tearing up, as we FLY OVER THE SHORT HILLS 
           NEIGHBORHOOD AGAIN...

           INT. MARGIE’S OFFICE - HIGH-RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           ... and PULL BACK through the window and find Corey looking 
           out, eyes bloodshot. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Are we just going to sit here and 
                        stare off into the distance, or are 
                        we going to talk about it?

                                 COREY
                        There’s nothing to talk about. I 
                        feel pathetic. 

                                 MARGIE
                        You’re strong.

                                 COREY
                        I don’t know why I thought a boy 
                        would ever be into me. I mean, I 
                        should have known that it was too 
                        good to be true. Who could ever 
                        love me?
                                 MARGIE
                        Corey. I have a very simple, but 
                        important question for you: Do you 
                        love yourself?

                                 COREY
                        Not right now. No.

                                 MARGIE
                        Why?

                                 COREY
                        Because... 

                                 MARGIE
                        Because isn’t an answer, Corey. Why 
                        don’t you love yourself?

                                 COREY
                        I don’t love myself, because I HATE 
                        MY BODY!

           Corey tosses a PILLOW across the room for emphasis.

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                             (through tears)
                        I’m literally trapped and I don’t 
                        know when I’ll ever feel free.

           Corey curls up in a ball on the floor. Margie rushes to her 
           side. Hugs Corey. Calms her down. 

                                 MARGIE
                        Sh... It’s okay, Corey... Sh... 

           Corey blows her nose. Calms down.

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Corey, there are times when you 
                        come into my office, and I forget 
                        that you’re transgender. You may 
                        not believe it, but you are that 
                        girl you know you are on the inside 
                        even without your sexual 
                        reassignment surgery. You remind me 
                        so much of my daughter. She was 
                        obsessed with everything pink. It 
                        was terrible - I HATE PINK!

           Corey laughs. Blows her nose again. 

                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        Corey, don’t trust what you see in 
                        the movies. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGIE (CONT’D)
                        A woman doesn’t have to like pink. 
                        We don’t have to be Princesses, and 
                        we most certainly don’t have to be 
                        Queens. A woman just needs to love 
                        herself for who she is. That’s what 
                        makes a “real” woman. Can you do 
                        that?

           Corey takes a deep breath. Can she? ON COREY looking out the 
           window, knowing what she wants to do now... 

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Corey sits at her easel designing a PROM DRESS, focused. The 
           dress is PINK, of course. Corey sews together pink fabric. 

           Drapes the fabric on her mannequin. Makes some adjustments. 
           Sews some more. We don’t see her creation yet, but Corey 
           looks at it, satisfied. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COREY’S BEDROOM - PROM NIGHT

           Judy does Corey’s make-up as they have a heart to heart--

                                 JUDY
                        I was always afraid of you getting 
                        hurt for being yourself-- 

                                 COREY
                        Well you were right, per usual. 
                        Y’know they’re going to be there 
                        tonight, Mom. Is it crazy for me to 
                        go? 

                                 JUDY
                        Y’know when I gave birth to you it 
                        was the most incredible, insane, 
                        delicious experience I’ve ever had 
                        in my entire life. It was supposed 
                        to be hard, a VBAC - vaginal birth 
                        after a c section. Those aren’t 
                        supposed to happen, and if they do, 
                        they’re supposed to be pain-ful. 
                        But you just burst out, announcing 
                        yourself to the world... So easy.
                             (in awe of her daughter)
                        That’s you. You make things that 
                        are supposed to be hard, easy and 
                        incredible. Childbirth. Life. Your 
                        transition. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDY (CONT'D)
                        The joy you bring to it all. That’s 
                        why I’m realizing I’m crazy to ever 
                        worry about you... So you got 
                        knocked down by some evil girls? 
                        Big deal. Never let anyone stand in 
                        the way of what you want... even 
                        me. Because that love of life is 
                        what’s so special about you, Corey. 
                        So go do what you always do, and 
                        fucking go for it!

           Corey grins broadly, encouraged. She stands up and studies 
           her reflection in a full length MIRROR--

           REVEAL she’s now in THE PINK PROM DRESS SHE DESIGNED HERSELF. 
           Judy wells up, before they both hug and happy-cry together. 

           EXT. HANNAH GREEN’S MANSION - PROM NIGHT

           A valet station is set up in front of Hannah Green’s house 
           for a small PRE-PROM GATHERING.

           INT. HANNAH GREEN’S MANSION - PROM NIGHT

           Hors D’oeuvres and champagne flutes are served by model 
           caterers to an intimate gathering. Corey and THE WAGNER 
           FAMILY mingle with Hannah and THE GREEN FAMILY. Also, in 
           attendance are ROBBIE LIPPMAN AND FAMILY, and KEREN BRENDER 
           AND FAMILY, and a special guest we’ll reveal soon. Corey 
           pulls Robbie and Hannah aside --

                                 COREY
                        Listen I need to apologize to you 
                        both.

                                 ROBBIE
                        Don’t. There’s no need.

                                 HANNAH
                        Agreed. Save it.

                                 COREY
                        Thanks for being there for me.

           Corey, Robbie, and Hannah group hug and make up. 

                                 ROBBIE
                        Honestly, I should be thanking you. 
                        Keren is way out of my league. 

                                 COREY
                        You’re right about that. 
                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        Okay, let’s get a group picture 
                        guys.

           Judy wrangles the kids, and directs them to LINE UP for a 
           classic PROM PICTURE. Guys behind Girls. Corsages out. 

           WE PAN DOWN THE LINE - past Keren, standing in a classic prom 
           pose with Robbie, past Hannah who is in the girl’s position 
           being big-spooned by her date, EJ JACKSON (Ej is our special 
           guest) and ends on--

           COREY RAE who looks ravishing in her PINK DRESS, and who is 
           going to Prom alone and owning it BECAUSE COREY DOESN’T NEED 
           A DATE TO VALIDATE HERSELF!

                                 JUDY (CONT’D)
                        Say cheese!

           The photo FLASH, brings us to--

           INT. PARTY BUS - IN MOTION -  DUSK

           Flashing lights in their party bus. Corey sits and observes 
           the action all around her. Kids are chugging alcohol and 
           dancing on the STRIPPER POLES, having a blast.

           INT. PARTY SPACE - PROM NIGHT

           A large projector displays, SHORT HILLS HIGH - SENIOR PROM. 
           There’s a DJ, a dance floor, and a buffet. The kids dart to 
           the dance floor, while the Teachers, we recognize from 
           earlier, stand around looking amused. 

           Robbie, Hannah, and Corey follow the procession of students 
           heading to the dance floor as they pass the Prom King and 
           Queen VOTING BOOTH, where Dr. Pitts holds court behind a 
           table collecting ballots.

                                 HANNAH
                        Has anyone seen Sasha or Taylor 
                        yet?

                                 COREY
                        I don’t know what I’ll do if I see 
                        them.

                                 HANNAH
                        Don’t worry. We’ve got your back. 
                                 ROBBIE
                        I hear Public Enemy number one and 
                        two are hiding out somewhere. 
                        They’re too afraid to show their 
                        faces. The cowards!

           ON COREY clocking STUDENTS casting their ballots. Corey 
           starts to freak out internally. 

                                 HANNAH
                        You okay, Corey? 

           Corey nods, yes. But isn’t sure...

                                 COREY
                        I have to run to the bathroom 
                        really quick.

           Corey heads off as we catch NEKO NOTICING COREY...

           INT. WOMEN’S RESTROOM - PROM NIGHT

           Corey stands at the SINKS staring into the mirror. We hear 
           the door open behind her, as--

                                 NEKO (O.S.)
                        Corey? Is that you? Can I come in?

           Corey turns to find Neko in a TUXE.

                                 COREY
                        Leave me alone, Neko.

                                 NEKO
                        Listen, I’ve been trying to track 
                        you down and talk to you for weeks. 
                        I feel terrible.

                                 COREY
                        Just go!

                                 NEKO
                        I swear to God, I didn’t know about 
                        the fake account, and if I did I 
                        would have turned her in myself. I 
                        broke up with Sasha right when I 
                        found out. 

                                 COREY
                        Listen, you don’t have to pretend 
                        to be “nice” to me.
                                 NEKO
                        I’m not just being nice!

                                 COREY
                        Bullshit. Sasha told me before all 
                        of this went down.

                                 NEKO
                        What do you mean?

                                 COREY
                        I saw the texts. You told her you 
                        just went out with me that day to 
                        be nice. That you would never hook 
                        up with a “cross dressing” freak.

                                 NEKO
                             (confused)
                        What? No. I would never say that. I 
                        swear! 

                                 COREY
                        Just stop messing with me, and get 
                        out of here...
                             (he doesn’t budge)
                        GET OUT!!!

           Neko takes a deep, emotional breath before leaving. Corey 
           calms down, studies herself in the MIRROR again, before--

           WE HEAR CRYING FROM ONE OF THE STALLS...

           Corey turns around. Approaches the stall. Corey pushes the 
           door open to find SASHA, who’s mascara is smeared from 
           crying. She’s a mess. Awkward beat.

                                 SASHA
                        I’m so sorry... 

           Sasha cries more. Corey doesn’t know what to say. Sorry isn’t 
           good enough. Not by a fucking long shot. But she doesn’t 
           leave--

                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        I know, it doesn’t make it any 
                        better, but I really am sorry. I 
                        know it’s been a crazy year for 
                        you, but it’s been a crazy year for 
                        everyone. You’re so confident, so 
                        you’ll never know what it feels 
                        like to look in the mirror every 
                        morning and hate yourself. I don’t 
                        know why I did it. You’re an 
                        amazing person, I’m a monster... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SASHA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I just wanted some of your 
                        confidence to rub off on me.

           Corey thinks about this. 

                                 COREY
                        I’m not going to forget the 
                        horrible fucking things you did to 
                        me just because you say - “sorry.”

                                 SASHA
                        I know, I know... You shouldn’t.

                                 COREY
                        And maybe by losing my friendship, 
                        you’ll learn never to fucking treat 
                        someone like that ever again. EVER.
                             (Sasha nods in agreement, 
                              she won’t)
                        ... But you’re not a monster. 
                             (beat, thinks)
                        Listen, I spent way too much of 
                        this year locked in a stall, and I 
                        refuse to be responsible for 
                        someone else going through the same 
                        thing. Let’s just go out there 
                        together, and I’ll make sure no one 
                        pulls anything on you. Okay?

                                 SASHA
                        I can’t go out there... look at me. 
                        I’m not brave like you. 

                                 COREY
                        Here. Let me touch you up. 

           LATER - Corey re-touches Sasha’s make-up. Sasha is 
           dumbfounded that Corey would do this for her. Maybe Corey is 
           dumbfounded too. 

           Corey finishes up and smiles satisfied with her work. 

                                 SASHA
                        I need to come clean about 
                        something else too, Corey. 
                             (Corey braces herself)
                        Neko didn’t send that text... I 
                        made that up too.

           Corey lights up. She’s mad at Sasha, but thrilled at what 
           this means.
                                 DR. PITTS (V.O.)
                        It’s time to announce this years 
                        Senior Prom King and Queen...

           INT. PARTY SPACE - NIGHT

           Dr. Pitts stands on the stage in front of the dance floor. 
           The Student Body eagerly awaits the results.

           IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM--

           Corey and Sasha re-join the party and stand in the back of 
           the CROWD. Corey turns to Sasha--

                                 COREY
                             (whispers to Sasha)
                        If people give you a hard time when 
                        you win, I’ll handle it. Don’t 
                        worry.

           Sasha nods her thanks. They both take deep breaths in 
           anticipation...

           BACK ON STAGE--

                                 DR. PITTS
                             (into mic)
                        Reminder, we will not be doing a 
                        King and Queen Dance this year. 
                        Instead we’ll do a Victory lap.

           THE CROWD BOOS!

                                 DR. PITTS (CONT’D)
                             (into mic)
                        Quiet please. Quiet. First, the 
                        Prom King is... 
                             (dramatic beat, reading)
                        Neko Del Forno.

           Cheers and clapping. 

           IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM - Neko, still clearly emotional, 
           ambles up through the crowd, hops ON STAGE, and accepts his 
           CROWN. He forces a smile, but his heart isn’t in it. 

                                 DR. PITTS (CONT’D)
                             (into the mic)
                        And the winner of this years Prom 
                        Queen is...

           Dr. Pitts opens up a piece of paper. Dramatic Beat.
           ON COREY bracing herself for the worst. 

                                 DR. PITTS (CONT’D)
                             (into the mic)
                        COREY RAE.

           THE CROWD ERUPTS IN CHEERS AND APPLAUSE!!!

           ON COREY STUNNED as the SOUND is sucked out of the room, and 
           it feels like we’re UNDER WATER, as--

           WE’RE IN COREY’S POV--

           Corey turns to Sasha who cheers and mouths, “You won!!!” 

           Corey slowly makes her way to the front of the STAGE and is 
           slowed down by well wishers, including EJ, Robbie, and Hannah 
           who are all going insane - though we can’t HEAR what they’re 
           saying. 

           Finally Corey makes it ON STAGE and stares at Neko who is 
           clapping the loudest of all, as the SOUND RETURNS--

           Dr. Pitts approaches and puts on Corey’s TIARA-- 

                                 DR. PITTS (CONT’D)
                             (into mic)
                        Now it’s time to start the victory 
                        lap.

           THE DJ PLAYS THE VICTORY LAP MUSIC, something corny and  
           popular like Taylor Swift’s YOU BELONG WITH ME. Before Neko 
           and Corey can do their victory lap, Neko approaches the mic--

                                 NEKO
                             (into mic)
                        With all due respect, a victory lap 
                        is bullshit. Will you dance with 
                        me, Corey?

           All eyes on Corey Rae. She’s poker faced for a moment. Then 
           smiles broadly. She nods, okay. 

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR

           Neko and Corey SLOW DANCE surrounded by the entire school. 
           Neko pulls Corey in close. 

           They both smile and dance as if they’re the only ones in the 
           room. Seeing each other. Truly seeing each other. 

           And then the rest of THE CROWD joins in-- 
           Hannah crazy dances with EJ. Robbie and Keren slow dance. 
           Monique dances with Mr. Shilp, before we BOOM UP ON THIS 
           HAPPY ENDING and CUE QUEEN’S “KILLER QUEEN,” as we--

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. NYC APARTMENT - DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        So I decided to go to NYU, and 
                        pursue my dreams of being like 
                        Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the 
                        City and it was the best decision I 
                        ever made... 

           Corey sits at a drafting table, sketching, in her tasteful 
           NYU dorm room. She wears a chic but casual outfit that would 
           make Carrie Bradshaw proud.

           EXT. NYC STREET - DAY

                                 COREY (V.O.)
                        ... well, actually, I’m more of a 
                        Samantha Jones.

           Corey struts down an NYC street with confidence, style, and a 
           pep to her step. 

           SHE’S BECOME THE DYNAMIC WOMAN SHE ALWAYS DREAMED SHE WOULD 
           BE, as we FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
