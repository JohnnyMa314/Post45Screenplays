           OVER BLACK we hear:

                                 911 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        911, what’s your emergency?

                                 TEEN BOY (V.O.)
                        Yo, this house is on fire!

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           We cut in on a FACEBOOK LIVE VIDEO STREAM of a burning house 
           on a dark residential street. A TEEN BOY talks on the phone. 

                                 TEEN BOY
                        652 Marion Ave! It’s a huge fire! 

           We hear the voice of an unseen TEEN GIRL who’s recording the 
           video we’re watching. She addresses her Facebook audience.  

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.)
                        Oh my God, this is crazy you guys! 
                        This is insane!

           Facebook reactions and comments (”sad face emoji” “prayer 
           hands emoji” “hope everyone’s safe” etc) pop up on the video. 
           These comments continue over the course of the live stream. 
           As the camera moves around we see that there are a few other 
           BYSTANDERS nearby. Teen Girl turns camera towards Teen Boy. 

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        They coming?

                                 TEEN BOY
                        Yeah.

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.)
                         (to Facebook audience)
                        We called 911, so help is on the way. 
                        This is wild you guys! I’ve never seen--

           Suddenly, a woman’s scream comes from inside the house. 

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God!

                                 TEEN BOY
                         (to 911 operator)
                        Holy shit, there's a lady in there! 
                        She's screaming, man! Where's the fire 
                        truck, man?!

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.)
                        You guys this is so scary. She’s-- Oh 
                        my God, I feel so helpless. 
           The camera turns towards the other bystanders.

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What do we do?! We have to do 
                        something!

                                 TEEN BOY
                         (still on phone)
                        They said to wait for the firemen. 
                         (grave realization)
                        There’s nothing we can do.

           We hear the faint sirens of an approaching fire truck. The 
           bystanders look at the fire and listen to the woman scream. 
           Some of them cry. All of them feel fucking powerless.

           Suddenly, a MYSTERY MAN emerges from the darkness and dashes 
           into the burning house. 

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.)
                        Did you guys see that?!

                                 TEEN BOY
                        Yoooo!

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.)
                        A man just ran into the fire! 

           Mystery Man emerges from the fire like a goddamn American 
           hero, carrying CLAUDETTE HARRIS (60s).  

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        He saved her!

           The video zooms in as Teen Girl tries to get a better look at 
           the mystery hero, but in the dark, from across the street, we 
           can't make out the man's face. We, however, do hear a dazed 
           and delirious Claudette shouting--

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        My baby! My baby! My baby!

           Mystery Man puts Claudette down and runs back into the house. 
           Two bystanders help Claudette away from the fire.  

           Seconds later, a huge EXPLOSION rips through the house. 

           The video shakes as all the bystanders scream and run further 
           away from the fire.

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.)
                        Oh my God. Oh my God! The house 
                        literally just blew up!
           The video steadies and refocuses on the house, which is now 
           completely engulfed in flames. Everyone watches it quietly, 
           all thinking the same thing-- 

                                 TEEN GIRL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The man. He was still in there.

           As smoke from the fire fills the night sky, Facebook comments 
           continue to pop up on the video -- “This is so sad!” “Prayers 
           up” “That guy’s definitely dead.” 

           EXT. SMALL TOWN, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY

           FRANKIE WILSON (17) bikes to school. She doesn't know what 
           she wants to do in life, but knows that it won't be in this 
           shitty small town. 

           As she bikes, we establish NEWBANK, NEW YORK, a small upstate 
           New York town. It’s not “everybody knows each other” small, 
           but it’s definitely not a place where things happen. No small 
           town charm, no big city excitement, just... meh. 

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        I could’ve been born anywhere. LA. 
                        Brooklyn. Hawaii. But I was born in 
                        Newbank, New York. And as if that 
                        wasn’t tragic enough, I grew up in 
                        Newbank, New York and still live in 
                        Newbank, New York. Land of the mediocre, 
                        home of the blah. If anyone ever made a 
                        list of the saddest places to live, 
                        Newbank would definitely make that 
                        list. And if it didn’t, it’d be because 
                        no one had ever heard of it, not 
                        because it wasn’t worthy of the insult. 

           Frankie bikes past a bowling alley, which is generically 
           named BOWLING ALLEY.

                                 FRANKIE (V.O.)
                        Do you know how many weddings I’ve 
                        seen at the bowling alley? And it’s 
                        not a nice bowling alley. I work there 
                        so I can tell you with one hundred 
                        percent certainty that no amount of 
                        mopping can get rid of the smell of 
                        stale popcorn and fresh sadness. And 
                        still, people choose it for a moment 
                        that marks the start of a new chapter 
                        of their lives. It’s like everyone 
                        here has given up on wanting more for 
                        themselves. Or maybe they don’t know 
                        that there’s more out there.

                        I don’t want getting by and bowling 
                        alley weddings. I want more. And 
                        that’s the biggest challenge I’ve ever 
                        faced: wanting more in a place that 
                        doesn’t have more to offer.     

           Frankie pulls up in front of NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL and hops off 
           her bike. She locks it up and hurries inside. 

           INT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - MR. FISHER’S OFFICE - LATER

           Frankie sits across from MR. FISHER (50s, guidance counselor, 
           his way is the best way), reading him her scholarship contest 
           essay. This is the V.O. narration we’ve been hearing. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        But this challenge has only made me 
                        stronger. Made me work harder. Because, 
                        much like your founding director at the 
                        Harvey Foundation, I too want to break 
                        free from Newbank. And this scholarship 
                        would not only give me the key to get 
                        out, but also the tools to survive on 
                        the other side. All I want is to make it 
                        to the other side. And I would love for 
                        the Harvey Foundation to be a part of 
                        that journey. Thank you for your time 
                        and consideration.   

           Frankie puts her essay down and looks at Mr. Fisher, hopeful. 
           Mr. Fisher gives her two thumbs down.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        They asked for the biggest challenge 
                        you’ve ever faced and you spent the 
                        entire essay trashing Newbank.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Because living here’s a challenge. 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Frankie, the Harveys grant a full ride 
                        scholarship to a Newbank senior every 
                        year because they want to feel 
                        connected to their hometown. They don’t 
                        want to read essays attacking it. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        The Harveys ditched this place decades 
                        ago.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        If anything, their foundation gives 
                        out this scholarship so that they can 
                        help the rest of us escape.
                         (off Fisher’s look)
                        I thought you said they wanted brutal 
                        honesty.

                                 MR. FISHER
                        No, they want tear-jerker honesty. 
                        Death, pain, struggle, tragedy. They 
                        want to feel like they need to save 
                        you before they give you their money. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I think my essay screams, “save me.” 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Okay. Don’t listen to me. But just so 
                        you know, other students are taking my 
                        very sage advice. Someone wrote a 
                        truly moving essay about their 
                        father’s battle with cancer.    

           Frankie rolls her eyes. She knows who he’s talking about.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I see Natasha’s playing the daddy 
                        cancer card again. How exploitative of 
                        her. 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        No, how smart of her. That’s the kind 
                        of essay they want to see. That’s the 
                        kind of essay that wins. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Her dad had cancer for like a hot 
                        second when she was an infant. He’s 
                        been cancer free for literally all of 
                        her cognitive life. So, how exactly is 
                        that experience more challenging than 
                        being trapped in a town you hate? 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Look Frankie, only one student’s going 
                        to win this scholarship. I want you to 
                        have a chance, but you won’t with this 
                        essay. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I might.

           Mr. Fisher slides Frankie’s essay back to her.
                                 MR. FISHER
                        Well, I don’t feel comfortable sending 
                        the Harvey Foundation this.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Are you seriously not gonna let me 
                        submit?

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Give me something worthy of submission 
                        and I’ll send it along.

                                 FRANKIE
                        That’s not fair!

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Deadline’s tomorrow if you want to get 
                        in the race. 

           Frankie grabs her essay and huffs out of the office.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           OLIVIA ‘LIV’ WILSON (mid 30s, truly believes she’s smarter 
           than everyone she knows) and JP WILSON (mid 30s, dreamer, 
           fitness obsessed) are mid-argument as Liv makes dinner. Liv 
           is wearing a red polo shirt and khaki pants. A pin on her 
           shirt reads “MANAGER.” JP is in athletic wear.  

                                 JP
                        Just sign the papers! 

                                 LIV
                        JP, please try and understand that I 
                        hate you and don’t want to make you 
                        happy. 

                                 JP
                        Look, you can fight this all you want, 
                        but I’m going to marry Gina.

                                 LIV
                        Aw, but you can’t. You’re still 
                        married to me and last I checked 
                        bigamy’s illegal.

           The back door opens and Frankie enters with her boyfriend 
           DONALDO (17, sweet, simple). Liv and JP stop arguing.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Hey kids.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey mom. 

           Frankie heads to the fridge, ignoring JP.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Don, you want something to eat?

                                 DONALDO
                        Always.

           Frankie starts making two sandwiches. 

                                 JP
                        Hey honey.

                        You know I hate when you call me that.

           Frankie ignores him. JP turns back to Liv and they have a 
           whisper fight behind Frankie.  

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        You feel good about yourself? Turning 
                        my daughter against me?

           Frankie tries to stay tough, but a flash of sadness crosses 
           her face. Donaldo notices. He pulls out his phone and starts 
           to surreptitiously record her. 

                                 JP
                        You’re making this harder than it 
                        needs to be.

                         (without looking up)
                        The Harvey scholarship deadline is 
                        tomorrow and I need quiet to write a 
                        new essay so that I can leave this 
                        place and never look back. 

           JP shoots Liv an angry look and storms out the back door. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Wouldn’t it be easier if you just 
                        divorced him?

           Liv doesn’t respond. Frankie grabs her food and she and 
           Donaldo exit the kitchen. Liv slams a cabinet, frustrated.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - FRANKIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Donaldo lounges on the bed, working on his phone, while 
           Frankie works on an old desktop computer, a Word document 
           open on the screen. “What’s the biggest challenge you’ve ever 
           faced?” is written at the top. The rest of the page is blank. 

           Frankie types “tragedy tragedy...” She sits back, frustrated. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Ugh. The only tragic thing about my 
                        life is that it’s painfully ordinary. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Why’s your essay gotta be so sad? Is 
                        that what the Harvey people want?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Who knows. But it’s what Mr. Fisher 
                        wants and he’s the one choosing the 
                        essays to send in. So if I’m even 
                        gonna get a chance for the Harvey 
                        peeps to read it, I have to get past 
                        the tragedy loving gatekeeper.

           Frankie lays her head down and lets out a long moan.

                                 DONALDO
                        Babe, don’t stress yourself out. If 
                        Fisher doesn’t like your essay, then 
                        fuck him. You don’t need this. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        You’re right. ‘Cause I can totally 
                        afford to pay for college with all my 
                        bowling alley riches. 
                         (then)
                        Sorry, I’m just a little freaked out.

                        If I don’t get this scholarship, I 
                        don’t know what I’m gonna do.

                                 DONALDO
                        Okay, it’s break time. I made you 
                        something.

           Donaldo leans over and plays her a video on his phone. It’s 
           the video that he surreptitiously shot of Frankie with her 
           parents fighting behind her. It’s been beautifully edited 
           with music, close-ups on Frankie’s face and slo-mo effects.  

                                 DONALDO (CONT’D)
                        I call it - Frankie makes a sandwich 
                        while her parents fight.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Title’s a little on the nose...
                        Jeez, I look fucking depressed.

                                 DONALDO
                        I think you look pretty. 

           Frankie smiles. Donaldo lays back on the bed and watches 
           Frankie watch the video. He’s happy he made her happy.   

                                 FRANKIE
                        You’re so good at this. 
                         (then, she’s said it before)
                        If you went to college, you could do a 
                        film program and--

                                 DONALDO
                        I don’t need college to make cool 
                        videos.

                                 FRANKIE
                        All I’m saying is that it’d be a waste 
                        of your talent to stay here. You’d end 
                        up as some school portrait photographer 
                        when you could be so much more. 

                                 DONALDO
                         (sincere)
                        I’d be happy taking pictures of kids 
                        all day.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Dream big, Donaldo.

                                 DONALDO
                        You’re my big dream. I’ll just go 
                        wherever you go. 
           Donaldo smiles up at Frankie and she can’t help but be 
           charmed. She moves to the bed and kisses him. 

                                 DONALDO (CONT’D)
                        Or we can both stay here.

                                 FRANKIE
                        In bed or in Newbank?

                                 DONALDO
                        Both.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Ha, yeah right. I need to come up with 
                        a scholarship winning life tragedy by 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Maybe you should write about your 
                        parents’ divorce. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Everyone gets divorced, it’s not a 
                        tragedy anymore. I need something 
                        really sad. Like cancer dad. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Cancer dad?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Fucking Natasha wrote an essay about 
                        her dad’s stupid cancer and apparently 
                        it’s the kind of depressing shit the 
                        scholarship board will eat up. It’s 
                        not even like her dad died. He 
                        survived cancer! So if anything, 
                        that’s a happy story, it’s not a--     
                         (an idea)
                        Holy shit, that’s it.

           Frankie hops out of bed and hurries back to her desk.

                                 DONALDO
                        What?

                                 FRANKIE

                        cancer dad? 

                         DONALDO
                                                       FRANKIE
           A blind dad.
                                            A dead dad.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        A blind dad? 
                                 DONALDO
                        He can’t see his kids - that’s sad. 
                        But yeah, a dead dad’s sadder.

                                 FRANKIE
                        And that’s what my essay’s about.

                                 DONALDO
                        But your dad isn’t dead.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mr. Fisher and the Harvey Foundation 
                        don’t know that. I’m winning this 
                        scholarship.

           INT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - MR. FISHER’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Mr. Fisher is in the middle of reading an essay. He lowers the 
           paper and looks at Frankie, who’s sitting across from him. 
           There’s a tear in his eye. 

                                 MR. FISHER 
                        Wow. This is... powerful. I didn’t 
                        know your father had passed.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah. He did. Not a lot of people know 
                        ‘cause it’s recent and I don’t like 
                        talking about it. But after meeting 
                        with you, I felt like I was ready to 
                        open up about this challenging 
                        experience of losing my dad. 

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Thank you for sharing your heart. The 
                        Foundation is going to love this essay.

           Frankie smiles.

           NATASHA SAINT-CLAIR (17, extremely ambitious, extremely 
           intense) storms down the hall, on a mission. She’s wearing a 
           Harvard T-shirt and an “I’m better than you” attitude.  

           Natasha spots her target -- Frankie, standing by her locker. 
           She marches up to her.

                                 NATASHA
                        You wrote an essay about the death of 
                        your father.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What do you want, Natasha? 
                                 NATASHA
                        Since when is your dad dead?

                                 FRANKIE
                        How’d you know what my essay was 
                        about?

           Natasha doesn’t respond.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        You snuck into Mr. Fisher’s office and 
                        read all the essay submissions. How on-
                        brand of you. 

           Frankie closes her locker and walks away. Natasha follows. 

                                 NATASHA
                        I didn’t know your dad had died.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We’re not friends. I wouldn’t expect 
                        you to know. 

                                 NATASHA
                        When'd he die?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Last week.

                                 NATASHA
                        How’d he die?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Heart attack.

                                 NATASHA
                        Why don't you look sad?

                                 FRANKIE
                        We all grieve in our own ways, 
                        Natasha.

                                 NATASHA
                        Why didn’t you put any of those 
                        details in your essay? You were pretty 
                        vague about what happened.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        That’s because my essay isn’t about how 
                        or when or why my dad died. It’s about 
                        my struggle to overcome the loss. 

                                 NATASHA
                        You don’t look like you’re struggling. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        Do I look like I’m done with this 
                        conversation? Because I am. 

                                 NATASHA
                        I think you’re lying! 

           Frankie stops walking and turns back to Natasha. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Excuse me?

                                 NATASHA
                        I don’t think your dad is dead.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

                                 NATASHA
                        I think you made it up so that you can 
                        win the Harvey scholarship.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        I didn’t make up anything. My dad is 
                        dead. 

                                 NATASHA
                        Prove it.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Prove it?! What kind of heartless 
                        person tells someone to prove that 
                        their dad is dead? 

                                 NATASHA
                        A fake essay shouldn’t win over a real 
                        one.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Wow. You’re really scared that my 
                        essay is gonna beat yours. I guess 
                        that makes sense. Mine is a moving 
                        piece about the loss of the man who 
                        gave me life. And yours - I mean, I 
                        didn’t break into Mr. Fisher’s office 
                        and read everyone else’s submissions 
                        like a psycho - but knowing you, yours 
                        is probably about...
                         (makes a show of thinking)
                        ... your very much alive dad having 
                        cancer when you were a baby who didn’t 
                        know what cancer was. Yeah, I’d pick 
                        my essay too. But hey, don’t worry. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        I’m sure you’ll find another 
                        scholarship to pay for Harvard. You 
                        seem very resourceful. 

           Natasha gets in Frankie’s face.  

                                 NATASHA
                        I’m going to expose you for the liar 
                        that you are. And when I do, I’m going 
                        to make sure that you’re not only 
                        disqualified from the scholarship 
                        contest, but also expelled for cheating.  

           Natasha turns and marches off. Frankie watches her go. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Shit. 

           INT. LOCAL GYM - BACK OFFICE - LATER

           JP is pitching to the GYM OWNER (male, 40s). JP holds 
           brochures and exercise DVDs with pictures of himself on it. 

                                 JP
                        The JP Wilson Method is about mind 
                        body conditioning and pushing the 
                        boundaries of what you think is 
                        possible. 

                                 GYM OWNER 
                        Our members aren’t really interested 
                        in fancy fitness methods. They just 
                        want the basics: treadmills, weights--

                                 JP
                        That’s what they think they want. But 
                        with my eight week program, they’ll 
                        get results they never even dreamed 
                        of. If you partner with me, I’ll bring 
                        the JP Wilson Method exclusively to 
                        your gym and give you rights to sell 
                        my work-out DVDs... A lot of other 
                        gyms have already expressed interest.

                                 GYM OWNER
                        Which ones?

                                 JP
                        All I can say is you should get in 
                        while you can. So, we making a deal? 
                        It feels like we’re making a deal. 

                                 GYM OWNER
                        We’re not.
                                 JP
                        I get it, you need time to think. I’ll 
                        leave some of my brochures and videos.

                                 GYM OWNER
                        That’s not necessary.

                                 JP
                        So you can look them over later.

                                 GYM OWNER
                        No seriously, I’ll probably just throw 
                        them away, so you should keep them. 

                                 JP
                        Okay. Your loss buddy.

                                 GYM OWNER
                        Sure.

           INT. GINA’S CAR - SAME TIME

           GINA (late 30s, wants to be a mom more than anything) waits 
           in her car outside the gym. She’s wearing medical scrubs. 

           Gina notices a YOUNG MOM crossing the street pushing a double 
           stroller with an infant in back and a BABBLING TODDLER up 
           front. The toddler accidently drops her toy onto the street, 
           but Young Mom doesn’t notice, continuing along. 

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Gina exits her car, grabs the toy and chases after Young Mom.

                                 GINA
                        Excuse me! 

           Young Mom stops and Gina hands her the toy.

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        She dropped this.

                                 YOUNG MOM
                        Oh my goodness, thank you! Gracie say 
                        thank you to the nice lady.

                                 GRACIE
                        Thank you.

                                 GINA
                        She’s so cute. Can I hold her?
                                 YOUNG MOM
                         (weirded out)
                        No.

           Young Mom turns and continues on her way. 

                                 JP (O.S.)
                        Gina.

           Gina turns to see JP approaching her. He gives her a peck.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming to pick me up, but I 
                        think I need to run home.

                                 GINA
                        That bad? 

                                 JP
                        These people have no vision! I know 
                        this method would take off if they’d 
                        just give me a chance! 

           Gina puts her arms around him.

                                 GINA
                        It’ll happen.

                                 JP
                        You’re amazing.

                                 GINA
                        I know.

           Gina kisses him and then heads towards her car.

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        Come on, let’s go. I need to wash the 
                        smell of death off of me. 

           JP puts his stuff in the car but doesn’t get in. Gina sees 
           him standing there, looking at her sheepishly.

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        You still want to run home, don’t you? 

                                 JP
                        You know me so well, and that’s why I 
                        love you. 

           Gina rolls her eyes and laughs as she gets in the car.

                                 GINA
                        See you at home, crazy.
           Gina drives off. JP puts on some music, takes a deep breath 
           and starts to run home.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           QUICK CUTS of JP running home - focused, sweating, and 
           strong. It’s clear that running is therapeutic for him. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           JP runs up to his apartment complex and is surprised to see 
           Frankie sitting outside.  

                                 JP
                        Frankie.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey JP.

           JP tenses at being called that, but doesn’t comment on it. 

                                 JP
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I need a favor.

           INT. JP AND GINA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           JP and Frankie enter. The apartment has a homey decor and 
           everything matches perfectly, except for a pile of fitness 
           gear in the corner. It’s obvious JP moved into Gina’s place. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Where’s your lady friend?

                                 JP
                        I think she’s in the shower. 
                         (calling)
                        Gina? ... Yeah, she’s in the shower. 
                        Do you want something to drink? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        No.

           Frankie notices a wall covered with a tacky amount of FRAMED 
           CUTESY PHOTOS of JP and Gina. She frowns. JP squirms. 

                                 JP
                        She might’ve gone overboard with that 
                        haha... You said you need a favor?

                                 FRANKIE
                        I need you to pretend to be dead.
                                 JP
                        I’m sorry, what?

                                 FRANKIE
                        The Harvey scholarship is super 
                        competitive and Mr. Fisher said they 
                        wanted something tragic so... I wrote 
                        an essay about how I’m dealing with 
                        your death. 

                                 JP
                        What?!

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s really good! And I think I 
                        actually have a shot at winning. Which 
                        is why fucking Natasha is on a mission 
                        to blow my cover and disqualify me. 
                        Which is why I need you to play dead. 
                        Just until I win. Please. 

                                 JP
                        You killed me off in your essay? 
                        That’s insane. Not to mention a jinx 
                        on my life, Jesus Christ Frankie!  

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s not a big deal.

                                 JP
                        You wrote about how I’m dead! Do you 
                        have any idea how that makes me feel? 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 JP
                        Thank you.

                                 FRANKIE
                        So will you do it?

                                 JP
                        No!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh my God!

           Gina enters, freshly showered. She’s surprised to see Frankie.  

                                 GINA
                        Oh, hi Frankie.
                                 FRANKIE
                        I’ve never asked you to do anything 
                        for me! 

                                 GINA
                        What’s going on?

                                 JP
                        My daughter killed me off for some 
                        essay contest and now she wants me to 
                        hide out and pretend to be dead.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s not like you have a job to go to.

                                 JP
                        I’m building a fitness empire!

                                 FRANKIE
                        You are so selfish!

                                 JP
                        Okay. Fine. So I pretend to be dead. 
                        What’s the scholarship people gonna 
                        think when I miraculously come back to 
                        life after you win? Did you ever think 
                        about that?

           Frankie pauses. She hadn’t. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Well... the Harvey people won’t notice 
                        because they’re not looking into it. 
                        Literally no one is trying to fact 
                        check my essay except Natasha, and 
                        once I convince Nancy Drew that you’re 
                        dead, she’ll drop it and move on. 

                                 JP
                        And if she doesn’t?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Well, she won’t be here forever! Once 
                        she gets into Harvard and leaves town, 
                        she’ll forget about the whole thing.

                                 JP
                        Oh so now I’m playing dead until this 
                        girl goes off college. Why don’t I 
                        just play dead permanently?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Is that an option?
           That stings. Frankie immediately regrets saying it. Beat. 

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        I shouldn’t have written that essay. 
                        It was stupid. But it’s too late now 
                        to take it back without getting 
                        completely screwed. Please JP. 

                                 JP
                        I’m sorry. 

           Frankie grabs her bag and storms out of the apartment. 

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Am I a bad parent for not doing this?

                                 GINA
                        Of course not.

                                 JP
                        I mean, playing dead and condoning 
                        this behavior -- that would be the 
                        crazy thing to do, right?

                                 GINA
                        You’re not a bad parent. 

           The front door opens and Frankie re-enters.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’ll get you your divorce.

                                 JP
                        What?

                                 FRANKIE
                        If you do this for me, I’ll get mom to 
                        sign your divorce papers.

                                 GINA
                        He’ll do it.

                                 JP
                        What?!

                                 GINA
                        JP, Liv’s going to keep dragging out 
                        this divorce as long as possible. If 
                        Frankie can get her to sign--

                                 JP
                        Gina--
                                 GINA
                        My eggs are running out of time!
                         (then)
                        I want us to start our family before 
                        it’s too late. Come on, you can play 
                        dead for a few days. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        A week. Maybe two. No more than three. 
                        Please.

                                 GINA
                        Please.

           Gina and Frankie both make puppy dog pleading eyes. Beat.

                                 JP
                        You get your mom to sign the papers 
                        and you start calling me daddy again.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Gross.

                                 GINA
                        Yeah, honey, she’s not five. It’s 
                        weird if she calls you daddy. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m not calling you daddy.

                                 JP
                        Fine, don’t call me daddy! But you 
                        have to call me dad or pop or father 
                        or any other daddy synonym because 
                        that’s what I am! I’m your dad, not 
                        your JP. No more JP.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’ll call you dad.

                                 JP
                        Then I’ll play dead.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay.

           Frankie turns and quickly exits the apartment. 

                                 JP
                         (calling after her)
                        You’re welcome!
           EXT. JP AND GINA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Frankie leans against the front door and lets out a deep sigh 
           of relief. She smiles.

           INT. OFFICE SUPPLY STORE - MANAGER’S OFFICE - LATER

           A tiny back office with a giant glass window that looks out 
           onto the main floor of the store. 

           Liv sits at her computer in her work uniform of khakis and a 
           red polo. She’s scrolling through an article titled “How To 
           Escape Your Dead-End Job.” Liv clicks a link within the 
           article: “Start A New Career On The Side.” She scrolls through 
           a list of side careers - Web Design, Bookkeeping, Software 
           Development - until one catches her eye: REAL ESTATE. Liv 
           clicks on it and a video with a SMILING BUSINESSMAN pops up.   

                                 SMILING BUSINESSMAN 
                        Buying investment property can seem 
                        daunting, but when you break it down, 
                        it’s actually a lot easier than you 
                        might think. With my simple how-to-
                        guide, you too can find financial 
                        freedom through real estate.    

           There’s a tap on Liv’s window. Liv pauses the video and looks 
           up. She sees Frankie smiling on the other side of the glass. 

           Frankie does a series of dance moves behind the glass: the 
           hoola, the swim, some vogueing, finishing off with a twirl. 
           Liv laughs and claps. Frankie bows and comes around the 
           corner to enter the office.   

                                 LIV
                        I haven’t gotten a Frankie show in 
                        years. Why you blessing me with such 
                        cute dance moves?  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Because you’re the best mom ever and I 
                        love you.

                                 LIV
                        And because...

                                 FRANKIE
                         (sheepishly)
                        I need a favor. 

           INT. OFFICE SUPPLY STORE - MAIN FLOOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Liv exits her office with Frankie following behind.
                                 LIV
                        No.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mom, please. It was the only way he’d 
                        agree to do it. 

           Liv starts stocking a shelf. She works as they talk. 

                                 LIV
                        First of all, this whole play dead 
                        scheme is truly idiotic (so of course 
                        your dad would agree to do it). And 
                        second, you have no business asking me 
                        to sign divorce papers. God! I can’t 
                        believe he put you up to this.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It was my idea.

                                 LIV
                        My divorce is none of your business. 
                        So drop it. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I know you hate him, but--

                                 LIV
                        I said drop it! 

           A CUSTOMER looks over at the noise and Liv composes herself. 

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Making me raise my voice at work. I’m 
                        not doing this with you right now. Or 
                        ever. Go home. 

           Liv walks away from Frankie, back towards her office. 

           INT. OFFICE SUPPLY STORE - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Liv sits and lets out a frustrated sigh. Frankie enters. 

                                 LIV
                        I swear to God, Frankie--

                                 FRANKIE
                        Can I have a job application? 

                                 LIV
                        What?
                                 FRANKIE
                        I can’t afford to go to college 
                        without this scholarship, so I should 
                        start planning my future here. This 
                        job will pay better than the bowling 
                        alley. I can stock shelves, and help 
                        people pick out staples, and maybe one 
                        day work my way up to manager. 

                                 LIV
                         (beat)
                        I didn’t realize my life was so 
                        terrible.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s not... But don’t you want more 
                        for me?

           Liv glances at the article on her computer screen - “How To 
           Escape Your Dead-End Job.” She does.  

                                 LIV
                        I’ll sign them. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yes! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

                                 LIV
                        I should get back to work. I’ll see 
                        you at home.

           Frankie smiles and hurries out of the office. Liv sits, 
           alone. Her marriage is ending, her daughter is leaving, and 
           she’s stuck in a dead-end job. Liv looks at the Smiling 
           Businessman’s face that’s paused on her screen. She clicks on 
           the pdf of his “How-To-Guide” and presses PRINT. 

           INT. JP AND GINA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           JP sits on the couch, working intently on his laptop. Gina 
           slinks in, wearing a tiny pink robe, heels and nothing else. 
           JP looks up and smiles.  

                                 JP
                        What’s all this?

                                 GINA
                        One of the perks of dying -- you get 
                        to chill with sexy angels. 

                                 JP
                        Uh-oh, you’re wearing red. Does that 
                        mean I’m in hell?
                                 GINA
                        It’s pink and it’s the only cute robe 
                        I have. Also, I’m naked under here.

                                 JP
                        I like that.

                                 GINA
                        Oh you do? How about this?

           Gina does a sexy, awkward little dance. JP laughs, loving it.

                                 JP
                        Did you choreograph that?

                                 GINA
                        Sure did. These special moves are 
                        reserved specifically for dead guys. 

                                 JP
                        Wow, if I’d known about the perks, I 
                        would’ve died way sooner.

           JP pulls Gina down onto the couch and kisses her.

                                 GINA
                        Thanks for doing this. I know it 
                        sucks.

                                 JP
                        Actually, it’s not so bad. I have a 
                        sexy angel and I figured out a way to 
                        make some money off of being dead.

                                 GINA
                        What?

                                 JP
                        This guy I knew died in a motorcycle 
                        accident a few years ago and his 
                        family raised over ten grand to pay 
                        for his funeral. 

                                 GINA
                        So?

                                 JP
                        So...

           JP turns his laptop to Gina and shows her what he’s working 
           on -- a GOFUNDME PAGE.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        I’m raising money for my funeral! 
                                 GINA
                        Are you insane?

                                 JP
                        I know it sounds crazy, but it’s a 
                        genius idea. I’m already playing dead, 
                        right? So, I start a GoFundMe campaign 
                        as the family of the late JP Wilson, I 
                        tell a sad, sappy story, America 
                        weeps, America opens their wallets...

                                 GINA
                        No. No!

                                 JP
                        Look at how much money these funeral 
                        campaigns are making. 
                         (scrolling through campaigns)
                        Claire Davis Funeral Fund: 13,000 
                        raised. Mike Gordon Memorial: 11,750 
                        raised. Randy’s Funeral: 29,000 
                        dollars raised!

                                 GINA
                        Those people are dead!

                                 JP
                        So am I! Okay, not really. You’re the 
                        one who wanted me to play dead.

                                 GINA
                        For Frankie and her little Facebook 
                        friends. Not for the whole world.

                                 JP
                        It’s easy money and it’s not like it’s 
                        hurting anyone. Plus, think of what we 
                        could do with ten grand. I could 
                        finally afford to open my own gym. We 
                        could use that money for our wedding.

                                 GINA
                        JP, you thought it’d be hard to come 
                        back to life when it was just some 
                        teenage girl checking for you. How do 
                        you expect to come back if you draw 
                        all this attention to yourself and 
                        people donate money to your funeral?! 
                        What, you gonna resurrect to open a 
                        gym? That won’t be weird!   

                                 JP
                         (smiling, proud)
                        Baby, I already thought about that.

                                 JP (CONT'D)
                        It won’t be a problem - if I come back 
                        to life somewhere else.

                                 GINA
                        What?

                                 JP
                        I can open a gym anywhere. We can 
                        start our family anywhere. There’s 
                        nothing keeping us here. We could take 
                        the donation money we make and skip 
                        town. Start our lives somewhere new. 

           Gina starts to consider it...  

                                 GINA
                        Where would we go?

                                 JP
                        Anywhere you want.  

                                 GINA
                        Grand Rapids, Michigan. Forbes ranks 
                        it as the number one best place to 
                        raise a family. What do you think of 
                        Grand Rapids, Michigan?    

                                 JP
                        I think it’s perfect. Sooo...

                                 GINA
                        Let’s raise some money for your 
                        funeral.

           INT. NATASHA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Natasha races in, drops her bag and sits at her desk. There’s 
           a poster of PATTY HEWES (the ruthless lawyer played by Glenn 
           Close in Damages) on the wall above her desk. Natasha opens 
           her laptop and does some Internet recon. 

           She types “Frankie Wilson dad dead?” into Google. Nothing. 
           She types “Frankie Wilson Newbank” and finds Frankie’s 
           Facebook page. Frankie’s most recent Facebook status reads: 
           “RIP Dad.” Natasha furrows her brows, not buying it. 

           Natasha clicks through Frankie’s Facebook until she finds the 
           name of her dad - “JP Wilson.” She types “JP Wilson” into 
           Google. Nothing. She types “JP Wilson Newbank dead” and comes 
           across JP’s GoFundMe page. As she skims, the words jump out: 

           “Raising funds to cover the funeral costs for JP Wilson” 
           “tragic loss” “Loving father” “daughter, Frankie Wilson”
           Natasha sits back, stunned. Frankie’s dad is actually dead.

                                 NATASHA
                        NOOOOOOOOOOOO!

           Natasha trashes her bedroom in frustration. Her door opens 
           and NATASHA’S DAD (40s, tired) pokes his head in. He sees the 
           chaos in the room and immediately looks twice as tired.    

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        Frankie might win the scholarship 
                        contest over me because her dad is 
                        dead! Why can’t you be dead, dad?!

                                 NATASHA’S DAD
                        I don’t know, honey. Dinner’s ready. 

           He exits the room. Natasha throws herself onto her bed.

                                 NATASHA
                        Aaaaah!

           We pan over to Natasha’s desk and land on JP’s GoFundMe page. 
           The goal tracker reads: $0 reached of $10,000 goal.   

           INT. JP AND GINA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY

           CLOSE on JP’s GoFundMe page: $0 reached of $10,000 goal. 

                                 JP (O.S.)
                        Oh come on!

           REVEAL JP looking at the page on his laptop. He makes a call. 

                                 JP (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        It’s not working, we’re still at zero. 
                        No one cares that I’m dead.

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE/MORGUE - EXAM ROOM - SAME TIME

           A small facility with the basic equipment needed to do the 
           job. Nothing fancy. Gina is on her phone. She’s wearing 
           scrubs with a tag that reads ASSISTANT CORONER. 

                                 GINA
                        Babe, it hasn’t even been 24 hours. 
                        Just give it a sec. 
                         (off noise in the hall)
                        My boss is coming, gotta go, love you.

           Gina hangs up as the Head Coroner, SAL LEWIS (70s, old man 
           with no boundaries) rolls a covered body in on a gurney.
                                 SAL
                        Got a John Doe for us, sweetie.  

                                 GINA
                        Okay.

           They move the body to the exam table. Sal pauses dramatically. 

                                 SAL
                        You got your smelling salts ready?

                                 GINA
                         (has said this many times)
                        I’m not going to faint, Sal.

                                 SAL
                        Alright little miss, it’s a nasty one. 

           Sal uncovers the body. It's severely burned. There are patches 
           of skin on the lower half, but the face is pretty much gone. 

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        He had no identification on him and 
                        there haven’t been any missing persons 
                        reported, so police sent him here in 
                        hopes we could ID him.   

                                 GINA
                        What happened?

                                 SAL
                        Rescued a woman from a house fire. He 
                        went back in to get her baby and the 
                        house exploded. Turns out the woman he 
                        saved calls her dog her baby. Poor guy 
                        died trying to save a goddamn poodle.  

           Sal examines the body, with Gina assisting.

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        Adult male, height: six feet, no 
                        visible tattoos, birthmark on upper 
                        left thigh-- get a picture of that.  

           Gina takes a picture of the birthmark. 

                                 GINA
                        Should we run his fingerprints? See if 
                        we can ID him that way?

                                 SAL
                        Prints burned clear off in the fire. 
                        But that was a good idea, sweetie. 
           Sal gives Gina a tap-tap on the butt. Gina tenses, but 
           doesn’t say anything. This has clearly happened before.  

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        No, our best bet is the teeth. And 
                        that’ll still be tough since we don’t 
                        have any dental records to compare ‘em 
                        to.  
                         (then)
                        This man is a hero and no one misses 
                        him. No one’s mourning him like he 
                        deserves. Damn shame. 

           Gina looks down at the faceless, unclaimed, hero body. Hmmm.

           INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING

           A worn down bowling alley with a giant sign on the wall that 
           reads, “BOWLING ALLEY.” A good sized crowd fills the place. 
           There’s a small wedding happening in a lane in the corner.

           Donaldo and Frankie are mid-convo as they bowl. Frankie is 
           wearing a Bowling Alley Employee T-shirt. 

                                 DONALDO
                        I’m just saying, twenty colleges is a 
                        lot.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s a numbers game, babe. Apply 
                        everywhere, get in somewhere.

                                 DONALDO
                        Okay, but what if you get accepted to 
                        all twenty schools, then what?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Then I stick ‘em all in a hat, choose 
                        one at random, and get the hell outta 
                        here.

           Donaldo laughs.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DONALDO
                        You’re in such a hurry to leave 
                        Newbank, but you don’t even know where 
                        you want to go.
                                 FRANKIE
                        Well, the one thing I do know is that 
                        I want to go. I don’t care where as 
                        long as it’s not here. 

           Frankie grabs another ball and moves towards the lane, so she 
           doesn’t hear Donaldo say--

                                 DONALDO
                        I like living here.

           Frankie bowls a strike.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yes!
                         (then)
                        I hate that I’m so good at bowling.
                         (to Donaldo)
                        I’ve got 15 minutes left in my break. 
                        We can keep bowling, or we can go make 
                        out in the parking lot.

           Donaldo studies Frankie.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DONALDO
                        Lemme take your picture.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Here?

                                 DONALDO
                        Yeah.

           Donaldo takes out his phone and points the camera at her. 

                                 DONALDO (CONT’D)
                        Smile.

           Frankie makes an ugly face and Donaldo takes a picture. He 
           sits, clicking away on his phone, a sly smile on his face. 

                                 FRANKIE
                         (suspicious)
                        What are you doing?

                                 DONALDO
                        Oh nothing.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You better not be posting that 
                        picture.
                                 DONALDO
                        What picture?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Nooo!

           Frankie tries to grab Donaldo’s phone but he hops up and runs 
           away. She chases after him, but he dodges her laughing, still 
           working on his phone. Frankie jumps onto Donaldo’s back.   

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Do you surrender?

                                 DONALDO
                        I surrender.

           He carries Frankie back to their booth and puts her down.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay Donnie boy, let’s see what you 
                        did.

           Donaldo holds up his phone and shows her a picture of a weird 
           looking baby. It’s a mashup of Donaldo and the ugly face 
           picture of Frankie. Frankie bursts out laughing.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        What is that?

                                 DONALDO
                        Make-a-baby app. That’s what our 
                        baby’ll look like. Lil Frankie. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Aww, look at our busted little baby. 
                        She’s perfect. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Yeah she is.

           Frankie kicks her feet up and lays her head in Donaldo’s lap 
           as she continues to study their ugly baby. Donaldo watches 
           the wedding ceremony in the corner.

                                 FRANKIE
                        This face is definitely not gonna sell 
                        any diapers. But I bet she has a great 
                        personality and a boss bitch attitude.

           Donaldo looks down at Frankie.

                                 DONALDO
                        Let’s make her for real.
                                 FRANKIE
                        What?

                                 DONALDO
                        Don’t worry, she’ll be much cuter than 
                        this. 

           Frankie shoots up.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Are you serious?! 

           A tense beat as Donaldo studies Frankie. He smiles.

                                 DONALDO
                        Of course I’m not serious. It was just 
                        a joke... It’s my turn.

           Donaldo hops up, grabs a ball and resumes bowling. Frankie 
           looks down at the busted mashup baby, concerned. Part of her 
           knows - Donaldo wasn't kidding.  

           INT. JP AND GINA’S APARTMENT - LATER

           CLOSE ON a laptop screen. A news segment is playing.

                                 REPORTER
                        A real world superhero gave up his life 
                        to save a stranger from a raging fire.

           The news segment cuts to the facebook video stream of the fire 
           rescue from the top of the movie: mystery man carries out 
           Claudette and runs back into the house right before it 
           explodes. The news segment cuts back to the reporter.   

                                 REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        That video was captured by local teens 
                        on that tragic night. The identity of 
                        this brave hero is still unknown. 

           We pull out to reveal Gina and JP watching this video online.

                                 JP
                        Why are you showing me this?

                                 GINA
                        His body came into the coroner’s 
                        office today. We’re trying to ID him, 
                        but it’s looking like that’s going to 
                        be impossible. 

                                 JP
                        Man, I don’t know if I could do it - 
                        run into a burning building like that.
                                 GINA
                        You think people would donate money to 
                        this guy’s funeral?

                                 JP
                        Of course - he’s a fucking hero. 

                                 GINA
                        What if he was you?
                         (off his confused look)
                        His body is burned past recognition 
                        and you’re about the same height and 
                        build. If we ID this John Doe as JP 
                        Wilson, you become a local hero who 
                        rescued an old lady from a fire. And 
                        the donation money pours in.     

                                 JP
                        We can’t do that. Can we do that?

                                 GINA
                        No one’s reported him missing, so he 
                        clearly doesn’t have anyone in his 
                        life. His body’s just gonna sit in the 
                        morgue, unclaimed and unidentified. At 
                        least this way, we can give him a 
                        funeral he deserves. And then we can 
                        leave town and finally start the lives 
                        we deserve. It’s a win-win. 

                                 JP
                        True.

                                 GINA
                        Plus, you get to die a hero.

                                 JP
                        JP Wilson, American hero. People would 
                        donate ten grand for that guy’s funeral.   

                                 GINA
                        People would donate twenty grand for 
                        that guy’s funeral.  

                                 JP
                        You think so?

                                 GINA
                        Motorcycle dude got ten for his and he 
                        didn’t save anybody from a fire. A 
                        brave hero’s gotta be worth at least 
                        double.  
                                 JP
                        Yeah... Let’s do it! How do we do it?

                                 GINA
                        Well, I can’t be the one to claim the 
                        body. It’d be suspicious since I work 
                        there. And there’d be more questions 
                        if my boss knew we were dating.  

                                 JP
                        Okay.

                                 GINA
                        So we need someone else to claim the 
                        body...

           Beat. JP realizes who that someone else is.

                                 JP
                        Fuck.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           JP and Gina sit across from a smug Liv. 

                                 LIV
                        Gina, do you enjoy dating my husband?

                        JP, you do remember that I hate you?

                        And you understand that I don’t want 
                        you to be happy?

                                 JP
                        You’ve made that abundantly clear.

                                 LIV
                        I thought I had. Which is why I’m 
                        confused as to why you think I’d do 
                        anything to help you and your 
                        desperate little girlfriend.  
                         (to Gina)
                        I don’t usually make assumptions about 
                        people I don’t know, but a woman who 
                        gets engaged to a married man can’t be 
                        anything but desperate.  
                                 GINA
                        Not desperate. Unlike you, I love JP.

                                 LIV
                        That’s sad.

                        Are you really going to let your hate 
                        for me get in the way of you making 
                        money? And it’s a lot of money. Think 
                        of all the things you could do if you 
                        had some extra cash. 

           Liv considers it. She could use the money...

                                 LIV
                        How much?

                                 JP
                        At least twenty grand. Maybe more.

                                 LIV
                        And people are just going to donate 
                        all of that to you?

                                 JP
                        Once I’m a local hero they will. Come 
                        on Liv, it’s a good plan. And if it 
                        makes you feel better, I’ll do 
                        everything I can not to be happy.

           Liv rolls her eyes and hides a smile. She’s still charmed by 
           him. Gina notices.

                                 LIV
                        Alright, say people do donate all that 
                        money. What then? 

                                 JP
                        Once the campaign’s closed, GoFundMe 
                        will send the money we raised to my 
                        bank account. And once I have that, 
                        I’ll pay you your cut.

                        man’s bank account and that dead man 
                        is going to transfer money to his

                        can pay you your cut in cash so that

                        So, how do I claim this body?

                                 GINA
                        After you tell the police that you 
                        think JP may be the man who died in 
                        that fire, they’ll bring you to the 
                        coroner’s office for a positive ID.

                        John Doe has a distinct birthmark on 
                        his upper left thigh. If you describe 
                        this to Sal, he’ll ID the body as JP.  

                                 LIV
                        You sure about that? What if he wants 
                        DNA or something to prove it?

                                 GINA
                        Sal hates having unsolved John Does 
                        and he hates doing extra work. 
                        Positive ID of the birthmark will be 
                        enough for him.   

                                 LIV
                        It better be. Because if I get caught, 
                        I’m turning both of you in and telling 
                        the police you threatened my life and 
                        forced me to do this.

                        One more thing, JP. You need to stay

           Liv sits in the hall next to OFFICER BUTCH BLAKE (40s, 
           fratty). Liv looks like she’s been crying.

                                 LIV
                        I thought he was out of town. He was 
                        supposed to be out of town.

                                 BUTCH
                        Maybe he is out of town. Maybe he’s 
                        not the guy who got all burned up in 
                        that fire. 
                         (then, reconsidering word 
                          choice)
                        Who died heroically in that fire.

           The receptionist BRITTANY (20s) approaches them.

                                 BRITTANY
                        They’re ready for you.

           Liv stands and drops her purse, “frazzled.” She bends to pick 
           it up. While she’s bent over, Butch checks out her ass. 
           Brittany catches him looking and he quickly averts his eyes. 

           Liv gathers her things and Brittany leads them to...

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They enter. Sal and Gina stand behind the exam table, the 
           covered body on it. Butch hangs back as Liv approaches them. 
                                 SAL
                        Are you ready?

                                 SAL
                        The face is unrecognizable. Does your 
                        husband have any distinguishing marks 
                        on his body? Tattoos, scars?

                        thigh. Like an upside down umbrella.

           Sal uncovers the lower half of the body, revealing the 
           birthmark. 

                                 SAL
                        Is this it?

           Liv nods yes as tears spring to her eyes.

                        Yes. It’s my husband. It’s JP.

                        It’s not... as you remember.

                                 LIV
                        I want to see it.

           Sal nods and uncovers the top half of the body. Liv gently 
           touches the burned face.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        How am I supposed to live without you? 

           Liv rests her head on the body.

                        I love you, JP. I love you.

           Gina watches. Part of her is impressed by Liv’s commitment. 
           The other part is concerned by Liv’s words.   
           INT. WILSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - LATER

           JP watches the news. We see a Reporter on screen.

                        as local family man, JP Wilson. 

           A happy family picture of JP, Frankie and Liv appears on

           It’s the end of the school day and the halls are packed as 
           kids head towards the exit. Frankie walks in the opposite 
           direction. Her cell rings - it’s Donaldo. Frankie considers 
           answering... but then declines the call and continues on to... 

           INT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - MR. FISHER’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Frankie knocks and pokes her head in. Fisher is at his desk.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You wanted to see me?

                        Yes, come in, sit.

           Frankie sits and Mr. Fisher perches on his desk next to her.

                                 MR. FISHER (CONT’D)
                        How are you doing?

                        It’s hard, but I’m hanging in there.
                                 MR. FISHER
                        You’re strong. Like your father.

           Frankie is taken aback by that comment, but rolls with it.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Thank you.

                                 MR. FISHER
                        When you told me of his passing, I 
                        didn’t realize the sacrifice he made. 
                        Your father is the true epitome of the 
                        word hero.

           Frankie shifts uncomfortably - wtf is going on?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yes. He is.

                                 MR. FISHER
                        I made a donation to the funeral 
                        campaign. I hope it helps. I donated a 
                        hundred dollars. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Wow, I don’t even know what to say.

           Frankie covers her face, as if she’s going to cry.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Will you excuse me?

                        Of course, of course. 

           Frankie hurries out of the office.

           Frankie storms down the hall, pissed.

           Frankie bangs on the door. Gina answers it and Frankie barges 
           past her into the apartment.

           INT. JP AND GINA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Frankie storms through the apartment, looking for JP.

                        JP! I asked you to do ONE thing! JP!

                        Where is he?

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - LATER

           Liv and JP are hunched over a laptop, which is open to their 
           GoFundMe page. The goal tracker is at $19,825 of $20,000.

                                 LIV
                        I can’t believe how fast people are 
                        giving us money.

                                 JP
                        I told you this would work.

                                 LIV
                        Refresh it again.

           JP refreshes the page. The tracker is now $20,050 of $20,000.

                        We’re over twenty thousand!

           JP and Liv jump up in excitement and hug, for a brief moment 
           forgetting that they hate each other. They break apart. 

                                 LIV
                        One of your stupid ideas actually

                        Weak compliment, but I’ll take it. 

           The two share a smile. This sweet moment is interrupted by 
           Frankie storming down the basement stairs.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What is wrong with you?!

           Frankie is followed in by Gina. Gina is not happy to see JP 
           and Liv looking cozy on the couch together.  

                                 GINA
                        She came by our place looking for you.

                        to it. What if people start asking 
                        questions? This could really mess 
                        things up for me. Did either of you 
                        think about that before you did this? 

           Liv and JP avert their eyes in shame - neither of them had 
           thought about Frankie.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Wow.

                                 JP
                        The campaign makes my death look more 
                        realistic, which actually helps you...

                                 LIV
                        We’ll shut down the account.

                                 GINA
                        Okay, hold on, I think we should stick 
                        to the plan. Everything we did would 
                        be pointless if we don’t make the 
                        money. JP.

                                 JP
                        We’ve already made over twenty grand. 
                        We reached our goal. 

                                 GINA
                        Yeah, well, think about how fast that 
                        was. Imagine how much more money we 
                        could make if we left the campaign up 
                        for a few more days. 

                                 LIV
                        This isn’t affecting your family, 
                        Gina. We’re closing out the account. 

                                 GINA
                        JP?

                                 JP
                        We reached our goal. 

           Liv smirks at Gina.

                                 GINA
                         (purposefully)
                        I just wanted to make as much money as 
                        possible for our move to Grand Rapids.
           JP shoots Gina a look - seriously. Liv’s face falls. She 
           covers, trying to act nonchalant. 

                                 LIV
                         (to JP)
                        You’re moving?

                                 JP
                        I’m dead. I can’t live here anymore.

                                 LIV
                        Right... I’ll close the account.

           Liv moves to the laptop. JP turns to Frankie, explaining.

                                 JP
                        You’re going off to college. You can 
                        visit us.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Whatever.

                        Holy shit.

           They all turn to her.

                                 JP
                        What?

                                 LIV
                        Holy fucking shit.

                                 JP
                        What?

                                 LIV
                        Someone just donated two hundred 
                        thousand dollars.

           Everyone rushes to the laptop and crowds around to see. The 
           goal tracker is now at $220,050 of $20,000 goal.

                           JP

           Holy shit.
                                            Oh my God.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Who would donate that much money?

                                 LIV
                        It’s from a Claudette Harris.

                                 GINA
                        That’s the woman from that house fire.
           Liv reads the comment that Claudette left with her donation.

                                 LIV
                        “Money for a life is never an even 
                        trade. No amount can ever bring back 
                        the life I took from you. I’m so 
                        sorry. I’m so sorry.”

                                 FRANKIE
                        This doesn’t feel right. Taking 
                        advantage of a grieving old lady.

                                 GINA
                        I mean, it is her fault that someone 
                        died trying to save her dog. 

                                 JP
                        Yeah. And donating this money probably 
                        makes her feel better about that. So 
                        when you look at it that way, we’re 
                        helping her find peace and it would be 
                        a disservice to everyone if we didn’t 
                        accept her money.  

                                 LIV
                         (to Frankie)
                        This could help pay for college.

                                 FRANKIE
                         (considering)
                        It wouldn’t matter as much if I didn’t 
                        win the Harvey scholarship...

                                 JP
                        So we all agree that we’re keeping the 
                        money?

                                 GINA
                        Of course we’re keeping the money.

                                 LIV
                        I think we should keep it.

                                 JP
                        Frankie?

           Frankie nods. Yes.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Then let’s shut this bad boy down 
                        before Claudette changes her mind. 

           JP closes the GoFundMe account and addresses Liv.
                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        The money should be transferred to 
                        your bank account in three to seven 
                        business days. Ladies.
                         (he turns on some music)
                        We’re rich.

           Gina jumps into JP’s arms.

                                 GINA
                        We’re rich!

           Liv looks away. Frankie notices. She grabs her mom and dances 
           her around the room. Everyone dances. Feeling happy and rich. 

           EXT. STREET - THE NEXT DAY

           The music carries on as Frankie bikes to school, beaming. 

           EXT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Music fades as Frankie pulls up and hops off her bike. Her 
           cell dings with a text. It’s Donaldo: “You okay?” Frankie 
           ignores the text. She turns and comes face to face with 
           Natasha. 

                                 NATASHA
                        You said he died from a heart attack.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don’t have time for this.

                                 NATASHA
                        Now all of a sudden he’s a local hero 
                        who died in a fire. Which is it?

                                 FRANKIE
                        He had a heart attack. In the fire.

                                 NATASHA
                        You’re lying! Your whole family’s 
                        lying!

                                 FRANKIE
                        You’re right, Natasha. My whole 
                        family’s lying. And the coroner who 
                        identified my dad’s body is lying. And 
                        the woman who said my dad saved her 
                        life is lying. Everyone is lying. Why? 
                        So I can win some stupid essay 
                        contest? Do you know how ridiculous 
                        that sounds? Do you know how insane 
                        you’ll look if you tell people that? 
           Natasha falters, no longer sure of herself.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        My dad is dead. Why are you doing this?

                                 NATASHA
                        Is he actually dead?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yes. I feel like I lost a piece of me. 
                        And you’re making things worse. 

                                 NATASHA
                         (beat)
                        I’m sorry. I can get really competitive 
                        sometimes and... I’m sorry. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Thanks. I have to get to class.

           Frankie walks away. She smiles. Behind her, Natasha watches 
           her go, brows furrowed. She doesn’t know what to believe 
           anymore, but she’s still not 100% buying Frankie’s act.    

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - LIV’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Liv gets ready for work. She pins her manager pin onto her 
           polo. Liv’s phone dings. She checks it and sees a DEPOSIT 
           NOTIFICATION from her bank. 

                                 LIV
                        Wait, they said three to seven days.

           Liv quickly opens her bank app and there it is - a deposit of 
           $220,050. Liv stares at the number in awe. She’s never had 
           this much money in her account... Liv squeals in excitement.  

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Liv hurries excitedly towards the basement.

                                 LIV
                        JP! It’s here! 

           Liv stops in her tracks when she sees a note taped to the 
           basement door. “Thanks so much Liv for helping us start our 
           new lives in Grand Rapids. Love, Gina :)”. A wallet sized 
           photo of JP kissing Gina is taped beneath the words. Liv 
           stands there, frozen in anger. She rips the note off the door. 

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Liv storms into the kitchen. She turns on the stove and sets 
           Gina’s note/picture on fire. She watches Gina’s face burn. 
           The fire moves quicker than expected and burns Liv’s finger. 
           She drops the burning note on the floor.

                                 LIV
                        Shit shit.

           Liv stomps out the fire... It leaves behind a burn spot on 
           the kitchen floor. She can’t catch a break.   

           Liv leans against the counter, heated. Her work bag sits in 
           front of her and something sticking out of it catches her 
           eye. She pulls it out and we see that it’s the real estate 
           “How to Guide” that Liv printed earlier. It’s covered in 
           highlights and sticky notes, which makes it clear that Liv 
           has actually been studying this guide. 

           A look of determination comes over Liv. She makes a call.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Hey, it’s Liv. I won’t be able to make 
                        it into work today.

           Liv exits the kitchen, on a mission.

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - DAY

           Gina enters the office and greets the receptionist Brittany, 
           who is sitting with her head resting on the front desk. 

                                 GINA
                        Morning Brittany.

           Brittany moans in response. Gina laughs.

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        Another rough night?

           Brittany lifts her head, clearly hung over.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Why does whiskey feel so good and then 
                        feel so bad? I should just be drunk 
                        all the time so I’m never hung over.

                                 GINA
                        That’s one way to do it.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.

           The two turn to see a woman approaching the front desk. Gina 
           recognizes her - it’s Claudette Harris. She looks tired and 
           fiddles with the CROSS NECKLACE she’s wearing. Brittany sits 
           up, trying to look more professional and less hung over.
                                 BRITTANY
                        Good morning! How can I help you?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Hello, my name’s Claudette Harris. I 
                        tried calling. 

           Brittany’s demeanor immediately changes to less friendly.

                                 BRITTANY
                        Have a seat Ms. Harris.

           Claudette sits in the waiting area, out of earshot. Brittany 
           picks up the phone and dials Sal’s office. 

                                 BRITTANY (CONT’D)
                         (whispering)
                        Hey Sal, that woman’s here. The one 
                        who keeps calling.

           Brittany hangs up the phone. Gina and Brittany talk quietly. 

                                 GINA
                        What’s going on?

                                 BRITTANY
                        That’s the woman who got JP Wilson 
                        killed. She’s been calling non-stop, 
                        asking to see his body.

           A frustrated Sal approaches them.

                                 SAL
                        Where is she?

           Brittany points to the waiting area and we follow Sal as he 
           approaches Claudette. Gina and Brittany watch the interaction. 

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Harris. 

           Claudette stands.

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        I told you not to come here.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I need to see the body. 

                                 SAL
                        Like I said on the phone, you’re not 
                        family, so that won’t be possible.
                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I need to see him. You have to let me 
                        see him!

                                 SAL
                        Listen lady, you need to get on out of 
                        here! And stop calling us! You try 
                        this again and I’ll have a restraining 
                        order taken out against you. Now go.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I’m not leaving until I see JP.

                                 SAL
                         (calling over)
                        Brittany, get the police on the phone.

           Claudette collects her things and sadly exits. Sal walks back 
           over to Brittany and Gina.

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        Real looney-tune, that one. 

                                 GINA
                        Was that necessary? She seems so sad.

                                 SAL
                        A man’s dead because of her and she’s 
                        managed to make it all about what she  
                        needs and what she wants.

                                 BRITTANY
                        And she keeps leaving us creepy 
                        messages. Listen to this. 

           Brittany plays a voice-mail on speakerphone for Gina.

                                 CLAUDETTE (V.O.)
                        Hello, this is Claudette Harris again. 
                        I’m sorry to keep bothering you, but I 
                        need to see him. JP. He’s my savior, 
                        our souls are forever connected. I can 
                        feel it. I need-- I don’t understand 
                        why you’re keeping him from me. You 
                        can’t keep him from me. I want to see 
                        his body! I need to see his body!
                         (then)
                        I’m sorry. I’ll try you again later. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Isn’t that creepy? It’s like she’s 
                        obsessed with him. 
                                 GINA
                        Yeah. Super creepy. 

                                 SAL
                        If she really wants to see JP that 
                        badly, then she’s going to have to go 
                        through his family. That is if they 
                        ever decide to pick up his body.
                         (to Brittany)
                        Have they finally made arrangements?

           Gina tenses at the question.

                                 BRITTANY
                        No. I left a message for his wife, but 
                        haven’t heard back. 

                                 SAL
                        Damn shame. Poor guy’s been in a box 
                        all week. After everything he’s been 
                        through. 

                                 GINA
                        I mean, this has got to be really hard 
                        for them. Picking up the body and 
                        planning a funeral - that would make 
                        it all real. It would mean he was 
                        actually gone. I get it.

                                 SAL
                        Well, I don’t. But I guess I don’t 
                        have your compassionate female spirit.  

           Sal winks at Gina and walks off.  

                                 BRITTANY
                        Such a creeper.   

                                 GINA
                        Yeah. And I don’t know why he’s making 
                        such a big deal about JP’s family.

                                 BRITTANY
                        I mean, it is kinda weird that they 
                        haven’t picked up his body yet. 

                                 GINA
                        Yeah.  

           Gina smiles goodbye and then hurries down the hall. She sends 
           a text to Liv: “You need to pick up the body NOW!”
           EXT. WILSON HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Liv exits the house. Her cell dings with the text from Gina. 
           Liv looks at it, rolls her eyes and continues on to her car. 

           A woman, TIFFANY HARRIS (30s, cold, businesslike) approaches.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Olivia Wilson?

                                 LIV
                        Hi, yes. I’m sorry, do I know you?

                                 TIFFANY
                        My name is Tiffany Harris. My mother 
                        is the woman your husband saved. 

           Tiffany sticks out her hand and Liv shakes it. Beat.

                                 LIV
                        Can I help you with something?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Sorry. I just drove up from Manhattan, 
                        so I’m a bit tired. 

                                 LIV
                        Okay...

                                 TIFFANY
                        My mother donated a large sum of money 
                        to you.

                                 LIV
                        Yes, and we’re extremely grateful.

                                 TIFFANY
                        She shouldn’t have done that. I came 
                        to ask you to return it.

                                 LIV
                        Excuse me?

                                 TIFFANY
                        That money is her life savings. You 
                        can’t keep it.

                                 LIV
                        I don’t know what to say to that.

                                 TIFFANY
                        You can say that you’ll return my 
                        mother’s money.
                                 LIV
                        She gave it to us because my husband 
                        sacrificed his life for her.

                                 TIFFANY
                        And I’m very sorry for your loss. But 
                        that money belongs to my family. So 
                        I’m going to need you to give it back. 
                        I’m more than happy to help cover 
                        funeral costs for your husband.

                                 LIV
                        I’m sorry, I’m late. I have to go.

           Liv opens her car door and Tiffany slams it shut.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Do you feel good taking advantage of 
                        an old lady?

                                 LIV
                        Do you? You said you just drove up 
                        from Manhattan. Your mother’s house 
                        exploded - with my husband inside - 
                        almost two weeks ago. You couldn’t 
                        find time to make the trip after your 
                        mom lost her home, but the second she 
                        gave away her money, here you are. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Don’t presume to know anything about 
                        me. I want my money back.

                                 LIV
                        Your money? Wow. I don’t need to make 
                        any presumptions, because it’s pretty 
                        obvious that you don’t care about your 
                        mom. When’s the last time you visited 
                        her? Or called her? Or even thought 
                        about her? My husband did more for 
                        your mother that night than I’m sure 
                        you’ve done for her your entire life. 
                        You don’t deserve her money. So-- 

           Tiffany punches Liv in the face.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck! 

           Tiffany turns and walks away. Liv screams after her.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you! I’m glad I have your money, 
                        you fucking psycho!  
           Liv gets into her car. She checks out her face in the 
           rearview mirror. Her eye is already starting to swell.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

           Liv sighs and starts the car. She makes a call on 
           speakerphone. A man answers. 

                                 MAN (ON PHONE)
                        Hagan Realties. 

                                 LIV
                        Hi Mickey, it’s Olivia Wilson.

                                 MICKEY (ON PHONE) 
                        Olivia! We still touring the house 
                        today?

                                 LIV
                        Yes! Running late, but I’m on my way!

           She drives off.

           INT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER

           Frankie sits alone in the crowded cafeteria, watching a video 
           on her phone. It’s the footage of Claudette being rescued 
           from the fire. Donaldo sits down next to her. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Are you okay? I’ve been calling you.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Yeah, sorry, things have just been 
                        crazy.

                                 DONALDO
                        All the stuff with your dad--

                                 FRANKIE
                         (looking around)
                        Not here.

           EXT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Frankie and Donaldo sit in the bed of Donaldo’s royal blue 
           pick up truck. 

                                 DONALDO
                        It’s one thing for your dad to pretend 
                        to be dead, but don’t you think it’s 
                        kinda shady of him to pretend to be 
                        the guy who died saving that woman? 
                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s not hurting anyone.

                                 DONALDO
                        I guess. It still feels wrong. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Well, it’s too late to go back now. 
                        If people find out JP’s not actually 
                        dead, I lose my chance at winning the 
                        Harvey scholarship.

                                 DONALDO
                        Is the scholarship worth all this? 

           Frankie tenses, annoyed. Donaldo notices.

                                 DONALDO (CONT’D)
                        I just want you to be happy.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I am happy. We should get back inside.

                                 DONALDO
                        Okay.

           The two hop out of the truck and head back towards the 
           school. Donaldo looks over at Frankie. She’s right next to 
           him, but she feels so far away.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

           JP sits, staring at the clock on the wall. The time couldn’t 
           be moving any more slowly. JP couldn’t be any more bored. 

           In a series of QUICK CUTS we see JP grow more restless as he 
           tries to pass the time cooped up in the basement: He plays 
           Candy Crush on his phone... He does push-ups... He calls Gina 
           - it goes to voicemail... He does burpees... He flips through 
           a fitness magazine... He jogs back and forth.    

           JP sits, staring at the clock on the wall. It’s like no time 
           has passed at all. JP sighs, frustrated. Beat. He gets up. 

           EXT. WILSON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           JP steps outside, wearing running shorts, a hoody (with the 
           hood up) and sunglasses. He checks to make sure that no one 
           is around. And then he starts to jog down the block. 

           INT. NATASHA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Natasha sits in her car, across the street from the Wilson 
           house. She starts the car and follows JP. 
           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           JP runs, a slight smile on his face. This is what he needed.

                                 NATASHA (O.S.)
                         (calling)
                        JP WILSON?

           JP reflexively turns at the sound of his name and sees 
           Natasha creeping alongside him in her car. 

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        I knew it! You’re not dead!

                                 JP
                        Shit!

           JP takes off sprinting in the opposite direction. Natasha 
           busts a crazy ass U-turn and chases after JP. 

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           The street is empty. Beat. JP turns onto the street, running 
           hard. Natasha’s car comes flying around the corner after him. 

           Natasha guns it and hops the curb to cut JP off, clipping him 
           with the side of her car. JP crashes to the ground.

           Natasha rushes out of her car with her phone and takes a 
           picture of JP on the ground. JP pops up, knees bloodied, and 
           sprints away. Natasha calls after him: 

                                 NATASHA
                        You're going to jail, Mr. Wilson! 
                        You're all going to jail!

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - LATER

           Officer Butch sits with his feet up on his desk. There’s a 
           bucket of tennis balls next to him and he’s shooting them 
           into a trash can across the way. A FEMALE OFFICER walks by.

                                 BUTCH
                        Carter, you wanna see me make this 
                        basket with my eyes closed?

                                 CARTER
                         (without stopping)
                        No.

           As Carter passes him, Butch throws a tennis ball at her, 
           hitting her in the back of the head. Carter turns, annoyed.
                                 BUTCH
                        One day, we’ll look back at this 
                        moment and laugh.

           Carter rolls her eyes and walks away, muttering as she goes.

                                 CARTER
                        Fucking toddler.

           Butch resumes shooting tennis balls into the trash can.

                                 CHIEF STANTON (O.S.)
                        Butch.

           Butch turns to see CHIEF STANTON (50s, loves the title of 
           Chief, but doesn’t love the responsibility). He’s approaching 
           carrying two POLICE CHIEF HATS (one white, one brown).

                                 BUTCH
                        Hey Chief.

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        I’m speaking at my daughter’s Career 
                        Day. Which hat should I wear to show 
                        the kids how important my job is?

           Chief Stanton models one hat, then the other. Butch considers 
           the options sincerely.

                                 BUTCH
                        Hmmm. The brown one is bigger, and 
                        bigger is always better. But if you 
                        wear the white one, you can open up by 
                        saying “I’m the leader of the good 
                        guys, which is why I wear a white hat.” 

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        Oh that’s good. You think they’ll get 
                        it?

                                 BUTCH
                        Probably not. Go with the bigger one.

           The front door flies open and Natasha marches into the police 
           station. She sees Butch and Chief Stanton and approaches them.

                                 NATASHA
                        I need to report a crime!

                                 BUTCH
                        Then you’ve come to the right place. 
                        What’s the crime?
                                 NATASHA
                        JP Wilson faked his death and stole 
                        someone’s identity.

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        JP Wilson? Isn’t he the man who died 
                        saving that woman from a house fire?

                                 NATASHA
                        That’s what they want you to think, 
                        but it’s a scam. He’s alive!

                                 BUTCH
                        Sweetheart, I saw JP’s body with my 
                        own two eyes. He’s very much dead.

                                 NATASHA
                        I’m not your sweetheart and your eyes 
                        were wrong. JP’s alive and I have 
                        proof! He was out jogging and I 
                        followed him and took this picture.

           Natasha pulls out her phone and shows them the picture she 
           took of JP. It’s a blurry shot of JP’s profile, and with his 
           hoody and shades on, it’s impossible to make him out.

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        The picture’s a little blurry because 
                        he was running away from me. 

                                 BUTCH
                        Why was he running away from you?

                                 NATASHA
                         (duh)
                        Because I was chasing him. 

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        Young lady, is this some kind of 
                        prank? Because it’s illegal to waste 
                        an officer’s time.

                                 NATASHA
                        It’s not a prank. I saw JP. 

                                 BUTCH
                        Maybe you saw someone who looks like 
                        JP. 

           Natasha exhales, frustrated.

                                 NATASHA
                        Can I please speak with someone more 
                        superior than you two?
           Chief Stanton puffs his chest out, offended. 

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        I’m the Chief.

                                 BUTCH
                        He’s the Chief.

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        Shouldn’t you be in school right now?

                                 NATASHA
                        This is insane.

                                 BUTCH
                        Look sweetheart--

                                 NATASHA
                        I’m not your fucking sweetheart!

                      CHIEF STANTON
                                                    OFFICER BLAKE
           Hey!
                                            Whoa!

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        You can’t talk to us like that. We’re 
                        police officers!

                                 NATASHA
                        Then do your jobs, you simple-minded 
                        spawns of cousin-fuckers!

                                 BUTCH
                        Whoa! Whoa!

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        You get out of here right now before I 
                        lock you up for truancy!

           Natasha screams in frustration and storms out of the police 
           station, knocking files off a desk as she goes. 

           OFFICER FELIX KRASINSKI (30s, smart) enters as Natasha storms 
           out. Chief Stanton turns to Butch, shaking his head.

                                 CHIEF STANTON (CONT’D)
                        Unreal. Kids these days.

                                 BUTCH
                        So disrespectful. 

           Chief Stanton walks off. Krasinski sits at his desk, which is 
           across from Butch. 
                                 BUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Krasinski! Catch!

           Butch grabs a tennis ball and tosses it to Krasinski. He 
           makes no attempt to catch it, letting the ball fly past him.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        What was that all about? With the 
                        girl.

                                 BUTCH
                        Oh, you know the guy who died saving 
                        that old lady from the fire? 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Yeah. I actually went to high school 
                        with him. 

                                 BUTCH
                        Well, the girl thought she saw him out 
                        jogging around today.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        She saw JP Wilson?

                                 BUTCH
                        She saw someone who looks like JP 
                        Wilson. And now she’s convinced he 
                        faked his death.

           Officer Krasinski leans back in his chair, thinking.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Huh. 

                                 BUTCH
                        What?

                                 KRASINSKI
                        You know, I was a little surprised 
                        when I heard what JP did. The guy I 
                        knew in high school wasn’t a run into 
                        burning houses to save old ladies type 
                        of guy.

                                 BUTCH
                        Well, guess he changed.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Yeah... What was that girl’s name?

                                 BUTCH
                        I don’t know.
                                 KRASINSKI
                        Someone came in to make a report and 
                        you didn’t get their information?

           Butch sits up, defensive.

                                 BUTCH
                        I tried to, but she was too busy 
                        calling me a cousin-fucker to give it. 
                        And anyway, her accusation was 
                        baseless. I was at the coroner’s 
                        office when he identified JP’s body.  

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Claiming someone faked their death is 
                        a pretty big accusation to make for no 
                        reason. Why would she do that?

                                 BUTCH
                        Why do teenaged girls do any of the 
                        crazy things they do? She’s probably 
                        on her period.

           Krasinski leans back in his chair, mind racing. He grabs his 
           coat and heads back out.

           INT. NATASHA’S CAR - LATER

           Natasha pulls up and parks in front of her house. She sits, 
           steaming, and then hits the steering wheel in frustration.

                                 NATASHA
                        Idiots.

           Natasha’s phone dings with an e-mail notification. She checks 
           her phone - it’s an e-mail from HARVARD UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS 
           OFFICE! Natasha’s face lights up with excitement.

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God!

           Natasha quickly opens the e-mail... and discovers that she 
           was WAITLISTED. Her face falls. 

           INT. HOUSE FOR SALE - LATER

           Liv tours a house with MICKEY HAGAN (40s, bus bench real 
           estate agent, super white teeth). She has make-up covering the 
           black eye that’s forming from her punch to the face.     

                                 LIV
                        Why’s the owner selling?
                                 MICKEY
                        The owner recently passed away. Not in 
                        the house! He was very old and passed 
                        away in a hospital. Very peacefully. 
                        Anyway both his kids live out of state 
                        and don’t want to hold on to the 
                        property, so they’re selling. 

           Mickey leads Liv into the kitchen.

           INT. HOUSE FOR SALE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey points out the appliances.

                                 MICKEY
                        All of the appliances are in good 
                        condition. And--

           Liv interrupts his tour to get to what she came for.

                                 LIV
                        The listing said it had a finished 
                        basement.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yes. I like to save the best for last. 

           Mickey leads Liv down a flight of stairs. He unlocks the door 
           at the bottom and opens it to reveal a finished basement. 

           INT. HOUSE FOR SALE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey and Liv enter and he shows her around.

                                 MICKEY
                        Finished basement, complete with 
                        bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette and 
                        it’s own private entrance. 

           Liv walks around, a smile creeping onto her face at the

                        This is perfect. A family upstairs, a 
                        single person or couple down here. Two 
                        rent checks every month.

                        This house would make a great rental.

                        I know. That’s why I’m here.

                        Alright! All you need to do is fill 
                        out the application and put in an 
                        offer. There are already four other 
                        bids on the place, so you’ll probably 
                        need to come in above the 215 asking 
                        price to be seriously considered.

                        another one and I don’t have time for 
                        a bidding war. I want this house and I 
                        need to buy now.

                        paying out of pocket for your first

                        I can get a cash-out refinance after

                        back and transfer the balance to loans.

                        out of state owners who don’t even 
                        want the property. You’re not going to 
                        get a better deal than this. I just 
                        need them to accept my offer, today. 
                        Do you think you can make that happen?

           Donaldo approaches Frankie at her locker. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Hey, you want a ride home?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mr. Fisher wants to talk to me so I’m 
                        gonna be here late.

                                 DONALDO
                        I can wait.

                                 FRANKIE
                        No, it’s fine, I have my bike. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Cool... Is everything okay with us?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Of course. I’ll call you later. 

           Frankie gives him a quick peck and hurries off. Donaldo 
           watches her go, concerned. 

           INT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - MR. FISHER’S OFFICE - LATER

           Mr. Fisher sits at his desk. Frankie pops her head in.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You wanted to see me?

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Frankie, yes, come in. 

           Frankie enters and sits. Mr. Fisher dramatically slides a 
           manila envelope across his desk to her. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What’s this?

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Open it. 

           Frankie opens the envelope and pulls out a piece of paper. 
           It’s a SCHOLARSHIP AWARD CERTIFICATE from the Harvey 
           Foundation. With Frankie’s name on it. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        Are you serious? I got it?

                                 MR. FISHER
                        You got it.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I got it! Yes! Oh my God! I can’t 
                        believe I won!  

                                 MR. FISHER
                        I knew it’d be you.
                         (off her look)
                        I know you chose not to include the 
                        specifics in your essay, but I 
                        followed up with the Harvey Foundation 
                        and made sure they knew the full 
                        story. They were truly moved by your 
                        father’s sacrifice. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh. I won because of what my dad did?

                                 MR. FISHER
                        Death, pain, struggle, tragedy. They 
                        want to feel like they need to save 
                        you before they give you their money.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You know what? I don’t care why I won. 
                        It’s finally real. I’m getting out.  

           Frankie looks down at her ticket out of Newbank, and smiles.

                        out jogging around today, so I just 
                        want to make sure that this dead body 
                        is the dead body we think it is.

                        Can’t hurt to double check.

                                 SAL
                         (annoyed)
                        I’ll put in a request for JP’s dental 
                        records and compare it to our body. 
                        I’m sure it’ll be a match. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Thanks.

           A text message ding interrupts her music. Another text 
           message ding interrupts her music.

           Natasha reaches over and grabs her phone. She checks the 
           message, and sits up. We don’t see what she just got, but, 
           from the look on her face, whatever it is, it’s big.

           Gina sees JP laying on the couch, battered and bruised.

                        wanted to go on a quick run, and then 
                        that psycho chick came out of nowhere.

                        Shit.

                        She went to the police! This Officer 
                        Krasinski guy came by asking questions. 

           JP reacts when she says Krasinski.

                                 JP
                        Wait, what was the cop’s name?

           Gina takes Krasinski's card out of her bag.

                                 GINA
                        Officer Felix Krasinski. He wants--

                        I went to high school with that guy. 
                        He hates me.

                        Are you serious?

                        He dated Liv senior year; thinks I 
                        stole her from him.

                                 GINA
                        Did you?

                                 JP
                        Liv dated him to make me jealous. She 
                        always did that when we were fighting. 
                        Everyone knew that! It’s not my fault 
                        he chose to be her temporary boyfriend 
                        and fall in love with her.  

                                 GINA
                        Well, high school was forever ago. He 
                        probably doesn’t even remember that.

                                 JP
                        He tried to fight me after Liv dumped 
                        him and I kinda kicked his ass in 
                        front of the whole school. He might 
                        remember that.   

           Beat. Gina stares at him.

                                 GINA
                        JP. Are you telling me that the cop 
                        who’s investigating your fake death is 
                        your fucking high school nemesis?! He 
                        wants us to run your dental records 
                        against the body to make sure it’s 
                        you, which it isn’t. And once he finds 
                        out-- oh God, we’re going to jail.

                                 JP
                        No, no, I can fix this. 

                                 GINA
                        Once Sal gets your records tomorrow--  

                                 JP
                        Can you fake the records? Make them 
                        match the body?

                                 GINA
                        They’re sending them directly to Sal. 
                        He’s the one doing the comparison. 

                                 JP
                        Shit. Okay. What if we get rid of the 
                        body? 
                                 GINA
                        Get rid of the body? What the fuck are 
                        we mobsters now?

                                 JP
                        If there’s no body, then there’s 
                        nothing to compare my dental records 
                        to. We can sneak into your office 
                        tonight, steal the body and get rid of 
                        it before Sal can run the comparison.  

                                 GINA
                        Are you insane?

                                 JP
                        I’m trying to fix this!

                                 GINA
                        We can’t steal the body! 

                                 JP
                        What do you wanna do? Wait for 
                        Krasinski to bust us?

                                 GINA
                        Obviously not!
                         (paces, thinking)
                        Okay. Okay. So the dental records will 
                        prove that the body isn’t yours, but 
                        it doesn’t technically prove that we 
                        did anything wrong. You’re missing, 
                        right? So your wife goes to ID a John 
                        Doe that she believes to be you and 
                        what do you know, you both happen to 
                        have a similar birthmark. It’s just a 
                        case of mistaken identity, nothing 
                        illegal about that. 

                                 JP
                        People donated money for a man who 
                        died in a fire. Once they figure out 
                        that it’s not me, the police might try 
                        to take the money back. Claudette will 
                        want to take her money back. 

                                 GINA
                        We’ll be long gone and in Grand Rapids 
                        by then. 

                                 JP
                        Liv will still be here and she’s the 
                        one they’ll go after to get the money.
                                 GINA
                        If Liv had picked up the body when I 
                        told her to, we wouldn’t even be in 
                        this mess, so honestly I don’t care if 
                        she’s left to deal with the fallout. 
                         (then, off his look)
                        Everyone donated on their own free 
                        will. If Liv sticks to the mistaken 
                        identity story, they won’t be able to 
                        prove fraud and probably won’t be able 
                        to go after her for the money. 

                                 JP
                        Probably?

                                 GINA
                        JP, I need you to take my side on 
                        this. We do nothing, we get our money, 
                        and we go. Please. 

                                 JP
                        Okay. 

           INT. MICKEY HAGAN’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Liv signs paperwork with Mickey.

                                 MICKEY
                        And sign here. And here. And here.

           Liv signs her final signature and then slides the paperwork 
           across the table to Mickey, with a check for $220,000.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Congratulations. You just bought your 
                        first investment property.

           Liv smiles, proud. 

           EXT. MICKEY HAGAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Liv exits Mickey’s office and heads towards her car. Across 
           the street, Tiffany Harris sits in her car, watching Liv.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - SAME TIME

           An excited Frankie bursts into the house, looking for Liv.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mom! Mom! 

           Frankie checks the kitchen, living room and Liv’s bedroom - 
           she isn’t there. Frankie heads towards her bedroom, but then 
           stops. Frankie turns and heads towards the basement. 
           INT. WILSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Frankie climbs down the basement stairs. JP and Gina turn to 
           look at her when she enters.

                                 JP
                        Hey Frankie.

           Frankie runs over to JP and hugs him. JP is happily surprised 
           and squeezes back. Beat. The two break apart.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What happened to your face?

                                 JP
                        Oh, I tripped. A lot of clutter down 
                        here. 

           Frankie hugs JP again. 

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Two hugs? What’d I do to deserve this? 
                        Not that I’m complaining. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I got the scholarship.

           In a burst of joy, JP swings Frankie over his shoulder and 
           dances her around the room. Frankie laughs. It’s a beautiful 
           father-daughter moment. 

                                 JP
                        Yes! Woooooooo! Wooooo!

           JP puts Frankie down.

                                 GINA
                        Congratulations Frankie.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Thanks. 
                         (then, to JP)
                        I know this was a crazy thing for me 
                        to ask you to do. I couldn’t have done 
                        this without you.

                                 JP
                        That’s not true. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mr. Fisher told the Harvey Foundation 
                        that my dad was a local hero who died 
                        saving a woman from a fire. That’s the 
                        only reason they picked me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        So yeah, I really wouldn’t have this 
                        scholarship if you hadn’t done all of 
                        this.  

                                 JP
                        I’d do anything for you.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I know. Thanks dad.

           JP beams at the word dad.

                                 JP
                        You’re welcome. Daughter.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Really?

                                 JP
                        I know, I know, I made it weird, but I 
                        just got so excited that you dropped 
                        the d-word! Say it again.

                                 FRANKIE
                         (laughing)
                        Bye dad.

           Frankie heads back upstairs. 

                                 JP
                        Yes, one more time!

                                 FRANKIE
                         (as she disappears upstairs)
                        You’re so lame, dad.

                                 JP
                         (calling after her)
                        Thank you, daughter!

           JP plops down on the couch, brimming with joy. Gina snuggles 
           up next to him.

                                 GINA
                        I’m so happy for you.

           JP smiles at her. But then his face falls as he realizes 
           something. 

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?
                                 JP
                        She got that scholarship because I was 
                        a local hero who died saving a woman 
                        from a fire. If they find out it’s not 
                        actually me... I can’t mess this up 
                        for her.    

           JP looks at Gina, pleading. 

                                 GINA
                        Okay.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - FRANKIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           In a similar tableau to Natasha, Frankie lays on her floor, 
           listening to music on her phone. But unlike Natasha, she’s 
           smiling from ear to ear. 

           A text message ding interrupts her music. 

           Frankie reaches over and grabs her phone. It’s a text from 
           Natasha - “You don’t deserve that scholarship.”

           Frankie smirks, happy that Natasha knows she beat her. 
           Frankie texts Natasha - “sore loser much.”

           Frankie gets another text from Natasha. It’s the video that 
           Donaldo took of her and her parents arguing:

                                 JP (ON VIDEO)
                        You’re making this harder than it 
                        needs to be.

                                 LIV (ON VIDEO)
                        You’re the one who--

                                 FRANKIE (ON VIDEO)
                        The Harvey scholarship deadline is 
                        tomorrow and I need quiet to write a 
                        new essay so that I can leave this 
                        place and never look back. 

           Frankie’s face falls. She gets another text from Natasha: 
           “Your dad doesn’t look dead to me. Meet me at school. 9pm.” 

           EXT. DONALDO’S HOUSE - LATER

           Donaldo works under the hood of his pick-up truck. Frankie 
           comes up behind him and hugs him.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey.

           Donaldo turns, careful. 
                                 DONALDO
                        Oh. Hey, babe.

           Frankie walks over and sits on the bed of his truck.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Come sit with me.

           Donaldo sits next to her. Frankie immediately climbs on top 
           of him and starts kissing him. Donaldo laughs uncomfortably.

                                 DONALDO
                        You want to go inside?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Let’s make a baby.

                                 DONALDO
                        What?

           Frankie rips her shirt off.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Right now. Let’s make a baby.

                                 DONALDO
                        What are you doing?

           Donaldo covers Frankie up.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don’t care who sees.

                                 DONALDO
                        Frankie--

                                 FRANKIE
                        This is what you wanted, right? For me 
                        to stay here forever and have your 
                        babies. So let’s do it! Let’s make a 
                        baby, you fucking asshole!

                                 DONALDO
                         (beat)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Why did you do that? 

                                 DONALDO
                        You won off a lie. It wasn’t right.
                                 FRANKIE
                        No. You don’t get to take some moral 
                        high ground, like that’s why you did 
                        this. 
                         (then)
                        You didn’t think I’d win. You 
                        pretended to have my back, but you 
                        were secretly hoping I’d fail, so that 
                        I couldn’t afford to leave. So that 
                        I’d be stuck here.   

                                 DONALDO
                        The way you talk about Newbank - how 
                        you’re stuck here, how it has nothing 
                        to offer, how it’s not enough, how you 
                        can’t wait to leave it and never look 
                        back... I was starting to feel like 
                        you were talking about me too. You 
                        were pulling away and you weren’t 
                        talking to me and... You’re my big 
                        dream, Frankie. I was scared I’d lose 
                        you. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Who the fuck cares you were scared?! 
                        That doesn’t give you the right to 
                        ruin my life! ‘Cause that’s what you 
                        did when you sent that video to 
                        Natasha. She’s gonna destroy me.  

                                 DONALDO
                        I just wanted us to be together. I...

           He doesn’t know what else to say. He really fucked up. Beat.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s so dumb that you couldn’t tell 
                        the difference between my feelings for 
                        Newbank and my feelings for you. Maybe 
                        if you weren’t so busy trying to hold 
                        me back you would’ve noticed that I 
                        was trying to push us both forward.  

           Frankie puts on her shirt and turns to go.

                                 DONALDO
                        I love you, Frankie.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don’t think you do. 

           Frankie walks away.
                                 DONALDO
                        Frankie, I’m sorry! I can fix this!
                         (she keeps walking)
                        Frankie! Frankie! 

           Donaldo starts to reel. Desperate. He needs to fix this. 

           INT. WILSON HOME - LIV’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Liv stands in front of her mirror, practicing a speech she’s 
           going to give to JP. Her black eye has become more prominent. 

                                 LIV
                        I just bought my first investment 
                        property. And I used your part of the 
                        money. Okay relax. I’m going to 
                        refinance and get it back, but that’s 
                        going to take a few weeks. So Grand 
                        Rapids is gonna have to wait. I put my 
                        life on hold for you and now it’s your 
                        turn. Consider this reparations for all 
                        the years I supported you. (Don’t say 
                        reparations). 
                         (pointing to her black eye)
                        Do you see this?! I got punched in the 
                        fucking face protecting our money! I 
                        deserve this!
                         (then)
                        You said I was stuck in a dead-end job. 
                        Well now I’m a landlord... I don’t feel 
                        bad. It’s your turn to put your life on 
                        pause. So deal with it! 

           Satisfied with her prep work, Liv turns to go. She turns back 
           to the mirror and checks her reflection. She fixes her hair.  

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The basement is empty. We hear Liv’s voice as she makes her 
           way down the stairs.

                                 LIV (O.S.)
                        JP, I have something to tell you.

           Liv appears in the room and stops in her tracks when she sees 
           that it’s empty. Beat. Liv shakes her head in sad disbelief.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        You fucking asshole.
           INT. GINA’S CAR - NIGHT

           Gina and JP sit outside the Coroner’s office in Gina’s SUV. 

                                 JP
                        You ready? 

                                 GINA
                        When we have a little girl, we should 
                        name her Oriana. It’s Latin for 
                        sunrise and symbolizes a new 
                        beginning. We could call her Ori for 
                        short. Or Ana. Or maybe we won’t 
                        shorten it. Maybe we’ll always call 
                        her by her full name. Oriana. What do 
                        you think?    

                                 JP
                        Oriana. I love it.  

           Gina leans over and kisses JP.

                                 GINA
                        Ready.

           Gina and JP both put on gloves and get out of the car. 

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - LATER

           Gina pulls open the drawer storing John Doe and pulls out the 
           sliding table. She unzips the body bag and talks to the body.  

                                 GINA
                        I’m sorry we’re doing it this way. I 
                        promise we’ll bury you somewhere nice. 
                        Sorry.   

           Gina rezips the body bag and turns to JP.

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           They lift the body bag off the table and head towards the door. 

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Gina sets down the part of the body bag she’s holding and 
           rushes over to the filing cabinets. 

                                 JP
                        What are you doing?
                                 GINA
                        Looking for his x-rays.
                         (searching through folders)
                        Come on, come on.

                                 JP
                        Just leave it.

                                 GINA
                        If they have John Doe’s x-rays, it 
                        won’t matter that we stole his body. 
                        Found it!

           She pulls the file out and sticks it in her pants. 

                                 SAL (O.S.)
                        What the hell is going on here?

           Gina and JP turn to see Sal standing in the doorway. 

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        Gina, what are you--
                         (he notices JP)
                        You’re JP Wilson. You’re supposed to 
                        be dead.

           Sal looks at Gina... and JP... and the body bag... and 
           realizes what’s going on.

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        I’m calling the police.

                                 GINA
                         (moving towards him)
                        Sal, wait!

                                 SAL
                        You stay right over there, missy!  

                                 GINA
                        Please, let me explain.

                                 SAL
                        I don’t need you to explain something 
                        that I’m seeing with my own two eyes. 
                        You’re stealing the body that’s 
                        supposed to be JP Wilson, but clearly 
                        isn’t JP Wilson because JP Wilson is 
                        standing right over there, very much 
                        alive. Now, I don’t know what kind of 
                        con you two are pulling, but I know it 
                        sure as hell ain’t legal.
                                 GINA
                        We can pay you! We have money, we can--   

           Sal shakes his head in disgust and takes out his cellphone. 

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Gina snaps. She grabs a pair of medical scissors near her and 
           stabs Sal in the neck. Sal and Gina look at each other, both 
           completely shocked at what she just did. Blood gushes from 
           his neck. He stumbles forward, trying to find something to 
           stop the bleeding, but crashes to the floor. Sal tries to 
           speak, but can’t. The life fades from his eyes.  

           Gina stares at Sal’s body. She’s still clutching the bloody 
           scissors. She turns to JP and sees a look of horror on his 
           face.

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know what else to do. He was 
                        going to ruin everything. I didn’t 
                        know what else to do.

                                 JP
                        We have to go.

           JP throws the John Doe body bag over his shoulder and heads 
           towards the door. Gina stares at Sal’s lifeless body.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Gina!

           Gina hurries after JP, taking the bloody scissors with her.

           EXT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Frankie sits on the curb, waiting. Natasha pulls up across 
           the street. She gets out of her car and walks over.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        You said 9.

                                 NATASHA
                        I felt like making you wait.

           Natasha sits next to Frankie and pulls up Donaldo’s video on 
           her phone. She watches it. 

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        It’s really weird how your “dead hero 
                        dad” was fighting with your mom the day 
                        before the Harvey scholarship deadline. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        Days after he allegedly died rescuing 
                        an old lady from a fire.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        What are you going to do with the 
                        video?

                                 NATASHA
                        I could’ve given it to the police. Had 
                        you and your whole family arrested for 
                        fraud. But I didn’t.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What do you want?

           Natasha hands Frankie a slip of paper.

                                 NATASHA
                        That’s the e-mail address for the 
                        Harvey Foundation Scholarship Board. 
                        Start typing.

           Frankie types as Natasha dictates what to say.

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        “Dear Harvey Foundation. I decline 
                        your scholarship. Please give it to 
                        someone else. Signed, Frankie.” Let me 
                        see.

           Frankie shows Natasha the e-mail. 

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        Send it.   

           Frankie looks at the e-mail, defeated. And hits send.

                                 NATASHA (CONT’D)
                        Now the scholarship will go to the 
                        person who should’ve won in the first 
                        place.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We good?

                                 NATASHA
                        Hmm. No.

           Natasha stands. Frankie jumps up after her.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What?!
                                 NATASHA
                        I’m still going to give the video to 
                        the police.

                                 FRANKIE
                        But I did what you wanted! You’re 
                        going to get the scholarship! You 
                        don’t have to do this.

                                 NATASHA
                        Obviously I don’t have to. But I’m 
                        going to do it anyway. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Why?!

                                 NATASHA
                        I did everything right! I worked hard 
                        and I prepared and you cheated! You 
                        and your whole family cheated! Why 
                        should things work out for you and not 
                        for... Things don’t get to work out 
                        for you.   

                                 FRANKIE
                         (realizing)
                        You didn’t get into Harvard.

           Natasha tenses, but quickly covers. 

                                 NATASHA
                        I’m going to get off the waitlist and 
                        I’m going to get this scholarship and 
                        I’m going to do amazing things. And 
                        you’re going to live the sad, 
                        disgraced, pathetic little life you 
                        deserve. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Please don’t do this. 

           Natasha turns to go. Frankie grabs her wrist to stop her.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        Natasha--

           Natasha pulls her arm away from Frankie. 

                                 NATASHA
                        Don’t touch me!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Please. I’ll do anything. Please.
                                 NATASHA
                        Refusing to accept when it’s over.  
                        How on-brand of you. 

           Natasha smirks at Frankie and turns to head back towards her 
           car. Frankie crumbles to her knees, her world spinning.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Natasha! Please! 

           Natasha sticks up her middle finger. BAM! Natasha is run down 
           by Donaldo's pick up truck. Frankie screams. Natasha lays 
           lifeless in the street. Donaldo gets out of his truck.

                                 DONALDO
                        She can’t hurt you now. 

           EXT. WILSON HOME - NIGHT

           Gina’s SUV pulls into the garage. 

           INT. GINA’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Gina and JP sit, quiet. They’re both covered in dirt. Gina 
           has a blood stain on her shirt. Beat.

                                 GINA
                        Sal was a sexual harasser. He was 
                        always touching my ass. He wasn’t a 
                        good guy. 

                                 JP
                        It was my idea to steal the body.  

                                 GINA
                        He was old. He didn’t have that much 
                        life left ahead of him. 

                                 JP
                        Gina--

                                 GINA
                         (noticing the blood stain)
                        We need to get out of these clothes. 
                        We need to burn these clothes.

           Gina gets out of the car. JP follows her.  

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           JP and Gina enter and are accosted by a furious Liv.
                                 LIV
                        You fucking asshole! Two hundred and 
                        twenty grand on the line for this 
                        family and you still couldn’t manage 
                        not to be selfish! 

                                 JP
                        Liv--

                                 LIV
                        All you have to do is stay inside! 
                        It’s not fucking rocket science, JP!

                                 GINA
                        If you had just picked up the body 
                        when I told you to, none of this 
                        would’ve happened. 

           Liv finally notices that they’re both covered in dirt and 
           that Gina has blood on her.

                                 LIV
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 GINA
                        You didn’t pick up the body and we 
                        were going to get caught. We had to 
                        steal it and then Sal came and now 
                        he’s dead.

                                 LIV
                        What is she talking about? 

                                 JP
                        They were going to prove that it 
                        wasn’t me. 

                                 LIV
                        Who’s dead?!

                                 JP
                        The coroner. He caught us and--

                                 GINA
                        This is your fault! You should’ve 
                        picked up the body! If you had just 
                        picked up the body!

                                 LIV
                        Oh my God. Oh my God.

           The back door opens and Frankie and Donaldo enter. Everyone 
           freezes. Beat.
                                 FRANKIE
                        Something bad happened. 

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone is circled around the back of Donaldo’s pickup 
           truck, which has a tarp covering it. Donaldo lifts the tarp 
           and reveals Natasha’s dead body inside.

                                 LIV
                        No.

                                 JP
                        Fuck.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 LIV
                        No. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s all my fault.

                                 LIV
                        No!

                                 DONALDO
                        It was me.

                                 JP
                        What did you do?!

                                 GINA
                        She’s dead.

                                 LIV
                        Oh God!

                                 GINA
                        And Sal’s dead.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Who’s Sal?!

                                 GINA
                        He was going to ruin everything.

                                 DONALDO
                        She was going to ruin everything.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What the fuck is going on?!
                                 GINA
                        People are dead because of us.

           The weight of that statement throws the room into silence... 
           Frankie vomits on herself. JP is immediately by her side. 
           Frankie vomits again. Beat. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I wish I never wrote that stupid 
                        essay.

                                 JP
                        Everything’s going to be okay. I’m 
                        going to fix this and everything is 
                        going to be okay.  

           Frankie looks up at her dad. She believes him.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay.

           JP snaps into action.

                                 JP
                        Liv, take Frankie inside. Donaldo come 
                        with me. Gina, go home. You have to go 
                        to work in the morning. 

                                 GINA
                        No. No, we have to go. We have to 
                        leave town. We have to leave town 
                        tonight.

                                 JP
                        If the police find Sal and you’re in 
                        the wind, you’ll go from not being a 
                        suspect to being the number one 
                        suspect. They’ll come looking for us 
                        and we’ll spend the rest of our lives 
                        looking over our shoulders. I have a 
                        plan. We can still fix this.    

                                 GINA
                        Let’s go to Grand Rapids.

                                 JP
                        We will. After I fix this. I need you 
                        to trust me. Okay?

                                 GINA
                        Okay.
                                 JP
                        You and Sal were the only two coroners 
                        in the office, right?

                                 GINA
                        Yeah.

                                 JP
                        Good. Tomorrow’s another normal day. 
                        You’re going to go to work and you’re 
                        going to find Sal and you’re going to 
                        call the police. And when the bodies 
                        come in, you’re going to do the 
                        autopsies. You understand?  

           Gina nods her head, yes.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                         (to everyone)
                        If we all keep it together, we’ll be 
                        fine. And then when our money comes 
                        in, we can split. 

           A look of panic flickers across Liv's face. 

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go! 

           Everyone disperses. 

           EXT. CORONER’S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Gina sits in her car, waiting, anxious. She pops a pill to 
           calm her nerves and takes a deep breath. 

           Gina takes out her phone and goes to Brittany’s Instagram. 
           There are several pictures from the night before of Brittany 
           partying. Gina checks the location - Blue Cat Bar. 

           Gina puts away her phone and stares out the window, waiting. 
           She finally sees what she’s waiting for - Brittany walking 
           towards the office. Gina waits for Brittany to unlock the 
           office and go inside. Then she gets out of her car. 

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Gina approaches the front desk as Brittany settles in. 

                                 GINA
                        Morning Brittany. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Morning.
                                 GINA
                        Hey, were you at Blue Cat Bar last 
                        night?

                                 BRITTANY
                        I was! 

                                 GINA
                        I thought I saw you.

                                 BRITTANY
                        You were there? 

                                 GINA
                        Yeah.

                                 BRITTANY
                        You should’ve said hi! We could’ve 
                        done shots! 

                                 GINA
                        You were with a bunch of young cool 
                        looking people and I didn’t want to be 
                        the old lady cramping your style. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Honestly, I could’ve used some style 
                        cramping. My head feels like trash and 
                        I’ve been burping up whiskey all 
                        morning. 

                                 GINA
                        Sounds like a lot of shots. 

                                 BRITTANY
                        It was. Seriously, if I wasn’t such a 
                        happy person, I’d think I was an 
                        alcoholic. 

                                 GINA
                        Hahaha. Okay, time to start the day.

           Gina smiles goodbye and heads towards the exam room.

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gina enters and sees Sal’s dead body, still on the floor 
           where she left it. She looks at it for a beat and then--  

                                 GINA
                        AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

           Brittany comes running up behind Gina.
                                 BRITTANY
                        What’s wrong?!

           Brittany sees Sal’s dead body on the floor and screams.

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - LATER

           Butch questions Gina and Brittany, while Krasinski looks 
           around the crime scene.

                                 BUTCH 
                        When was the last time you saw Sal?

                                 GINA
                        Around six last night.

           Krasinski looks at the open medical drawer where John Doe 
           used to be.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Where’s John Doe’s body? 

                                 GINA
                        It was here when I left yesterday. But 
                        when we got in this morning, the body 
                        was gone and Sal was... oh God.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        What’d you do last night? 

                                 GINA
                        Brittany and I were at the Blue Cat.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Blue Cat? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        It’s a bar.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Have either of you noticed anything 
                        suspicious or out of the ordinary? 

                                 GINA
                        There was that woman. 
                         (to Brittany)
                        What was her name? The lady who kept 
                        calling? 

                                 BRITTANY
                        Right. Claudette Harris. She’s the 
                        woman that JP saved from that fire. 
                        She kept calling and calling and 
                        leaving messages about JP’s body.

                                 BRITTANY (CONT'D)
                        It’s like she was obsessed with him. 
                        She showed up here yesterday and Sal 
                        kicked her out. Said he’d get a 
                        restraining order against her if she 
                        came back. Oh my God, do you think she 
                        did this? 

           Butch and Krasinski look at each other. Sounds like they have 
           their first suspect.  

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           Krasinski and Butch sit across from Claudette. Butch hits 
           play on a tape recorder and we hear Claudette’s voice. 

                                 CLAUDETTE (V.O.)
                        Hello, this is Claudette Harris again. 
                        I’m sorry to keep bothering you, but I 
                        need to see him. JP. He’s my savior, 
                        our souls are forever connected. I can 
                        feel it. I need -- I don’t understand 
                        why you’re keeping him from me. You 
                        can’t keep him from me. I want to see 
                        his body! I need to see his body!
                         (then)
                        I’m sorry. I’ll try you again later.

                                 BUTCH
                        Is that you?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Yes.

                                 BUTCH
                        You left a lot of messages about JP 
                        Wilson’s body.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I needed to see him. But the Coroner 
                        wouldn’t let me.

                                 BUTCH
                        Is that why you killed him? So you 
                        could steal JP’s body?

           Krasinski shoots Blake a frustrated look - that’s not how 
           you’re supposed to interrogate a suspect.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Butch.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        The Coroner’s dead?
                                 BUTCH
                        He wouldn’t let you see JP, so you took 
                        matters into your own hands. You tried 
                        to steal the body, but Sal caught you. 
                        And things got out of hand, didn’t it? 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Let’s back up. Ms. Harris, where were 
                        you last night?

           Claudette clutches the cross that’s hanging around her neck.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I did it. I killed the Coroner.

           Butch leans back, pleased with himself. But Krasinski isn’t 
           buying Claudette’s confession. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        How’d you kill him?
                         (Claudette doesn’t respond)
                        Where’s JP’s body? 
                         (she doesn’t respond)
                        Why are you confessing to this crime?

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        Because I’m guilty and I should be 
                        punished for what I did. Please send 
                        me to jail now. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        You should speak with a lawyer.

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I don’t want a lawyer! I want to go to 
                        jail! Send me to jail! 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Ms. Harris--

                                 CLAUDETTE
                        I don’t want to talk anymore.

           Claudette turns away from them. Krasinski studies her, brows 
           furrowed - this case just got weird.   

           INT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           We follow Frankie as she makes her way down the crowded 
           hallway, in a daze. She passes a locker with a giant HARVARD 
           MAGNET on it - Natasha’s locker. Frankie looks at it for a 
           moment, and then continues on to her locker.
           Donaldo is waiting there. They lock eyes. The bell rings and 
           the hallway empties as everyone hurries to class. Frankie and 
           Donaldo are left standing alone.

                                 DONALDO
                        Hey.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey.
                         (beat)
                        What did you guys do with...

           Frankie can’t bring herself to finish the sentence. She looks 
           away. Silence. 

                                 DONALDO
                        Are you scared of me?

           Frankie is caught off guard by that question. She thinks 
           about it... then answers honestly. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        No.

                                 DONALDO
                        I’m scared of me.

           They stand in silence. 

           INT. MICKEY HAGAN’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Liv hurries into Mickey’s office. Mickey looks up from his 
           desk and smiles.

                                 MICKEY
                        Hi, can I help you?

                                 LIV
                        I need to cancel the deal. I need my 
                        money back.

                                 MICKEY
                         (confused)
                        I’m sorry. Do I know you?

           Liv stops in her tracks.

                                 LIV
                        What?

                                 MICKEY
                        Do we have an appointment?
                                 LIV
                        Mickey, it’s Olivia Wilson. I was here 
                        yesterday. I closed on a house and I 
                        have fourteen days to void the deal 
                        without financial penalty. I need my 
                        money back.

                                 MICKEY
                        Look ma’am, I want to help you, but I 
                        honestly have no clue what you’re 
                        talking about. 

           Liv grabs documents out of her purse and slams them onto 
           Mickey’s desk.

                                 LIV
                        I signed paperwork with you! This is 
                        your signature!

           Mickey looks over the paperwork.

                                 MICKEY
                        This is my signature, but I don’t 
                        recall signing any of this. 

                                 LIV
                        What is happening?

                                 MICKEY
                        Let me check and see if you’re in our 
                        system. Please have a seat. We’ll get 
                        this all sorted. 

           Mickey grabs the paperwork and disappears into the back 
           office. Liv sinks into a chair, her world spinning.

                                 LIV
                        What is happening? This can’t be 
                        happening.

           Someone sits down next to Liv.

                                 TIFFANY (O.S.)
                        I don’t need to make any presumptions- 

           Liv turns and is horrified to see Tiffany sitting next to her.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Because it’s pretty obvious that you 
                        don’t love your husband and that you 
                        don’t care he’s dead. 

           Liv goes to the door that Mickey disappeared through. She 
           tries to open it, but it’s locked. She bangs on the door.
                                 LIV
                        Mickey! Give me my money! Mickey!

                                 TIFFANY
                        Once he heard that the money you gave 
                        him to buy property was scammed from 
                        tons of people who thought they were 
                        donating to a funeral, including my 
                        poor, old, grieving mother-- well, 
                        then he was more than happy to help me 
                        recoup my loss. I mean, I also paid 
                        him. He’s no Mother Theresa. 

                                 LIV
                        This isn’t happening.

                                 TIFFANY
                        Olivia, stop, this is clearly 
                        happening. 

                                 LIV
                        I’ll go to the police.

                                 TIFFANY
                        And tell them that you set up a 
                        fraudulent donation account to trick 
                        people into buying you an investment 
                        property? I don’t think you will.
                         (then)
                        You were right. I’m a terrible 
                        daughter and I don’t deserve my 
                        mother’s money. But you don’t deserve 
                        it either.

           Tiffany points to Liv's black eye.

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        That looks like it hurts.

           Tiffany smiles and walks out, leaving behind a broken Liv.

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - LATER

           Krasinski, Butch and Chief Stanton watch Claudette through 
           the two-way mirror. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Chief, I don’t think she did it. 

                                 BUTCH
                        She confessed. Multiple times. 
                                 KRASINSKI
                        Does she look like someone who can 
                        carry a dead body?

                                 BUTCH
                        Maybe she dragged it or maybe she 
                        rolled it or maybe she’s strong. Our 
                        job is to prove she did it, and she 
                        made it easy by saying she did it.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Our job is to find the actual killer 
                        and I don’t think it’s her.

                                 BUTCH
                        Then why would she confess? Multiple 
                        times.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        I don’t know. 

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        We have a confession. Seems like a win 
                        to me.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Chief--

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        Book her and close the case. 

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

           The back door opens and Liv enters. She drops her bag, opens 
           a cabinet, takes out a bottle of whiskey and sets it on the 
           counter. As she’s reaching for a glass, she accidently knocks 
           the whiskey bottle off the counter. It falls to the floor, 
           shattering. Liv looks at the mess... and gives up. She lays 
           down and rests her face against the kitchen tiles.  

           JP enters from the basement.

                                 JP
                        Liv?

           Liv lays there, catatonic. No response. JP sits beside her.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        I know everything is fucked, but you 
                        gotta stay tough. You’re tough. 

           Liv doesn’t respond. JP touches the bottom of her black eye. 
                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        What happened here?
                         (no response)
                        I’m sorry I got you involved in this. I 
                        screwed up. Again. I’ve been screwing 
                        up your life since we were fourteen. 
                         (no response)
                        I’m a fucking asshole, Liv. Don’t give 
                        me the satisfaction of breaking you.   
                         (no response)
                        Come on, you need to fight. Frankie 
                        needs you to fight.

           Liv doesn’t respond. JP shakes her.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Liv!

           Still no response. JP stands, at a loss at what to do. He 
           gets a glass of water and throws it in Liv’s face. She sits 
           up, gasping. JP kneels beside her.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           Liv beats on JP’s chest, completely overwhelmed.

                                 LIV
                        No! No! No! 

           JP holds her until she calms down. 

                                 JP
                        We’re going to be okay.

                                 LIV
                        We’re not.

                                 JP
                        We are.

                                 LIV
                        I messed up.

                                 JP
                        You can’t blame yourself for not 
                        picking up the body. If I hadn’t gone 
                        jogging, the police wouldn’t have even 
                        been looking into it. And Natasha 
                        would’ve never gone after Frankie 
                        and... This is all on me, not you.
                         (then)
                        I can still fix this, but I need your 
                        help. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JP (CONT'D)
                        I need you to play the grieving wife 
                        one more time.
                         (off her look)
                        Your husband’s body is missing.

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - LATER

           Krasinski scrolls through JP’s Facebook page, reading the  
           RIP messages that are posted on his wall: “Rest in Peace 
           friend” “I’ll miss you JP” “God just got a brave new angel” 
           etc. Krasinski frowns, incredulous.  

                                 NATASHA’S DAD (O.S.)
                        We’re here about our daughter.

           Krasinski looks up and sees NATASHA’S MOM and Dad, both 
           distraught, talking to the DESK SERGEANT up front. 

                                 NATASHA’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        We got a call. 

                                 DESK SERGEANT
                        Yes. I’ll get Officer Carter for you.

           Desk Sergeant dials Carter’s extension.

                                 DESK SERGEANT (CONT’D)
                         (on phone)
                        Her parents are here.
                         (to parents)
                        She’ll be right up. 

           Krasinski sees Carter approaching and intercepts her.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Carter.
                         (re: parents)
                        What’s going on?

                                 CARTER
                        Some hikers found a body at the bottom 
                        of Redfox Canyon. Suicide by cliff. 
                        Taking the parents to make an ID.  

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Suicide by cliff?

                                 CARTER
                        Yeah.

           Carter hands Krasinski the police report she’s carrying. 
                                 CARTER (CONT’D)
                        We found her car parked at the top 
                        with a suicide note inside. She was 
                        upset she didn’t get into Harvard. 
                        Thought her life was over. I’m telling 
                        you, they’re putting too much pressure 
                        on kids these days.  

           Krasinski sees Natasha’s school picture in the file.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Isn’t this the girl who made a scene 
                        here the other day? 

                                 CARTER
                         (slight smile)
                        Called Butch a simpleminded spawn of 
                        cousin-fuckers. Smart girl. And now I 
                        have to watch her parents ID her body. 
                        I hate this part.  

                                 KRASINSKI
                        I’ll take them for you. 

                                 CARTER
                        Seriously?

                                 KRASINSKI
                        I’m good with grieving parents. 

           Krasinski heads off before Carter can respond.

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - LATER

           Gina looks down at Natasha's body on her table. It’s banged 
           up, but has been prepped and cleaned. Gina covers the body 
           and pops a pill to calm her nerves. Brittany enters.

                                 BRITTANY
                        They’re here. You ready?

           Gina nods and Brittany shows in Natasha’s Mom and Dad and 
           Krasinski. Krasinski hangs back while the parents approach 
           Gina and the covered body on the table.

                                 GINA
                        Are you ready?

                                 NATASHA’S DAD
                        Yes.

           Gina pulls back the sheet, revealing Natasha’s body. 
           Natasha’s Mom lets out a wail as Natasha’s Dad fights back 
           tears. Gina can barely look at them.  
                                 GINA
                        Is this your daughter? 

                                 NATASHA’S DAD
                        Yes. My little girl. She was spiraling 
                        and I didn’t do anything. I saw her 
                        spiraling and I--

           Natasha’s Dad breaks down. He reaches out and touches 
           Natasha’s head. 

                                 NATASHA’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry I let you down! 

           Gina looks away, silent tears rolling down her face. 

                                 NATASHA’S MOM
                        I can’t! 

           Natasha’s Mom runs from the room. Natasha’s Dad follows her 
           out. Krasinski turns to Gina. Beat. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                         (re Gina’s tears)
                        Did you know her?

                                 GINA
                        No. But it’s still sad. She was so 
                        young. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        You put cause of death as suicide?

                                 GINA
                        Yes. She died on impact when she hit 
                        the ground. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Is there any chance she was pushed or 
                        thrown off that cliff? To make it look 
                        like she jumped?

                                 GINA
                        The trajectory of her injuries are 
                        more in line with a jump than with a 
                        push or a throw. Her blood alcohol 
                        level was over .2, so she was 
                        incredibly intoxicated at time of 
                        death. And officers found a note at 
                        the scene. There, unfortunately, is no 
                        way to be 100% sure what happened to 
                        Natasha, but considering all the 
                        evidence, the most likely explanation 
                        is suicide. 
           Krasinski studies Gina.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Are you okay?

                                 GINA
                        I just performed autopsies on my 
                        colleague who was murdered by a psycho 
                        and a teenaged girl who took her own 
                        life. I’ve been better.  

           Krasinski looks at her for another beat. Then nods and exits 
           the room. Gina lets out a deep breath.  

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON the TV. The news is on and a Reporter is mid-segment.

                                 REPORTER
                        And in a strange turn of events, 
                        Claudette Harris went from fire victim 
                        to murder perp. Police Chief Stanton 
                        held a press conference earlier today 
                        to speak on this truly bizarre case.

           The news cuts to the press conference. Chief Stanton stands 
           in front of the police station with Liv by his side.

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        Last night county coroner Sal Lewis 
                        was killed and the body of JP Wilson 
                        stolen. Through the swift and 
                        exemplary work of my officers, we 
                        discovered that Claudette Harris - the 
                        woman who JP gave his life for - had 
                        left a series of odd and threatening 
                        messages for Sal regarding JP’s body. 
                        When we brought Ms. Harris in for 
                        questioning, she immediately confessed 
                        to the murder of Coroner Lewis. We are 
                        still in the process of tracking down 
                        the missing body. JP’s wife, Olivia 
                        Wilson, is here today to make a plea 
                        for her husband. 

           Chief Stanton motions to Liv and she steps up to the mic. 

                                 LIV
                        If anyone close to Ms. Harris has any 
                        information about the location of my 
                        husband’s body, please contact the 
                        police. My husband was a hero and he 
                        deserves to be buried. 
           The news segment cuts back to the Reporter.

                                 REPORTER
                        Claudette Harris has been charged with 
                        manslaughter and despite the desperate 
                        pleas from his wife, has yet to reveal 
                        what she did with JP Wilson’s body.
                         (then)
                        Up next - local high school student 
                        commits suicide after being waitlisted 
                        at her dream college. Are we putting 
                        too much pressure on our kids? More 
                        after the break. 

           We pull out to reveal JP, Gina, Liv, Frankie and Donaldo 
           sitting somberly around the TV, watching the news. Beat.

                                 GINA
                        We did it.

                        Can you not sound so happy? That poor 
                        woman is going down for what you did. 

                                 GINA
                        And Natasha’s parents think she 
                        committed suicide because of what your 
                        daughter and her boyfriend did.   

                                 JP
                        Hey, we all need to stick together, 
                        okay? We’re in the clear for now, but 
                        we need to stay calm so we don’t make 
                        any mistakes. And when the money comes--  

                                 GINA
                        When’s the money coming? Why’s it 
                        taking so long?

                        They said it could take up to seven 
                        business days. It should be here soon. 

                                 JP
                        Until then, everyone needs to keep up 
                        appearances - go to school, go to 
                        work, act like everything’s normal. 
                        And we’ll all be fine.       

                                 LIV
                        I need some water.

           Liv hurries out of the room. 
           INT. WILSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Liv paces nervously. She turns on the kitchen sink and 
           splashes water on her face. Frankie enters.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mom?

                        You hungry?

                        Not really.

                                 LIV
                        I’m starving.

           Liv grabs some vegetables and starts chopping them up. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        What are you making?

                        I don’t know.

           Liv’s chopping grows increasingly more manic. Desperate. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mom?

           Liv stops chopping.

                        There’s no money.

           Frankie’s face falls.

                        What do you mean there’s no money?

           Frankie and Liv turn to see Gina standing in the doorway. JP 
           and Donaldo follow her in. 

                                 GINA (CONT’D)
                        Where’s our money?

                                 JP
                        Liv?

                                 LIV
                        You were going to Grand Rapids and you 
                        were going off to college. I wanted a 
                        new life for myself too.
                                 GINA
                        Where’s our money? 

                                 LIV
                        I was going to get it back after the 
                        deal closed. I had everything planned.

                                 GINA
                        WHERE’S OUR MONEY!

                                 LIV
                        It’s gone! They took it. They took 
                        everything. It’s all gone.

           Gina lunges at Liv and puts her hands around her throat, 
           choking her. The room erupts in chaos. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Get off her!

                                 JP
                        Gina stop!

           JP tries to remove Gina, but Gina wildly swings her arm back, 
           accidently elbowing JP in the face. His nose starts to gush 
           blood and he falls back, momentarily blinded by the blow.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           Gina squeezes her hands tighter around Liv’s neck. Liv 
           desperately claws at Gina’s hands, unable to breathe. 

                                 GINA
                        That money was-- I killed someone! 

           Donaldo goes to grab Gina, but then freezes, afraid to put 
           his hands on her. Frankie grabs a frying pan.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Get off!

           Frankie whacks Gina in the side of the head. Gina falls over, 
           releasing Liv, who immediately starts coughing, sobbing and 
           gasping for air. 

           Frankie, JP and Donaldo rush to Liv’s side. Gina watches, a 
           trickle of blood creeping down the side of her head. She 
           realizes what she’s just done. 

                                 GINA
                        I’m sorry.
                                 FRANKIE
                        You could’ve killed her! 

                                 GINA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Get out. Get out of our house! Get the 
                        fuck out of our lives! 

           Gina looks to JP, but his attention is on Liv.

                                 JP
                         (comforting Liv)
                        It’s okay. You’re going to be okay.

           Liv wraps her arms around JP. Gina takes in the tableau -- 
           JP, Frankie and Donaldo surrounding Liv. They’re a family... 
           and she’s on the outside. Gina’s heart breaks. She turns and 
           walks away. We follow her out. 

           EXT. WILSON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Gina gets into her car, buckles her seat belt and turns on 
           the engine. She looks towards the Wilson house and waits, 
           desperately hopeful... Nobody comes out after her. Gina wipes 
           away a tear and drives off. 

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - FRANKIE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Donaldo and Frankie lay in bed looking at each other. 

                                 DONALDO
                        I froze. When Gina was choking your 
                        mom. I could’ve grabbed her, but I was 
                        afraid to hurt her. I don’t want to 
                        hurt anyone else. 

                                 FRANKIE
                         (beat)
                        I could’ve killed Gina when I hit her 
                        in the head. I wasn’t thinking, I just 
                        knew that I had to protect my mom... I 
                        get what you did. With Natasha.

                                 DONALDO
                        I murdered her.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Is it considered murder if you’re 
                        protecting someone you love?
                                 DONALDO
                        ... Yes. It’s definitely still 
                        considered murder. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I know.

           Donaldo swings his legs off the bed, his back to Frankie.

                                 DONALDO
                        We have to go to school and pretend 
                        everything’s normal.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Do you remember when my life was so 
                        boring that I had to make up a fake 
                        tragedy?

           Donaldo doesn’t respond. Frankie stares at his back, unsure 
           how to help him.

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - SAME TIME

           JP is asleep on the couch. Liv enters carrying a breakfast 
           tray of pancakes, eggs, orange juice and coffee. She sets the 
           tray down and watches JP snore. In addition to her black eye, 
           she now has bruises on her neck from where Gina choked her.

           Liv picks up the glass of orange juice and pours it in JP’s 
           face. JP shoots awake, gagging. Liv laughs.

                                 JP
                        What the hell, Liv?!

                                 LIV
                         (laughing)
                        I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I couldn’t help 
                        it! You were an easy target and I had 
                        to get you back for throwing water in 
                        my face.

                                 JP
                        You were catatonic. It was necessary.

           JP runs his finger across his face and licks it.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Orange juice? Really?

                                 LIV
                        It was either that or hot coffee.
                                 JP
                        So not pouring something in my face 
                        wasn’t an option?

                                 LIV
                        No.

           Liv sits down next to JP.

                           JP
                                                         LIV
           You made me breakfast?
                                            I made you breakfast.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.

                                 JP
                        Thanks.

           JP takes in Liv’s bruises.

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        You look...

                                 LIV
                        Like two crazy bitches kicked my ass?

                                 JP
                        I’m sorry she did that to you. 

                                 LIV
                        You said you would fix everything and 
                        you did. We’re safe because of you. 
                        And I know I really fucked up with the 
                        money, but I was thinking about it and 
                        I can sell our house. People would 
                        expect the grieving widow to want to 
                        move on, so it wouldn’t look 
                        suspicious or anything. And then we 
                        can use the money we get from it to 
                        leave town and start over somewhere 
                        new. You, me and Frankie. 

                                 JP
                        Liv--

                                 LIV
                        We can be a family again.

           JP looks at her sadly.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        Or not.
                                 JP
                        I’m sorry I hurt you.

                                 LIV
                        Kicking you out was supposed to make 
                        you try harder. We were supposed to 
                        come back together. That’s what we do. 
                        But it only took you seven days to 
                        find someone new.

                                 JP
                        I’m sorry.

           Liv points to the bruises on her neck.

                                 LIV
                        How can you love someone who did this? 

                                 JP
                        Last night - that’s not who she is.

           Beat.

                                 LIV
                        I should get to work. 

           Liv stands and walks away. She turns back.

                                 LIV (CONT’D)
                        If you weren’t already dead, I’d 
                        divorce you.

                                 JP
                        Thanks.

           Liv exits the basement. JP grabs his phone and makes a call. 

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

           Gina's phone, inside her open purse, silently lights up with 
           a call from JP. We pull up to reveal that Gina is sitting in 
           the police station. Officer Krasinski approaches her. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        You wanted to see me?

           Gina stands and hands him a report.

                                 GINA
                        I took another look at Natasha's body 
                        after you left yesterday and realized 
                        that I had made a mistake. Natasha’s 
                        injuries weren't all sustained from 
                        the fall. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GINA (CONT'D)
                        There's also blunt force trauma 
                        consistent with getting hit by a car. 
                        You were right. This wasn't suicide. 
                        It was murder.

           INT. GINA’S CAR - LATER

           Gina gets into her car and takes a deep breath. She takes out 
           her phone and sees a missed call from JP. She listens to the 
           voicemail. 

                                 JP (V.O.)
                        Gina. You scared me last night. What 
                        you did to Liv wasn’t okay and I was 
                        angry. But when I woke up, all I 
                        wanted was to be next to you. We don’t 
                        need the money. We’ll go to Grand 
                        Rapids and we’ll make it work. You, 
                        me, and little Oriana. I love you.

           Gina smiles. Then she remembers what she just did and the 
           smile drops -- oh shit! 

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Gina stands across from a suspicious Officer Krasinski.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        So first it was suicide, and then it 
                        was murder, and now it's suicide 
                        again?

                                 GINA
                        I apologize for the inconsistency. I’m 
                        still new at this head coroner job.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Can you wait here for a second?

           Gina nods and Krasinski walks over to Chief Stanton’s office. 
           Gina sees them looking at her and shifts nervously. She turns 
           and tries to calmly make her way towards the exit. 

           EXT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Gina hurries to her car. Krasinski and Butch exit the police 
           station and follow after Gina.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Gina, can we ask you a few questions?

                                 GINA
                        Sorry, I need to get back to work.
                                 KRASINSKI
                        We’re going to have another coroner 
                        run an autopsy on Natasha’s body. What 
                        are they going to find?

           Gina gets into her car and speeds away. 

                                 BUTCH
                        Car chase! I’m driving!

           Krasinski and Butch jump into a police car and chase after 
           Gina.

           EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Gina zooms down the street, with Krasinski and Butch right 
           behind her, sirens blaring.

           This very brief car chase ends with Gina crashing her car 
           into a tree. Gina gets out of her car, disoriented, and 
           continues her get-away on foot. She’s on an open road and 
           there’s clearly nowhere for her to run or hide. Krasinski and 
           Butch creep along behind Gina in their police car. 

                                 BUTCH
                        Is she seriously going to keep 
                        running? 

           Butch picks up the car mic and talks to Gina through the 
           loudspeakers. 

                                 BUTCH (CONT’D)
                        Stop running. We caught you. Stop 
                        running. We caught you. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Pull over.

           Butch pulls over. Krasinski hops out and chases after Gina.

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           A stoic Gina sits across from Butch, who has his feet on the 
           table and is bouncing a tennis ball off the wall behind her.

                                 BUTCH
                        I can do this all day, sweetheart. I 
                        know you think you’re tough, but I 
                        will get the truth out of you. Getting 
                        people to confess to their crimes is 
                        kinda my specialty. 

           Gina doesn’t respond. Butch gets in her face.
                                 BUTCH (CONT’D)
                        You killed that girl, didn’t you? You 
                        killed her and tried to cover it up as 
                        a suicide. Admit it. Come on, clear 
                        your conscious. Confess. 

           Gina doesn’t respond. The interrogation door opens and 
           Krasinski enters, holding a file. 

                                 BUTCH (CONT’D)
                        She’s still giving us the silent 
                        treatment.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Gina, why’d you run from us?

                                 GINA
                        You were chasing me and it made me 
                        nervous. My brain just went into 
                        flight mode.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        We sent Natasha’s body to another 
                        coroner. What are they going to find?

                                 GINA
                        That I’m not very good at my job. I’m 
                        not used to doing autopsies on my own 
                        and I’m afraid I may have made some 
                        mistakes. That’s why I kept changing 
                        my report. I’m going to be fired, 
                        aren’t I?

           Krasinski smiles, impressed with Gina’s ability to keep up 
           the lie. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        I just searched your apartment. You 
                        had a pretty interesting photo wall. 

           Krasinski opens his file and lays out photos he took. They’re 
           pictures of Gina and JP’s CUTESY PHOTO WALL. 

                                 BUTCH
                        Whoa! That’s JP Wilson!

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Good observation, Butch, that is JP 
                        Wilson. And Gina. Together in lots and 
                        lots of pictures. A bit tacky for my 
                        taste, but who am I to judge how you 
                        express your love. 

           Gina starts to sweat, but doesn’t speak.
                                 KRASINSKI (CONT’D)
                        I was surprised to see this photo wall 
                        because JP’s allegedly dead body was 
                        identified by your office, and you 
                        never mentioned that you two were 
                        lovers. That’s strange.  

                                 BUTCH
                        Real strange, Gina, real strange.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        What happened?
                         (no response)
                        Okay, let me guess. You and JP faked 
                        his death to make a quick buck and 
                        then killed Sal and Natasha to cover 
                        it up. Am I warm? 

                                 BUTCH
                        Feels pretty damn warm to me.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Where’s your boyfriend, Gina?
                         (no response)
                        Was his wife involved?

           Gina tenses at the word “wife.” Krasinski notices. 

                                 KRASINSKI (CONT’D)
                        Yes, his wife identified the body and 
                        took the donation money, so I’m 
                        assuming this con was a family affair. 
                        How’d his wife feel about you two 
                        dating? You’d think she’d hate him for 
                        that, but man her performance as the 
                        grieving wife was so realistic. I 
                        honestly believed she loved him.
                         (then)
                        I guess that makes sense. I went to 
                        high school with JP and Liv and they 
                        were always on again, off again, on 
                        again, off again. But she never 
                        stopped loving him. Even when she was 
                        with someone who treated her better, 
                        she always took him back. 
                         (then)
                        Gina if you don’t talk to me, you’re 
                        going to go down for these crimes on 
                        your own. 
                         (then)
                        Well, on the bright side, once you’re 
                        in jail and out of the way, those two 
                        high school sweethearts can finally be 
                        on again.   
           Krasinski stands to go.

                                 GINA
                        Wait!

           INT. WILSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - LATER

           Music is playing as JP exercises. He’s in the middle of doing 
           power push-ups. 

           A pair of feet appear below him. JP looks up and sees 
           Krasinski standing above him.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Hey JP.

           EXT. WILSON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The music continues, underscoring as Krasinski leads JP out 
           in handcuffs. 

           INT. OFFICE SUPPLY STORE - MAIN FLOOR - SAME TIME

           Butch walks a distraught Liv across the store in handcuffs, 
           while customers and other store employees look on in shock.  

           INT. NEWBANK HIGH SCHOOL - LATER

           Krasinski and Butch stand in the front hall. A nervous Mr. 
           Fisher scurries up to them.

                                 MR. FISHER
                        I’m sorry officers, they’re not here. 
                        They never showed up for school today.

           EXT. REDFOX CANYON - SAME TIME

           Frankie and Donaldo are in the process of digging a hole at 
           the bottom of the canyon, where Natasha’s body was found. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I think this is deep enough. You 
                        ready? 

                                 DONALDO
                        Yeah.

           Donaldo drops his shovel and walks over to his truck. There’s 
           a small OAK TREE in the back. Donaldo lifts out the tree and 
           carries it back to the hole.  

           Frankie and Donaldo carefully plant the oak tree in silence. 
           When they’re done, they stand and take in their work. It’s 
           beautiful. 
                                 DONALDO (CONT’D)
                        Natasha, I’m really sorry for what I 
                        did to you. I know planting a tree 
                        won’t bring you back or make things 
                        right, but... it’s something... 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I know we don’t deserve it, but I want 
                        us to go on living. Do you think we 
                        can do that?

           Beat. Donaldo takes Frankie’s hand.

                                 DONALDO
                        Yeah.

           INT. DONALDO’S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Frankie and Donaldo get into the truck. They share a smile. 
           Frankie’s phone dings with a notification alert. She checks 
           and sees that she has a new voicemail. She listens to it.

                                 JP (V.O.)
                        Hey Frankie, it’s your dad. I’m not 
                        dead. 

           Frankie furrows her brows, confused, and puts her phone on 
           speakerphone so that Donaldo can hear too.

                                 JP (V.O.)
                        I know that you’re probably shocked, 
                        confused and angry to hear that, but 
                        it’s true -- I’m alive. 

           Frankie looks at Donaldo - WTF?

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - DAY

           As the VO continues, we see quick shots of: 

           JP getting his mugshot taken, resolute.

           A tear stained Liv getting finger printed.

           Gina, dazed and weary, being interrogated by Krasinski and 
           Butch.

           Liv getting her mugshot taken.

           JP being interrogated by Krasinski and Butch.

           Gina getting finger printed.

           Gina getting her mugshot taken.

                                 JP (V.O.)
                        Your mother, Gina and I faked my 
                        death. I’m not a hero who died in a 
                        fire. I’m a loser who took advantage 
                        of a hero’s death to make some money. 
                        And I did something awful to protect 
                        that lie. I hurt your friend Natasha. 
                        She found out what we were doing and 
                        she was going to expose us and I 
                        snapped. I’ll regret that moment for 
                        the rest of my life. 

           INT. DONALDO’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Frankie tears up as she listens to the call.

                                 JP (V.O.)
                        Frankie, I’m sorry that I hurt you. 
                        You deserve so much more. You deserve 
                        the world. I’m sorry I couldn’t give 
                        it to you. 
                         (then)
                        They’re telling me my time is up. You 
                        let Donaldo know that he better be 
                        good to you. He better be a better man 
                        than I was or I’ll come find him. 
                        Metaphorically, I guess. I’m going 
                        away for a long time. I love you, 
                        Frankie. 

           The call ends, leaving Frankie and Donaldo in a stunned 
           silence. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        He’s taking the fall for everything.

                                 DONALDO
                        I’m turning myself in.

           Donaldo starts his truck and zooms out of the canyon. 
           Frankie’s cell rings. She answers.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hello?

                                 LIV (V.O.)
                        Frankie.

           Frankie breaks down at the sound of her mother’s voice.
                                 FRANKIE
                        Mom! What’s going on?

           We INTERCUT phone call with--

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Liv stands at the phone in the corner of the station. She’s 
           trying to hold it together, but we can feel her fear. 

                                 LIV
                        Your dad isn’t dead, Frankie. We faked 
                        his death. He’s not a hero who died in 
                        a fire. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Mom, don’t do this.

                        Your dad did something awful, Frankie.

                        Stop!

                                 LIV
                        He hurt your friend Natasha. We’ve 
                        been arrested.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We’re coming.

                                 LIV
                        NO! No. I won’t let our mistakes ruin 
                        your life. Do not come here. You’re 
                        going to get out of Newbank and you’re 
                        never going to look back. Do you hear 
                        me? 
                         (no response)
                        Frankie, I need you to hear me.

                                 FRANKIE

                        You should take Donaldo with you. He’s

                        I love you.

           Liv hangs up the phone and lets out a small sob.

           INT. DONALDO’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Frankie puts down her phone. Frankie looks at Donaldo. 
           Donaldo looks at Frankie. She nods. Donaldo slows down, makes 
           a U-turn and drives off in the opposite direction. 

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - CHIEF’S OFFICE - LATER

           Chief Stanton sits at his desk, the weight of the world on 
           his shoulders. Krasinski rushes in.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        They’re lying! Their calls were almost 
                        identical - “your dad isn’t dead, he 
                        wasn’t a hero who died in a fire, he 
                        hurt your friend” - like it was planned. 
                        I don’t think JP killed Natasha. Gina 
                        implicated both Donaldo and Frankie in 
                        that murder and I think she’s telling 
                        the truth. The parents are lying to 
                        cover for the kids. Frankie and Donaldo 
                        were involved, I know it.   

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        I don’t care.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Chief--

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        I’ve got people confessing to a crime 
                        that I already locked an old lady up 
                        for. I’m going to look like such a 
                        jackass. I want this mess over. I need 
                        this case to be done. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        Chief--

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        They confessed! So unless those kids 
                        waltz in here and tell me that they 
                        did it, we’re gonna charge the people 
                        who confessed. 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        The last time you put a confession 
                        above evidence, an innocent woman 
                        ended up behind bars. 
           Chief Stanton shoots Krasinski a seething look.

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        Are JP and Olivia Wilson innocent?

                                 KRASINSKI
                        No.

                                 CHIEF STANTON
                        Then get the fuck out of my office and 
                        close this goddamn case!

           Krasinski shakes his head and storms out. 

           INT. NEWBANK POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

           JP sits with his head on the table. Krasinski enters and sits 
           across from him. JP sits up. The two guys look at each other. 

                                 JP
                        So. What now? 

                                 KRASINSKI
                        You’ll never get out. I’ll make sure 
                        of that.

                                 JP
                        Okay... Once I go down, that’s it 
                        right? You won’t go after anyone else? 

           Krasinski doesn’t respond. 

                                 JP (CONT’D)
                        Look, I know we’re not friends and you 
                        don’t owe me anything... Please.

                                 KRASINSKI
                        I’m not going after anyone else. 

                                 JP
                        Okay. Let’s do this.

           EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - OPEN ROAD - SAME TIME

           Donaldo’s blue pick up truck drives down a route-like road 
           that’s flanked by pastures of green.

           INT. DONALDO’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Donaldo drives, while Frankie sits in the passenger seat, 
           looking out the window. She sees the LEAVING NEWBANK sign 
           coming up. 
                                 FRANKIE
                        Wait, stop.

           Donaldo pulls over and Frankie hops out of the truck. She 
           walks over to the LEAVING NEWBANK sign and stares at it. 
           Donaldo appears by her side.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t how I thought I’d leave.

           The two stand there in silence looking up at the sign. Beat. 
           Frankie turns and heads back towards the truck. Donaldo 
           follows her.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll drive.

           Frankie gets in the driver seat, Donaldo in the passenger, 
           and they drive off. We stay with the LEAVING NEWBANK sign, 
           watching the truck grow smaller and smaller as it leaves 
           Newbank behind.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK

                                       END
