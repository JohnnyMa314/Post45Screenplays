           EXT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           The street in front of the arena has been taken over. It’s a 
           carnival. There’s a Ferris wheel with “Bryant” on it.

           Fans everywhere in purple and gold. Parents and children, 
           couples on dates. Selfies, smiles, celebration. Everyone 
           here to see or be seen.

           SUPER: “Kobe Bryant, Jersey Retirement Ceremony”

           We find a KID at a photo booth between two human puppets in 
           Lakers jerseys, #8 and #24. 

                                 KID
                        The mamba! The black mamba!

           He points at the puppets, relics from a Nike ad campaign, as 
           his dad gets a photo for the Gram, and we pull back to the 
           event entrance, an aluminum arch draped with a banner:

           “The Los Angeles Lakers Welcome You To Kobeland”

           19-year-old ---- -----, blonde, open, vulnerable, sits for a 
           job interview with a male HOTEL MANAGER twice her age. He’s 
           reviewing her resume. 

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        So, you’re majoring in...

                                 ----
                        I haven’t picked. I don’t really 
                        have to until I’m a sophomore. But 
                        performing is my passion. You know, 
                        writing and singing music. I was in 
                        choir in high school, and I did 
                        theater- don’t judge.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        I’ll do what I can. 
                                 ----
                        Then I won’t feel bad admitting I 
                        was also a cheerleader.

           He smiles, puts down the resume for a second.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        What we need in terms of summer 
                        help is mainly at reception. This 
                        isn’t exactly our busy season-

                        Skis work better when there’s snow.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        They do. But there’d also be some 
                        light work at the concierge desk. 
                        Giving pointers, securing dinner 
                        reservations, that sort of thing. 
                        Are you a people pleaser?

                                 ----
                        Definitely.

           He picks the resume back up.

                                 HOTEL MANAGER
                        Can you start this week? 

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           The Lakers are playing the San Antonio Spurs. The Laker 
           Girls are literally crying.

           ABC Sports sideline reporter JIM GRAY interviews JACK 
           NICHOLSON. Gold shirt, sunglasses. 

                                 GRAY
                        Jack, how disappointing is this? 

                                 JACK
                        Well, it’s heartbreaking for me, 
                        but we’ve had a great ride with the 
                        Lakers. It’s one of the great runs 
                        in the history of sports. San 
                        Antonio played great tonight. Best 
                        teams win seven game series. But 
                        hats off to the Lakers. They’re a 
                        great champion. They deserve 
                        everything. That’s why all these 
                        people are standing up for them. 
                        It’s heartbreaking, but we’re here.
           Then a shot of KOBE BRYANT, 24 years old, on the bench.  
           White towel draped over his shoulders. Brooding. Somewhere 
           between anger and helplessness. 

           There are about two minutes left in the game, and his team 
           is getting crushed, 105-78. 

           As the reserves play out the remaining time, we hear play-by-
           play man BRAD NESSLER.

                                 NESSLER (V.O.)
                        There was a standing ovation that 
                        lasted the duration of the timeout 
                        for the Lakers, who have given the 
                        fans here so many thrills. Three 
                        straight championships. But it’s 
                        all set to come to a close.

           The clock winds down. Kobe gets up from the bench. And then 
           it’s over. The Spurs win 110-82. 

           Media on the floor. Players hug their opponents. Jim Gray 
           finds Kobe coming out of one such embrace. 

                                 GRAY
                        Kobe Bryant, down here on the 
                        court. Kobe, this is a difficult 
                        moment for you. We appreciate your 
                        time. How disappointed are you?

                                 KOBE
                        Well, you know, I just hate losing. 
                        It’s a tough loss. They played 
                        extremely well. We just have to get 
                        ready for the offseason. Next 
                        season for us starts right now. 

                                 GRAY
                        How much harder will you work in 
                        this offseason now for you to get 
                        back to the championship? 

                                 KOBE
                        I’ll push myself to exhaustion. 

           And he means it. This is everything to him.

           INT. ARENA HALLWAY, NIGHT

           Lakers GM MITCH KUPCHAK, gray hair, shirt and tie, 6’9”, 
           about to turn 49, passes by a gaggle of REPORTERS in the 
           hall outside the locker room. 
                                 REPORTER #1
                        Mitch, your thoughts on the loss? 

           He raises an eyebrow.

                                 MITCH
                        That was... convincing.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Do you expect Kobe to sign the 
                        extension now that the season has 
                        ended?

                                 MITCH
                        He’s already under contract for 
                        next year. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        But beyond that. Do you expect him 
                        to remain a Laker?  

                                 MITCH
                        Now’s not the time, Tim. 

           Security opens the door to the locker room. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, CONTINUOUS

           Players showering, getting dressed. It feels like a funeral. 

           Mitch finds Head Coach PHIL JACKSON, 58, only an inch 
           shorter, gray hair and glasses. The Zen Master. He’s won 
           nine championships, tied for most in NBA history. 

                                 MITCH
                        Ten wins short of a championship is 
                        ten wins too far.

           Phil has an eraser. His target is a white board with the 
           number 10. 

                                 PHIL
                        It happens when the group doesn’t 
                        honor the path.

                                 MITCH
                        They’re going to take the whole 
                        thing, aren’t they? San Antonio.

                                 PHIL
                        We couldn’t defend the fucking 
                        screen roll.
                                 MITCH
                        We’ll get you help. You know this 
                        franchise is committed to winning.

           Phil knows. But he’d rather let Mitch wonder. He surveys the 
           locker room. Guys packing up.

                                 MITCH
                        How’s your heart?

                                 PHIL
                        The blood’s flowing. It’s funny. 
                        You’d think I had a balloon shoved 
                        into my artery a couple days ago.

                                 MITCH
                        Dr. Buss cares about your health. 
                        We all do. I think you know.

                                 PHIL
                        He and I will sit down about my 
                        contract. For now, I’m summoned to 
                        be flogged by the press.

           He pads off.

           EXT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           The players’ parking lot. A Range Rover and a Porsche exit. 
           Only one car left. A Ferrari. 

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           It’s Kobe’s car. He stayed behind to get up shots in the 
           darkened, empty arena. A nondescript Lakers staff member 
           rebounds the ball. 

           His knee is bothering him. His shoulder’s fucked up. 

           He keeps shooting anyway.

           LATER

           Kobe finally leaves through the tunnel, showered, in street 
           clothes. His wife, VANESSA, just turned 21, and their baby 
           daughter are waiting for him.

           Vanessa is quick to hold and kiss her husband. 
                                 VANESSA
                        Oh, baby. I’m so sorry. But you 
                        were awesome.

                                 KOBE
                        Yeah, 7 turnovers. Only got to the 
                        damn free throw line once. Missed 
                        them both.

                                 VANESSA
                        You scored 20. This isn’t on you.

                                 KOBE
                        I need surgery. I can feel it.

                                 VANESSA
                        Where?

           He puts his hand on her back. Doesn’t want to talk about it. 
           They walk. He kisses his daughter on the head.

           EXT. HONOLULU, DAY

           Outside on the deck of a pricey rental home, Phil Jackson 
           meets with Lakers owner, DR. JERRY BUSS, 70. 

           Buss has a mustache and auburn hair that must be a toupee. 
           He goes by doctor because he got a PhD in physical chemistry 
           when he was 24, but he made his fortune in real estate. 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        We’re chasing the Celtics, really, 
                        that’s how I see it. 

           Phil is distracted by the arrival of some very young women 
           inside the house. Blonde. Possibly teenagers. 

                                 PHIL
                        Are those your guests? 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        They read poetry to each other.

           Indeed the women have books. Phil backs up. 

                                 PHIL
                        How many titles do the Lakers have? 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        We have 14, Phil. And I believe we 
                        can tie those bastards from Boston 
                        with you as our coach.
                                 PHIL
                        No matter how hard I try, Jerry, we 
                        can’t get two trophies in one year. 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        Which is why I want to extend your 
                        contract through ‘06. That gives us 
                        three tries for two more rings. 

                                 PHIL
                        I don’t know. One is tough enough. 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        How many does Auerbach have?

                                 PHIL
                        You know the answer to that.

                                 DR. BUSS
                        One more puts you ahead of him. 
                        You’d be the greatest coach in the 
                        history of the sport.

                                 PHIL
                        Then what the hell do I need two 
                        for? 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        Why did Picasso keep painting after 
                        Guernica? 

           Phil looks back at the house. The women are seriously 
           conducting a reading. 

                                 PHIL
                        I’ll have my agent start 
                        negotiating with Mitch. 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        A good plan. 

           Phil starts to go then stops to ask one more question.

                                 PHIL
                        By the way, has anybody talked to 
                        Kobe about his knee? 

                                 DR. BUSS
                        His knee or his shoulder?  

           You could say there’s some confusion.
           EXT. KOBE’S HOUSE, NIGHT

           A U-shaped, 6500-square-foot, two-story mansion in a gated 
           community near Newport Beach. 

           INT. KOBE’S HOUSE, NIGHT

           Vanessa is curled up in Kobe’s arms on the sofa. There’s a 
           baby monitor on the coffee table.

                        What do you think? Pelinka says we 
                        don’t have to consult the team. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Well, you didn’t trust them on your 
                        shoulder, so...

                        I can’t miss games.

                        Where’s the surgeon?

                                 KOBE
                        The best guy we can find from the 
                        research is in Colorado. 

           She massages his right knee.

                                 KOBE
                        Careful, baby.

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s only tendinitis.

                                 KOBE
                        ‘Only tendinitis.’ Okay. You try to 
                        jump out the gym with it.

                                 VANESSA
                        What’s the procedure called? 
                        Arthroscopic?

                                 KOBE
                        Just a scope.

                                 VANESSA
                        I think you already know what you 
                        want to do.

                                 KOBE
                        Oh yeah?
           He pulls her in. The baby monitor crackles. She gets up.

                                 KOBE
                        Vanessa, baby, we can afford a 
                        nanny.

           She heads off to the nursery.

           EXT. VAIL, EAGLE COUNTY REGIONAL AIRPORT, NIGHT

           Kobe, two bodyguards, MIKE ORTIZ and TROY LASTER, as well as  
           his trainer, JOE CARBONE, disembark from a private charter. 

           Ortiz, on his cell phone. 

                                 ORTIZ
                        I wanna expedite things. Get the 
                        keys. No loitering, no paperwork. 

           Two cars are waiting. Their drivers open the rear doors. 
           Kobe gets in one, his entourage in the other. 

           EXT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, NIGHT

           The cars pull up out front. The bellman, BOBBY PIETRACK, is 
           already outside, expecting them. A mall fashion/college prep 
           look. He pushes a luggage cart towards the curb.

           INT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, NIGHT

           The entourage escorts Kobe into the lobby. ---- is at 
           reception, smiling.

                        Hey there, all. Where’s Mr. Ortiz?

           He steps up. She has the welcome materials and the keys 
           ready. Carbone slides in. 
                                 CARBONE
                        Which one’s for Rodriguez? 

           She indicates. Carbone takes it.

                        Hey, Javier, let’s go.

           Kobe, who was on his BlackBerry, paces towards the hall. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           ---- leads the entourage to the southwest end of the hotel. 
           About as far from the front desk as it gets.

           Kobe checks her out.

           INT. ROOM 35, NIGHT

           The door opens. The bodyguards go in first. It’s a suite 
           with a patio.

           Kobe pulls her aside as the bodyguards inspect the premises.

                        You could show me around.

                        Where else? There’s gotta be more 
                        here than just this room.

                                 ----
                        Maybe I can.

                        Okay. I see how it is...

           He’s flirting with her. 

           The bodyguards reappear.

                        I can show you your rooms now, if 
                        you want.

           INT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, NIGHT

           Rooms 18 and 20 are open. Laster and Ortiz share one. 
           Carbone gets his own. 

           Bellman Bobby comes down the hall with their luggage.

           INT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, NIGHT

           ---- checks her watch at the front desk. On the computer, we 
           see that only seven rooms in the hotel are occupied.

           Bobby comes up, the luggage cart now empty.

                                 BOBBY
                        They wouldn’t let me take him his 
                        bags. I had to hand them off.

           ---- peers down the hall. Ortiz and Laster are preventing 
           access to Kobe’s corridor.

           INT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, NIGHT

           An employee cafeteria. She walks out and up to the second 
           floor, then takes an elevator back down to the first floor.

           She emerges in the same hallway as Kobe’s room, having 
           circumnavigated the bodyguards. 

           Quietly, nerves showing, she knocks on the door.

           Kobe answers.

                                 ----

           First the resort in full, then the room on the second floor 
           above Kobe’s. 

           The windows are open.

           The couple inside is asleep.

                        I’ll walk you out when you finish.

           ---- and Bobby walk across the dark parking lot. Eventually, 
           she grabs his arm. 

                                 BOBBY
                        What’s wrong?

           She’s visibly shaking.

                        Kobe Bryant choked me.

                        Are you- What? What are you- 

           He’s shocked. She’s holding something back.

                                 BOBBY
                        I’ll believe you.

           Her lips quiver. 

           EXT. VERIZON WIRELESS AMPITHEATRE, NIGHT

           A Pearl Jam concert. Phil Jackson is here with bookish 
           sports agent DWIGHT MANLEY, 37. They have terrific seats. 

           Phil’s digging the music, but Dwight wants to talk business. 
           Problem is he’s pretty soft spoken for a guy at a concert. 

                                 PHIL

                        You promised this was about old 
                        times, reliving the glory days when 
                        Vedder used to come to Bulls games 
                        with Rodman. Not free agency.

                        Greatest power forward ever...

                        Who’s that? 

           Manley’s turn to roll his eyes. Phil knows.

                                 PHIL
                        How much does he care about 
                        breaking Kareem’s scoring record? 

                                 MANLEY
                        He wants a championship. That’s it.

           Pearl Jam begins to play “Spin the Black Circle”. Phil 
           listens but really he’s thinking about basketball.

                                 MANLEY
                        It can be a package deal, I think.

                        Payton could defend the screen 
                        roll.

                                 MANLEY
                        What’s that?

           Kobe is on an operating table under local anesthesia. A 
           video screen up next to him, facing away. 
           A surgeon makes a small incision at the joint in his right 
           knee then inserts a very tiny camera.

           The video screen comes alive. 

           The surgeon gets to work.

                        With the air conditioner going here 
                        it’s kinda loud so I’ll need you to 
                        speak up. You have a soft voice.

                                 ----
                        Okay.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Can you explain to me why we’re 
                        here and what happened last night? 

                                 ----
                        Last night I was at work, and I was 
                        sexually assaulted.

           MOMENTS LATER

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And then Mr. Bryant asked you to 
                        come back in about 15 minutes?

                                 ----
                        I showed him the spa, the exercise 
                        room, the outdoor pool, the outdoor 
                        jacuzzi. I took him back up to the 
                        lobby and showed him the terrace. 
                        And at that point he asked me to 
                        take him back to his room. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Then what happened? 

                                 ----
                        He invited me in, and I went with

                        He asked me to sit on the couch. He 
                        sat on the chair, and we were just 
                        talking. Nothing was really 
                        happening, just chitchat. He asked 
                        if I’d go in the jacuzzi with him 
                        later, at which point I told him my 
                        shift was over, and I was gonna go 
                        home because I was starting to get 
                        a little worried.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Well, if you were supposed to get 
                        off work at 7 why were you there at 
                        9:30 or 10 when he arrived? 

                                 ----
                        Because I was excited to meet Kobe 
                        Bryant. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        So you wanted to meet him?

                                 ----
                        Yes, I did. Plus I was trying to 
                        make up the extra hours that I 
                        missed by not coming in at 11.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay. So you’re just talking at 
                        this point?

                        He tried to convince me to come 
                        back in 15 minutes, which I told 
                        him I would just so I could get out 
                        of there. Then I stood up to leave. 
                        He stood up and asked me to give 
                        him a hug. So I gave him a hug, and 
                        he started kissing me, and I let 
                        him kiss me. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And that was consensual? 

                                 ----
                        Yes it was.

                                 ----
                        We kept kissing. Then he took off

                        to choke me. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What were you thinking at the time? 

                                 ----
                        I was thinking that his actions 
                        were getting physical, and I wanted 
                        to get out of the room.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And what were you telling him 
                        during all this? Or did you tell 
                        him anything? 

                                 ----
                        I told him once that I needed to 
                        leave.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Did you ever tell him anything 
                        else? 

                                 ----
                        No, because when he took off his 
                        pants that’s when I started to 
                        kinda back up and try to push his 
                        hands off me. And that’s when he 
                        started to choke me. He wasn’t 
                        choking me enough that I couldn’t 
                        breathe, just choking me to the 
                        point that I was scared. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay. This is where- this is hard- 
                        you’re doing a great job, okay? But 
                        I need you to describe for me where 
                        he was touching.

                        Outside of my underwear. He didn’t

                        was just touching, I guess.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        So he’s rubbing. What is he

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Did he know you were trying to 
                        leave?

                                 ----
                        Because I kept trying to back away 
                        and move towards the door. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS

                        and then he let go at some point? 

                                 ----
                        He was groping me. I tried to

                        when he grabbed my neck. And at 
                        that point I was just looking at 
                        him. I didn’t know what to do. I 
                        didn’t know what to say. Then he 
                        held me by my neck and physically 
                        forced me over to the side of the 
                        two chairs, and that’s when he 
                        turned my back to him and...

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay. So he was controlling your 
                        movements? 

                                 ----
                        Yes. He continually had one hand 
                        around my neck. And with his other 
                        hand he pushed me over to the side 
                        of the two chairs, turned me around 
                        and bent me over and lifted up my 
                        skirt.

                        Are you telling him anything at

                        At this point I was just kinda

                        Yeah. When he lifted up my skirt. I

                        underwear.

                        About as loud as I’m saying it now.

                        Did he hear you?

                                 ----
                        Because every time I said no he 
                        tightened his hold around me. And 
                        then he’d lean real close and ask 
                        me questions.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What would he ask you?

                                 ----
                        I said no. And he didn’t hear me or 
                        asked me to say it louder. He 
                        wanted me to turn around and look 
                        at him while I said it. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS

                        get out of here now,’ that he’d get 
                        more physical. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay. And then what happened? 
                                 ----
                        He lifted up my skirt, took off my 
                        underwear and pushed inside of me. 
                        He leaned his face toward mine and 
                        asked me if I liked it when a guy 
                        came on my face. I said no. Then he 
                        was like, ‘What did you say?’ And 
                        he grabbed and like tightened his 
                        hold on my neck. I said no. He said 
                        he was gonna do it anyway. At that 
                        point I got a little bit more 
                        aggressive and tried to get his 
                        hands off my neck. And he was still 
                        behind me at that point. He’s still 
                        choking me. I was not trying as 
                        hard as I could have to get away, 
                        but I was still trying...

                        trying to- I don’t wanna say be a 
                        good employee- but be nice, I 
                        guess.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And then what happened after he’s 
                        having sex with you from behind? 
                                 ----
                        When I started to get a little bit 
                        more aggressive- when I tried 
                        harder to get away- that’s when he 
                        stopped. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Were you crying then? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        When did you begin crying? 

                                 ----
                        When he started having sex with me.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Would he have known that this was 
                        not a consensual encounter? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        So it’s fair to say that you 
                        allowed him to do everything up to 
                        the point of the groping issue? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And at that point it was clear that 
                        he knew that you didn’t want to go 
                        any further? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And then you say you got forceful 
                        with him, and that made him stop 
                        all of a sudden. Did he say 
                        anything to you at that point? 

                                 ----
                        He didn’t say anything until he’d 
                        stopped, and I turned around and 
                        was looking at him, and that’s when 
                        he started saying, ‘This is just 
                        between the two of us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ---- (CONT'D)
                        Nobody is gonna know about this. 
                        You’re not going to tell anybody.’ 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What did you say? 

                                 ----
                        I said no, I wouldn’t tell anybody. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And why did you tell him that? 

                                 ----
                        I was scared he’d do other things 
                        to scare me into not telling 
                        anybody. You know, like, become 
                        more physical. Choke me harder, hit 
                        me. Something like that.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Is everything you’re telling me 
                        here today the truth? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        And you understand the difference 
                        between a truth and a lie? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Do you understand the allegations 
                        you’re making against someone? 

                                 ----
                        Yes I do.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        You understand the seriousness of 
                        this allegation? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Do you understand that if through 
                        our investigation it comes out that 
                        this was just a story, and it was 
                        made up, that you’ll be charged?
                                 ----
                        Yes I do.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Are you willing to testify in 
                        court? 

                                 ----
                        Yes.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay. We’ll just go like we would 
                        with any other case. We’re not 
                        treating this any different because 
                        of anybody’s stature in the 
                        community. I guess from my 
                        standpoint- it’s not that I don’t 
                        believe you, it’s just that I don’t 
                        want to see anybody doing this just 
                        to try and get ahead or anything 
                        like that. Because, obviously, this 
                        is pretty serious with a pretty 
                        serious person. Do you understand? 

                                 ----
                        Yes. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I understand this is hard for you 
                        to go through. It’s embarrassing 
                        too. But it wasn’t your fault, 
                        okay? If accountability needs to be 
                        held that’s what’s gonna happen. 
                        But don’t blame yourself. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           ---- exits the interview room. Her MOM and DAD are waiting. 
           They embrace. It’s a lot for all of them.

           INT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, DAY

           The lounge. Kobe, who has crutches beside him, plays chess 
           with Carbone. Ortiz and Laster monitor the low stress 
           environment. They have food, drinks.

                                 KOBE
                        Check.

           Carbone surveys the board.
                                 CARBONE
                        You got me in a bad spot, man.

                                 KOBE
                        You think this is bad? Shit...

           EXT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, DAY

           There are two cars from the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office 
           and one from Vail PD in the parking lot. 

           They’re staking out the resort.

           INT. ROOM 35, NIGHT

           Kobe is sitting up in bed, watching game film on a portable 
           DVD player. He places a call. 

                                 KOBE
                        Hey, I wanna put in for room 
                        service. Really? It stopped at 
                        10:30? Come on, you can bend the 
                        rules for me... yes, thank you. 

           He pulls the menu off the nightstand. 

           EXT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, NIGHT

           More cars from the Eagle County Sheriff’s Office arrive. 
           Detective Winters and DETECTIVE LOYA, another big guy, 30s, 
           gel in his short, spiked hair, get out and engage Vail PD.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        No movement? He hasn’t left?  

                                 VAIL PD
                        He’s behind your fucking car.

           Sure enough, for some reason, Kobe is in the parking lot, on 
           his crutches, accompanied by Laster.  

           Winters and Loya seek them out.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Mr. Bryant- I’m Detective Winters 
                        from the ECSO.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Eagle County Sheriff’s Office. My 
                        name’s Loya. I’m a detective too. 
                                 KOBE
                        What’s going on, fellas? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        We wanted to discuss something from 
                        last night.

                                 KOBE
                        What do you mean? 

           Detective Loya has a tape recorder in his shirt pocket. He 
           activates it. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I don’t really wanna talk about it 
                        here. Can we go back to your room? 

           Kobe looks at them, unsure what’s going on, but agrees.

                                 KOBE
                        Yeah, come on.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                             (refers to Laster)
                        Who’s this gentleman here? 

                                 KOBE
                        One of my security guards. 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Do you mind if he stays with these 
                        officers here while we talk to you?

           Laster is siphoned off by the cops from the stakeout. 

           Kobe and the detectives proceed towards the hotel. They want 
           to delay any further conversation, but he presses them.

                                 KOBE
                        What’s this all about? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        We received a call earlier today 
                        with an allegation.

           Kobe stops and gathers his crutches.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Do you want me to hold those for 
                        you, or are you all right? 

                                 KOBE
                        Just tell me what this is.
                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        We took a report of a possible 
                        sexual assault allegation. So I 
                        wanna find out your side of the 
                        story.

                                 KOBE
                        Side of what story? What exactly 
                        are you talking about? 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Do you wanna have this conversation 
                        in front of everybody or do you 
                        wanna go into a room? 

                                 KOBE
                        This is my career.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        So where’s your room at? 

                                 KOBE
                        It’s all the way on the other side, 
                        man. I can’t walk there.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        We’ll just take it real slow.

           Kobe doesn’t move.

                                 KOBE
                        My biggest fear is my career, my 
                        image.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I understand. Very, very much so. 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        And this is how we work, Kobe. 
                        We’re not here to destroy your 
                        career or your image, but we do 
                        have a serious matter at hand we’d 
                        like to resolve. And it’s all gonna 
                        depend on your cooperation. 

                                 KOBE
                        Do I have to? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Well, that’s up to you. I mean we’d 
                        like to find out your side of the 
                        story. That’s all we wanna do.
                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Were you with a female party last 
                        night? 

                                 KOBE
                        A girl showed me around, yes. I 
                        think her name was ----. Something 
                        like that.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s what we’d like to talk 
                        about, okay? 

                                 KOBE
                        Her? Did she say I did something?

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I’ll be blunt. Did you have sexual 
                        intercourse with her? 

                                 KOBE
                        No.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay, Kobe, here’s what I’d like to 
                        do. There’s an allegation that 
                        unconsensual intercourse occurred 
                        last night, okay? 

           Kobe starts to protest.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Hang on, okay? Hang on. I 
                        understand you have every right to 
                        be upset, but I’m giving you an 
                        opportunity to tell the truth if 
                        something did happen. Because we’re 
                        gonna find out. 

                                 KOBE
                        Is there any way I can settle this? 
                        Whatever it is, I mean? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What do you mean by ‘settle’? 

                                 KOBE
                        If my wife found out that anybody 
                        made any type of allegations 
                        against me, she’d lose her shit. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I understand your concerns and 
                        frustrations, okay?

                        But what I need to talk to you 
                        about is this allegation. I need to 
                        find out if this actually happened. 
                        I mean it could have been a 
                        complete come-on. She could have 
                        led you on.

           Kobe’s temper flares.

                                 KOBE
                        But what if this scenario-

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Kobe, Kobe, Kobe. Calm down here a 
                        sec. Let me explain something to 
                        you. She’s consented to an exam. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        We’ve got physical evidence. 

                                 KOBE
                        But listen- 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Listen to me first, okay? Be 
                        straight up with me, Kobe. We’re 
                        not gonna tell your wife. Did you 
                        have sexual intercourse with her? 

                                 KOBE
                        That’s what I need to know, whether 
                        you’ll tell my wife, because I did 
                        have sexual intercourse with her.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Okay, was it consensual? 

                                 KOBE
                        It was totally consensual. 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        What makes you believe that?

                                 KOBE
                        Cause she started kissing me. Then 
                        she bent over- 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Did she tell you-

                                 KOBE
                        She got up to leave, and she gave 
                        me a kiss.

                                 KOBE (CONT'D)
                        So I kissed her back, and then I 
                        started caressing her, and then she 
                        put her hand on my thing or 
                        whatever, and it kinda went from 
                        there.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay, hear me out. It’s possible at 
                        some point she may have told you, 
                        ‘No, I don’t wanna do this.’ Maybe 
                        she did lead you on a little bit. 
                        She kissed you but then said, ‘No, 
                        I don’t want this to happen.’

                                 KOBE
                        If she said that I stopped. Nope. 
                        There was no semen, no nothing. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        How long did it go for? 

                                 KOBE
                        Five minutes maybe.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        During that time, did she ever say 
                        anything to you? Did she scream, 
                        ‘No, stop, I don’t wanna do this’? 

           Kobe hesitates.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What was she saying? 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        The best thing is to be straight 
                        up. That way we can resolve this. 

                                 KOBE
                        Okay, I’m thinking. I’m thinking.
                             (beat)
                        I’m trying to think of the 
                        conversation we had.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Did you ever have her from the back 
                        of her head or her neck? 

           Kobe demonstrates that he did. 

                                 KOBE
                        I had my right hand like this and 
                        my other hand like that. 
                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        How hard were you holding onto her? 

                                 KOBE
                        I don’t know. My hands are strong. 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Did you ever ask her if you could 
                        cum in her face? 

           Kobe is adamant.

                                 KOBE
                        Yes. That’s when she said no. 
                        That’s when she said no. 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Did you get any blood on you or 
                        anything like that? 

                                 KOBE
                        She didn’t bleed, did she? 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Yeah, she had a lot of bleeding. 

                                 KOBE
                        What? You gotta be kidding me. From 
                        where? 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        From her vaginal area.

                                 KOBE
                        Did she cut herself or something? 
                        There’s no blood on me whatsoever, 
                        man. Matter of fact, I still have 
                        the boxers. They’re all white. 
                        There’s nothing on them.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Is it okay if we take those?

                                 KOBE
                        Alright, can I ask you a question 
                        though? I do not want this to get 
                        to the media. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        We don’t either.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        That’s why we’re here so late.
           Finally, Kobe begins to move inside.

           INT. THE LODGE AND SPA AT CORDILLERA, CONTINUOUS

           Winters and Loya escort Kobe through the lobby. 

                                 KOBE
                        I can’t believe this girl. What 
                        does she want from me? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I don’t think she wants anything.

                                 KOBE
                        Are you kidding me? She has to have 
                        a motive to do this. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What do you think it is then? 

                                 KOBE
                        She must be trying to get money or 
                        something.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Are you willing to pay if she is? 

                                 KOBE
                        I got to. I got to. I’m in the 
                        worst fucking situation.
                        Whatever I need to do without 
                        making this thing public I will do, 
                        man. I don’t care what it is.

           They turn towards the elevators.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What kind of surgery did you have? 

                                 KOBE
                        Arthroscopic. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS

                                 KOBE
                        Cartilage.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        You gonna be ready for the season? 
                                 KOBE
                        I don’t know, man. I don’t even 
                        know if I’ll be able to play this 
                        season with this shit going on. If 
                        it becomes public I’ll lose my 
                        wife. All my endorsements...

           They call the elevator.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        How long have you been married? 

                                 KOBE
                        My wife and daughter, they mean 
                        everything, man. Everything. 

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Well, did you think about that 
                        beforehand?

                                 KOBE
                        It was consensual with this girl. 
                        There was nothing weird.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        I don’t mean to offend you in any 
                        way, but is this a habit of yours, 
                        that you cheat on your wife? 

                                 KOBE
                        Um, with one other person. And she 
                        could actually testify I do the 
                        same thing, the strangling thing.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Who’s this other person? 

                                 KOBE
                        Her name’s Michelle.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        The girl from last night has a 
                        bruise on her neck.

                                 KOBE
                        Yeah, I mean, me and Michelle, 
                        that’s what- we do the same thing. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        How many times did you have sex 
                        with Michelle? 

                                 KOBE
                        A lot. She’ll tell you the same.
                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Obviously, your wife doesn’t know 
                        about this.

                                 KOBE
                        No. Nothing, man. Seriously. 

           The elevator dings. Opens. They get in.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Would you be willing to take a 
                        polygraph examination? 

                                 KOBE
                        Oh, yeah. I’d do it. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        They’re inadmissible in court. But 
                        she’s willing to take one, and I’m 
                        just asking if you’d be.

                                 KOBE
                        Yes, I am.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        What do you think the results of 
                        those tests are gonna be? 

                                 KOBE
                        I don’t know. I’ve never taken one. 
                        I’m nervous right now. My hands are 
                        shaking.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Would you be willing to consent to 
                        a sexual assault examination kit?

                                 KOBE
                        I don’t believe this, man. 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I have a court order so it doesn’t 
                        matter whether you consent or not.

           Kobe is disconsolate.

           The elevator doors open. 

           Ortiz, who must have been notified by Laster as to what was 
           going on, is waiting outside room 35. 
                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Real quickly though, I’m gonna call 
                        down and have them bring some bags 
                        so we can collect evidence. 

           As he goes to his radio, Detective Loya engages Ortiz.

                                 DETECTIVE LOYA
                        Sorry to make this all an 
                        inconvenience for you guys.

                                 ORTIZ
                        You don’t even know.

           He’s right. No one could be prepared for the shitstorm 
           they’ve just unleashed. 

           EXT. FLATHEAD LAKE, DAY

           A cabin in Montana. A man pulls up on a motorcycle. Once he 
           takes off his helmet, we see that it’s Phil Jackson. 

           INT. CABIN, DAY

           Incense burns. Phil meditates. 

           Upon finishing, he puts out the incense. 

           Later, his phone rings. 

           INTERCUT: LAKERS PRACTICE FACILITY

           Mitch, on the line, in his office.

                                 MITCH
                        You’re not gonna believe this. 

                                 PHIL
                        Don’t make predictions, Mitch. 

                                 MITCH
                        A girl’s claiming Kobe raped her. 

                                 PHIL
                        Who?

                                 MITCH
                        In Colorado, where he went to get 
                        this fucking scope done without 
                        consulting us. From the hotel. 
                                 PHIL
                        I see.

                                 MITCH
                        What the fuck? Are you not shocked?

                                 PHIL
                        Not entirely. I’ve seen him 
                        consumed by anger plenty of times. 

                                 MITCH
                        This isn’t getting pissed off at 
                        you or his teammates. It’s a crime. 
                        Possibly. He hasn’t been charged 
                        yet, but he has a lawyer in-state, 
                        the same firm that represented 
                        JonBenet Ramsey’s parents. The 
                        train is leaving the station.

                                 PHIL
                        When will we know for sure? 

                                 MITCH
                        After the 4th, I’m told. So try to 
                        enjoy the fireworks.

                                 PHIL
                        I wonder how this affects Payton 
                        and Malone’s decision. Say Kobe 
                        misses significant time...

                                 MITCH
                        My sense is the players will be on 
                        his side, but there’s a lot we have 
                        to see about right now. 

                                 PHIL
                        I’ll call him.

                                 MITCH
                        Don’t press his buttons. Worry 
                        about the team.

           They hang up.

           INT. WHEELER & CLUNE, LLC, DAY

           ---- and her mom and dad meet with former Eagle County 
           prosecutor, JOHN CLUNE, 33, clean-shaven, thoughtful, fluffy 
           dark brown hair graying prematurely at the temples.
                                 MOM
                        People tell us the DA’s office only 
                        has so many resources. 

                                 CLUNE
                        Well, Eagle is a small county. 
                        Small even compared to an 
                        individual like Mr. Bryant.

                                 DAD
                        Point being, we understand this 
                        could get messy. 

                                 CLUNE
                        That’s a word I’d put at the low 
                        end of the scale. 

           ---- sees that the door is ajar. She gets up to close it. 

                                 CLUNE
                        ----, what do you think? 

                                 ----
                        What do you mean? 

                                 CLUNE
                        If I come on board to help with the 
                        case, I promise to do whatever I 
                        can to protect you. But we’re up 
                        against a very famous person with a 
                        lot of money and a lot of good will 
                        with the public. There are no 
                        guarantees.

                        He did this to me.

                                 CLUNE
                        Okay. Then we’ll fight.

           INT. KOBE'S HOUSE, MORNING

           A vaulted room stacked with memorabilia and trophies. Kobe, 
           cell phone to his ear, looks very small even at 6’6”. 

                                 KOBE
                        Fuck, man. Alright.

           He hangs up. A long moment of silence. He pulls a book off a 
           shelf. Their wedding album. 
           The photos, from two years ago, are somewhat sad. It was a 
           tiny wedding, 12 people, without his parents, sisters, or 
           teammates.

           Vanessa walks in. She stays at the other end of the room.

                                 VANESSA
                        I heard you on the phone.

                                 KOBE
                        Pamela called.

                                 VANESSA
                        Who the hell is Pamela? 

                                 KOBE
                        One of the lawyers.

                                 VANESSA
                        And? 

                                 KOBE
                        They issued a warrant. I gotta go 
                        to Colorado and turn myself in.

                                 VANESSA
                        To jail?!

                                 KOBE
                        There’s bail. 25-thousand. I’ll be 
                        home by tonight. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Am I asleep? Is this a nightmare?

                                 KOBE
                        Will you come with me? 

           She glares at him.

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, DAY

           Mitch is seated in between aging future hall of famers, 
           point guard GARY PAYTON, soon-to-be-35, and power forward 
           KARL MALONE, nearly 40. 

           A press conference.

                                 MITCH
                        I’d like to introduce to the city 
                        of Los Angeles, the newest Los 
                        Angeles Lakers, Gary Payton and 
                        Karl Malone. 
           Claps. Payton and Malone show off their jerseys.

                                 MALONE
                        I’m honored to be here... I realize 
                        this is Kobe and Shaq and Phil’s 
                        team...

                                 PAYTON
                        Me and Karl is just gonna come here 
                        to help get a championship...

           EXT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           Flags out front. Brown brick. It could be a high school 
           except for the sign that says “Eagle County Justice Center”. 

           And then there’s the media. 

           TV trucks. Abundant cameras. Reporters smashed together in 
           the parking lot, which is shared by the Sheriff's 
           Department, the DA's office and the courthouse. 

           A much different press conference. Boyish district attorney 
           MARK HURLBERT at a dais. 

                                 HURLBERT
                        Today I announce the filing of 
                        class three felony sexual assault 
                        charges against Kobe Bean Bryant. 
                        This decision did not come easily. 
                        But after a thorough review of the 
                        evidence, I strongly believe we can 
                        prove this case beyond a reasonable 
                        doubt. 

           Detective Winters is in the background, listening, along 
           with Clune and the other lawyers from the DA’s office.

                                 HURLBERT
                        If found guilty, Mr. Bryant faces 4 
                        years to life in prison or 20 years 
                        to life on probation with a fine of 
                        up to 750-thousand dollars.

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, DAY

           There are just as many media members here, out on the floor, 
           which is stripped down to concrete, as if the arena is set 
           for a concert. But it’s not. Another press conference.
           Kobe and Vanessa come out from behind a black curtain, 
           holding hands, and sit at a table. He’s rid himself of his 
           goatee and nearly shaved his head.

           Kobe gets the chair for his wife. After they sit, they clasp 
           hands up on top of the table where everyone can see.

           Defense attorney PAMELA MACKEY, early 40s, white, brunette, 
           wearing all black, sits by Vanessa. Next to Mackey is lawyer 
           HAL HADDON, a little older, glasses, sandy brown hair. 

           Mackey reads a statement. 

                                 MACKEY
                        Kobe Bryant is innocent of the 
                        charges that were filed against him 
                        today. He stands falsely accused of 
                        an extremely serious crime. Kobe 
                        Bryant did not assault his accuser. 
                        Kobe Bryant will plead not guilty. 
                        His defense is that what happened 
                        on June 30th in Eagle County was a 
                        sexual encounter between two 
                        consenting adults. We do not intend 
                        to try this case in the press. We 
                        are confident that a Colorado jury 
                        will find that Mr. Kobe Bryant is 
                        innocent. Thank you. 

           Kobe adjusts his mic. Vanessa rubs his hand. His face is 
           clenched. He keeps shaking his head. He appears enraged. 
           Eventually, he starts talking without a script. 

                                 KOBE
                        I’m innocent. I didn’t force her to 
                        do anything against her will. I’m 
                        innocent. I sit here in front of 
                        you guys furious at myself. 
                        Disgusted at myself for making a 
                        mistake of adultery. And I love my 
                        wife with all my heart. She’s my 
                        backbone. 
                             (to Vanessa)
                        You’re a blessing. You’re the beat 
                        to my heart. You’re the air I 
                        breathe. You’re the strongest 
                        person I know. And I’m so sorry 
                        having to put you through this, our 
                        family through this.

           She keeps rubbing his hand, hasn’t taken her eyes off him 
           till now. 
                                 KOBE
                        I’m a human being. I’m a man just 
                        like everybody else. I mourn. I 
                        cry. Just like everybody else. And 
                        I sit here before you guys, 
                        embarrassed and ashamed for 
                        committing adultery. 
                             (becoming more choked up)
                        You know, I go through the feeling 
                        if I could just turn back the hands 
                        of time. I love my wife so much. 
                        She’s so special to me. 
                             (turning defiant)
                        But I’m innocent. And together, my 
                        wife and I, and our family- we’re 
                        gonna fight these false 
                        accusations. We have a lot at stake- 
                        I have a lot at stake- and that has 
                        nothing to do with the game of 
                        basketball. It has nothing to do 
                        with endorsements. This is about 
                        us. This is about our family. We’re 
                        gonna fight this all the way to the 
                        end. I appreciate everybody out 
                        there for the support. We’re gonna 
                        need the support and prayers now 
                        more than ever. Thank you. 

           He gets up first then helps Vanessa off the stage.

           EXT. EAGLE, DAY

           A small town of ~3500 that has a Texaco parking lot as its 
           hub of teenage activity. A compact car pulls in, windows 
           decorated with white shoe polish: “Kobe is innocent!” 

           JANELLE MEDINA, 19, gets out. Boys cheer her.

                                 JANELLE
                        Go Lakers! Number 8! 

           She and the boys scribble the same slogan on the car of 
           LINDSEY MCKINNEY, 18, and everyone laughs.

           But then Janelle and the boys leave -- and Lindsey squeegees 
           off the shoe polish.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I definitely don’t think ---- was 
                        out to get anyone. Right now, it’s 
                        impossible to know what happened in 
                        that room. 
           She says this to a reporter, who scribbles in her notebook. 

           EXT. ----’S PARENTS' HOUSE, DAY

           In fact, the media has converged on Eagle. Reporters and TV 
           crew are gathered on a suburban street at a house that has 
           white shades in all the windows. 

           ----’s dad emerges on the front porch. Reporters swarm him 
           with questions. He deflects.

                                 DAD
                        Do you like my new screen door?

           But they want to know about the charges.

                                 DAD
                        You can’t say the DA hasn’t taken 
                        enough time to thoroughly analyze 
                        all of this. 

           He can’t discern one question from another. Too many.

                                 DAD
                        Hey, out-of-towners. You should 
                        drive down to Sylvan Lake over the 
                        weekend. It’s beautiful there. 

           He’s friendly, but he can only be out here so long before 
           being overwhelmed. He dives back inside, finds his wife. 

                                 MOM
                        Can she really stay here? 

                                 DAD
                        That’s why we hired John.

           They share a resigned, contemplative look.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The police disperse the crowd; they shut down the street. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER, NIGHT

           ----, wearing a ball cap, head down in the middle of a group 
           of friends, enters the theater playing Bad Boys II. 

           Inside, fellow ex-cheerleader, RACHEL YANDLE, blonde hair 
           parted down the middle, sits next to ----.
                                 RACHEL
                        Are you okay? 

                                 ----
                        I feel like I’m going to puke. 
                        Otherwise, super great.

                                 RACHEL
                        Was it the press conference?

                                 ----
                        I don’t know what I expected.

                                 RACHEL
                        Him crying on TV, holding his 
                        wife’s hand...  

                                 ----
                        It’s gross.

           The lights dim. ---- takes off her hat, shakes out her hair.

           INT. CABIN, NIGHT

           Phil places a call that rings through to voice mail.

                                 PHIL
                        Kobe, it’s Phil. I’m sure you’ve 
                        been inundated with calls. I’m in 
                        Montana for a while. Call whenever 
                        you can. 

           He hangs up. His adult daughter, ELIZABETH, is lounging, 
           messing with a fishing pole.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Dad, even if he ever responds, you 
                        have to say something publicly. 

                                 PHIL
                        Probably. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What’d you think of Mitch’s 
                        statement? 

                                 PHIL
                        I’m checked out. What’d it say?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Something like the allegations were 
                        out of character. Kobe is an asset 
                        to the team and the community.

                        The word ‘wonderful’ was in there. 
                        Then, of course, no further comment 
                        since it’s an ongoing legal matter.

                                 PHIL
                        The NBA must feel the same.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you think he’ll play this 
                        season? 

                                 PHIL
                        I do. 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        On top of all this he had, what, 
                        two surgeries? His shoulder then 
                        his knee?

                                 PHIL
                        He only knows how to compete.

           INT. TATTOO PARLOR, NIGHT

           The shop has been shut down for a private session. 

           Kobe, his bodyguards, and a TATTOO ARTIST. He’s getting his 
           very first tattoos. On his upper arm, “Vanessa”, with a 
           crown and two angel wings. Underneath “Psalm XVII”.

                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                        Psalm 17. Which one’s that? 

                                 KOBE
                        O Lord, hear my plea for justice. 
                        Listen to my cry for help. Pay 
                        attention to my prayer, for it 
                        comes from honest lips.

                                 TATTOO ARTIST
                        Tight.

           EXT. NEWPORT BEACH HOME, DAY

           Two blocks from Kobe’s house. Smaller but still big. A “for 
           sale” sign out front. And MOVERS -- which surprises the REAL 
           ESTATE AGENT, who just showed up to switch the sign from 
           “for sale” to “sold.” 

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Excuse me? When did you start? We 
                        weren’t closed until an hour ago.
                                 MOVER
                        55 minutes ago. Customer said we 
                        had to get here while she was still 
                        the buyer’s mother-in-law.

                                 REAL ESTATE AGENT
                        Do you know who the buyer is? 

                                 MOVER
                        Duh. Kobe Bryant.

           The agent just shakes her head, takes the sign altogether.

           INT. RAFINITY JEWELERS, DAY

           Kobe and Vanessa are inside a surprisingly quirky store. 
           They wait on owner/designer RAFFI to come out from the back.

           Bodyguard Laster is also here. No one seems particularly 
           happy until Raffi appears -- at which point they’re suddenly 
           all smiles. He’s got a ring box, quite excited.

                                 RAFFI
                        Mrs. Bryant...

           He opens the box. Inside is an 8-carat purple diamond ring 
           worth about $4M.

           She puts it on. And it’s like her husband doesn’t exist.

           INT. COLLEGE STUDENT HOUSE, NIGHT

           The home of University of Iowa student/sports fanatic JOHN 
           ROCHE, 22, who was drinking all day at a golf event. His 
           clubs are on the floor. He stumbles on them while he paces, 
           drinking more beer, ranting into a phone.

                                 ROCHE
                        You fucking slut! You goddamn 
                        whore! I’ll ram a coat hangar up 
                        your little cunt. Do you wanna 
                        die?! Do you have a death wish?! 

           He careens forward, nearly slamming into the wall, where 
           there’s a poster of Kobe doing a reverse jam.

           INT. ----’S PARENTS’ HOUSE, NIGHT

           The answering machine captures Roche’s rant. Dad, Mom, and 
           XXXX. Mom puts her hands over her daughter’s ears, but ---- 
           takes them off.
                                 ROCHE (V.O.)
                        Because I will fucking kill you! 
                        You stupid idiot. You’re dead!

           The machine bleeps off. 

                                 DAD
                        I’m calling the police.

           He exits into the kitchen. Mom talks to a shaken ----.

                                 MOM
                        John can monitor your phone and 
                        email. We’ll figure out somewhere 
                        safe for you to go. 

           EXT. MCKINNEY HOUSE, DAY

           Another house in Eagle County. A man in a suit rings the 
           doorbell. He’s a REP for The National Enquirer.

           Lindsey, the girl who erased the pro-Kobe shoe polish from 
           her car, answers the door.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Dude! I said no three times!

                                 NATIONAL ENQUIRER REP
                        $12,500. That’s our final offer.

           A beat.

                                 NATIONAL ENQUIRER REP
                        Look, you already told the paper in 
                        Orange County that she OD’d. People 
                        want to hear your thoughts.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I shouldn’t have said it.

           Her dad appears and shuts the door. The rep scratches his 
           beard, flummoxed. 

           INT. TODAY SHOW, MORNING

           ----’s friend Rachel has found her way onto the Today show.

                                 RACHEL
                        When she saw Kobe speak, she was 
                        really disgusted.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                        It just made her sick to her 
                        stomach, and she couldn’t believe 
                        he had the nerve to cry and just go 
                        by, holding his wife’s hand. 

           We skip ahead.

                                 RACHEL
                        I think she just knows it’s going 
                        to be a long process, and that they 
                        are going to try to find anything 
                        they can to use against her. 

           One more time.

                                 RACHEL
                        She’s not doing this for the 
                        attention or the money. She just 
                        wants to see a consequence and for 
                        him to be behind bars. She’s here 
                        for the justice. 

           INT. LARRY KING LIVE, NIGHT

           Law student JAMEIKA WILLIAMS is being interviewed by LARRY 
           KING. The chyron says that she met Kobe in 1997 and that 
           they briefly dated when she was 19 and he was 18.

                                 JAMEIKA
                        I couldn't believe that he could be 
                        charged with sexual assault. That’s 
                        not the Kobe Bryant I knew. He was 
                        always a calm, nice person- a 
                        family person. Never rough, never 
                        aggressive. It’s not his character.

           INT. MSNBC, NIGHT

           Now Rachel and CASEY STRICKLER, a bleached blonde friend of 
           XXXX’s, are in split-screen on The Abrams Report with Ivy 
           League law school grad, DAN ABRAMS, who looks the part.

                                 ABRAMS
                        Janelle Medina, a high school 
                        classmate says, ‘I’ve known her for 
                        eight years. I don’t believe she’s 
                        telling the truth.

                        anything it took to get famous, and 
                        I think this is just a publicity 
                        stunt for her, something for her to 
                        get money and for her to get fame.’ 
                        What do you make of that statement?

           Casey takes this one.

                        You know, Janelle didn’t go to 
                        school with us. And in this kind of 
                        situation, there are so many people 
                        who either pretend to be her best 
                        friend or they pretend that they 
                        know everything about her just 
                        because they want to talk. 

           INT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, NIGHT

           Clune watches the rest of The Abrams Report in a conference 
           room with lead prosecuting attorney INGRID BAKKE, mid-30s, 
           has the look of a tennis player from the 80s.

                        Rachel, finally, was anything 
                        happening in your friend’s life 
                        before all this happened that might 
                        provide some perspective as to 
                        where she was mentally?

                                 RACHEL
                        She was a little depressed because 
                        she lost one of her good friends a 
                        little less than a month ago. And 
                        her and her boyfriend broke up not 
                        too long ago also. So, she was 
                        already not doing very well. 

           Bakke weighs in.

                                 BAKKE
                        Who the hell needs enemies when you 
                        already have friends? 

           They’re pissed. Clune kills the program and turns his 
           attention to newspapers that are all over the table.
                                 CLUNE
                        So now it’s public that she 
                        attempted suicide in February and 
                        supposedly took too many over the 
                        counter pills as a cry for help in 
                        May. Plus, was depressed about her 
                        friend dying in a car accident. 

                                 BAKKE
                        And we’ve got these kids claiming 
                        she was at a party bragging about 
                        how hung Kobe was. 

                                 CLUNE
                        I could see her trying to deflect.

                                 BAKKE
                        Nobody’s even supposed to know who 
                        she is.

                                 CLUNE
                        Eagle is too small.

                                 BAKKE
                        What can we do?

                                 CLUNE
                        Make them stop. And I’m sending her 
                        out of the country.

           INT. ----'S PARENTS' HOUSE, DAY

           ----’s dad has the newspaper with a statement from Phil. 

           “For the past four years it has been my privilege to coach 
           Kobe Bryant. He has consistently demonstrated responsible 
           behavior to me... I was saddened by the allegations... As 
           his coach and mentor he has my full support. Kobe is 
           entitled to the presumption of innocence, a hallmark of our 
           legal system, and judgment must occur within the Colorado 
           courtrooms.” 

           Meanwhile, his wife is on the phone.

                                 MOM
                        Rachel, I know you’re trying to 
                        help, but we need you to stop 
                        talking to the media... No, I’m 
                        calling all her other friends, 
                        too... I realize, but her emotional 
                        struggles- they have nothing to do 
                        with what happened on June 30th.

                        It’s just catnip for reporters and 
                        ammo for the defense.

           EXT. UNIVERSAL AMPITHEATER, NIGHT

           The Teen Choice Awards. Kobe and Vanessa on the red carpet. 
           He’s got a platinum chain with a cross pendant and an Ali T-
           shirt. But the cameras are interested in one thing --

           Her new ring.

           INT. UNIVERSAL AMPITHEATER, NIGHT

           Kobe is given the award for Favorite Male Athlete. He walks 
           up on stage to a standing ovation. 

                                 KOBE
                        We’ve been flying through some dark 
                        clouds lately, but soon the sun is 
                        going to rise and shine again. As 
                        the great Dr. Martin Luther King, 
                        Jr. said, ‘Injustice anywhere is a 
                        threat to justice everywhere.’

           He raises the trophy. Thunderous applause.

           INT. BAR, NIGHT

           ---- is on “vacation” with a friend in Calgary. A guy buys 
           her a drink with Canadian dollars. He’s part of a group. 

           ---- and the guy dance together. The group watches them. 
           They start kissing. Some people from the group take photos.

           ---- takes a break, comes over. One of the girls from the 
           group, KYLIE ROBINSON, causes a scene.

                                 KYLIE
                        We got your picture, girl! We’re 
                        gonna get paaaaiiddddddd!

                                 ----
                        What?

           She’s upset.

                                 KYLIE
                        Why you gotta be so butt hurt? 

           The guy shows up and caresses ----’s back. She seems to go 
           to another place.
                                 ----
                        I should get the money not you.

           Kylie laughs. ---- joins her. But it feels like she’s doing 
           it just because she doesn’t know what else to do. 

           EXT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           Kobe, in a cream colored suit, enters the courthouse with 
           his lawyers, Hal Haddon and Pamela Mackey, at his side. 

           The media is a horde. There’s also a handful of fans 
           chanting his name. 

           INT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           Kobe stands in court in front of JUDGE GANNETT, 50s, 
           bearded, small glasses, shaggy hair. Mackey also stands.

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        The defendant has the right to hear 
                        the charges that have been leveled 
                        against him read aloud in court. 
                        Where do you stand on that?

                                 MACKEY
                        We waive the right, Your Honor.

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Acknowledged. Then on the question 
                        of a hearing to determine if 
                        there’s enough evidence to go to 
                        trial, the rule requires that if 
                        you request, it be held in 30 days. 
                        Any objection to that being voided? 

                                 KOBE
                        No, sir. 

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Then we’ll set it for October 9th.

           EXT. KOBE'S HOUSE, DAY

           Kobe is chauffeured home before sunset. 

           NIGHT

           We hear voices. Kobe and Vanessa arguing at an increasingly 
           loud and feverish pitch, the words indecipherable... 
           Until the front door slams open and Kobe storms out, 
           furious. Vanessa right behind him, stops in the doorway, 
           ready to shut it on his face.

                                 KOBE
                        Don’t do that. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Don’t do that. Me? You’re telling 
                        me not to do something?

                                 KOBE
                        I don’t have my keys.

           She shoves the door closed and double locks it. He bangs.

                                 KOBE
                        Vanessa! Let me the fuck in.

           She won’t. He backs away, makes a call.

                                 KOBE
                        Man, I need you to set me up 
                        somewhere. Tonight’s not fucking 
                        happening at home... Wherever. Some 
                        motel somewhere.

           EXT. LAKERS PRACTICE FACILITY, DAY

           Phil is back in LA. He parks a Mercedes outside.

           INT. VIDEO ROOM, DAY

           Phil watches tape of last season’s elimination game against 
           the Spurs with his basketball guru, 81-year-old TEX WINTER.

           Since it was a blowout, there’s not a lot to like.

                                 TEX
                        Forget two more years. Are you sure 
                        you don’t wanna quit right now? 

                                 PHIL
                        Now Todd’s negotiating with Dr. 
                        Buss. 

                                 TEX
                        Still negotiating? I could be dead 
                        by the time they finish.

                                 PHIL
                        You’re a young 81.
                                 TEX
                        Forget about me. What we need is 
                        Karl to be a young 40.

                                 PHIL
                        And Payton a young 35.

                                 TEX
                        And Kobe... how’s Kobe? 

                                 PHIL
                        Never returned my calls. But he’s 
                        supposedly coming in.

           INT. PRACTICE GYM, DAY

           He’s here, doing non-contact drills. We haven’t seen him 
           with a basketball since the playoffs. There’s a notable 
           difference. He’s gaunt. Slower. Less explosive. Weaker.

           Phil walks out onto the floor. 

                                 PHIL
                        Kobe.

           He waves him over. Kobe snarls a little. Keeps working.

                                 PHIL
                        Just a couple minutes. 

           Kobe doesn’t come right away. Phil heads to his office.

           INT. PHIL’S OFFICE, DAY

           Phil has been waiting at his desk. Kobe finally shows up. He 
           flips the chair around to sit facing the seat back. 

                                 PHIL
                        Did you get my phone calls? 

                                 KOBE
                        Yeah.

           Nothing else. Phil smiles in an effort to be congenial.

                                 PHIL
                        We really want you to survive this 
                        thing. Are you getting any help? Do 
                        you have anybody to talk to? 

                                 KOBE
                        No.
                                 PHIL
                        Kobe, you need someone to talk to. 

                                 KOBE
                        We have a priest.

                                 PHIL
                        Good. That’s a start. Talk to him.

                                 KOBE
                        What about the team? 

                                 PHIL
                        You want to talk to your teammates?

                                 KOBE
                        I mean the game. I wanna talk about 
                        my game.

                                 PHIL
                        There will be time for that.

                                 KOBE
                        I’m not gonna take any shit from 
                        Shaq this year. I’ve had it. I’m 
                        not afraid to go up against him.

                                 PHIL
                        We’ll watch what’s being said. I 
                        can tell you’re under a lot of 
                        stress. 

                                 KOBE
                        I’m fucking stressed? Okay.

           He stands up. Phil looks him in the eye. 

                                 PHIL
                        I’m hoping for the best with your 
                        situation. 

           Kobe looks him back. These two don’t trust each other.

           EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH, DAY

           A Ferrari idles outside. A physically fit PRIEST with a 
           laissez faire attitude comes out of the rectory. 

           He opens the Ferrari. Kobe is in the driver’s seat.

                                 PRIEST
                        We could go into the rectory, you 
                        know. It might actually be less 
                        conspicuous.

                                 KOBE
                        I gotta get home. I just- man, I 
                        thought I could use your advice. 

                                 PRIEST
                        What’s on your mind? 

                                 KOBE
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 PRIEST
                        It could be more than one thing. 
                        But I need to ask... did you do it? 

                                 KOBE
                        Of course not. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Is your lawyer good?  

                                 KOBE
                        Yeah, he’s phenomenal. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Then let it go. Move on. 

                                 KOBE
                        How? There are people who hate my 
                        guts, thinking I did something.

                                 PRIEST
                        What’s important? Who you are? Or 
                        who people think you are? 

                                 KOBE
                        Who I am. Of course.

                                 PRIEST
                        Then be who you are. God won’t give 
                        you anything you can’t handle.
                                 KOBE
                        So somehow this is, like, my 
                        destiny? Or fate?

                                 PRIEST
                        I heard a quote once. ‘I was born 
                        for the storm and a calm does not 
                        suit me.’

                        It’s in God’s hands now. Let it go.

                        The judge ruled that you don’t have 
                        to testify in the preliminary 
                        hearing. And your medical history 
                        can’t be used either.

                        That’s great. Isn’t it, sweetheart?

                                 CLUNE
                        That said, the defense typically 
                        waives this hearing altogether. The 
                        burden to go to trial is mostly a 
                        formality.

                        The media will be there. Likely, 
                        they want to keep building their 
                        case to the public. So you should 
                        be ready for anything.

                        Not to be alarming, but you’re 
                        still getting a lot of threats. 
                        Also, frankly, a number of 
                        solicitations. We’ll probably have 
                        to keep moving you around. Even to

           A media firestorm, flanked by Kobe fans. Someone holds a

                        ever appear confused or mixed up 
                        with the questions you were asking? 

           Judge Gannett asks for clarity.

                        By ‘she’ who are you referring to? 

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        The victim. I’m sorry.

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        The victim didn’t appear to be 
                        confused.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Are the victim’s initials X.X.? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes, those are.

           For the record the court allowed the victim’s initials to be 
           used, but we’ll keep them redacted here.

                        At that point, Deputy Rich and 
                        myself- well, we asked her if she’d 
                        showered in the meantime.

                        She stated she hadn’t, and we asked 
                        her if we could collect the 
                        clothing she was wearing that 
                        night. Which we did. 

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        And how did you obtain that? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Deputy Rich went upstairs with the 
                        victim and obtained a black dress, 
                        like a black coat that goes with 
                        it. It looks like a uniform type 
                        outfit. The dress was one piece. A 
                        bra, and underwear.

                        What did the Sexual Assault Nurse 
                        Examiner, or SANE nurse, tell you 
                        about the injuries she observed? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        She stated that there were several 
                        lacerations to the victim’s 
                        posterior Fourchette or vaginal 
                        area. And two of those lacerations 
                        were approximately one centimeter 
                        in length. And there were many, I 
                        believe, two millimeter 
                        lacerations, too many to count.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Did she describe what those 
                        lacerations were consistent of? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        She stated that the injuries were 
                        consistent with penetrating genital 
                        trauma. That it’s not consistent 
                        with consensual sex.

                        The victim’s vaginal area.

                        Who told you that?

                        Where’s the vagina? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I believe...

                                 MACKEY
                        You don’t know, do you, Detective? 

           Winters stumbles over his words.

                                 MACKEY
                        Which side is her tummy? On the top 
                        of the picture or the bottom of the 
                        picture? Or the side?

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        From this photo, I could guess, but 
                        I’m not quite sure.

                                 MACKEY
                        Judge, we’d object. This witness 
                        does not have sufficient knowledge 
                        about this photograph to have it 
                        entered into evidence through him. 

           Crittenden counters.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Judge, he can get sufficient 
                        knowledge through hearsay, which 
                        he’s already indicated. He has 
                        knowledge of it through the nurse.
                                 GANNETT
                        Though I must admit that it reduces 
                        its value if he doesn’t know very 
                        much about it. Anyway, it’s going 
                        to be admitted over objection.

                        Did the nurse indicate to you any 
                        other disclosures that the victim 
                        made regarding what had happened 
                        that night with Mr. Bryant during 
                        the SANE examination? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        The nurse stated one other thing 
                        that the victim didn’t tell me 
                        initially in my interview.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        And what was that? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        About performing oral sex on Mr. 
                        Bryant.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Did you later talk to the victim 
                        regarding this? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes, I did.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        And what did she tell you? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        She stated that right after sexual 
                        intercourse with Mr. Bryant, in her 
                        words, he wanted her to kiss his 
                        penis before she left. 

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Did she tell you what her response 
                        was to that? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        She stated no. 

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Did she tell you what he did after 
                        she said no to that? 
                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        She stated that he grabbed her and 
                        placed her in front of him down at 
                        his waist level, and pulled his 
                        penis out, and she kissed it. He 
                        made her kiss it. 

           MOMENTS LATER

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Did you submit the T-shirt that Mr. 
                        Bryant gave you that he indicated 
                        he was wearing on June 30th, 2003, 
                        when the sexual intercourse 
                        occurred, to the Colorado Bureau of 
                        Investigation? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I did. 

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        What did they find? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        On the inside of the T-shirt, on 
                        the front towards the bottom, they 
                        found what appeared to be blood 
                        excretions.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        And were sero- I can’t say it- 
                        serological exams conducted on the 
                        blood stains? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        They sampled the blood stains, yes. 

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        And what did they determine? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        They determined- well, they 
                        developed, according to the 
                        reports, a DNA profile that was 
                        consistent- or that is the same DNA 
                        profile as the victim in this case.

           Mackey goes in on cross-examination.
                                 MACKEY
                        Detective Winters, let’s begin with 
                        a discussion about X.X.’s injuries, 
                        shall we? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Okay.

                                 MACKEY
                        You heard this story that she tells 
                        about how Mr. Kobe Bryant grabbed 
                        her neck and choked her, right? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes, I did.

                                 MACKEY
                        And so being a detective, you 
                        immediately look at her neck, don’t 
                        you? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I did look at her neck for marks.

                                 MACKEY
                        Sure. You’re looking at her neck to 
                        see if there’s any physical 
                        evidence that supports and 
                        corroborates this story of choking? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes.

                                 MACKEY
                        And when you look, Detective, you 
                        didn’t see a single thing, did you? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Not from the front, no. 

                                 MACKEY
                        Now, you’re not the only one who 
                        examined ---- ----- on July 1st, 
                        2003, are you? You took her over to 
                        the- I’m sorry, you didn’t take 
                        her. She went over to the Valley 
                        View Hospital and was examined by 
                        nurses over there, correct? 

           Bakke angrily interjects. Mackey said the victim’s name.
                                 BAKKE
                        Judge, I’m going to object and ask 
                        the record be stricken regarding 
                        disclosure of the name.

                                 MACKEY
                        Oh, I’m sorry, Judge. I didn’t even 
                        know.

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Well, it shows all of us that some 
                        are awake and some aren’t. 
                             (beat)
                        The record will be stricken with 
                        regard to the identification of 
                        that name and-

                                 MACKEY
                        I’ll try, Judge.

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        And we’ll all need to try harder.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Crittenden stops Mackey.

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Objection. Calls for speculation. 

                                 MACKEY
                        Judge, I’ll rephrase.

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Do it. Thank you.

                                 MACKEY
                        They conducted an interview of Miss 
                        ----- where they also heard this 
                        story of choking, correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I believe so, yes. 

           The prosecution reacts. Now she used the victim’s last name.

                                 MACKEY
                        And so they’re examining her, and 
                        they also look at her neck, right? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I don’t know what part of the 
                        anatomy.
                                 MACKEY
                        Let’s just cut to the chase here, 
                        Detective. They don’t see any marks 
                        on ---- -----’s neck? 

           She “catches” herself using the victim’s full name after 
           stern looks from Judge Gannett and the prosecution.

                                 MACKEY
                        I’m sorry. I apologize, Judge. This 
                        is going to be very hard for me. I 
                        don’t think of her as X.X. It’s 
                        very hard. I-

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Let me suggest, rather than using 
                        the initials, choose another form. 
                        That can make the confusion perhaps-

                                 MACKEY
                        I will. Judge, I’ve never had to 
                        not call somebody by their name. 
                        It’s very difficult. I will try 
                        very hard. May I call her Miss F.? 

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        That would work with me.

           Winters reviews a document from discovery in a binder.

                                 MACKEY
                        And as you look at that diagram, 
                        you see that there is no indication 
                        made by the SANE nurse of any marks 
                        on Miss -----’s neck, correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Not on her neck. Just on the jaw 
                        line.

           But that’s not the point. She did it again.

           MOMENTS LATER

                                 MACKEY
                        Now, you never saw that bruise? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        No, I did not. 
                                 MACKEY
                        You sat with Miss ----- at her 
                        home, correct? 

           Judge Gannett interrupts.

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Again, I know it’s going to be 
                        tough for you, but-

                                 MACKEY
                        I’m trying, Judge. I’m trying. Let 
                        me write myself a big note. 

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Or I could just go get the muzzle.

                                 MACKEY
                        Yeah, the muzzle would be good.

           MOMENTS LATER

                                 MACKEY
                        And they also look at the rectum, 
                        anal opening, right? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes.

                                 MACKEY
                        And that’s the one where they say, 
                        quote, ‘no trauma noted’? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s correct.

                                 MACKEY
                        And in fact that’s what you would 
                        expect based on the story that the 
                        accuser told you, right? She never 
                        claims anything other than vaginal 
                        sex, correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s correct.

                                 MACKEY
                        Now, they do see some- and I want 
                        to quote this specifically so I get 
                        it correct- multiple small, shallow 
                        pinpoint lacerations, approximately 
                        one to two millimeters in length on 
                        the posterior Fourchette, correct? 
                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        I’m assuming that the area that the 
                        arrow is coming from is the 
                        posterior Fourchette, then that’s 
                        correct, yes. 

                                 MACKEY
                        And that area is between the 
                        vaginal opening and the anal 
                        opening on a woman’s body, correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        It appears so, yes. 

                                 MACKEY
                        Now, these injuries, as we’ve been 
                        calling them- no one told you 
                        they’d need medical attention, 
                        correct?  

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        No one told me that. 

                                 MACKEY
                        I think what you testified on 
                        direct was that what you see there 
                        is consistent with ‘penetrating 
                        genital trauma,’ correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s correct.

                                 MACKEY
                        Now, you don’t have any expertise 
                        to make that conclusion, correct? 
                        You have to rely on what the nurse 
                        told you? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s correct. They’re trained in 
                        that so...

                                 MACKEY
                        And she told you that it was not 
                        consistent with consensual sex, 
                        right? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        She stated that it- these types of 
                        injuries you wouldn’t see in 
                        consensual type encounters. 
                                 MACKEY
                        And she said that the injuries were 
                        recent, but she couldn’t tell you 
                        how recent? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s correct. 

                                 MACKEY
                        Now, when you rely on that opinion, 
                        that it was consistent with 
                        penetrating genital trauma, did you 
                        ask her if it was also consistent 
                        with a person who had had sex with 
                        three different men in three days? 

           The prosecutors rise in unison, shouting objections.

                                 BAKKE
                        Judge, objection!

                                 CRITTENDEN
                        Judge, yeah. I’m going to object as 
                        to beyond the scope, no foundation, 
                        and relevance at this point. And 
                        this also- it goes past the limited 
                        need for this hearing. 

           Judge Gannett is furious.

                                 JUDGE GANNETT
                        Well, what I intend to do right now 
                        is to move us back into the next 
                        room. Empty this courtroom. We’re 
                        going to need at least a week.

           He gavels. The hearing abruptly ends. 

           INT. WHEELER & CLUNE, LLC, DAY

           ----’s parents are in the lobby with heavy heads.

           Their daughter is behind closed doors with Clune and Bakke, 
           who have been asking a lot of questions.

                                 ----
                        I told him no. 

                                 CLUNE
                        We agree. This case is only about 
                        what happened in that room.
                                 BAKKE
                        The defense overstepped. 

                                 CLUNE
                        Which is why Judge Gannett reacted 
                        how he did. But they did it for a 
                        reason.

                                 ----
                        To say, what, I’m not a virgin? So 
                        I can’t be raped?

                                 CLUNE
                        It’s vile, and it’s wrong. But 
                        there’s a perception.

                                 CLUNE
                        Say we were to end up in a 
                        compromised position, where things 
                        looked really dire. Is there an 
                        alternative to him being convicted 
                        that would satisfy you?

                        For instance, issuing an apology in 
                        exchange for you dropping out.

           ---- can’t believe this. But there’s also a part of her that 
           would cherish the relief of everything being over.

                                 BAKKE
                        It’s not something we’d push for.

                                 CLUNE
                        But to think about. Just in case.

           And we’re back. So are the media and the Kobe fans. 

           SUPER: “Preliminary Hearing, Day Two”
           INT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           All the same players. Kobe, in a brown suit without a tie. 
           Mackey cross-examines Winters. Today, she’s even-handed.

                                 MACKEY
                        Detective Winters, on July 1st, 
                        2003, when you interviewed the 
                        accuser, you asked her when she 
                        last had consensual sex. And she 
                        told you, ‘About three days ago,’ 
                        correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes.

                                 MACKEY
                        And she told you that during that 
                        sexual encounter a condom was used, 
                        correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s correct.

                                 MACKEY
                        Later on July 1st, 2003, the 
                        accuser goes to a hospital in 
                        Glenwood Springs for a sexual 
                        assault examination, correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes. 

                                 MACKEY
                        And at that time she’s wearing some 
                        yellow knit panties, correct?

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        From what I was told.

                                 MACKEY
                        And you submitted both of those 
                        panties, the ones that you 
                        collected earlier in the afternoon, 
                        as well as the yellow knit panties, 
                        to the C.B.I. for forensic 
                        evaluation, correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        Yes.
                                 MACKEY
                        And the semen and sperm found in 
                        the yellow panties collected at the 
                        hospital from the accuser did not 
                        match the DNA profile of Mr. 
                        Bryant, correct? 

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        In the yellow panties, that’s 
                        correct.

                                 MACKEY
                        Stated another way, the accuser 
                        arrived at the hospital wearing 
                        panties with someone else’s semen 
                        and sperm in them, not that of Mr. 
                        Bryant, correct?

                                 DETECTIVE WINTERS
                        That’s correct.

           Things are wrapping up inside. Reporter #1 and #2 exit the 
           courthouse and join the rest of the media, which await a 
           press conference. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Now we get why his lawyers didn’t 
                        waive the hearing. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Everything he said to the cops 
                        stays sealed. While she gets aired 
                        out for sleeping around.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        They’re gonna claim she had sex 
                        with someone after Kobe, right? But 
                        before the rape exam? That’s what 
                        Mackey was getting at wasn’t she? 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        My sense too.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        But how do we know she wasn’t out 
                        of her head, traumatized, and just 
                        grabbed some dirty panties?

           DA Hurlbert has started his press conference.
                                 HURLBERT
                        The evidence that Kobe Bryant 
                        committed sexual assault is strong. 
                        I’m confident in the prosecution 
                        and our witnesses. 

           The reporters look at each other. Not a lot of people in the 
           crowd agree.

                                 HURLBERT
                        Judge Gannett will rule correctly 
                        and send this case to trial.

                        Is there a fucking ball on this

                        I think there’s one outside.

           He mocks opening the emergency exit.

                                 KOBE
                        I’m serious. Is there a fucking

                        Actually, there might be. 

           He goes into the carry-on compartment in the back.

                                 ORTIZ
                        Why the hell do you need a ball?

                                 ORTIZ
                        Always haters.

                                 KOBE
                        There are people who don’t think I 
                        can handle the pressure. Think I 
                        should take the season off. 

                                 ORTIZ

                        Fuck him. I heard from opponents- I 
                        heard from C-Webb- before I heard 
                        anything from him. 

                                 ORTIZ
                        But what’s with the basketball?

           Carbone returns. He’s got a basketball, alright. A Nerf. 

                                 CARBONE
                        My kid gave it to me as a keepsake.

           Kobe laughs, takes the ball.

                                 KOBE
                        It’s for a mental exercise. One man 
                        with a basketball, one man without. 

                                 CARBONE
                        Who are you without it?  

                                 KOBE
                        I’m Kobe Bryant. 

                                 ORTIZ
                        Then who are you with it?  

                                 KOBE
                        A motherfucker who destroys 
                        everyone.

                                 CARBONE
                        This guy got a name? 

                                 KOBE

                        He thinks you should stay here for 
                        a while. Not so bad, right? 

           INT. LAKERS PRACTICE FACILITY, DAY

           Kobe goes hard, beating up the assistant coach charged with 
           defending him in the post.

           Phil and Mitch observe. Mitch is pensive.

                                 PHIL
                        Suddenly his knee looks good. 

           Mitch nods, makes a sound.

                                 PHIL
                        What?

                                 MITCH
                        I talked to Pelinka. He still wants 
                        to opt out of his contract at the 
                        end of the season. 

                                 PHIL
                        I suppose the organization hasn’t 
                        been supportive enough. Not 
                        covering all of his travel expenses 
                        back and forth to Colorado, only a 
                        percentage...

           Sarcasm.

                                 MITCH
                        He wanted a better private jet.
                             (off Phil’s look)
                        That’s not why he’s opting out. I’m 
                        just complaining. About him 
                        complaining.

                                 PHIL
                        Dr. Buss could always let him walk.

                                 MITCH
                        He’s a superstar in his prime, 
                        Phil. He’ll sell season tickets and 
                        jerseys for the next ten years.

           Now it’s Phil’s turn to grumble.
                                 MITCH
                        What? 

                                 PHIL
                        He may be facing life in prison.

                                 MITCH
                        Stop. 

           Kobe puts his shoulder into the assistant coach, knocks his 
           jaw back, and blows past him on the way to a vicious dunk.

                                 MITCH
                        What’d I say about our court being 
                        his refuge from the other one?

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           MIKE TYSON is in the crowd holding two signs that say “Free 
           Kobe” in different fonts. 

           Pre-game. The Lakers players form a circle on the floor.

           Without Kobe.

           INT. PLAYERS LOUNGE, NIGHT

           He’s in the back, watching on TV. A female STAFF MEMBER who 
           doesn’t speak a lot of English stops arranging food and 
           drinks to point at the screen.

                                 STAFF MEMBER
                        You? No?

                                 KOBE
                        Nah, man. Knee needs more rest.

           Wouldn’t keep him from joining the team on the bench but...

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           End of the third quarter. Kobe walks through the tunnel, out 
           to the sideline. Fans shouting support from the stands.

           After he sits on the bench, he’s shown on the Jumbotron.

           He receives a huge ovation. Almost like he planned it.
           INT. AMERICA WEST ARENA, NIGHT

           In Phoenix. Lakers versus Suns. Kobe is playing in this 
           game. Not shooting well but getting to the free throw line.

           But away from home the atmosphere is different. He’s booed 
           nearly every time he touches the ball. 

           Scoreboard. The Lakers win 103-99.

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Pregame intros. The arena is dark. The PA ANNOUNCER says --

                                 PA ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        At guard, number 8, Kobe Bryant!

           Kobe runs out onto the floor, slapping hands with teammates. 
           The cheers are deafening.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT

           Kobe in the scrum with reporters. The stat sheet says he had 
           21 points, and the Lakers beat the Warriors 87-72.

                                 KOBE
                        It doesn’t really help my game 
                        much, but playing at Staples Center 
                        makes me feel more comfortable.

           LATER

           He and Vanessa leave the arena holding hands. 

           EXT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           Back in court. Today, besides the media, there are about a 
           dozen people rallying in support of the victim.

           SUPER: “Procedural Hearing”

           INT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           Kobe stands with his attorneys. The prosecution, opposite.

           The judge who will preside over the trial, TERRY RUCKRIEGLE, 
           50s, feathered brown hair parted down the middle, glasses, 
           loves his job, enters the court.  
                                 JUDGE RUCKRIEGLE
                        Good morning, everyone. Get 
                        comfortable, sit.

           The courtroom obliges.

                                 JUDGE RUCKRIEGLE
                        As most of you know, this hearing 
                        has been arranged for the defendant 
                        to submit a plea if he so desires, 
                        as well as scheduling...

           The rest is irrelevant. It’s all scheduling ephemera. More 
           noteworthy --

           ----’s parents are seated in the first row behind Kobe.

           There is no love lost.

           EXT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           Press conferences. First, prosecution spokeswoman KRISTA 
           FLANAGAN. Crittenden, Bakke, and Hurlbert at her side.

                                 FLANAGAN
                        The family thought it was important 
                        for people to realize that there 
                        really is a victim in this case. 
                        They wanted to show their support.

           Then Mackey --

                                 MACKEY
                        We have decided to follow usual 
                        procedure and not enter a plea as 
                        of today. I fully advised my client 
                        of the charge against him.

           ROBIN FINEGAN, one of the people we saw supporting the 
           victim outside the courthouse, from a victims’ assistance 
           group, is next. She’s with reporters off to the side.

                                 FINEGAN
                        We are here to remind everyone to 
                        treat this sexual assault case as 
                        the serious crime that it is rather 
                        than as fodder for entertainment.
           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, NIGHT

           Then, almost seamlessly, we’re with Kobe, swarmed by 
           reporters in the visitor’s locker room in New York. The 
           Lakers are about to play the Knicks. The reporters are here.

                                 REPORTER #1 
                        How do you stay focused through all 
                        the distractions? 

                                 KOBE
                        Faith. I have my good days and bad 
                        days, you know what I mean? If I 
                        just have faith, God will carry me 
                        through.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Kobe, has your approach to life 
                        changed? 

                                 KOBE
                        Yeah. When you go through something 
                        like I’m going through... everybody 
                        in this room has something they’re 
                        going through. Everybody has their 
                        breaking point. And I’ve been 
                        there. And it brings you closer to 
                        God. 

                                 THIRD REPORTER
                        When you reach your breaking point 
                        is it because of things that happen 
                        on or off the court? 

                                 KOBE
                        People talking about my family. 
                        They have nothing to do with my 
                        situation. Dragging them into it 
                        and saying false things about them. 
                        That really pisses me off. 

           The session ends. Reporter #1 and #2 have a moment.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Sounded like his opening statement.

           INT. WHEELER & CLUNE, LLC, DAY

           Dad and Mom are in with Clune. They pass around a subpoena. 

                                 MOM
                        What do they think I can tell them?
                                 CLUNE
                        Well, they’re trying to get her 
                        medical records from the facility 
                        the police took her to in February. 
                        I presume they want to use you to 
                        say, ‘Look, she told her mom she 
                        attempted suicide. She gave up her 
                        privacy rights.’

                                 DAD
                        That’s ridiculous. It’s absurd.

                                 MOM
                        I’m her mother. 

                                 CLUNE
                        We can fight it. But we don’t have 
                        to decide right now. Don’t worry. 

           He opens his briefcase.

                                 CLUNE
                        The other issue isn’t yours but-

           He tosses them a T-shirt. On the front is a drawing of a 
           hanged stick figure, like the game where you try to guess a 
           word or phrase, with TEES.COM filling in the blanks.

                                 CLUNE
                        The company that makes these gave a 
                        couple to the sheriff’s office. 
                        Then some folks tried to order more 
                        as a ‘souvenir’.

           Dad and Mom flip the shirt over. On this side, the number 8 
           is sandwiched between “I’m not a rapist” and “I’m just a 
           cheater” with Kobe’s name partially filling in a set of 
           blanks (the O E and the A are missing). 

                                 CLUNE
                        The optics, especially since it can 
                        be construed as a reference to 
                        lynching, are not... well, I’ll 
                        just say it- they’re atrocious.

           A beat.

                                 CLUNE
                        His lawyers are exceptional. You 
                        get what you pay for.
           INT. STAPLES CENTER, DAY

           Lakers shootaround. They’re prepping for a game against 
           Denver tonight. Some light shooting. Phil and the coaches 
           outlining opponent specifics for offense and defense. 

           No sign of Kobe.

           INT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           Because he’s in court. 

           There are also witnesses set to be called. Lindsey McKinney,

           Mackey addresses Judge Ruckriegle. 

                                 MACKEY
                        My client stands accused of a very 
                        serious crime. There is lots of 
                        history about black men being 
                        falsely accused of this crime by 
                        white women. I urge you to focus on 
                        the specifics of this case, not the 
                        political agenda of the rape crisis 
                        center. 

           Bakke counters. 

                                 BAKKE
                        Judge, we acknowledge your need to 
                        determine if the victim’s medical 
                        history and sexual past should be 
                        allowed as evidence in the trial. 
                        All we’re asking is they not be 
                        discussed in an open hearing, for 
                        the media and everyone in the world 
                        to hear, before that determination 
                        is made. It’s a simple ask.

                                 JUDGE RUCKRIEGLE
                        I’ll grant you that. Let’s retreat 
                        to chambers.

           The attorneys move to the back. Kobe along with them. He 
           looks at his watch.

           EXT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           It’s early but fans are starting to arrive for the game.

           Judge Ruckriegle and the attorneys return to court.

                                 JUDGE RUCKRIEGLE
                        Okay, here’s what we’re going to 
                        do. All witnesses for today are 
                        dismissed. I’m siding with the 
                        prosecution- further evidentiary 
                        hearings on this matter will be 
                        sealed. 

           He gavels. A setback for the defense. But it barely 
           registers with Kobe. He can’t get out of here fast enough.

                        Denying the accuser’s sexual past 
                        and mental health history would 
                        violate Mr. Bryant’s constitutional

                        and modus operandi for falsely 
                        accusing Mr. Bryant of sexual 
                        assault. 

           Next, it’s Bakke’s turn.

                                 BAKKE
                        Our position isn’t only about this 
                        case. Presenting the victim’s 
                        personal history in front of a 
                        national media audience will 
                        discourage other sexual assault 
                        victims from coming forward. The 
                        defense wants to embark on a 
                        humiliating and embarrassing 
                        fishing expedition. It’s unfair and 
                        unjust. Why would anyone want to be 
                        put through this? 

           Mackey again.

                                 MACKEY
                        Grossly, the prosecution wants you 
                        to believe that the only relevant 
                        time period in this case is when 
                        Mr. Bryant and his accuser were 
                        alone in his hotel room.

                        We vehemently disagree. And I 
                        strongly believe that in the end 
                        the court will side with us. 
                        Justly.

           EXT. VAIL, EAGLE COUNTY REGIONAL AIRPORT, NIGHT

           Kobe hustles onto a private jet, accompanied by bodyguards.

           INT. PRIVATE JET, NIGHT

           Kobe, holding the Nerf basketball, mentally dialing in.

           EXT. LAX, NIGHT

           Kobe et al moving from the private jet to a waiting van. As 
           he passes the driver he says --

                                 KOBE
                        Tip off’s in 25. Let’s fucking go.

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Seats filling. Intros starting. Getting closer to tipoff.

           INT. VAN, NIGHT

           On the way to the arena. In heavy traffic. 

           Kobe is in the back -- riding an exercise bike.

           The van has been specially outfitted. He’s pedaling to get 
           his legs warm for the game. 

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Which has started. Lakers versus Nuggets. It’s halfway 
           through the first quarter.

           EXT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           The van pulls into the players’ parking lot. Kobe gets out, 
           doesn’t bother closing the door, jogs into the arena.
           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           The second quarter is about to begin. Kobe hustles through 
           the tunnel then walks to the bench. Fans noticing, reactions 
           rolling through the arena.

                                 PHIL
                        How’s your mindset?

                                 KOBE
                        Let me play.

           Phil puts him in the game.

           The crowd erupts.

           He immediately starts pressing, desperate to show everyone 
           that being in court earlier hasn’t affected him.

           LATER

           Down the stretch, Kobe misses a series of shots, allowing 
           the Nuggets to tie the game at 99 with 2.5 seconds left in 
           the 4th quarter.

           The Lakers have the ball. Phil calls timeout. 

           He and the players huddle. He draws a play on a whiteboard.

                                 PHIL
                        We’ll run Starburst for Gary.

           Kobe not thrilled about this. He wants the fucking shot.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The Lakers run the play from out of bounds, but Payton 
           doesn’t get free. 

           The ball goes to Kobe.

           He drills a 20-foot jump shot as time expires. 

           Lakers win.

           The arena explodes. 

           LATER

           In the locker room with reporters --
                                 KOBE
                        I haven’t hit a game winner in a 
                        while. I had a good feeling about 
                        it.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Did you leave for Eagle this 
                        morning or fly in last night? 

                                 KOBE
                        Up at 4:30am. Yeah. It’s been a 
                        long day. That’s life. You just 
                        have to struggle along with it. 

           INT. WHEELER & CLUNE, LLC, DAY

           Bakke, in with Clune and a new attorney from the county, 
           DANA EASTER, strong build, early 40s. Speakerphone is on. 
           Everyone’s stressed.

                        Dana and I have a long history 
                        working together. DA Hurlbert added 
                        her on for extra support. 

           INTERCUT: FLORIDA APARTMENT

           ----, on the other end of the line, pacing. Impatient. 

                                 ----
                        Well, what’s the crappy news? 

                                 BAKKE
                        We’re going to need you to testify 
                        about your sexual history in an 
                        evidentiary hearing. 

                                 ----
                        Okay.
                                 BAKKE
                        It’s just for the judge to 
                        determine if it will be admissible 
                        at trial. Everything you say will 
                        be sealed. No one will find out.

                                 ----
                        It’s fine. I’ll be fine. What else? 

           The lawyers all look at each other. She’s more confident 
           than them.

           INT. LAKERS PRACTICE FACILITY, DAY

           The players walk out for practice. Phil finds Kobe.

                                 PHIL
                        How’s your knee? You up for doing 
                        some running? 

                                 KOBE
                        Sure. Soon as I finish treatment.

           Phil happily nods. Kobe proceeds into the back.

           LATER

           The team is practicing. Phil oversees. But he’s distracted 
           by Kobe, who enters from the locker room and sits on the 
           sideline with an ice pack on his shoulder.

           Looks like he has no intention of running after all. 

           LATER

           Practice ends. Phil gets to Kobe before he can leave.

                                 PHIL
                        You lied to me about running. Why?

                                 KOBE
                        I was being sarcastic.

                                 PHIL
                        Wrong answer. You need to treat me 
                        with respect, not sarcasm.

           He walks away. Kobe curses him in the background. Phil 
           becomes incensed but keeps walking. 
           INT. MITCH'S OFFICE, MOMENTS LATER

           He storms in on Mitch. 

                                 PHIL
                        I won’t coach this team next year 
                        if Kobe is still here. I’ve had it. 
                        He won’t listen to anyone. 

           Mitch is silent.

                                 PHIL
                        Are you listening to me? 

                                 MITCH
                        Dr. Buss wants to put negotiations 
                        for your contract extension on hold 
                        until after the season.

                                 PHIL
                        I’m shocked.

           He isn’t. He turns and walks out, slams the door. 

           EXT. KOBE'S HOUSE, DAY

           Another screaming match. Vanessa, coming in and out of the 
           house, throwing Kobe’s clothes into the street.

                                 VANESSA
                        Take your shit and go! Just leave!

                                 KOBE
                        My car’s at the fucking shop!

           She throws his stuff faster than he can pick it up. 

                                 VANESSA
                        Is that my problem?! 

                                 KOBE
                        I’ve got a fucking game tonight!

                                 VANESSA
                        Basketball. Like basketball’s so 
                        important. 

                                 KOBE
                        It bought you all this.

                                 VANESSA
                        It bought you all this shit, too!
           She keeps throwing.

                                 KOBE
                        All I got is my bike. I can’t put 
                        this shit in there.

           She goes inside, slams the door. Kobe looks around at all 
           the stuff...

                                 KOBE
                        What the fuck do I do with this? 

           No idea. He walks to the garage.

           EXT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Kobe arrives on a motorcycle. Walking into the arena, he 
           looks like he’d rather be anywhere but here. 

           A security guard says what’s up? Kobe doesn’t respond. He’s 
           disassociated from his environment.

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Lakers versus Orlando. First half. Kobe is listless. He 
           misses every shot he takes. Tracy McGrady, the Magic’s best 
           player, is showing him up. 

           We hear the Lakers TV crew, PAUL SUNDERLAND and STU LANTZ. 

                                 SUNDERLAND (V.O.)
                        What a play by McGrady. The Lakers 
                        need more from Kobe tonight if they 
                        expect to stand a chance.

                                 LANTZ (V.O.)
                        All those heretics who claim that T-
                        Mac is better will use this half as 
                        exhibit A, that’s for sure.

           Kobe gets to the foul line. He goes 1-2.

           He finishes the half with one point.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM, NIGHT

           Halftime. Kobe has made his own corner in the locker room. 
           Guys are looking at him strangely. He’s in some kind of 
           zone, talking to himself.
                                 KOBE
                        You may lose everything in life 
                        because of the situation you put 
                        yourself in. You may lose your 
                        family, your freedom... but you 
                        won’t lose fucking basketball. You 
                        can control this shit. Remember the 
                        priest. Remember two selves. I’m 
                        gonna take these motherfuckers out. 

           He gets up, finds Phil. 

                                 KOBE
                        Let me guard McGrady.

                                 PHIL
                        We need your offense. No. You’ll 
                        wear out.

           Phil leaves before Kobe can argue. Kobe seethes.

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Third quarter. McGrady dominates again. 

           At the timeout between quarters, Phil finds Kobe.

                                 PHIL
                        Okay. Take him. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           The fourth quarter. Kobe is a beast. He locks down McGrady 
           on defense. He gets bucket after bucket on offense. 

                                 SUNDERLAND (V.O.)
                        An incredible drive and finish by 
                        Kobe. He now has 22 points in the 
                        4th quarter alone.

                                 LANTZ (V.O.)
                        The Tracy McGrady fans aren’t so 
                        loud now, are they, Paul? 

           Kobe makes another two pointer...

           The Lakers pull ahead in overtime and win 113-110. 

           EXT. KOBE'S HOUSE, NIGHT

           Kobe returns on his motorcycle. 
           His clothes are still in the street. 

                                 KOBE
                        Jesus Christ.

           He picks everything up, piles it in the garage then drives. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER, NIGHT

           Kobe watches Kill Bill, Vol. 2. The scene with Michael 
           Madsen and DARYL HANNAH in the trailer. He opens a briefcase 
           full of money -- and gets attacked by a snake. 

                                 DARYL HANNAH
                        Budd, I’d like to introduce my 
                        friend, the Black Mamba. You know, 
                        before I picked that little fella 
                        up, I looked him up on the 
                        internet. Listen to this. In 
                        Africa, the saying goes, ‘In the 
                        bush, an elephant can kill you, a 
                        leopard can kill you, and a Black 
                        Mamba can kill you. But only with 
                        the Mamba is death sure. Hence it’s 
                        handle- death incarnate. Pretty 
                        cool, huh?

           Kobe is enthralled. This resonates with him.

           EXT. LAX, DAWN

           The bodyguards guide Kobe and his trainer towards the jet.

                                 KOBE

                        We were on this fucking plane, 
                        remember? With your kid’s Nerf, 
                        Carbone? When I’m not Kobe.

                                 CARBONE

           The usual circus, except we’re away from it, somewhere 
           different. A fire exit at the back of the building.

           She slips inside, joined by her parents and attorneys. But 
           media are in the hallway. The sides converge.

           She walks, calm and composed, ignoring their questions on 
           her way into the courtroom --

           Which is then closed.

           Kobe.

           The first time they’ve seen each other since the incident. 

           He looks at her like a defender trying to stop him from 
           getting to the rim.

           She gives it right back.

           ----, her parents, and her lawyers break from the courthouse

                        You were great. Really. If we had a

           EXT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Fans flow towards the entrances. Many wear Kobe’s jersey. 
           The highest energy we’ve seen in this setting so far.

           SUPER: “2004 NBA Finals, Game One”

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           The Lakers are pitted against the Detroit Pistons. We hear 
           announcers AL MICHAELS and DOC RIVERS.

                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        The Pistons are the rare team to 
                        play for a championship without a 
                        superstar player. 

                                 RIVERS (V.O.)
                        And the Lakers have four future 
                        hall of famers, Al. 

                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        The prognosticators don’t expect 
                        Detroit to put up much of a fight. 
                        But in sport, you have to run it 
                        through.

           Now the game is in motion. Detroit’s defense is stifling. 
           Tayshaun Prince guards Kobe. 

           He scores 25 points but needs an inefficient 25 shots.

           And the Lakers lose 87-75.

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           Game 2. The Lakers are down 3. The ball comes to Kobe. He 
           attacks Rip Hamilton and takes a deep three pointer, four 
           feet beyond the arc, with 2.1 seconds left to tie the game. 

           The Lakers pull away in overtime.
                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        Suddenly, the Pistons and that 
                        suffocating defense can’t stop LA.

           Scoreboard: Lakers 99, Pistons 91.

           EXT. THE PALACE OF AUBURN HILLS, NIGHT

           The arena in suburban Detroit.

           INT. THE PALACE OF AUBURN HILLS, NIGHT

           This game is all Kobe. He dominates the ball but either 
           can’t get his shot, takes an inefficient one, or misses.

                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        Boy, Bryant is really struggling 
                        tonight, isn’t he, Doc? 

                                 RIVERS (V.O.)
                        The Pistons are doing a tremendous 
                        job showing him multiple bodies, 
                        forcing him into a crowd. 

           Kobe’s angst grows. Phil gets him off the floor.

                                 PHIL
                        Take a break.

           Kobe walks to the bench, seething.

           Scoreboard: Detroit 88, Los Angeles 68.

                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        And there it is. Detroit goes up 2-
                        1 in the series with games 4 and 5 
                        here at home.

           INT. THE PALACE OF AUBURN HILLS, NIGHT

           Kobe responds to his terrible game 3 by taking too many 
           shots, 14 in the first half, even while Tayshaun Prince 
           blankets him. 

                                 RIVERS (V.O.)
                        Kobe can get caught at times trying 
                        to do it all when really he needs 
                        to rely on his teammates.
                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        Well, if this continues, the 
                        underdog Pistons are going to be  
                        one win away from a championship. 

           Kobe keeps firing, finishing the game 8-25, a god awful 32%. 

           And the Lakers lose 88-80.

           Worse, Malone limps off the court while Kobe complains to 
           Phil about Prince.

                                 KOBE
                        How can the refs let this fucking 
                        guy get to my arm on every fucking 
                        shot? 

                                 PHIL
                        You pledged to run the offense.

                                 KOBE
                        Prince hits me every fucking time.

           They go through the tunnel into the locker room.

           INT. HOTEL, NIGHT

           One of the banquet rooms. The Lakers have arranged a dinner 
           for the team and all the staff that travels with them. 

           Phil’s eating with Tex and the coaches when Dr. Buss walks 
           over from... let’s just call it an “eclectic” table. As in 
           Hawaii, there are very young women.

                                 DR. BUSS 
                        I think the weight of this whole 
                        ordeal has finally caught up to our 
                        young man. 

                                 PHIL
                        Maybe you’re right. 

           He eyes Kobe, who’s sharing a table with Malone. Nobody is 
           in a good place.

           INT. THE PALACE OF AUBURN HILLS, NIGHT

           Game 5. Malone is on the bench in street clothes. The score 
           is 98-72 in favor of Detroit.
                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        Of all the crazy things in this 
                        series, could you have ever figured 
                        the Lakers would need a near 
                        miracle to win the only game they 
                        win, and Detroit would end up in 
                        triple figures in a blowout in the 
                        deciding game?

           Kobe angrily misses shots, 14 total, going 7-21. 

                                 RIVERS (V.O.)
                        What I love though, when they 
                        signed Gary Payton and Karl Malone, 
                        everybody assumed they’d just won a 
                        title. If you’re a team sport guy, 
                        it gives every kid in the world a 
                        message. No matter who’s on your 
                        team, you still have to earn it. 

           The clock ticks. Kobe goes to the bench, resigned to defeat.

                                 MICHAELS (V.O.)
                        The Detroit Pistons have just 
                        shocked the Los Angeles Lakers, 100-
                        87, to win the NBA title. 

           Detroit celebrates. And Kobe leaves the court. The one thing 
           he thought he could control having fallen completely apart.

           INT. KOBE’S HOUSE, DAY

           Kobe looks at a framed jersey from his first game as a pro.

           Vanessa watches from the hall. He looks vulnerable, pensive. 

           Eventually, she comes into the memorabilia room.

                                 VANESSA

                        Yeah. But it doesn’t matter. Either 
                        way it’ll be the same outcome.

                                 PHIL
                        Would my being with the Lakers or 
                        retiring have any influence on you 
                        re-signing with the team?

           Kobe stands. Phil speaks to him.

                                 PHIL
                        A lot has transpired in the past

           INT. EAGLE COUNTY JUSTICE CENTER, DAY

           An exhausted and overwhelmed COURT CLERK is putting together 
           press releases for media outlets. 

           She attaches a batch of files to an email and presses send. 

           As it leaves her outbox she notices that one of the files is 
           labeled “Sealed DNA Transcript”.

                                 COURT CLERK
                        Oh no.

           She tries to X out the email, but it’s too late. 
           INT. LA TIMES, DAY

           The email lands in the inbox of a PR ASSISTANT at the paper. 
           She reviews the email, looks at the attachments curiously.

                                 PR ASSISTANT
                        Sealed transcript? 

           She opens it and hits print.

           LATER

           Reporter #1 has the document on his desk. He’s on the phone. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        So there’s our answer. Or am I not 
                        reading it right? 

           INTERCUT: REPORTER #2’S OFFICE

           At a different newspaper, also reading the document. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        You are. I think that’s what the 
                        defense’s DNA expert said today.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        That the semen samples on her and 
                        her underwear originated after the 
                        encounter with Kobe.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        So he allegedly raped her. Then she 
                        had sex with another guy. Then she 
                        went to the police, had the medical 
                        exam. All within, like, half a day?

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Which means her injuries could’ve 
                        been caused by this other partner. 
                        That’s reasonable doubt.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        ‘Who reacts to getting raped by 
                        sleeping with somebody else?’ The 
                        defense will argue that too. On top 
                        of everything. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        So long as the judge rules her 
                        sexual history admissible at trial. 
                                 REPORTER #2
                        He has to now. There’s no choice. 

                                 REPORTER #1
                        In the meantime, these transcripts 
                        are gonna leak online, and she’ll 
                        be smeared all over the world.
                             (beat)
                        Kobe’s gonna get off, isn’t he? 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Did you ever have any doubt? 
                        Whether he’s guilty or not- did you 
                        ever? 

           For him, it’s rhetorical. For his buddy, a hardening truth.

                        It feels unbelievable to be in Los 
                        Angeles playing for the Lakers the

                        chance to finish my career here.

           A question from the media.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Kobe, do you have any comment on 
                        reports that you played a role in 
                        Shaq and Phil no longer being here?

                                 KOBE
                        That angers me. That hurts me. They 
                        did what they had to do. That had 
                        nothing to do with me. In a perfect 
                        world, we would have all come back 
                        and won another championship.

           Another question.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Mitch, how did the risk of the 
                        trial factor into your decision to 
                        make this deal- or did it? 

                                 MITCH
                        If there is any risk, it was a risk 
                        we were willing to take.

                        With evidentiary hearings on the 
                        matter now exhausted, I’m inclined 
                        to side with the defense- that the 
                        alleged victim’s sexual activities 
                        in the 72 hours before she was 
                        medically examined hold significant 
                        bearing on this case. Therefore, I 
                        rule all activities in those 72 
                        hours admissible for trial.

                        Do you remember my idea about 
                        securing an apology from Kobe? What 
                        if I worked on that now? What if I 
                        used a back channel to the defense? 

           ---- is thinking.

                                 EASTER
                        We would stay on track for the 
                        trial in case it didn’t work out.

                                 ----
                        Only if he admits I didn’t make 
                        this up. Or do it for money. I’d 
                        want him to say he understands why 
                        I told the police.
                                 CLUNE
                        I think that’s smart. We can set 
                        the rules.

           He’s optimistic. But ---- is distant.

                        I can handle the trial. 

           She’s trying to convince herself as much as them.

           Clune sits in a conference room with junior defense 
           attorney, TERENCE O’CONNOR, who’s very fixated on the pen 
           he’s rolling between his fingers. 

                                 CLUNE
                        Get Pam and Hal to get Kobe to sign 
                        a formal apology, and I’ll get my 
                        client to withdraw from testifying 
                        against him.

                                 O’CONNOR
                        But what would the apology say? 

                                 CLUNE
                        She has three stipulations. 

           O’Connor finally looks away from his pen at Clune.
                                 O’CONNOR
                        I’ll come back.

           LATER

           Clune, waiting, nearly at the end of his rope, when O’Connor 
           returns and slides a notepad across the table.

           Clune reads it. He isn’t happy.

                                 CLUNE
                        This is an apology for what she’s 
                        been through, not his behavior. 

                                 O’CONNOR
                        Take it to your client. 

                                 CLUNE
                        Do you think she’s bluffing?

           O’Connor shakes his head no. 

                                 MACKEY
                        Unbelievable. 

                                 HADDON
                        I’ll call Clune. 

                                 MACKEY
                        To say what? I’ll open his client’s 
                        soul at trial?

                                 HADDON
                        Let them draft the statement she 
                        wants. So we have it in our pocket.  
                        Then if the deal falls apart our 
                        hands are clean. We can say we were 
                        never interested in an apology.

                                 MACKEY
                        I can’t believe she’s going to put 
                        herself through this. I don’t 
                        believe it.

                        Pam, she went to the police 13 
                        hours after the incident. She’s not 
                        shy. Do we really want to risk 
                        prolonging this ordeal if we don’t 
                        have to? When there’s a civil case 
                        to worry about too?

           INT. JEFFERSON COUNTY COURTHOUSE, DAY

           The prosecution has borrowed an unused courtroom to run a 
           mock cross-examination of ----. A male lawyer acts as a 
           STAND-IN for Mackey.

                        Alright, let’s start now.

           He looks at his watch then glares at ----.

           The courtroom is silent.
           Bakke and Easter observe along with Clune and Wood. The 
           latter are quietly engaged.

                                 CLUNE
                        I’m not bringing it up to her.

                                 WOOD
                        No. Hal getting involved means 
                        they’re serious. Don’t dismiss it. 

                                 CLUNE
                        She went through hell making this 
                        decision to testify. She’s set. I’m 
                        not playing games over an apology 
                        unless something drastic happens. 

           The Mackey stand-in looks back at his watch. A minute has 
           passed. He accosts ----.

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        You’re still kissing him. You 
                        kissed him for four more minutes.

                                 ----
                        That’s too long. We didn’t kiss 
                        that long. 

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        Well, you said five minutes. Did 
                        you lie to the police?

                                 ----
                        Maybe it was three minutes. Or two.

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        So you did lie to Detective 
                        Winters. Why?

                                 ----
                        I didn’t. It’s- hard to remember. 

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        Is it also ‘hard to remember’ if 
                        you ever clearly told the defendant 
                        no on the night of June 30th, 2003?

                                 ----
                        No I said it. I said no.

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        But based on what we just heard, 
                        miss, you could change your mind in 
                        the future, couldn’t you?
                                 ----
                        I wouldn’t do that.

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        You ‘wouldn’t do that.’ Let me ask. 
                        Is it also ‘hard to remember’ the 
                        number of sexual partners you had 
                        the week of June 30th, 2003? 

           This one hits her. She fumbles it. All stress.

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        We’ll come back to that. Is it also 
                        ‘hard to remember’ the number of 
                        pills you took when you attempted 
                        suicide on February 25th, 2003? 

                                 ----
                        ...I mean. Yes...

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        Would you describe yourself as 
                        unstable, miss? 

           She can’t speak.

                                 MACKEY STAND-IN
                        Please answer the question. 

           She crumbles. 

           Finally, after everything, her breaking point. 

           Her attorneys are unsettled. Wood leans in to Clune.

                                 WOOD
                        For chrissakes, is this drastic 
                        enough?

           MOMENTS LATER

           We’re close on ----. So close that we can’t even tell where 
           she is. But we know one thing. She’s been steamrolled.

           It seeps in. Then we hear Clune.

                        this year has been incredibly 
                        difficult for me personally, I can 
                        only imagine the pain she has had 
                        to endure.

                        I also want to make it clear that I 
                        do not question the motives of this 
                        young woman. No money has been paid 
                        to this woman. She has agreed that 
                        this statement will not be used 
                        against me in a civil case. 
                        Although I truly believe this 
                        encounter between us was 
                        consensual, I recognize now that 
                        she did not and does not view this 
                        incident the same way I did. After 
                        months of reviewing discovery, 
                        listening to her attorney, and even 
                        her testimony in person, I now 
                        understand how she feels that she 
                        did not consent to this encounter. 

           The song ends. The lights on her CD player flash. It’s 
           switching discs. She reaches for a college course book on 
           the end table and opens it.

           Kobe, alone in the gym, competing with unbridled intensity 
           against imaginary defenders.

                                 MACKEY (V.O.)
                        I issue this statement today fully 
                        aware that while one part of this 
                        case ends today, another remains. I 
                        understand that the civil case 
                        against me will go forward. That 
                        part of this case will be decided 
                        by and between the parties directly 
                        involved in the incident and will 
                        no longer be a financial or 
                        emotional drain on the citizens of 
                        the state of Colorado.

           Kobe executes a spectacular reverse dunk.

           EXT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           We’re back where we started, at “Kobeland”, the festival to 
           celebrate Kobe’s career as a Laker. 
           We track inside the arena with fans on a date, wearing 
           matching Nike T-shirts.

           “Forever Mamba
           Forever Legend” 

           INT. STAPLES CENTER, NIGHT

           It’s halftime but everyone is in their seats. 

           Kobe, now 39, in a perfect suit, walks out onto the court. 

           The cheers are deafening. He responds to the adoration with 
           prayer hands. We’ve never seen him smile this much.

           Dr. Buss’s daughter, JEANIE, now the controlling owner and 
           CEO of the team, speaks to the crowd.

                                 JEANIE
                        Thank you, Kobe. You taught us what 
                        happens when you out-work fear with 
                        a relentless Mamba mentality, 
                        teaching us that failure is a 
                        nonexistent concept. You have 
                        forever made your mark on this 
                        franchise. Your legacy is much 
                        greater than basketball. 

           Jeanie is tearful. Kobe comforts her. Booming cheers are the 
           bridge to the PA Announcer.

                                 PA ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        The time has come, Lakers fans. 
                        Please direct your attention up to 
                        the southeast corner of the arena, 
                        where number 8 and number 24 will 
                        hang forever, as we honor one of 
                        our Laker greats, Kobe Bryant. 

           Kobe looks up at the rafters as a pair of screens draw down, 
           revealing two jerseys, 8 and 24, with “Bryant” on the back. 

           He puts his hand on his heart. The fans chant his name. He 
           takes the mic.

                                 KOBE
                        Thank you so much for tonight. I 
                        love you. Mamba out. 

           Then he drops the mic and we

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
