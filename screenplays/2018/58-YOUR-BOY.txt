           INT. LONG ISLAND RAILROAD TRAIN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Punch. Punch. The sound of a railway ticket-puncher. Punch.

           On this train from Penn Station, we see a typical crowd of 
           COMMUTERS: a hockey fan in an Islanders jersey; a lady whose 
           shirt insists she loves New York; a teen flossing his teeth.

                                 ELECTRONIC TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENT
                        The next station is: Huntington!

           Close on PRESTON HOLLIS: 21, black, shy. That’s his stop.

                                 PRESTON
                        Sorry, sir? Do you mind if I, um --

           Preston is stuck between a window and a SNORING BUSINESSMAN, 
           wearing a plus-sized suit and noise-canceling headphones.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Sorry? Excuse me, sir? Pardon me?

           Nada. Rather than disturb this white man’s dreams, Preston 
           tries to climb over to the empty seat in front of him. Nope. 
           His leather sneaker gets caught in the overhead storage rack.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON STATION PLATFORM - MINUTES LATER

           Thud. Now off the train, Preston plops down two bags: a black 
           suitcase reading PBH III and a duffel with the UPenn crest.

           Preston’s tight polo and fitted jeans reveal he works on his 
           body. Even still, his handsome eyes lack confidence as he 
           nervously takes out his iPhone to make a casual call:

                                 PRESTON
                        Hey man, I’m here. You close?
                             (pause)
                        No worries. How late...?

           EXT. HUNTINGTON POST OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Cut to JAKE LAPORTE: 20, mixed-race, and in a hurry. On this 
           humid June day, sweat drips from his Haitian-American-Jewish 
           Afro to his BUSTA RHYMES concert t-shirt to his baggy shorts.

           Though Jake is too overweight to run quickly, his sprint is 
           slowed further by flip-flops and an open Mountain Dew bottle. 
           Drink SPLASHES all over this suburban strip mall parking lot.

                                 JAKE
                        Fuck! Pour one out for this soda...
           Jake arrives at the glass door of his local post office. He 
           pulls the door, pushes it, pulls. It’s locked. Fuck.

           Then, through the glass, Jake sees a USPS GUY closing up. 
           Jake knocks, waves. The white employee mouths, “Closed!”

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, it’s not my fault! There are 
                        road closures today! Plus the line 
                        at Wetzel’s Pretzels was mad long!

           INT. TRAIN STATION BATHROOM - SOME MOMENTS LATER

           Still waiting for his ride, Preston enters a filthy public 
           bathroom. There’s toilet paper in the urinal. A diaper in the 
           toilet. Over an ad for City University of New York, graffiti 
           has revised its message to read CHOOSE C.U.N.Y-lingus.

           But Preston has only come there for the mirror. He stares at 
           himself -- deep breath -- and starts to rehearse something:

                                 PRESTON
                        Hey, man. There’s, um, something 
                        I’ve been meaning to tell you...

           EXT. POST OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Jake continues pleading with the USPS guy through the glass.

                                 JAKE
                        I can’t just get it tomorrow! My 
                        friend P.B. is back today, and I 
                        haven’t seen him in two birthdays!

                                 USPS GUY
                        Oh, in that case? Still don’t care.

                                 JAKE
                        C’mon. Don’t you still have a best 
                        friend from childhood? A homie 
                        since straight-up kindergarten?

                                 USPS GUY
                        Nobody still has a best friend from 
                        kindergarten. Straight-up go away.

           INT. TRAIN STATION BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Back to Preston, still rehearsing to himself:
                                 PRESTON
                        Turned out there’s no non-awkward 
                        way to text this. Tried with that 
                        dance lady emoji, but...no. So, now 
                        that we’re both back, I need you to 
                        know...that, um...I’m gay.

           EXT. POST OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Back to Jake, now holding his iPhone up to the glass door as 
           the Marvelettes song “Please Mr. Postman” plays:

                                 THE MARVELETTES (WAILING) (O.S.)
                        Please Mr. Postman! Whoa, yeah...!
                        Ple-hease, Mr. Po-oh-oh-ost-man...!

           Jake makes a cry-baby face as the song plays. The USPS guy, 
           beyond pissed off, inserts earplugs.

           INT. TRAIN STATION BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Back to Preston, still rehearsing in the mirror. We CUT among 
           different ways he’s practicing coming out.

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m gay, Jake. 
                             (CUT, playing it cool)
                        Yeah, I’m gay! It’s like, whatever!
                             (CUT, somber)
                        This doesn’t have to change things 
                        between us...
                             (CUT, Jamaican accent)
                        Jay-kab! Ya best friend be sexually 
                        attracted to uddah men, mohn!

           EXT. POST OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Back to Jake in the USPS door, trying a more dramatic tactic.

                                 JAKE
                        Then don’t do it for me! Do it for 
                        your soul! Surely you wish to be 
                        more than what others see...

                                 USPS GUY
                        This can’t be serious.

                                 JAKE
                        To prove you’re more than the 
                        bitchy post office guy. Don’t we 
                        all want that? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAKE (CONT'D)
                        For in the words of African-
                        American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois: 
                        “It is a peculiar sensation, this 
                        double-consciousness. One ever 
                        feels his two-ness -- ”

                                 USPS GUY
                             (interrupts, rolling eyes)
                        Oh, sweet Christ. Get your damn 
                        package. Just, please stop talking.

           The USPS employee comes to unlock the door. Jake grins.

                                 JAKE
                             (smug, to himself)
                        Bore ‘em with Du Bois! Every time.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON TRAIN STATION - EARLY EVENING

           Now in the parking lot, Preston waits with his bags. He looks 
           at his gold watch, uncomfortably patient like always.

           Finally, Jake’s hand-me-down HATCHBACK CAR screeches up, 
           parking sloppily between two lined spots. Jake rushes out and 
           doesn’t miss a beat in taking charge of their greeting.

                                 JAKE
                        Don’t hate me, don’t hate me, don’t 
                        hate me! Lanes were closed and --

           Jake shuts up, stunned. He takes a full look at Preston, who 
           knows why Jake is surprised. Preston’s bashful about it.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me! And when in the past 
                        year and a half did your body get 
                        all Dannon Oikos non-fat-Greek?

                                 PRESTON
                        Shut up. You’ve seen me lately.

                                 JAKE
                        Only on FaceTime! You been calorie 
                        counting, Jenny-Craig-Robinson?

                                 PRESTON
                        You know how dining hall food is.

                                 JAKE
                        Yes. Delicious. Always. Well, I 
                        guess this may not fit now, but...
           Jake holds out his USPS PACKAGE, which he’s just wrapped 
           poorly on-the-go in PAPER SCRAPS and DUCT TAPE.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Happy 21st. Sorry it’s four months 
                        late and wrapped in my mom’s Jewish 
                        community newsletter.

                                 PRESTON
                             (reading wrapping paper)
                        “18 Tips for a Kosher Menopause.” 
                        You really know me so well.

                                 JAKE
                        Fuck off. Just open it.

           Preston opens the gift: a SWEATSHIRT printed with the poster 
           of 1990s Fox sitcom LIVING SINGLE. Queen Latifah and its five 
           other black stars stand together, wacky smiles and all.

                                 PRESTON
                        Hold up! You got me a Living Single 
                        custom sweatshirt?

                                 JAKE
                        Your favorite ‘90s sitcom-slash-
                        Queen-Latifah-vehicle! I lost a 
                        bidding war on eBay but convinced 
                        the vendor to make a second one.

           Preston now unzips and reaches into his duffle bag.

                                 PRESTON
                        Well, I know you don’t turn 21 for 
                        another month. But just so you know 
                        I wasn’t jacking your ideas...

           Preston pulls out an IMPECCABLY-WRAPPED PACKAGE from his bag.

                                 JAKE
                        No. This isn’t. Is this...?

           Jake opens his gift: the exact same LIVING SINGLE sweatshirt. 

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        MY favorite ‘90s sitcom-slash-Queen-
                        Latifah-vehicle!

           Jake, overwhelmed, gives Preston a big hug. Through their 
           embrace, Jake smiles. Preston still looks panicked.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I missed you, motherfucker.
                                 PRESTON
                        Missed you too, motherfucker.

           INT. JAKE’S CAR - MINUTES LATER

           Jake and Preston are driving away from the station.

                                 JAKE
                        So. I ran into Adam J. when I got 
                        back, and he’s having an end-of-
                        Junior-year party tonight. Nah 
                        worries, I invited both of us.

                                 PRESTON
                        You want to see that crew? They’re 
                        still always such dicks to us.

                                 JAKE
                        Our best other friends? Sure, they 
                        make the occasional fat joke...

                                 PRESTON
                        They called us “Tweedle Dee and 
                        Tweedle Double-Dee.” They called us 
                        “Dunka and Roo.” They called us 
                        “Boyz Ate Men.”

                                 JAKE
                        Regardless! Since when do we turn 
                        down a party where there might be 
                        actual girls in attendance?

                                 PRESTON
                        I just...thought we could maybe 
                        catch up tonight. One-on-one.

                                 JAKE
                        Catch up? We FaceTime all the 
                        FaceTime. C’mon! I don’t have a 
                        summer job yet. This could be my 
                        season to get recruited...
                             (mock sexy voice)
                        ...for love.

           Preston shakes his head, annoyed with Jake’s joke, and with 
           Jake’s typical ability to persuade him to go along.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE PARTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A Pitbull song blasts as Jake struts excitedly into the house 
           party. Preston, a case of beer in hand, follows tensely.
           The party is just okay. There’s a beer pong table. Some kids 
           smoking weed. Around a coffee table, three scrawny-yet-cocky 
           white bros hold court. These are ADAM, FINN and NATHANIEL.

                                 JAKE
                        What’s good, amigos?

                                 ADAM
                        Oh shit! LaPorte actually showed 
                        up! Hey yo, Dunka -- where’s Roo?

           Preston, already hating this night, gives a friendly wave.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        Wait wait. Is that P.B. Hollis?! 
                        Dude, you got jacked! Did daddy pay 
                        for steroids?

           The bros laugh, high-five. Preston folds his arms, trying to 
           casually cover biceps. Jake stands up straighter.

                                 PRESTON
                        Nah, just started lifting I guess.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        Started lifting now? Varsity try-
                        outs were six years ago, bro.

                                 FINN
                        “Pubey Holl-ass and Drake LaPork.” 
                        Two of the only black kids in 
                        school. Too fat to play basketball.

                                 ADAM
                        You mean one-and-a-half black kids. 
                        Even if Jake’s double the weight.

           Jake’s smile fades. ALYSSA KAPLAN, a confidently pretty, 
           zaftig classmate, clocks this and approaches the group.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Don’t be dicks. These guys brought 
                        alcohol, right? So...let’s party.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE PARTY - A BIT LATER

           Jake and Preston drink by themselves, observing the crowd.

                                 JAKE
                        You hear the way Alyssa Kaplan was 
                        all, “Let’s party?” Felt like there 
                        were hella romantic undertones, no?
                                 PRESTON
                        A sonnet, really. You’re not still 
                        mad she ditched you before prom?

                                 JAKE
                        She had a dormant tapeworm. Shit’s 
                        unrequited! Let’s talk to her.

           He waves Alyssa over. She’s with ERIN JIMENEZ, a beautiful 
           Latina classmate. Erin talks right to Preston. He’s startled.

                                 ERIN
                        Hey you!

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh! Hi. Preston...

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah! P.B. Hollis! And I’m --

                                 PRESTON
                        Erin Jimenez. I know. Sorry, just 
                        surprised you know my name.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Hollis, I feel like nobody’s seen 
                        you in years.

                                 JAKE
                             (inserting himself)
                        Yeah, well he was abroad in Paris, 
                        last summer and fall. My dude was 
                        studying that French-ass language.

                                 PRESTON
                        French.

                                 ERIN
                        That’s amazing! And what are you up 
                        to this summer?

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m, uh, doing an internship for 
                        this app called RickShaw?

                                 ALYSSA
                        RickShaw? Shit! I use that all the 
                        time. You in Manhattan for that?

                                 JAKE
                        Yep. In an apartment his pops owns. 
                        With a dope pull-out I’ll be party-
                        crashing on pretty much all summer.
           Preston looks annoyed by basically everything Jake is saying.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Sounds nice. I’m stuck at home all 
                        summer, working on my art thesis.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh! Cool, I’m here too, basically. 
                        Yeah. Still figuring out what kind 
                        of internship I want to choose.

                                 ERIN
                        Isn’t it kinda late to be figuring 
                        that out? Like...it’s summer.

           Silence as Jake tries to figure out how to spin this. Then, 
           from the dining room, a bro cries out.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        We need four more for flip-cup!

                                 ERIN
                        We’re in!

           Erin pulls Preston’s arm and runs into the other room. Jake 
           and Alyssa look at each other, shrug, and follow.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE PARTY: DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Round one of flip-cup has just ended. The team on Jake’s side 
           of the long table CHEERS. He and Alyssa high-five.

                                 ERIN
                        Okay, best of three! Alyssa and I 
                        are up first this time. P.B. and 
                        Jake, you guys finish. Match up!

           Players on each side line up, holding beer cups to match with 
           opponents. Jake looks across at Preston and gestures a glance 
           to Alyssa and Erin. He’s excited for their prospects tonight.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Up...down...up...DRINK!

           Alyssa and Erin CHUG their beers and start trying to flip the 
           empty cups. Alyssa FLIPS hers successfully, on the first try.

                                 JAKE
                        Yes Kaplan! Show ‘em how we used to 
                        do in mothafuckin’ Hebrew School!

           Alyssa laughs, both with and at Jake. Erin LANDS her cup.
           As the game continues, Jake and Alyssa’s team struggles, 
           while Preston and Erin's keep making cups. As the line loops 
           back to Preston, he has plenty of time to land the final one.

                                 ERIN
                        Let’s go, Hollis! You got this!

           Despite the encouragement, Preston MISSES. Again. And again.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, Hollis! Just relax!

           The rest of his teammates aren’t so patient. They shout their 
           frustration at Preston as he keeps missing. 

           Meanwhile, the other team catches up, leaving the final two 
           cups down to Jake and Preston. Jake versus Preston.

                                 ALYSSA
                        C’mon, Jake!

           Yep. With one try, Jake LANDS his cup. Fists go up. His team 
           CHEERS. Alyssa reaches up for two high-fives.

                                 ALYSSA (CONT’D)
                        Yes! L’goddamn-CHAIM, bitch!

           Jake is loving this attention. Preston, meanwhile, is hating 
           himself. So are his teammates, such as Finn, who shoves him.

                                 FINN
                        You flip like a woman, Hollis.

                                 ERIN
                        Don’t listen to them! It’s a dumb 
                        game. And I’m tired of beer anyway.

           From the table, Erin pours herself gin. Then, as she grabs 
           orange juice to mix, somebody BUMPS into her. Juice SPILLS 
           all over Preston’s shirt. Onlooking bros cry party foul. 
           Preston’s annoyed, but he’d never want to make Erin feel bad.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        Shit! I am...so...sorry!

                                 PRESTON
                        Please, don’t apologize. It’s fine.

                                 ERIN
                        No! That shirt looks expensive! 
                        Here, let’s get that stain out!

                                 PRESTON
                        Really, Erin, it’s --
                                 ERIN
                        Don’t let me ruin a designer shirt 
                        just ‘cause you want to seem macho.

           Erin, tipsy and confident, pulls him to a bathroom. Jake, 
           seeing this, mouths “Nice!” at his reluctant best friend.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE PARTY: BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Erin leads Preston into the bathroom. Locks the door. After 
           wetting a towel under the sink, she starts patting it on 
           Preston’s shirt. He isn’t comfortable in any way.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m such an idiot. Doing this to an 
                        Ivy League tech startup genius.

                                 PRESTON
                        It’s only a revenue optimization 
                        internship...

                                 ERIN
                        I also feel dumb I never knew you 
                        in school. I guess I missed a lot.

                                 PRESTON
                        A lot of me and Jake recapping Star 
                        Trek reruns? You were too popular 
                        for that noise.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh, I really wasn’t popular.

                                 PRESTON
                        Please. You were volleyball 
                        captain, pretty, had a boyfr --

                                 ERIN
                        You thought I was pretty?

           Erin stops patting the shirt. Looking into his eyes, she 
           rests her hand on his soaked chest. She KISSES him.

           Preston is startled. Mid-kiss, he OPENS his eyes. In the 
           mirror, he sees himself. Kissing Erin. And then, suddenly...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN STATION BATHROOM - EARLIER THAT DAY

           We (and Preston) see a FLASH of him looking at himself in the 
           mirror of the gross train station bathroom. And then...
           A FLASH of the bathroom’s graffiti: CHOOSE C.U.N.Y.-lingus.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. HOUSE PARTY BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           Preston suddenly GAGS, mid-kiss. Erin pulls away, confused.

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m sorry, Erin! You’re great. But 
                        I really think you aren’t my type.

           Erin steps back. Sweetly embarrassed. But deeply sad.

                                 ERIN
                        Oh. You only like white girls, too.

                                 PRESTON
                        No! Trust me, that’s not --

                                 ERIN
                        Just, um, soak the shirt before you 
                        wash it. Vinegar works great.

           Erin, tearing up, runs out of the bathroom.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE PARTY: DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jake and Alyssa have just won another game. The two HIGH-
           FIVE, now tipsier, flirtier. Preston PACES up to Jake.

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake. We need to leave.

                                 JAKE
                        Nah, dude. I’m on a hot streak! You 
                        know? A hot streak?

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake. I. Need. Us. To. Leave.

           INT. LONG ISLAND DINER - A BIT LATER

           Silence. Jake and Preston are sitting at a booth in an empty 
           24-hour diner. Both agitated. Neither speaking. Until VAL, a 
           middle-aged waitress, walks over to take their order.

                                 VAL
                        So, the usual? Two B-L-T’s on white 
                        -- extra B, hold the toothpicks -- 
                        chili cheese onion rings and a 
                        couple of coffee milkshakes?
                                 JAKE
                        Like always. Thanks, Val.

           Jake passes her his menu. Preston holds onto his, studying it 
           as he apologetically orders not-off-the-menu.

                                 PRESTON
                        Um, no milkshake for me tonight. 
                        And actually, instead of a B-L-T, 
                        could I get the, um...number 58?

                                 VAL
                        58? The “California Body Omelette?”

                                 PRESTON
                        Um, yeah, that one.

                                 VAL
                        Wanna sub fries? Or hash browns? It 
                        just comes with plain tomato 
                        slices. Just cold, raw, plain --

                                 PRESTON
                        It’s okay. The tomato slices sound 
                        good. Thanks, Val.

           Val walks away, surprised. Jake has an equally baffled look.

                                 JAKE
                        Okay, dude. Fuck’s up with you? Why 
                        are you being so weird tonight?

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m being weird?

                                 JAKE
                        Yes. Why’d you make me leave that 
                        party? Were you jealous?

                                 PRESTON
                        Jealous? Of you?! About what?

                                 JAKE
                        Maybe flip-cup? Or me and Alyssa 
                        hitting it off? ‘Cause it was very 
                        zero-chill how you --

           Jake cuts himself off. He’s having an “A-HA!” moment.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Ohhh! I know! You get a little over-
                        excited with Erin in that bathroom?
                                 PRESTON
                        Ew! What? No!

                                 JAKE
                        Don’t be embarrassed, dude! She was 
                        high school top five for you! 
                        Suddenly she’s bathtub-adjacent? 
                        Trying to lease you a Hyund-jai?

           Jake mimes a jerking off motion. Preston’s in on mood for it.

                                 PRESTON
                        Stop it! I told you I didn’t want 
                        to go there tonight. I told you I 
                        wanted to catch up one-on-one.

                                 JAKE
                        Whoa! Shit! Alright! What’s up?

           Silence. Jake waits as Preston struggles to find courage, or 
           words. Too many nervous blood vessels in his chest, and head.

                                 PRESTON
                        Okay. Um. Huh...
                             (re-shifting)
                        Remember...third grade? When we had 
                        to do that end-of-year-presentation 
                        on, um...our favorite athlete?

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah? You presented on Mike Piazza. 
                        Weird since I always find your Mets 
                        fandom middling at best. At! Best!

                                 PRESTON
                        Sure. Well, I didn’t actually wanna 
                        do Mike Piazza. I never told you 
                        this. But I was originally gonna do 
                        my presentation on...Michelle Kwan.

                                 JAKE
                        ...Michelle Kwan?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah, Michelle Kwan. She was, 
                        um...an Olympic figure skater.

           Jake is every bit as confused as Preston is nervous.

                                 JAKE
                        That’s what you needed to say? What 
                        does that have to do with refusing 
                        a bathroom finger-job from --
           Jake cuts himself off. He’s having another “A-HA!” moment.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Hold up. Are you trying to tell me 
                        you’re...fucking Michelle Kwan?

                                 PRESTON
                        No! What?! No! Listen. In third 
                        grade, when I told Mr. DeLusipi --

                                 JAKE
                        Think it was pronounced DeLusheepi!

                                 PRESTON
                        Shut up! When I told him that I 
                        wanted to present on Michelle Kwan, 
                        he said not to. Because if I told 
                        anybody my favorite athlete was a 
                        figure skater, they’d...they’d 
                        think I’m the kind of boy 
                        who...wants to kiss other boys.

           Preston’s heart races. He hopes Jake is getting it. Please.

                                 JAKE
                        He said that shit? That’s fucked! 
                        And plus, like, totally false. Duh.

                                 PRESTON
                        I mean...it was definitely fucked 
                        for him to say it. But that, um, 
                        doesn’t mean he wasn’t...not wrong.

                                 JAKE
                        What does that mean, “that doesn’t 
                        mean he wasn’t...not wrong...?”

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake? I’m...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN STATION BATHROOM - BEFORE

           Quick FLASHES to Preston practicing this word in the mirror.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Gay. (CUT) Gay! (CUT) Gay.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. LONG ISLAND DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Back in the diner. Preston’s struggle to come out continues:
                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...trying to tell you...that I’m...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN STATION BATHROOM - BEFORE

           More FLASHES from the vomitous train station bathroom.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Homosexual. (CUT) Into guys. (CUT, 
                        Jamaican accent) Montego Bay, mohn!

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. LONG ISLAND DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Preston still can’t just say it. But he’s almost there.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...that I’m...coming out. To you. 
                        Now. Here.

           Yeah. Finally, Jake gets it. He STARES at Jake, dumbfounded. 
           And at exactly the wrong moment, Val comes with their food.

                                 VAL
                        One B-B-B-L-T with chili onion 
                        rings, one milkshake, and one crime 
                        against flavor. Anything else for --

                                 JAKE
                             (to Preston)
                        You’re...?

           Jake STARES, stunned. Preston NODS. Val is confused as hell.

                                 VAL
                        Just gonna leave these for you.

           She leaves. Jake continues to stare. Preston continues to 
           stare back, fearing Jake’s friendship-ending disapproval.

                                 JAKE
                        Fuck. Well this is...this is...
                             (and then, suddenly)
                        ...AWESOME!

           Jake BANGS his hands on the table, elated. He takes a victory 
           sip of coffee milkshake -- “Mmm!” Preston SMILES, surprised.

                                 PRESTON
                        Wait. Really?
                                 JAKE
                        Hell yeah, dude! My best friend’s 
                        gay! I got a gay best friend! Why 
                        ain’t we celebrating?! YOU GAY!

                                 PRESTON
                             (laughing, whispering)
                        Keep it down, okay?

                                 JAKE
                        Oh! Right. Shit.
                             (now whispering)
                        I got me a gay-ass best friend!

           EXT. PARK PLAYGROUND - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jake and Preston sit side-by-side on the swing set in a 
           public playground, another old haunt.

                                 JAKE
                        So, have you hooked up with guys? 
                        Like, at school?

                                 PRESTON
                        School? Definitely not. But when I 
                        was abroad, I went to a gay bar. By 
                        myself, just to see. And one night, 
                        a guy invited me to his apartment.

                                 JAKE
                        So you went? And...slept with him?

                                 PRESTON
                        Not with. Next to. But we made out, 
                        a lot. And it just felt, like: Oh. 
                        Right. I am super not into women.

           Jake sighs. Happy for Preston, but still in disbelief.

                                 JAKE
                        And who all have you told?

                                 PRESTON
                        I guess...that guy? And now you.

                                 JAKE
                        Really? Nobody else?

                                 PRESTON
                        Who else would I tell? You’re the 
                        first person I tell everything to.
                                 JAKE
                        Well shit. That’s the sweetest 
                        thing a virgin has ever said to me.

                                 PRESTON
                        Shut up...

           Preston shoves Jake’s swing.

           INT. JAKE’S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jake and Preston pull up next to the Hollis family’s home, an 
           upscale mini-mansion in a new-money suburban neighborhood.

                                 JAKE
                        So. You gonna tell your parents?

                                 PRESTON
                        Junior and Clarissa? They don’t 
                        need any more drama until my 
                        sister’s done planning her wedding.

                                 JAKE
                        Mmm. The Hollis family do love 
                        yelling at florists.

                                 PRESTON
                        Anyway. Thanks again, man. For 
                        being cool...about all of this.

                                 JAKE
                        Dude. Like you said: this doesn’t 
                        change anything between us. And hey 
                        -- now that you’re out, and in the 
                        city this summer, maybe we can both 
                        get recruited...
                             (mock sexy voice)
                        ...for love.

           Preston laughs at this dumb joke he detests.

                                 PRESTON
                        Fuck off. You’re the best. But 
                        seriously, fucking hate you.

           EXT. HOLLIS FAMILY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Preston, now outside, walks his bags to the house. From a 
           rolled-down car window...

                                 JAKE
                        Recruited for loooooooove!
           Preston cackles as Jake rolls up the windows and drives off.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - A BIT LATER

           Jake enters the kitchen of his mom’s lower-middle-class home. 
           He throws keys on a counter, where bins are labeled INCOMING 
           and OUTGOING. His cat pushes a mail envelope off the counter.

                                 JAKE
                        Sheena, no! You don’t get mail. 
                        You’re illiterate.

           He opens the fridge. On a TACO BELL bag, there’s a note: 
           “Jakey, Did you eat? If not, I got an extra Chalupa. xo, Mom”

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           In a living room den, Jake settles onto a chair with a plate 
           of cold Chalupa and his laptop. He opens it. Instagram.

           On screen, a tab is open to the photo of a black girl, Erika, 
           smiling with her arm around a dark-skinned boyfriend. They 
           both wear KENYON sweatshirts. Jake closes the tab.

           He then searches Alyssa’s Instagram webpage. Jake cracks a 
           smile while looking through pictures: her Jewish sorority; 
           sketches she’s drawn; a #throwback, skating with her dad.

           Jake sees that, then has a thought. He opens YouTube. In the 
           search tab, he types: “michelle quan figure skating.” Various 
           skating videos of Kwan show up. He selects one video, called: 
           Michelle Kwan 1998 Short Program. The video loads...

           ON LAPTOP SCREEN: We see 18-year-old Michelle Kwan. As sad 
           classical music begins, she SPINS slowly, throws out her 
           arms, RUNS dramatically forward, and LAUNCHES into a skate.

           Jake looks surprised. The dramatics are fully new to him.

           Kwan GLIDES freely, gracefully, while picking up speed into a 
           two-jump combination. As she does, a commentator commentates:

                                 SKATING COMMENTATOR (O.C.)
                        Triple lutz...! Double toe!

           Kwan LANDS both moves. She SMILES, arms out. Keeps gliding.

                                 SKATING COMMENTATOR (CONT’D)
                        Straight. Easy.

           Jake raises his eyebrows. He’s impressed, maybe a bit moved.
           Then, he hears FOOTSTEPS. Fuck. Fearing that someone might 
           discover him watching this video, he closes YouTube. Silence.

           After a beat, he types a saved search: redtube lesbian porn

           INT. HOLLIS FAMILY KITCHEN - MORNING

           One week later. One gorgeous kitchen. Preston walks in as his 
           mom CLARISSA (57, friendly, elegant in yoga pants) stands by 
           a kitchen island. She holds a green cloth sample to his face.

                                 CLARISSA
                        Honey? I’ve been thinking seafoam 
                        for this year’s holiday card. Or do 
                        you think that’s too close to 2006?

           On the counter, we see years of HOLIDAY CARDS showing 
           Preston, two parents, and three older sisters. They wear 
           matching smiles and preppy sweaters in each. Preston shurgs.

                                 PRESTON
                        Whatever you think, mom.

                                 CLARISSA
                        Don’t whatever-you-think me! You 
                        were gone in last year’s! My church 
                        gals thought you’d raptured. Just 
                        like this iddy-biddy waistline.

           She pokes at his stomach, playfully. Preston LAUGHS. Tickled. 
           She keeps tickling until she clutches him in a big, fond HUG.

                                 CLARISSA (CONT’D)
                        Stay longer! Commuting isn’t such a 
                        drag! Train is great for reading, 
                        or listening to funny white actors 
                        complain about their weeks...

           Then, Preston’s dad, PRESTON JR. (“JUNIOR”) enters. He’s 
           stern, imposing in pleated pants. Clarissa un-hugs Preston.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Preston. It’s time to go.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, sorry dad. Just have to repack 
                        one more --

                                 JUNIOR
                        Really? I only played nine holes 
                        because you wanted to miss traffic.
           INT. JUNIOR’S CAR - A FEW HOURS LATER

           Junior drives Preston in his luxury sedan. Dad focuses on the 
           bridge traffic as son stares blankly out the passenger 
           window. He looks at the Manhattan skyline. Neither talks.

           On the radio, a bebop jazz riff is ending. Then, we hear the 
           agonizingly mellow voice of a JAZZ RADIO HOST:

                                 JAZZ RADIO HOST (O.S.)
                        And next, on...Jazz 98. We’ll hear: 
                        Sarah Vaughan. Singing. A showtune. 
                        From...composer, Stephen Sondheim.

           Vaughan’s 1974 recording of “Send in the Clowns” begins:

                                 SARAH VAUGHAN (CROONING) (O.S.)
                        Isn’t it rich...? Are we a pair...?
                        Me here at last on the ground...

                                 JUNIOR
                        This isn’t jazz.

           Junior abruptly changes it. The excruciating bore of GOLF 
           COMMENTARY comes on. Preston keeps gazing out the window.

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER HALLWAY - AN HOUR LATER

           Junior shows Preston around a polished but sterile 1-bedroom 
           apartment. Junior hands Preston a set of keys and a Post-It.

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want this password getting 
                        out, so memorize it if you can.

           The Post-It reads WiFi Password: T1D16719rq88889jhlK8q887bnr

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        When you see Baskin in the office, 
                        tell him he owes me a squash match.

                                 PRESTON
                        I’d rather not play up the fact 
                        that you know him. If that’s okay.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Okay. Very good. Hard work needs to 
                        stand for itself, right?

           Preston nods. Junior sticks his arm out for a handshake.

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Well. Have a good summer.
                                 PRESTON
                        Dad, I’ll see you in a week. Ava’s 
                        engagement party?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Oh. Of course. Well, until then.

           They exchange a firm handshake. Junior leaves. Preston, now 
           by himself, takes a deep breath.

           INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

           Jake is asleep in his childhood bedroom, a shrine to The 
           Fugees, NY Mets, and LeVar Burton in Star Trek. 

           Jake’s mom NANCY (52, Jewish, anxiously reassuring) not-so-
           subtly nudges him awake. A clock reads 1:13 P.M.

                                 NANCY
                        Jakey? Your Black Student Union 
                        newsletter came. The one I get for 
                        my “talented ten-dollar” donation? 
                        But, I don’t see your name in it.

                                 JAKE
                        I...stopped going this semester.

                                 NANCY
                        What? Aw, honey! I told you: don’t 
                        let anyone ever tell you’re not --

                                 JAKE
                        Mom! It’s not a big deal, okay?

                                 NANCY
                        But I thought you started making 
                        new friends since you joined! And 
                        wasn’t there a girl you asked to -- 

                                 JAKE
                        Momm-uh! Stop social-worker-ing me!

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back in his apartment, Preston hangs button-down shirts in a 
           closet. He lines up skin creams and cologne on a dresser.

           Then, he changes into a workout tank and shorts. In the 
           mirror, he checks the status of his recent biceps.
           EXT. CHELSEA STREET - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

           Preston jogs past a local gym. He stops to look at a sign: 
           “APRIL HUSTLES BRING MAY MUSCLES (JUNE & JULY TOO!) -- COME 
           IN FOR YOUR THREE-DAY SUMMER TRIAL!” He walks in.

           INT. CHELSEA GYM - A BIT LATER

           Shots of manicured men working on their whey-protein bodies.

           Preston, sweating mid-workout, drinks from a water fountain. 
           As he lifts his head, he sees a veiny BODYBUILDER shout-
           grunting (“HWAUGHHH! HWAUGHHH!”) through a chest workout. 
           With each rep, an equally beefy SPOTTER is shout-counting:

                                 SPOTTER
                        SEVEN! EIGHT! C’mon, you got this. 
                        You’re the sultan! NINE! TEN! Show 
                        me TEN, sultan! Are you the SULTAN? 
                        SHOW! ME! WHO’S! THE! SULTAN!

           As the bodybuilder wheezes through his tenth arduous rep...

                                 BODYBUILDER
                        IIII’M THE FUCKINGGGG SULTANNNNN!

           Oof. Preston glances across the room to a handsome stranger 
           who is also eyeing this machismo display, with vicious 
           judgment. This handsome, disapproving stranger is CAMERON.

           Cameron is 25, white, slender but powerful. Instead of 
           sneakers, Cameron wears leather boots with his trendy gym t-
           shirt and shorts. His coiffed hair looks expensive.

                                 SPOTTER
                        Fuck yes you’re the sultan! Unnngh!

           As spotter high-fives sultan, Cameron spots Preston’s glance. 
           Cameron raises an eyebrow as if to ask, “A bit much, no?” 
           Preston gives a chuckle as if to reply, “Tell me about it.”

           Cameron then winces at Preston. Mocking the bodybuilder’s 
           face, he silently mouths: “IIII’M THE FUCKINGGGG SULTANNNNN!”

           Preston actual-laughs this time. He smiles at the handsome 
           stranger. Until the voice of a FUSSY MAN creeps behind him.

                                 FUSSY MAN
                        Well are we hydrating or not?!

           Preston looks behind at an impatient line for the fountain.
                                 PRESTON
                        Oh! I’m so sorry...

           Mortified, Preston moves out of the way. He then looks back 
           over to Cameron. But Cameron’s gone.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - NIGHT

           Jake sits with his laptop while simultaneously watching TV. 
           On it, the LIVING SINGLE theme song by Queen Latifah starts.

                                 LIVING SINGLE THEME (O.S.)
                        We are living...single!
                        Ooooo, and in a ‘90s kinda world,
                        I’m glad I got my GIRLS!

           Jake PAUSES the show. On his phone, he types a TEXT to 
           Preston: Recorded Living Single. Wanna FaceTime in?

           While waiting, he searches Alyssa’s Instagram. He nervously 
           hovers over the FOLLOW button. Click? Click. Okay.

           Still waiting, he opens that girl Erika’s page. There’s a new 
           photo of her with her boyfriend. The caption reads, “Prez & 
           First Lady of #BlackStudentUnion!” Jake frowns at this.

           PING. A response from Preston. Jake’s face perks up. He reads 
           the TEXT from Preston: Sorry, can’t. Work tomorrow. 

           Jake’s perk fades again. He changes the channel from LIVING 
           SINGLE to a re-run of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION.

           INT. RICKSHAW CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           A trendy start-up conference room where TED BASKIN (57, semi-
           retired “cool dad” look) talks to five college students.

                                 BASKIN
                        Welcome, interns! I’m Ted Baskin, 
                        and I was brought on as the CEO of 
                        RickShaw last year. So that means, 
                        just like you, I’m here to learn 
                        from this expanding company’s 
                        brilliant, diverse staff.

           Preston looks out the glass wall at this company’s staffers. 
           Almost all are white and male.

                                 BASKIN (CONT’D)
                        Including, of course, our inspiring 
                        co-founders. Judd? Lest? Any words 
                        of motivation for the new interns?
           We see the two pasty co-founders: LEST, 23, blank-faced in a 
           hoodie; and JUDD, 24, pulsing with manic energy.

                                 LEST
                        Not really.

                                 JUDD
                        Hey, yeah, I do. There’s mainly one 
                        thing we need from you interns...

           STEWART, an eager intern, whispers to Preston, anticipating:

                                 STEWART
                        Hard work...!

                                 JUDD
                        Don’t fuck anything for us! I won’t 
                        lie: not a whole lot for you noobs 
                        to do. We don’t even know what to 
                        do with the full-employment noobs.

           Preston looks back outside. He notices that workers are 
           mostly milling about or playing ping-pong.

                                 JUDD (CONT’D)
                        So please just don’t get us in any 
                        more shit on social media? We 
                        already spent too much for Baskin 
                        here to clean up shop after Lest’s 
                        incident at P.F. Chang’s.

           Lest shrugs. Baskin, mortified, laughs to cover the silence.

           INT. RICKSHAW INTERN CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

           Preston sets up his desk in a large cubicle set aside for 
           interns. Stewart sets up at the desk nest to him.

                                 STEWART
                        Actually kinda psyched there’s not 
                        much work. We got all summer to bro 
                        out -- make a good impresh!

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. Could be good, I guess...

           Preston, shy, looks away. Stewart, sensing Preston thinks 
           he’s too cool for school, rolls his eyes.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - A BIT LATER

           Jake watches a Mets game on mute while making a phone call:
                                 JAKE
                        Hi! I’m calling with regard to the 
                        graphic design internship you have. 
                             (beat)
                        Oh. You filled it already?

           Now on another call...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m an Africana Studies major at 
                        Kenyon with a 3.6 and a can-do --
                             (beat)
                        Filled in March, really?

           And another...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        No, I’m not proficient in 
                        Photoshop. But Adobe Reader...?

           Call is ended. Jake holds up a middle finger to his phone.

           INT. CHELSEA GYM - NIGHT

           More shots of men working on their glutes and vanity.

           As Preston walks through the gym, several eyes make prolonged 
           contact with his. He doesn’t sustain the glances, though. He 
           is looking for that handsome stranger. Nowhere to be found.

           INT. GYM LOCKER ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           Preston, towel around his waist, walks past other changing 
           bodies. He carries his own half-confidently as he approaches 
           a steam room. But before entering the foggy glass door, he 
           notices two BURLY MEN inside, making out. 

           Preston is paralyzed. Should he leave? Enter? Watch? One of 
           the men REACHES under the other’s towel. That man CLOSES his 
           eyes toward the ceiling. Preston GULPS, looking on. Until...

           Thud. Preston, startled, looks behind him. Feet away, Cameron 
           has just tossed a gym bag onto a locker room bench.

           Cameron, SMIRKING, lifts a judgmental eyebrow at Preston. As 
           he packs up his yoga mat, Preston scurries to the showers.

           INT. CHELSEA GYM LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

           Preston, changed into jeans and a button-down, approaches an 
           overly peppy GYM MEMBERSHIP REP behind the lobby counter.
                                 PRESTON
                        Hi. I was hoping to sign up for a 
                        summer membership.

                                 GYM MEMBERSHIP REP
                        Beach season! Show some dolphins 
                        that body! Just need a credit card.

           We see that Cameron is at the adjacent smoothie bar, watching 
           Preston as he hands over an American Express Gold Card.

                                 GYM MEMBERSHIP REP (CONT’D)
                        “Preston Blake Hollis I-I-I?” What 
                        do the three I’s stand for? Let me 
                        guess: Ivan? Izzy? Ooh, I-reese!

           EXT. CHELSEA GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           As Preston exits, he sees Cameron outside, standing by the 
           door. In one hand, Cameron SIPS an amino health drink. In the 
           other hand, he SMOKES a cigarette. He watches Preston.

           Preston nervously walks away. But then, on second thought, he 
           turns around, desiring any excuse to approach Cameron.

                                 PRESTON
                        Hey, sorry. Can I get a cigarette?

           Cameron shrugs, sure. He reaches to get Preston a cigarette.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Wait! I um...don’t smoke. Sorry.

           Beat. Cameron takes a long cigarette DRAG as he studies 
           Preston’s apologetic face. And then, finally, he speaks:

                                 CAMERON
                        I noticed you trying to join a 
                        steam room rendezvous. Don’t.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, I wasn’t -- 

                                 CAMERON
                        It’s just a bit...beneath us? I 
                        mean, I had my fun on the sauna 
                        circuit, but we children have to 
                        grow up eventually. One can’t jerk 
                        off old men in towels forever.

           Cameron’s voice is as alluring as it is bossy. Either way, 
           its confidence terrifies Preston.
                                 PRESTON
                        I...really just came for a workout.

           Cameron smiles as he exhales another cigarette drag.

                                 CAMERON
                        Of course. You have to burn off the 
                        calories from that Negroni somehow.

                                 PRESTON
                        Negroni? What Negroni?

                                 CAMERON
                        The barrel-aged drink we’re having 
                        this...Wednesday? At say, 4pm?

                                 PRESTON
                        Actually, I’m --

                                 CAMERON
                        More of a whiskey drinker? How very 
                        masc. Fine, I’ll allow you to order 
                        a “Boulevardier.”

                                 PRESTON
                        I was saying I’m at work until 7.

                                 CAMERON
                        Huh. You work. Fascinating. Well, I 
                        don’t know you well enough to watch 
                        me eat solids. So, let’s do after-
                        dinner drinks? 9:30? Raja House.

           Cameron hands over a business card. The front of the card 
           simply reads: CAMERON -- nothing else.

                                 PRESTON
                        It’s a...plan.

           Cameron raises two fingers to his lips. With them, he then 
           makes a peace sign. Winks. And then, he stomps away...

           Preston looks back at Cameron’s card. He turns it over. On 
           the other side, it simply reads: @cameron -- nothing else.

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Preston sits on his laptop, in the middle of a TV-watching 
           FaceTime hang. The LIVING SINGLE opening plays on his TV.
           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jake has his laptop open to the FaceTime with Preston. On his 
           TV, the LIVING SINGLE theme continues:

                                 LIVING SINGLE THEME SONG (O.S.)
                        We are living...single!
                        Ooooo, and in a ‘90s kinda world,
                        I’m glad I got my GIRLS!

           Intercut with Preston.

                                 PRESTON
                        Okay. This was an inspired idea.

                                 JAKE
                        Right, son? Oh! Wait. Almost forgot 
                        -- Alyssa followed back on Insta!

                                 PRESTON
                        Wow. Congrats. Will your registry 
                        be at IKEA or Applebee’s?

                                 JAKE
                        You mock, but I just completed 
                        phase one of getting a summer G-F.

                                 PRESTON
                        Well, in a surprise twist, I think 
                        I might have a date this week?

                                 JAKE
                        No way! Like, with a dude? Dude!

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah, this guy at my gym. Asked me 
                        to get a drink on Wednesday.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh, bummer. Did you tell him you’re 
                        terminally lame on work nights?

                                 PRESTON
                        Well, I figured I should say yes 
                        since I’m home this weekend for the 
                        engagement party. I told my mom 
                        you’re coming, by the way.

                                 JAKE
                        Dope. Wow, so you just like...go to 
                        a gym? And then, like...have a 
                        date? Being gay is mad easy, huh?
           INT. RICKSHAW INTERN CUBICLE - NEXT AFTERNOON

           Preston, at his desk, stares at his computer. An open word 
           document says TO DO LIST: 1.) Restock paper clips. 2.) Pick 
           up mozz sticks for Lest. 3.) Figure out what else to do.

           Then, Stewart slides his desk chair over to him.

                                 STEWART
                        Hollis! The other “ints” and I are 
                        playing kickball tonight. You in?

                                 PRESTON
                        No, sorry. I have plans tonight.

                                 STEWART
                        Bummer sauce! Could def use ballin’ 
                        skills like yours out there.

           Preston doesn’t respond as he opens up Google and types in a 
           new search: how many calories in a negroni?

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

           Sarah Vaughan’s recording of “I Feel Pretty” plays as Preston 
           unconfidently tries on button-down shirts in the mirror...

           He tries on a green shirt; then a blue one; then green again; 
           now a black one; then blue again. Nope, he settles for green.

           INT. RAJA HOUSE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           Preston hurries into the oak-toned lobby of an upscale club. 
           A HOSTESS (stylish, unfriendly) looks at him quizzically.

                                 PRESTON
                        Hello, I’m here for drinks. There 
                        might be a reservation? Cameron?

                                 HOSTESS
                        Is Cameron his first or last name?

           Preston panics, not actually certain of the answer.

                                 HOSTESS (CONT’D)
                        I’m only joking. We know Cameron.

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m guessing he’s here already? 
                        Sorry I’m twelve minutes late.
                                 HOSTESS
                        No? The reservation is for 9:45.

           Before Preston can check his phone, Cameron swoops in from 
           behind, majestically, out of nowhere, and begins lecturing.

                                 CAMERON
                        Always book your table for fifteen 
                        minutes after you tell someone to 
                        meet. Otherwise you’ll waste your 
                        youth waiting on “friends” to 
                        arrive late. As they always do.

                                 PRESTON
                        Sorry. I’m never usually this late.

                                 CAMERON
                        Exactly. You’re two minutes early.

           Cameron winks. He hands the hostess his suede messenger bag.

           INT. RAJA HOUSE COCKTAIL LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

           The hostess seats them at a wide booth. Cameron eases in. 
           This cocktail lounge is packed, exciting, sophisticated.

                                 PRESTON
                        Wow. This place is really --

                                 CAMERON
                        Bland? I know. But they have “young 
                        patron” specials to bring down the 
                        age from forty-ancient. So, here we 
                        babes are. Tell me about yourself.

                                 PRESTON
                        Okay. Well, I’m --

                                 CAMERON
                        You’re a rising senior at Penn...U, 
                        not State. You’re from non-Hamptons 
                        Long Island, even though your dad’s 
                        got that Hamptons money. And your 
                        major is...oh, it’s something dull.

                                 PRESTON
                        Logic, Information and Computation.
                        How did you know all that?

                                 CAMERON
                        Aren’t you an Ivy League student, 
                        Cream-Cheese? It’s called homework.
           Cameron winks again. Preston gulps, mesmerized.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Also I got bored in my cab here and 
                        spent 17 seconds on your LinkedIn.
                             (calling out to waiter)
                        Hi, sober here! Might we fix that?

           INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - SAME NIGHT, SAME TIME

           Jake, pacing nervously in his room, makes a phone call...

                                 JAKE
                        Alyssa! Hi! It’s Jake! LaPorte!

           INT. ALYSSA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           In her bedroom, Alyssa answers. Confused, but intrigued, she 
           puts down a pencil on the desk where she’s been sketching.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Oh. Hey, Jake! What’s...up?

           Intercut with Jake.

                                 JAKE
                        I was calling to say, um, thanks. 
                        For the Instagram follow!

                                 ALYSSA
                        You called? To thank me? For that?

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. Yeah! I noticed you only follow 
                        about seventy peeps who aren’t 
                        animals or celebrities.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Uh huh. Figure somebody’s gotta hit 
                        like on Oprah’s posts about bread.

           Jake cackles. Alyssa’s smiles, but still fairly weirded out.

                                 JAKE
                        Well, if you ever want any company 
                        while looking at her Instagram...

           INT. RAJA HOUSE COCKTAIL LOUNGE - A BIT LATER

           Cameron and Preston are half-way through a round of Negronis.
                                 CAMERON
                        Studied abroad in Paris? Parfait! 
                        Government may be full of men who 
                        took Spanish. But society’s run by 
                        us gals who sat at French table.

           Preston nods, compliant. He then checks his posture. Cameron, 
           sensing his nerves, leans forward inquisitively.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        So. Preston. Who’s your type?

                                 PRESTON
                        My type? Is that a weird thing to 
                        talk about on...um, you know...

                                 CAMERON
                        On what? An empty stomach?

                                 PRESTON
                        No, no. I meant...on a date.

           Through an uncomfortable silence, Cameron TILTS his head -- 
           half-apologetic, half-condescending. Preston realizes...

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh. This...isn’t a date.

                                 CAMERON
                        Aw! Babe! No.

                                 PRESTON
                        Fuck. I am so sorry. Please pretend 
                        I never said that.

                                 CAMERON
                        Don’t be silly! I forget when I 
                        meet a person in person that you 
                        have no way of knowing my type. Or 
                        that I already have a boyfriend who 
                        lives in Milan.

                                 PRESTON
                        Long-distance! That’s gotta be --

                                 CAMERON
                        Perfect. I’m too young to be 
                        settled down with some kind of...

                                 PRESTON
                        Life partner?
                                 CAMERON
                        ...cat. But I’m also too old to be 
                        dating twenty-somethings, you know?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. Wait. Sorry, how old are you?

                                 CAMERON
                        25. Sure. But my out age is 14.

                                 PRESTON
                        Out age?

                                 CAMERON
                        Yes. Every gay man has an age and 
                        an out age. Take my boyfriend. He’s 
                        45, but he didn’t come out until he 
                        was 31. So, he might be two decades 
                        older, in hetero-mortal years, but 
                        we’re actually the same out age.

                                 PRESTON
                        Meaning you came out at eleven?

                                 CAMERON
                        Talent show. My talent was drama.

           Preston’s phone blares: a FaceTime request from Jake.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Need to take that?

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh no. It’s...nobody. Sorry.

           Preston hits IGNORE. He places the phone on silent.

                                 CAMERON
                        So, at what age were you out-born? 
                        I’m gonna guess...sixteen?

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh. No. More recently than that.

                                 CAMERON
                        Okay. Freshman year of college?

           Preston shakes his head. Nervous. He doesn’t want to have to 
           come out about coming out.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Before or after you put on that 378-
                        dollar cologne this evening?
                                 PRESTON
                        Within the past...few...weeks...

           Preston is mortified. Cameron scowls at this, surprised.

                                 CAMERON
                        You’re a gay baby.

           And then, Cameron’s scowl releases into a wide grin.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        You’re in the city all summer?

           INT. RICKSHAW INTERN CUBICLE - THE NEXT MORNING

           Preston, tired at his office desk, receives a TEXT MESSAGE 
           from Jake: Dude. FaceTime me! It’s an emergency!

           INT. RICKSHAW CONFERENCE ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Preston hurriedly takes his laptop into the empty conference 
           room. He opens the screen and calls Jake on FaceTime.

                                 PRESTON
                        Hey! Hey man. What’s going on?

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - SIMULTANEOUS

           Jake, eating cereal, is on his laptop. Intercut with Preston.

                                 JAKE
                        There you are. So I called Alyssa, 
                        and it was a hard yes on bein’ my G-
                        F. But, I got caught in the moment 
                        and might have agreed to see that 
                        Space-Gandhi movie I promised we’d 
                        see. I know. I know. Don’t hate me.

                                 PRESTON
                        That’s the emergency that required 
                        interrupting my work day?

           Preston looks out the glass wall. Interns play Twister.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, obviously I don’t hate you. 
                        And sorry about last night. I was 
                        at drinks with that guy.

                                 JAKE
                        Your date! Right! Was he awesome?
                                 PRESTON
                        Well, turned out it wasn’t a date.

                                 JAKE
                        Rough. Forget that dude! He sucks.

                                 PRESTON
                        No. It actually was pretty fun. I 
                        think I’m seeing him again tonight.

                                 JAKE
                        Again? Like as a...friend?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. He’s hosting a drinks thing. 
                        Figure it’d be good for me to make 
                        a few gay friends while I’m here.

                                 JAKE
                        Huh. I guess if it’s not weird.

           INT. CAMERON’S STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

           Preston, dressed spiffy, is being led by Cameron through his 
           foyer. Impressive queer paintings hang on the wall.

                                 PRESTON
                        These are incredible. You said your 
                        boyfriend’s an art dealer, right?

                                 CAMERON
                        Jean-Olaf? Yes, but he’s really 
                        more of a performance art dealer.

           INT. CAMERON’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They arrive in a PALATIAL LIVING ROOM. Everything in it, from 
           the white furniture to the two other white friends, is sleek.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Flock, come meet a new sheep...

           We meet TIMMI. He is 22, statuesque but playfully bubbly. His 
           muscular frame seems like it could blow away in the wind.

                                 TIMMI
                        Hi! I’m Timmi. That’s two I’s, two 
                        M’s, one T. Not in that order.

                                 CAMERON
                        Timmi’s a model-slash-actor. Former 
                        actor-slash-model. Future trophy-
                        husband-slash-divorcé.
                                 TIMMI
                        Ugh! I so aspire to that.

           The other friend is DANIEL. He is 24, short, redheaded, 
           vicious. He paces at the side of the room on his phone.

                                 CAMERON
                        Daniel! What did I say about 
                        conference-ing in my duplex?

           Daniel rolls his eyes and gets off his phone call.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        That’s Daniel. Finance gay. Often 
                        to be found on a call with London.

                                 DANIEL
                        London? Please. Hong Kong, bitch.

           Daniel struts back over to the couches where the rest hover.

                                 CAMERON
                        Friends. Meet “Preston Blake Hollis 
                        the Third.” A mouthful, I know.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh. Friends usually call me “P.B.”

                                 DANIEL
                        “P-B?” We most certainly will not.

                                 TIMMI
                        Nobody ever got fucked while being 
                        named P.B. Here’s your vodka soda.

           Timmi hands Preston the drink he never ordered or requested.

           INT. CAMERON’S LIVING ROOM - HALF HOUR LATER

           Clink. Cameron, Daniel, Timmi and Preston are onto a second.

                                 PRESTON
                        So, how’d you guys become friends?

                                 DANIEL
                        By not being awful? Every gay in 
                        this city tends to be basic, or 
                        ugly, or judgmental...

                                 CAMERON
                        We gravitated, and then we stuck, 
                        and soon enough we’d merged to form 
                        “Balsamic Vinegar.”
                                 PRESTON
                        Oh! You guys have a band?

                                 TIMMI
                        A “band?” Wow, I haven’t heard that 
                        word since I was in the closet.

                                 DANIEL
                        Might as well ask if we “play pick-
                        up basketball.” Or “eat pussy.”

                                 CAMERON
                        No, “Balsamic Vinegar” is what we 
                        call our three-person text thread. 
                        We do have other friends. And we 
                        know everyone, of course.

                                 DANIEL
                        But we can’t add every Tom, Dick or 
                        Hairy Dick. We’re a fucking family.

                                 TIMMI
                        Cheers to that! Here’s your shot.

           Timmi hands Preston a tequila shot he hadn’t asked for.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, I’m good. Should probably get 
                        home soon. I’ve got work tomorrow.

                                 DANIEL
                        So? We all do, except for Cameron 
                        and Timmi. That’s not stopping us 
                        from gay-clubbing on a Thursday.

                                 PRESTON
                        We’re going to a club? Tonight?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes, Cinderella. If you’re worried 
                        about sleep, just do what I do. Eat 
                        a 5-Hour Energy for breakfast.

                                 TIMMI
                        Cheers!

           They lift their tequila shots as we cut to...

           INT. “THE HUNTER” GAY BAR - AN HOUR LATER

           Clink. Cameron, Timmi, Daniel and Preston down shots at THE 
           HUNTER, a gay bar where men are standing around as music 
           plays. Preston winces taking the shot. The others don’t.
                                 CAMERON
                        Preston, why is your Insta blocked?

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh. I hear it’s a bad career move 
                        to be public on Instagram. Gotta 
                        make that money, right?

           He chuckles nervously. The other three don’t return a smile.

                                 DANIEL
                        Wrong. Gotta be that money. Why 
                        hide your life from straight 
                        employers when you can show your 
                        straight coworkers you’re more 
                        interesting than they are?

                                 TIMMI
                        Exactly. You’re queer, you’re 
                        black, you’re young, you’re hot...

           Preston spits out some vodka soda.

                                 CAMERON
                        Define yourself by places like 
                        here. Where you look around and 
                        know you’re with your own kind.

           Preston considers this as he looks around. Big crowd. Lots of 
           gay men his age. Almost all are white.

           Then, the song “Come Into My World” by Kylie Minogue starts 
           to pulse. Daniel, Timmi and Cameron sway along familiarly to 
           this club jam as they drink. Preston’s tense face eases up.

                                 PRESTON
                        You guys know this song?!

                                 DANIEL
                        Duh we know this song.

                                 PRESTON
                        My sister had this CD when I was a 
                        kid! And I stole it from her! And 
                        hid it in a blink-182 case!

                                 CAMERON
                        I’m so sorry you had to go through 
                        purchasing a blink-182 CD.

           Preston laughs, smiles. He starts dance-swaying with them.
                                 PRESTON
                        I’m glad you guys convinced me to 
                        come ‘til the end of the night!

                                 CAMERON
                        End? What do you mean “end?”

           INT. GAY CLUB - AN HOUR LATER

           Clink. The four boys down four more tequila shots at FLAVOR, 
           a louder, more packed gay club with a proper dance floor.

           A thick, chic 30-year-old friend named SAL waves at them. As 
           Sal walks over, Cameron explains him in whispers to Preston.

                                 CAMERON
                        That’s Dumb Sal. Sadly, he’s dumb. 
                        Fortunately, he always has drugs.

                                 SAL
                        You guys! Audrey Hepburn died!

                                 DANIEL
                        Sal, she died twenty years ago.

                                 SAL
                        I know! Isn’t it sad?! Anyway, now 
                        I’m over it. Who’s this?

                                 CAMERON
                        Sal, this is Preston. He’s new in 
                        town, for the summer.

                                 SAL
                        Summer ho? Get that August Osage 
                        Bounty. Are you a top or bottom?

                                 PRESTON
                        Who? Me? Oh. I don’t...um...

           Sal awaits an answer. The others sense Preston’s discomfort.

                                 TIMMI
                        Sal, you can’t ask everyone that. 
                        Remember the St. Jude’s benefit?

                                 SAL
                        How can I know who to introduce him 
                        to until I know if he T’s or B’s?

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, um. I don’t...know, actually?
           All four now give Preston a shocked look.

                                 DANIEL
                        What do you mean you don’t know? 
                        You mean you’re vers? You do both?

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh. Um, no. I’ve never...neither...

           Suddenly, it dawns on these guys how very young and barely 
           out Preston is. They smile at him, condescendingly.

                                 TIMMI
                        So? What else should we talk about?

           Preston is mortified. He senses they’ve realized he’s not 
           cool. Not mature. Not gay enough. They finally stop talking 
           at Preston and begin to chat amongst themselves.

                                 DANIEL
                        Did we all see RuPaul this week? 
                        That motherfucking lip-sync...

                                 TIMMI
                        I know. I’d kill to death-drop like 
                        that. It’s so lame that we don’t 
                        even know anyone who can.

           And suddenly, Preston’s mood shifts.

                                 PRESTON
                        I can death-drop.

           The boys turn to Preston, all with scoffs on their face.

                                 SAL
                        You haven’t fucked a man, but you 
                        know how to death drop?

                                 TIMMI
                        Do you...know what a death drop is?

                                 DANIEL
                        We don’t mean bungee-jumping, hon. 
                        It’s a dance move drag queens do. 
                        Like, the hardest one there is.

                                 PRESTON
                        I know. I might not have been out 
                        in high school, but I had locked 
                        doors, YouTube tutorials, and an 
                        indoor trampoline room. I taught 
                        myself how to death-drop.
                                 CAMERON
                        Then let’s see it. Death-drop.

           The boys step five feet away, clearing a space. As they wait 
           for Preston to dance-fall, he suddenly gets bashful.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, I dunno. I’ve honestly never 
                        done a death-drop in public before.

                                 SAL
                        See? I’ve always known he couldn’t.

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m sorry, guys. I would do it for 
                        you. But, um, I’m just feeling kind 
                        of drunk, and nervous, and well --

           THUD! Preston falls down to the floor, LANDING on his back in 
           a PERFECT DEATH-DROP. The four other boys, shocked by both 
           his move and his fake-out, screech with excitement.

                                 TIMMI
                        That. Was. EVERYTHING.

           Preston stands up, unscathed by his fabulous fall. Men all 
           around the crowded club start snapping. YASSS-ing. Daniel and 
           Timmi come to Cameron’s side, dazzled in amazement.

                                 DANIEL
                        Do we...get to keep him?

           INT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - NEXT NIGHT

           Movie snack line. Jake and Alyssa wait in adjacent lines. 
           They smile at each other, with anxious competitive energy.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I’m totally getting to the front of 
                        my line before you!

                                 JAKE
                        Please. I invented “Popcorn Line 
                        Wait Grand Prix.” Old dude always 
                        trumps flustered mom-of-three.

           In front of Alyssa, there’s a MOM with WHINY CHILDREN. In 
           front of Jake, an OLD MAN. As the mother pays with a debit 
           card, the old man fumbles, counting pennies in hand.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Exact change? No! C’mon, grandpa!
                                 ALYSSA
                        YES! Ha. You’re buying.

           As the mom and kids leave, Alyssa victoriously waltzes to the 
           VENDOR in front of her. Jake leaves his line to join.

                                 ALYSSA (CONT’D)
                        Hey! One medium Diet Coke and a 
                        Raisinettes. And he’ll have...

                                 JAKE
                        Wow. You raised soda prices, huh?

           The popcorn clerk nods. As Jake anxiously studies the menu...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Make it a small...cup for water.

           INT. LONG ISLAND DINER - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jake and Alyssa sit at the diner, post-movie. They’re in the 
           middle of conversation, laughing.

                                 JAKE
                        What do you mean my Bar Mitzvah 
                        theme was “a bit un-kosher?”

                                 ALYSSA
                        Spike Lee’s Do The Right Thing? I 
                        don’t think that’s exactly the 
                        freedom our people fled Egypt for.

                                 JAKE
                        Wooow. And to think I sat you at 
                        the “Radio Raheem” table...

                                 ALYSSA
                        So. Think any pubescent Jewish boys 
                        will have a Space-Gandhi reception?

                                 JAKE
                        Oof! Definitely not. But, um. I’m 
                        still...glad we saw that movie.

           He slides his PINKY on the table to touch her hand. She lets 
           it rest there. For a beat. Until suddenly, she pulls it away.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Jake. Sorry, but I actually...have 
                        a boyfriend back at school.

           She grants him a sorry smile. Jake, humiliated, struggles to 
           play it cool as he responds. She listens, feeling terrible.
                                 JAKE
                        Oh! Me too! A girlfriend. Well, on-
                        off. We went out a few -- anyway. 
                        Ha! Did you, like, think I was...?

                                 ALYSSA
                        Dude? It’s cool. I had fun tonight. 
                        We can still hang as friends. Yeah?

                                 JAKE
                        Totally. I love friends. I mean, I 
                        like friends. Friends are chill.

           INT. JAKE’S CAR - THE NEXT DAY

           Jake, in a blazer and sloppily-tied tie, waits at Huntington 
           Station as a train finally arrives. He’s more sullen today.

           Preston emerges from the train, also in a blazer and tie. He 
           looks exhausted as he paces into Jake’s car.

                                 PRESTON
                        Sorry, sorry, so sorry! I got on 
                        the wrong train like an idiot.

                                 JAKE
                        Honestly kind of an honor to not be 
                        the late one. Here’s your Jen 
                        Aniston milk.

           Jake hands Preston a bottle of Smart Water.

                                 PRESTON
                        Bless. I am way too hungover to 
                        deal with this engagement party.

                                 JAKE
                        You got drunk last night?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. I was, um, out with that guy 
                        Cameron and his other friends.

                                 JAKE
                        Last night? I thought you were 
                        gonna do that Thursday night.

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. But we...went out again.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. Well, speaking of. Alyssa and I 
                        also decided it’s best to just be --
           Preston receives and laughs at a text on his phone. He hasn’t 
           heard Jake’s attempt to change the conversation.

                                 PRESTON
                        Sorry, man, what’d you say?

                                 JAKE
                        Oh, um. It’s nothing. Hey -- if I 
                        give you cash, could you buy me a 
                        bottle of wine to give your family?

                                 PRESTON
                        I cannot wait for you to turn 21.

           INT. HOLLIS FAMILY FRONT HALLWAY - A BIT LATER

           Preston and Jake enter the Hollis’s house. Clarissa, wearing 
           a sun dress and pearls, paces in her heels to hug Preston.

                                 CLARISSA
                        There’s our handsome prince!

                                 JAKE
                        And he brought your son too!

           Clarissa chuckles and waves “Oh stop!” at Jake. He hands her 
           a cheap bottle of screw-top Pinot Grigio. She maintains a 
           grin while peeling the price tag he forgot to remove.

                                 CLARISSA
                        Jake! You shouldn’t have! Now, 
                        hungry guys, get out and try some 
                        hors d’oeuvres. The truffle catfish 
                        tartare-tlets are just divine!

           EXT. HOLLIS FAMILY BACKYARD - A BIT LATER

           Jake and Preston stand around a crowded lawn. We see spiffy 
           outfits. Champagne. A string quartet playing Duke Ellington.

                                 JAKE
                        Hey! Another ham-hock spring roll?

           Jake flags down a SERVER: 28, Mediterranean, hot. This guy’s 
           catering garb doesn’t suit his stylish buzz-cut or earrings.

                                 PRESTON
                        None for me, sorry.

                                 SERVER
                        Got it. I’ll forgive you. Maybe.
           This server lingers, for a moment of deliberate EYE CONTACT 
           with Preston. Preston GULPS. Jake chews, noticing none of it.

           As the server struts away, Jake’s oldest sister JESSICA (a 
           mature 33) walks over with their grandma EVELYN (a young 84).

                                 JESSICA
                        Grandma. You remember Preston’s 
                        friend Jake, right?

                                 EVELYN
                        Do I remember! I used to pick these 
                        two up from school! And I’d say: 
                        that boy might be Jewish, but I 
                        sure do like him anyway!

           She laughs, squeezing Jake into a hug. He laughs, too, but 
           with a look of “Wait, what?” Preston and Jessica roll eyes.

                                 JESSICA
                        Jake, any idea what you’ll do after 
                        graduation next year?

                                 JAKE
                        Well that’s...hella far away. But I 
                        dunno! I’ve been thinking of trying 
                        to teach myself Photoshop.

                                 EVELYN
                        Photography? My friend Cleo needs 
                        someone to take pictures she has, 
                        and put them on her computer. I 
                        said: “Cleo! You mean with Scotch 
                        tape?” Not with Scotch tape!

                                 JESSICA
                        It’s called scanning, grandma.

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake, maybe that’s a thing you 
                        could do with your summer.

           Jake looks annoyed by Preston speaking on his behalf.

                                 JAKE
                        That’s...not really the kind of 
                        computer design I had in mind.

                                 EVELYN
                        Too bad. Twenty dollars an hour!

                                 JAKE
                        And what is Cleo’s phone number?
           INT. HOLLIS FAMILY DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Dinner time. The large dining room is filled with small 
           tables. Preston’s parents sit with other couples their age. 

           At another table: Preston’s sisters Jessica, LESLIE (31, 
           pregnant) and AVA (27) sit with their black male partners.

           Jake and Preston sit at a kids’ table. Preston’s 5-year-old 
           NEPHEW looks at Jake, smiling, and holds up seven fingers.

                                 NEPHEW
                        I have this many girlfriends.

           Jake nods. He then turns to Preston, distracted on his phone.

                                 JAKE
                        Jeez. Are you on, like, a text 
                        chain with these gay guys?

                                 PRESTON
                        No. I mean, they do have a thread, 
                        but not with me. Which is okay.

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah -- I’m on one with my mom and 
                        my Aunt Joan. Gets hella annoying.

           From his table, Junior stands and CLINKS a glass. Hush hush.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Hello all. Since Clarissa and I are 
                        so thrilled to host you tonight, I 
                        thought I’d say a few words about 
                        this home. The home where Ava grew 
                        up -- from diapers, to Barbies, to 
                        that unfortunate hair braids phase.

                                 JESSICA AND LESLIE (IN UNISON)
                             (rapping the Moesha theme)
                        “M to the...O to the...E to 
                        the...Moesha!”

           The two oldest sisters laugh, teasing their sister. Ava, 
           annoyed, throws crumbs of rosemary cornbread at them.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Anyhow. Joyous as this occasion may 
                        be, it also means our third little 
                        girl is starting a home of her own 
                        now. A family of her own. With a 
                        name that...sadly, isn’t Hollis.
                                 CLARISSA
                        Ooh, why’d I wear my Y-S-L mascara!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Still, it brings us comfort to know 
                        that Ava’s children will be raised 
                        by a good man -- a good black man.

           Ava’s fiancé nods. Grunts of affirmation from the room.

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        And also, that we’re blessed to 
                        still have our son, Preston the 
                        third, to pass on that Hollis name.

           Smiling eyes turn fondly to Preston. He looks panicked.

                                 AVA
                        Awww, look. Baby bro is blushing!

                                 EVELYN
                        He’ll be hitched any day now! I bet 
                        those Philly girls are all over him 
                        -- lookin’ all fit...!

           Jake looks sympathetically at Preston, who STARES down. With 
           a fork, he shuffles salad over peeled-off fried chicken skin.

           INT. HOLLIS FAMILY LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Coffee and dessert are out. Guests tap feet as an operatic 
           SOPRANO sings the jaunty Negro spiritual “His Name So Sweet.”

                                 SOPRANO (SINGING)
                        Po’ Sinner! Do you love Jesus?
                        His name so sweet...

           To the side, Jake spots Preston packing up his backpack.

                                 JAKE
                        There you are! Ready to finally get 
                        out of here and head to my place?

                                 PRESTON
                        I actually might head back to the 
                        city. Think I kind of O-D’d on Long 
                        Island and parent shit for one day.

                                 JAKE
                        No Living Single marathon? We’re 
                        almost at the one where Maxine and 
                        18-year-old Terence Howard get they 
                        May-December on.
                                 PRESTON
                        I just need to head home and sleep 
                        off this hangover. Wake up in my 
                        bed. Any chance I can get a ride?

           INT. JAKE’S CAR - AN HOUR LATER

           Jake pulls up back to Huntington Station to drop off Preston. 
           Preston glares out the window. Jake is silent, concerned.

                                 JAKE
                        Sure you’re okay, man? After, you 
                        know, that stuff your dad said?

                                 PRESTON
                        Um...yeah. It’s...whatever. Sorry I 
                        let it get me in a funk. But thanks 
                        for asking. Appreciate that a lot.

                                 JAKE
                        Of course. And let’s party it off 
                        soon. I know I can’t crash on work 
                        nights, but maybe we can do a big 
                        city night next Saturday?

                                 PRESTON
                        Definitely. Promise.

           EXT. HUNTINGTON STATION - A MOMENT LATER

           As he waits on the train platform, Preston gives an 
           affectionate WAVE to Jake as the car pulls away.

           Still frustrated, Preston takes a deep breath. And then, 
           after a moment, he pulls out his phone.

           He composes a TEXT to Cameron: So. What are we up to tonight?

           INT. SEASON-5 GAY CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Preston, now in a fashionable outfit, enters SEASON-5, a gay 
           bar where Cameron, Daniel, Timmi and Sal are sitting with 
           vodka sodas. They cheer hello as he arrives.

                                 DANIEL
                        Preston! I thought you were being 
                        rich in Long Island all weekend.

                                 SAL
                        Fire Island? Yasss diva!
                                 PRESTON
                        Not Fire Island. In Huntington, 
                        where I grew up.

                                 SAL
                        You grew up in Fire Island? Well no 
                        wonder you’re gay!

                                 CAMERON
                        Sal, I think you have some condom 
                        in your teeth.

           Sal shrieks and runs to a bathroom. Cameron, having gotten 
           rid of him, turns to Daniel and Timmi. They’re all beaming.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        So, girls. Who wants to tell him?

                                 PRESTON
                        Tell me what...?

                                 DANIEL
                        Cameron? The honors?

           Preston looks confused as Cameron looks down on his phone. 
           Taps. Until a moment later, Preston’s phone gets a PING.

           Preston looks at the ALERT on his screen: Cameron has invited 
           you to join the group “BALSAMIC VINEGAR.” His face lights up.

                                 PRESTON
                        Wait. Really? Your thread?!

                                 TIMMI
                        Welcome friend! Get ready for S-T-D 
                        freakouts and GIFS of drunk Helen 
                        Mirren...

                                 DANIEL
                        We figure you’ll find your way to 
                        the city next year. And until then, 
                        you’re only a $186 Acela ride away.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh my...GUYS! Thank you so much!

                                 CAMERON
                        Do not tell Sal. He thinks we can’t 
                        add him due to an iPhone bug. And 
                        we all need his good coke tonight.

                                 PRESTON
                        Cocaine? Oh, not for me, sorry.
                                 TIMMI
                        What do you mean? I see literal 
                        yawns coming out of your mouth.

                                 PRESTON
                        It’s cool. I’ll just get a Redbull.

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s fruit juice. Come on! You 
                        just joined Manhattan’s innermost 
                        circle of divine. We! Celebrating!

           Off of Preston’s uncertain face...

           INT. GAY CLUB BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sal cuts lines of cocaine on a bathroom sink counter with his 
           credit card. Cameron and Daniel futz with their hair in the 
           mirror. Timmi hands Preston a rolled-up $20 bill.

                                 TIMMI
                        It’s bad for your nose if you use 
                        anything less than a twenty.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh. Well, guess I can’t turn down a 
                        fuck-you to Andrew Jackson...

           They snap. Preston is still nervous, though. He slowly leans 
           down to a line. Until, KNOCK-KNOCK at the door. He jumps.

                                 DANIEL
                             (yelling to door-knocker)
                        Excuse you! I have a hi-fiber diet!

                                 CAMERON
                        Preston? You truly don’t have to if 
                        you don’t want. We’re friends here. 
                        We just want you to be comfortable.

           And suddenly, upon hearing this, Preston is. Confidently, he 
           leans down, puts the $20 to his nose, and inhales a line.

                                 SAL
                        That’s it, honey. Get your LIFE.

           As Preston LIFTS his head, experiencing a rush, we CUT to...

           INT. GAY CLUB DANCEFLOOR - LATER

           Nnst. Nnst. Hard club music blasts as we see FLASHES of the 
           boys enjoying huge fun on the dance floor. We see:
           - Sal snorts bumps of cocaine off a key ring.

           - Cameron passes out drinks for the other guys.

           - Daniel rubs his finger on his gums while he dances.

           - Timmi, shirtless, makes out with a boy on the floor.

           - Preston smiles, vogues, gets his aforementioned life.

           INT. CAMERON’S LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Preston wakes up fully clothed on a sofa, his drool all over 
           an animal-hyde pillow. He turns it over. Hungover in the 
           daylight, he winces at his phone. There’s a TEXT.

           From Jake: Hope you feeling better after yesterday, my OG.

           Preston looks at this with guilt-stricken appreciation. Then, 
           Cameron emerges from his room in underwear and a button-down.

                                 CAMERON
                        Good afternoon! Hope the emu-chaise 
                        was fine. You had simply too much 
                        nose fun for us to send you home.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, sorry. But thanks for that. For 
                        everything this week. It was great.

                                 CAMERON
                        Was? Summer is young! Oh, that 
                        reminds me: our favorite pop-up gay 
                        rave is next Saturday. It’s called 
                        “DickStupid.” You’re coming.

                                 PRESTON
                        Shit. I wish I could, but I have a 
                        friend visiting me next weekend.

                                 CAMERON
                        Friend? What’s his name? I’ll have 
                        Daniel add him to the V-I-P list.

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake LaPorte. But, um, is it okay 
                        that he’s straight?

                                 SAL (O.S.)
                        Ew! You’ve met a straight person?!

           Preston and Cameron look over and see that Sal has been 
           asleep this whole time under the coffee table. A damn mess.
                                 CAMERON
                             (clapping as he speaks)
                        Sal! You! Are! Literally! Thirty!

           INT. RICKSHAW INTERN CUBICLE - THE NEXT DAY

           Preston is at his computer. Unexpectedly, Baskin approaches.

                                 BASKIN
                        Preston! Want to chat in my office?

           Preston frantically closes browsers on his computer, where 
           he’s been online-shopping for new clothes.

                                 PRESTON
                        Ted! Yes! Hi! I’ll be right there.

           As Preston jolts up, Stewart shoots him an envious look.

           INT. BASKIN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Preston smiles as he struggles to sit on a beanbag across 
           from Baskin. Anything to keep the appearance of enthusiasm.

                                 BASKIN
                        So! How’s the old ‘tership treating 
                        ya so far? Learning a lot?

                                 PRESTON
                        No, yeah! It’s been so educational.

                                 BASKIN
                        Fun too, I hope! Wouldn’t want a 
                        pal like your dad to think the 
                        summer wasn’t a blast for you.

                                 PRESTON
                        Super blast.

                                 BASKIN
                        Good. ‘Cause, based on all the hard 
                        work, I’d say you’d be a stellar 
                        fit to work here after graduation.

                                 PRESTON
                        Wow. Really? I mean, yeah! I’d love 
                        it. To be in the city next year.

                                 BASKIN
                        Wonderful! That’s wonderful. Not a 
                        lot of color in tech, you know...
           Baskin chuckles, uncomfortable. Preston nods, uncomfortable.

           INT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER GYM - THAT AFTERNOON

           Jake is on an elliptical in a rinky-dink J.C.C. GYM. Unlike 
           Preston’s gym, it’s filled with unfit tweens and the elderly. 
           Apart from a janitor, Jake’s the only non-fully-white person.

           As he runs, a FITNESS GRANDMA gets on the machine next to him 
           and starts running. Faster than he does. Annoyed, Jake speeds 
           up. Annoyed back, so does the lady. Eventually, both SPRINT 
           furiously, until his earbuds jerk his iPhone, and then...

           Thud. Jake’s phone drops to the floor. Tweens look on with 
           judgmental pity. The cardio granny next to him is smug. He 
           slows. Disembarks. Picks up the phone. Its screen is cracked.

                                 JAKE
                        FUCK MY LIFE!

           A man in a yarmulke shushes, points to a sign: NO KVETCHING.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Oops. I meant:
                             (whispering, with a smile)
                        Fuck my life!

           EXT. CLEO’S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY

           Jake knocks on the door of a quaint home. A black woman 
           opens. This is CLEO: 72, scowling, a suspicious gossip.

                                 JAKE
                        Hi! I’m Jake! Here to help you scan 
                        photos? You must be Cleo.

                                 CLEO
                        I don’t have to be anybody. You’re 
                        a Hollis friend? You’re early.

                                 JAKE
                        Am I? My phone cracked at the gym.

                                 CLEO
                        Gym? Dudn’t look like you go to a 
                        gym. But come in, if you must.

           INT. CLEO’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cleo leads Jake into her living room. Walls are lined with 
           floral wallpaper and posters of paintings of MLK.
           She gestures to a clunky desktop computer on a dining room 
           table. A new, unpacked scanner sits next to it.

                                 CLEO
                        That’s the machine my son Evan and 
                        his idiot professor wife sent me. 
                        “Women’s Studies.” Foolishness.

           Cleo then gestures to dozens of large boxes of photos. Labels 
           indicate many decades worth of family photos are inside them.

                                 CLEO (CONT’D)
                        And there are all the photographs. 
                        Which my dumb-rocks daughter-in-law 
                        -- Ph.D. -- tells me to scan?

                                 JAKE
                        Well, happy to help you!

           Jake picks up one box of photos, to Cleo’s absolute horror.

                                 CLEO
                        No. No no. You don’t lay fingers on 
                        a single photo until I’ve explained 
                        everything about that photo, hear? 
                        And every person in it.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jake talks into his laptop screen, on FaceTime with Preston.

                                 JAKE
                        And she’s got a story for every 
                        one. We only got through 26 photos!

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Preston is distractedly texting while on the other laptop-end 
           of Jake’s FaceTime. Intercut with Jake.

                                 PRESTON
                        She is the church gossip. But at 
                        least she pays by the hour, right?

                                 JAKE
                        You right. Gotta stack that grandma-
                        friend paper for our N-Y-C weekend.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh. Speaking of. Do you wanna come 
                        with me to a club Saturday night?
                                 JAKE
                        Ummm, a hundred percent! Hundo per. 
                        Huh...puh...

                                 PRESTON
                        It’s a gay rave, though. That cool?

           Jake’s excitement fades. Slightly.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. Uh, sure. But is it a problem I 
                        don’t have any fake I-D?

                                 PRESTON
                        No, my friend already put your name 
                        on a VIP list. Says the bouncer 
                        won’t card or give us trouble, as 
                        long as we wear all-black.

                                 JAKE
                        Okay! Got it. All black everything.

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER FRONT HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING

           Knock on the door. Preston, party-ready in fashionable black 
           jeans and t-shirt, opens. There’s Jake in a too-tight BLACK 
           TURTLENECK and too-baggy BLACK CARGO SHORTS.

                                 JAKE
                        Y’all ready for this?!

           Jake begins grunting a techno pulse (“Nnnst! Nnnst!”) while 
           head-bobbing. Preston smiles, laughs, assumes this is a bit.

                                 PRESTON
                        Ha! Real nice outfit. Imagine...

           Jake stops Nnnst-ing. He’s suddenly embarrassed. Preston, 
           realizing Jake is embarrassed, becomes embarrassed himself.

                                 JAKE
                        Is it bad? This was all the black 
                        everything I had in my closet.

                                 PRESTON
                        No! Not bad! But, um, a turtleneck 
                        might get kind of hot in the club.

                                 JAKE
                        Well that’s why I packed Aquafinas 
                        in my cargo pockets. For hydration.
                                 PRESTON
                        Great! Besides, nobody can really 
                        see black inside a club anyway. So, 
                        um...ain’t nobody gonna judge! Ha.

           INT. CAMERON’S APARTMENT - THAT NIGHT

           CUT to Cameron, Daniel, and Timmi, who look shell-shocked 
           upon meeting Jake in this outfit. Preston stands by, nervous.

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh, you’re Jake. I assumed from the 
                        name that Preston met you in Paris.

                                 PRESTON
                        LaPorte? No, Jake’s half-Haitian.

                                 DANIEL
                        Ah. So parlez français, at least?

                                 JAKE
                        Nah. My pops left when I was a kid. 
                        Or as they say in Klingon: ghubDaQ!

           Jake chuckles, makes Vulcan salute. The others grin, uneasy.

                                 CAMERON
                        Can I get you a drink, Jake?

                                 JAKE
                        Sure. Do you have any IPA?

           Timmi shrieks. He then covers his mouth, apologetically.

                                 PRESTON
                        I’ll make you a whiskey-ginger.

           Cameron and Preston head to the kitchen. Timmi, Daniel and 
           Jake sit down. A pause as all search for anything to say.

                                 JAKE
                        Thanks for inviting me out with you 
                        guys tonight.

                                 DANIEL
                        Thank you for joining! I know a lot 
                        of straight boys would shy away, 
                        for fear they weren’t wanted.

                                 JAKE
                        I’ve actually heard gay bars are an 
                        awesome place to meet chicks.
                                 TIMMI
                        Well, gay bars exist on a spectrum. 
                        On one end, LGBT-friendly: bars for 
                        female besties and straight 
                        tourists. Tonight’s club is more of 
                        a, how do you say...penis dungeon!

           More uneasy grins until Cameron and Preston return with four 
           vodka-sodas and one whiskey-ginger.

                                 JAKE
                        Ooh. Thanks!

                                 CAMERON
                        Nuh-uh-ah! What do we say?

           Preston, Daniel and Timmi in unison, make crying faces:

                                 PRESTON, DANIEL, TIMMI (IN UNISON) 
                        “I THANK MY FAMILY! MY MOTHER, 
                        BLYTHE DANNER!”

           They clink glasses. Cameron clocks Jake’s confused.

                                 CAMERON
                        Gwyneth’s Oscar speech. You do know 
                        Gwyneth’s Oscar speech, yes?

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. No, I do! That’s right! Ha-ha!

           Jake holds out his glass, but the others have moved on.

                                 DANIEL
                        So tonight. That one gay partner at 
                        my firm will be there. That means I 
                        need everybody on their best and 
                        gayest behavior in the VIP section.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. I hope my outfit’s okay?

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s...fine! We’ll just say it’s 
                        “day-camp irony nouveau.”

                                 CAMERON
                        Then again. We could queer it up...

           EXT. “DICKSTUPID” WAREHOUSE BUILDING - AN HOUR LATER

           CUT to Jake, now in heavy mascara. An entire sleeve of his 
           shirt has been torn off. His Afro is scrunched in a tall bun.
           He trails Preston, who follows Cameron, Daniel and Timmi as 
           they stomp past a LONG LINE of gay men outside a warehouse 
           building. They approach a DOOR BOUNCER (40s, large, black).

                                 DANIEL
                        The name’s “Daniel Plus Four.”

           Without questioning, the bouncer lets all five of them 
           through, stamping their forearms on the way in.

           INT. “DICKSTUPID” ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           The boys enter. This party is VAST. Dark, loud, foggy -- far 
           more raw than the other gay establishments we’ve seen.

                                 CAMERON
                        Welcome to DickStupid...

           Slow-motion CLOSE-UP shots of Cameron, Daniel, Timmi and 
           Preston looking seductively at guys around the club. 

           In between, we cut to the men exchanging looks with them: an 
           older rugged BEAR; a young luminescent TWINK; a GO-GO BOY in 
           leather thong; a shaved GENDER-QUEER individual with a 
           pronounced jawline and huge diamond earrings.

           Then, a close-up shot of Jake, rubbing his eyes, watering 
           with the makeup Cameron put on.

           INT. “DICKSTUPID” DANCEFLOOR - A BIT LATER

           The boys, now holding drinks, arrive at the dancefloor. 
           There, they run into Sal. (All dialogue is club-shouted!)

                                 SAL
                        Hey girls! Refreshments?!

           Sal passes a TINY UNMARKED BOTTLE of liquid to Timmi, who 
           offers it to Jake. As Jake’s about to drink it as a shot...

                                 TIMMI
                        Don’t drink! These are poppers!

           Timmi takes the bottle back from Jake. He opens it, puts it 
           close to his nostril, SNIFFS. He then hands it to Daniel, who 
           does the same. Then Cameron. Then Preston. Jake is surprised.

                                 JAKE
                        Are poppers like...liquid cocaine?!
                                 CAMERON
                        No! Medicine for gay sex. And the 
                        best 90 seconds you’ll ever spend 
                        on a dancefloor! No side effects!

           Jake shrugs, not seeing the harm. He WHIFFS the smell-drug.

                                 SAL
                        Except for destroying brain cells! 
                        I think I read that on a podcast!

           Jake regrets it for a moment while the others dance, enjoying 
           themselves. Until, quickly, dancing is VERY fun for him too.

                                 JAKE
                        Peeb! Peeb! This is awesome!

           Preston nods. They start dance-hugging. Sal raises eyebrows 
           to the others, mouthing, “They fucking?” The others 
           aggressively shake heads: “God no.”

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Dude! Remember first grade? When we 
                        were we dressed up like Cogsworth 
                        and Lumière?!

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah?! What about it?!

                                 JAKE
                        Dunno! But now we’re in N-Y-C! And 
                        we’re together! Let’s get drunker!

           Preston laughs. But at that moment, he also spots a familiar 
           face: it’s the hot SERVER from his sister’s engagement party.

                                 PRESTON
                        I think I’m gonna stay here!

                                 JAKE
                        No! Come with!

                                 PRESTON
                        Why don’t you get me a drink?!

           Preston hands Jake two $20 bills. Jake shrugs. Too giddy!

                                 JAKE
                        You got it, dude! Unless I find a 
                        female who wants to be my G-F!

           Jake dances his way toward the bar. Preston smiles, until he 
           notices the baffled look on Timmi’s face.
                                 TIMMI
                        G-F? Like...gluten-free?

           INT. “DICKSTUPID” BAR - A BIT LATER

           Jake waits for drinks with Sal, at the bar. Jake looks back 
           at Preston, vogue-ing gleefully on the dancefloor.

                                 JAKE
                        Preston never dances like that!

                                 SAL
                        You shoulda seen him last Saturday! 
                        His pussy was on the floor!

                                 JAKE
                        Do you mean Friday night?! He 
                        stayed in last Saturday night!

                                 SAL
                        Several lines of cocaine and I beg 
                        to differ!

           Jake looks back at Preston, less admiringly this time.

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        We love Preston! It’s taken forever 
                        to find the right kind of black 
                        friend for us! Inclusivity, right?!

           Jake nods, puzzled. He sees Cameron hug Preston before taking 
           off for the VIP area with Timmi and Daniel. Preston stays.

                                 SAL (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna find an escaped Mennonite 
                        who wants to sit on my face! Byeee!

           Sal takes off as Jake’s two drinks arrive at the bar. Jake 
           grabs both. Looking around, he spots a goth woman. He nods at 
           her: ”sup?” She shakes her head. He still approaches, smooth:

                                 JAKE
                        Got a fetish for straight guys?!

           He holds up one of the drinks for her. She, in turn, holds up 
           a Post-It, which reads: DIDN’T COME TO BE HARASSED. She then 
           grabs both drinks from Jake and storms off.

           INT. “DICKSTUPID” DANCEFLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Preston inches to the hot server. They make focused eye 
           contact. Until the guy introduces himself as RAF.
                                 RAF
                        I’m Raf! How do I know you?!

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m Preston! I was at a party you 
                        catered on Long Island last week!

                                 RAF
                        Right! Those fancy people! So 
                        uppity! How did you know them?!

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, just...family friends!

                                 RAF
                        Well, fancy boy! You’re gorgeous!

                                 PRESTON
                        Sorry, I can’t hear you! What?!

                                 RAF
                        I said you’re deaf!

           Raf smiles. Then, he leans in to KISS Preston. After a beat, 
           Preston leans out, stunned. But before he can think of any 
           excuse not to, Preston leans back in. He kisses Raf again.

           INT. “DICKSTUPID” VIP AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Jake, now more drunk, looks for Preston. He can’t find him. 
           But, oh! He spots Daniel, Cameron and Timmi in the roped-off 
           VIP area. Jake waves, excited. They wave back, unexcited.

           Jake walks right up to the area, where a VIP BOUNCER (white, 
           ripped, stylish) stops him. He points to the sign: VIP ONLY.

                                 JAKE
                        Jake LaPorte! I’m on the list!

                                 VIP BOUNCER
                        This is VIP. Celebrities and Andy 
                        Cohen come here. Can I see I-D?

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. I...lost it! But don’t worry!

           Jake shows his forearm stamp he got on the way in. It reads: 
           DICKSTUPID: OVER 21 / OVER *IT*

                                 VIP BOUNCER
                        Yet you can’t verify being a VIP, 
                        21, or over it? How did you sneak 
                        in here, kid?
                                 JAKE
                        Sneak in? No, I’m with that guy! 
                        Daniel, um...Plus-Four!

                                 VIP BOUNCER
                             (turning to Daniel)
                        Daniel! You with this child? ‘Cause 
                        if you are, you can’t stay up here!

           Daniel gets sudden judgmental looks from older VIPs. Then, an 
           innocent, pleading look from Jake. Daniel seems torn.

                                 DANIEL
                        I, uh...have...no idea who that is!

           The VIPs look relieved. As the bouncer turns back to Jake, 
           Daniel mouths, “I’m so sorry, I’m the worst!” and mimes being 
           hung on a cross. Jake, annoyed, responds to the bouncer.

                                 JAKE
                        Fine, whatever! I’ll stay away from 
                        this dumb-ass VIP area!

                                 VIP BOUNCER
                        “VIP area?” Listen, Teenage Mutant 
                        Cargo-Turtle. You better leave this 
                        entire club before I call security.

                                 JAKE
                        WHAT?! No, I need my friend, he’s --

                                 VIP BOUNCER
                        Care to point out your little 
                        boyfriend so we can remove him too?

           Jake looks to the floor, where he now sees Preston. Kissing 
           Raf. Preston looks unfamiliarly happy, desirous, desired. 
           Jake, blank expression, doesn’t point to Preston, or his man.

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t see him. I’ll just go.

           INT. “DICKSTUPID” DANCEFLOOR - A MOMENT LATER

           Back on the floor, Preston emerges from a kiss with Raf.

                                 PRESTON
                        Want me to get us VIP drinks?

                                 RAF
                        VIP? Sure, fancy boy!
                                 PRESTON
                        I promise I’m not that fancy! It’s 
                        just, my friend’s up there, and --

           Raf kisses Preston, shutting him up. Then clutches his face.

                                 RAF
                        Give me your number! In case you 
                        can’t find me later!

                                 PRESTON
                        There’s no service in here! I 
                        promise I’ll be back, okay?

           Preston kisses him again. Then smiles, nods, and takes off.

           INT. “DICKSTUPID” VIP AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Preston walks up to the bouncer who kicked Jake out. He gets 
           in without any trouble, then walks up to Cameron, Daniel, 
           Timmi, now with Sal. They dance among the older VIP crowd.

                                 DANIEL
                        There you are! This night is amaze! 
                        I’m gonna get like seven promotions 
                        by the time I black in.

                                 CAMERON
                        Whose face have you been sucking?!

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh! A guy I met last week! At my 
                        sister’s engagement party!

                                 SAL
                        Your sister’s fiancé is gay?! Hot!

                                 PRESTON
                        What?! No! Anyway, where is Jake?!

                                 TIMMI
                        Jake?! Oh, right! Jake! The bouncer 
                        carded him and asked him to leave!

           There’s a sudden look of horror on Preston’s face.

                                 DANIEL
                        I felt so bad! Let me know where I 
                        can send him an Edible Arrangement.

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake got kicked out?! Is he okay?!
           Preston looks at his phone. No texts. No service. And, after 
           barely a moment, no battery.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        This fucking battery! FUCK! I need 
                        to go find him!

           Sensing Preston’s freak-out, Cameron pulls him aside.

                                 CAMERON
                        Babe? Calm! Jake’s better off! This 
                        place isn’t for him! It’s for you! 
                        And that hot man, who wants to have 
                        sex with you! Okay?! Don’t hold 
                        yourself back for some...pen-pal!

                                 PRESTON
                        Pen-pal?! No! I can’t leave Jake 
                        out there! He’s gonna hate me!

           Preston bolts out of the VIP area. His friends don’t stop 
           him, but they also don’t join.

           As Preston heads to the exit, Raf notices him leaving. He 
           looks at his phone, disappointed to not have that number.

           EXT. “DICKSTUPID” WAREHOUSE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Panicked, Preston stumbles outside. Runs up the street. The 
           line is still huge, but no sign of Jake. Preston hails a cab.

           EXT. FLATIRON DISTRICT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Preston jumps out of the cab outside his building. No Jake.

           He runs up his block. Then, as Preston paces by a 99¢ pizza 
           joint, he stops. In the WINDOW, he sees Jake, sitting alone.

           INT. 99¢ PIZZA JOINT - CONTINUOUS

           Preston slowly enters the pizza joint. He sits down across 
           from Jake. Jake glares at him. Blankly. Neither says hello.

                                 PRESTON
                        Did you...order a niçoise salad? At 
                        a 99-cent pizza joint?

           We see Jake’s paper plate: stale, browning romaine lettuce, 
           black olive rounds, and a cylinder of canned tuna on it.
                                 JAKE
                        A man in a corset tonight told me I 
                        should lay off cheese for a while.

                                 PRESTON
                        Look, man. I get you’re probably 
                        pissed that I --

                                 JAKE
                        That you had to babysit me in front 
                        of all your very important people?

                                 PRESTON
                        Okay. I get it. You’re mad.

                                 JAKE
                        I’m not mad. I was. I mean, I hated 
                        tonight. And then, on my way out, 
                        you were kissing that guy...

                                 PRESTON
                        I shouldn’t have left you to --

                                 JAKE
                        Shut up. I saw you with him, and it 
                        was like: “Oh shit. I’ve never seen 
                        P.B. mack on a dude.” But it was 
                        also like: Oh. Shit. I’ve never 
                        seen P.B. that...relaxed.

                                 PRESTON
                        I definitely wasn’t relaxed.

                                 JAKE
                        Normal, then. Normal. Just a person 
                        liking...kissing another person -- 
                        while, I dunno, songs are playing.

           Preston cracks a half-smile. Jake continues on, bittersweet.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        And your friends don’t have to like 
                        me. And I don’t have to like them. 
                        But if they -- that -- makes you 
                        feel normal? Then it’s whatever. As 
                        long as we can keep us...us.

           A pause. Preston registers all that Jake’s just said.

                                 PRESTON
                        Well. That guy tonight was hot. But 
                        know who else is hot? Khadijah’s 
                        upstairs doctor-neighbor in the 
                        Living Single we about to watch.
                                 JAKE
                        The brother from Best Man Holiday?

                                 PRESTON
                        Mm-hmm! Brother’s fine in The Best 
                        Man Holiday.

           They ease up. Laugh. Back to regularly scheduled banter.

           INT. CHELSEA GYM - NIGHT

           Two nights later, Preston walks with Cameron through the gym.

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh, Saturday night? Ended on a roof 
                        pool with some fugly models.

                                 PRESTON
                        Sorry again that I stormed.

                                 CAMERON
                        No, I’m sorry. About your friend. 
                        But mainly that you missed out on 
                        that hot caterer’s number!

                                 PRESTON
                        Same. But I’ve run into him twice, 
                        so maybe I’ll see him again.

                                 CAMERON
                        Don’t keep yourself chaste, though, 
                        for summer ramp-eth up. Are you 
                        free for Bastille Day?

                                 PRESTON
                        French Independence Day? Should be.

                                 CAMERON
                        I got us invited to a huge gay 
                        party in the Hamptons. And Daniel 
                        secured an Airbnb so we can make a 
                        full Balsamic weekend out of it.

                                 PRESTON
                        Definitely won’t miss that.

                                 CAMERON
                        Good. And until then, clear your 
                        schedule for every night this week.

           Preston’s eyes widen. Deep breath. And then, we enter a 
           MONTAGE showing his and Jake’s respective weeknights...
           INT. CAMERON’S LIVING ROOM / INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN

           “Just Friends” by Amy Winehouse plays as we CUT between 
           Cameron’s living room -- BALSAMICS having fun -- and Jake’s, 
           where he is alone, eating, on his laptop checking Instagram.

           In each frame, outfits change (Balsamics in stylish going-out 
           clothes, Jake in tees and shorts) to mark passage of time.

           BALSAMICS: Drinking shots and vogue-ing before going out.

           JAKE: Eats a Lean Cuisine meal. On Instagram, we see a photo 
           Jake posted with Preston that weekend. New NOTIFICATION: 
           Preston LIKED the photo. Jake smiles.

           BALSAMICS: Returning drunk, after a different night out.

           JAKE: Drinks Fresca. On Instagram, he clicks LIKE on a new 
           sketch Alyssa posted.

           BALSAMICS: Drinking cocktails, watching RuPaul’s Drag Race.

           JAKE: Eats peanut butter toast. On Instagram, his black 
           classmate Erika kissing her boyfriend.

           BALSAMICS: Sal cuts himself a HUGE line of cocaine. Daniel 
           tap his shoulder, judgmental. Sal rolls his eyes, then 
           divides the line of cocaine into five.

           JAKE: Eats ice cream. On Instagram, a pic Preston’s posted 
           with his gay friends. Jake looks at it, annoyed. He hovers 
           over the LIKE button. Click? Click. Reluctantly.

           BALSAMICS: All five drunk in brightly-colored wigs. Timmi 
           pulls back Sal’s yellow wig as he vomits into a marble vase.

           INT. CLEO’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The next week, Jake sits on the couch in Cleo’s living room 
           while she goes through photos, one by one. He takes notes.

                                 CLEO
                        This is my sister Barbara, back 
                        when we lived in Ohio. I already 
                        explained what Ohio is, didn’t I?

                                 JAKE
                        Cleo? It might save time if I can 
                        scan photos while you explain them.
                                 CLEO
                        Then how on earth are you supposed 
                        to take notes at the same time?

           As Cleo scowls, a PING on Jake’s phone. His face lights up. 
           TEXT from Alyssa: Any chance you can do me a HUGE favor?

           INT. IKEA PARKING LOT - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Jake and Alyssa carry a heavy box from IKEA to his car.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Thanks again for the hand. I had no 
                        idea you loved IKEA so much.

                                 JAKE
                        Duh! Swedish people are like the 
                        Aryan race -- but instead of hating 
                        on Jews, they were like, “Yo. Let’s 
                        help them build kitchen islands.”

           Alyssa laughs as they open the trunk to put the box in.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        So, um. Think you can make it to my 
                        birthday party on July 8th?

                                 ALYSSA
                        Yeah! Is it weird if Erin comes? 
                        Since Hollis like...dissed her?

                                 JAKE
                        No! She totally should! And trust 
                        me, P.B. didn’t want to diss her. 
                        He’s just...he wouldn’t diss a fly.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Aww. That’s sweet? I, however, say 
                        flies are ugly as fuck.

           Jake laughs as he shuts the trunk.

           INT. RICKSHAW INTERN CUBICLE - MORNING

           Preston, at the desk with nothing to do, is on Google. 

           He searches: raf catering guy. Then: caterers named raf in 
           long island or nyc. Then: catering raf, gay, earrings, hot.

           Stewart wheels his desk chair up next to him.
                                 STEWART
                        Yo! I know you missed the first 
                        three games, but you’re still in 
                        for team jerseys, right? They’re 
                        gonna say, get this: “Kick-shaw.”

           Preston, in an unusually confident, matter-of-fact moment:

                                 PRESTON
                        Look, I’m gonna be honest. I don’t 
                        enjoy playing team sports.

                                 STEWART
                        Really? No hoop dreams?

                                 PRESTON
                        None. I think people should sell 
                        candy on subways to support tall 
                        black kids who hate basketball.

           Stewart, stunned by this self-assuredness, wheels away.

           Preston turns back to his computer. A new e-mail has just 
           popped up. Its title: YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED...

           He opens a Paperless Post, with the header: BASTILLE day GAY. 
           As Preston reads the text, we hear an American man’s voice:

                                 INVITATION (V.O.)
                        Garçons -- it seems July is upon 
                        us, and that means one thing: we 
                        are not celebrating America.

                        Instead, save your red, white and 
                        blues for a rich gay celebration of 
                        rich gay France.

                        Hot friends and Bel Amis welcome to 
                        the Hamptons for top-shelf liquor, 
                        top-shelf bottoms, Parisian techno, 
                        couture shirtless-ness, a sex mime, 
                        and motherfucking liberty.

           Preston gulps, excited. Until:

                                 CAMERON’S VOICE
                        Allons enfants de la party of the 
                        summer. July 8th.

           A look of PANIC on Preston’s face. He checks his calendar. On 
           July 8th, sure enough: JAKE’S 21st BDAY PARTY. Fuck.
           INT. CHELSEA ART GALLERY - NIGHT

           Preston, Cameron, Daniel and Timmi stand together at a 
           crowded art gallery, plastic wine glasses in hand.

                                 CAMERON
                        What do you mean you can’t go? You 
                        said you’d be in for the weekend!

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah, but I assumed the Bastille 
                        Day party was on July 14th.

                                 DANIEL
                        No! The hosts go to Ethiopia on the 
                        12th, to adopt a baby or something.

                                 TIMMI
                        Meaning the weekend before will be 
                        epically naughty. 1pm ‘til sunrise.

                                 PRESTON
                        I’m sorry! I really have to be in 
                        Huntington that Saturday night for 
                        my friend Jake’s birthday party.

                                 DANIEL
                        Aw. He having it at Chuk-E-Cheez?

                                 CAMERON
                        Look, both are on Long Island. So: 
                        take Friday off, limo-bus with us 
                        for a Montauk night, make an early 
                        French cameo so we can all pose for 
                        photos -- a must -- then do Jake’s 
                        for a hot ninety, then come back 
                        for more Bastille debauchery. Okay? 
                        C’est la only fucking option.

           INT. PRESTON’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Preston is on his laptop. Another FaceTime call with Jake. 

           On his TV screen, we see a scene between the two male 
           roommates on LIVING SINGLE, the suave businessman Kyle (T.C. 
           Carson) and the lovable handyman Overton (John Henton).

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - CONTINUOUS

           Jake is on the other end of this FaceTime call, with the same 
           LIVING SINGLE scene cued up on his TV. Intercut with Preston.
                                 JAKE
                        Dude, we’re still just like Kyle 
                        and Overton from Living Single. I’m 
                        the lovable folksy romantic. You’re 
                        a type-A professional with all that 
                        European flare. Don’t you think?

           Preston seems unconvinced. Besides, his mind is elsewhere.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, hey. Just wanted to check. Your 
                        party is still on July 8th, right?

                                 JAKE
                        A-K-A my date of birth! Get ready, 
                        dude. Mom just ordered a keg!

                                 PRESTON
                        Gotcha. ‘Cause I just realized 
                        that’s the same day as this other 
                        thing I stupidly said I’d go to.

           Jake suddenly becomes sullen. Preston tries to play it cool.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. You’re...ditching my birthday?

                                 PRESTON
                        No! No. The other thing’s a daytime 
                        party, on Long Island. I was just 
                        checking your date to make sure I 
                        should take off work that Friday to 
                        stay at some Airbnb thing. Which 
                        would mean I definitely, two-hundo 
                        percent can get to your party.

                                 JAKE
                        Uh huh. Well. You know Huntington’s 
                        not that close to Fire Island.

                                 PRESTON
                        Don’t worry! It’s not in Fire 
                        Island! It’s in the Hamptons.

           INT. CLEO’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cleo is in the middle of more long-winded photo explanations. 
           She seems slightly more comfortable with Jake.

                                 CLEO
                        And here’s Lester, the one who sold 
                        insurance to Harry Belafonte, 
                        wearing a green tie...
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLEO (CONT'D)
                             (next photo)
                        And here’s Lester, the one who sold 
                        insurance to Harry Belafonte, 
                        wearing a red tie...

           Jake, taking notes, looks both bored and agitated.

                                 CLEO (CONT’D)
                        And here’s Lester’s cousin Cy, who 
                        became a homosexual in 1971. Oooh, 
                        Lester was mad when that happened! 
                        Almost stopped selling insurance.

                                 JAKE
                        Was Lester mad because Cy started 
                        acting and dressing differently? 
                        And then stopped hanging out with 
                        Lester? To spend all his time with 
                        richer, better-looking gay cousins?

           Cleo is stunned by this angry flare-up from Jake.

                                 CLEO
                        No. Lester was mad because Lester 
                        was a homo-phobic. You’re...not a 
                        homo-phobic, are you?

                                 JAKE
                        What?! No! My best friend is...
                             (realizing he can’t say)
                        ...friends with a gay person.

                                 CLEO
                        Okay. And you’re not secretly in 
                        love with that person, are you?

                                 JAKE
                        What?! No!

           INT. RICKSHAW KITCHEN PANTRY - DAY

           Preston, spotting Baskin in the kitchen pantry, gets up from 
           his desk to fill up a coffee next to him.

                                 BASKIN
                        Preston! How’s the family?

                                 PRESTON
                        They’re good! Oh, except. Actually? 
                        My grandma is...not well. Had a 
                        fall. In fact, she’s having hip 
                        surgery next Friday. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PRESTON (CONT'D)
                        She wanted me to be there, but I 
                        told her I had to work, of course.

           Preston’s twisted story works on Baskin, pitying him.

                                 BASKIN
                        Absolutely be there for it. I’m 
                        sorry, pal. Take Friday! I’ll email 
                        your dad to express my sympathy.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, maybe don’t, actually. He’s a 
                        bit touchy about it all.

                                 BASKIN
                        Right. I know from Pebble Beach how 
                        he gets about showing weakness!

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Preston packs new designer underwear in a bag. From outside, 
           he hears HONKING, fun shrieks, the French national anthem.

           Peering out the window, he sees an SUV-STRETCH-LIMO. Daniel, 
           Timmi and Cameron peer up at him, standing out of a sun roof.

                                 CAMERON
                        Commuting is such a drag. No?

           INT. PARTY LIMO - A BIT LATER

           Inside the party limo, Cameron, Preston, Timmi and Daniel, 
           are passing a bottle of Grey Goose around, taking swigs.

                                 TIMMI
                        Okay: Four gals. Hamptons weekend. 
                        Which Sex and the City ladies are 
                        we? I say Cameron is tall Carrie. 
                        Daniel’s short Miranda.

                                 DANIEL
                        Proud of it, you Y-chromosome 
                        Samantha! I suppose that means 
                        Preston is black Charlotte.

                                 PRESTON
                        Wait. One of them was black?

                                 DANIEL
                        No. You’re the black version of -- 
                        hold on a second! Have you never 
                        seen Sex and the City?
                                 PRESTON
                        Never. Sorry...?

           Gasps from Cameron, Daniel and Timmi. Much horror and pity.

                                 CAMERON
                        You grew up closeted, with older 
                        sisters, and didn’t watch Sex and 
                        the City? How did you learn about 
                        being a single woman circa 1998?

                                 PRESTON
                        I watched Living Single?

                                 DANIEL
                        Living Single? What’s that?

                                 PRESTON
                        A comedy about three black women 
                        who live in New York City. And a 
                        fourth black woman who’s a lawyer.

                                 CAMERON
                        So it’s black Sex and the City?

                                 PRESTON
                        Not exactly. There were also two 
                        guys who are their neighbors, so --

                                 TIMMI
                        So it’s black Friends? It doesn’t 
                        matter. Let’s watch it tonight!

           INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

           Jake is scrolling through photos of Preston on Instagram.

                                 NANCY (O.S.)
                        Jakey? We have to go to Costco!

           He sees photos of the four Balsamic friends, all having fun 
           on the beach in Montauk. Jake is visibly angered by this.

                                 NANCY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        JAKEY! COST! CO!

           INT. COSTCO - A BIT LATER

           Nancy and Jake are buying bulk items for Jake’s party.

                                 NANCY
                        Is P.B. on Long Island yet?
                                 JAKE
                             (mocking fancy voice)
                        Yep. But he’s in Montauk.

                                 NANCY
                        Honey? Has there been weirdness 
                        between you and P.B. this summer? I 
                        didn’t want to pry, but seems like 
                        things have kind of...changed?

                                 JAKE
                        If I tell you something, can you 
                        promise to not tell his parents?

                                 NANCY
                        Of course. Therapist-son 
                        confidentiality.

                                 JAKE
                        Well. He came out. Like, came out.

                                 NANCY
                        Wow! Good for him! I mean, I always 
                        figured he might be. I’m guessing 
                        you did too, right?

           Jake disregards this question. His tone gets whiny.

                                 JAKE
                        Anyway. Ever since he told me, he’s 
                        been so...superficial. Like, he now 
                        diets? And works out all the time?

                                 NANCY
                        Maybe he now cares how he looks to 
                        potential sexual partners. Which he 
                        never had to in the closet.

                                 JAKE
                        But...no! ‘Cause he also now spends 
                        all his time with other superficial 
                        guys. And they like, go out as a 
                        group! And have weird inside jokes!

                                 NANCY
                        Honey? Sounds like he’s just having 
                        a typical, positive gay experience.
                             (beat)
                        You’re not a homophobe, are you?

                                 JAKE
                        What? No!
                                 NANCY
                        Good. And...you’re not secretly in 
                        love with Preston, are you?

                                 JAKE
                        NO!

                                 NANCY
                        Okay! Okay! Just asking...

           INT. MONTAUK AIRBNB LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           A Montauk Airbnb after sundown. On a dining table are empty 
           tequila bottles, half-empty plates of sushi. We hear...

                                 LIVING SINGLE THEME SONG (O.S.)
                        We are living...single!
                        Ooo, and in a ‘90s kinda world,
                        I’m glad I got my GIRLS!

           Preston, Daniel, Timmi and Cameron stretch out on couches. On 
           the TV, they watch the opening credits for LIVING SINGLE.

                                 DANIEL
                        Queen Latifah? She acted in a T.V. 
                        show before she was in Chicago?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. But this was after she was 
                        already a hip-hop star.

                                 TIMMI
                        Queen Latifah was a hip-hop star?

                                 CAMERON
                        Shut up. This looks fun!

           INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Jake wakes up, expressionless. He looks at his phone. There’s 
           an Instagram notification. He’s been tagged in a post.

           He opens it: Preston has posted a photo of Jake and Preston, 
           at age five. They are in costume, respectively, as the clock 
           and candelabra from Disney’s BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.

           The Instagram caption reads: “HAPPY BDAY to BFF and OG 
           @jakelaporte...forever the #cogsworth to my #lumière”

           Jake snorts. He lets out an uncontrollably happy smile.
           INT. MONTAUK AIRBNB BATHROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

           Preston is applying moisturizer in a bathroom mirror. PING. 
           He gets a TEXT on his phone. 

           From Jake: <3 the pic, bro. You an UGLY-ASS enchanted clock!

           Preston laughs. Smiles. He types two TEXTS back...

           One reads: Fuck off, dude.
           The next reads: KIDDING! HAPPY BDAY! CAN’T WAIT FOR TONIGHT.

           INT. MONTAUK AIRBNB LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

           Preston walks into the living room. Cameron, Daniel and Timmi 
           are lying on the couch, still watching Living Single.

                                 PRESTON
                        Doesn’t the party start at 1?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yeah, but nobody who isn’t trash 
                        shows up on time.

                                 TIMMI
                        Besides, I need more Living Single!

                                 CAMERON
                        While you were in the bathroom we 
                        decided you’re the Khadijah in our 
                        group. Type A diva, but not bitchy 
                        than Daniel. He’s obviously Maxine. 
                        I’m Régine. Timmi’s Synclaire.

                                 PRESTON
                        So I’m the Queen Latifah? Huh. My 
                        friend always said I’m like Kyle.

                                 CAMERON
                        Honestly? Kyle? A straight man?

                          DANIEL
                                                          TIMMI
           Wow, definitely not. 
                                              That’s so cruel.

                                 PRESTON
                        Well, I should leave Bastille Gay 
                        by 4, so...let’s get ready soon?

                                 DANIEL
                        Ugh. Fine! But that right there?
                        Total Khadijah move.

           The other boys snap in agreement.
           EXT. BASTILLE PARTY ENTRANCE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           In slow motion, the boys stomp up to a huge Hamptons house. 
           We close up on their respective Bastille Day looks:

           - PRESTON: black-striped muscle tee, red neckerchief, beret

           - DANIEL: a crop top that reads JE FUCKS WITH SAINT-TROPEZ

           - CAMERON: floor-length kaftan colored like the French flag

           - TIMMI: the word Dior painted in gold on his shirtless chest

           EXT. BASTILLE PARTY BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           The boys step into a poolside backyard, rosé glasses in hand. 
           We see a hot-tub, a DJ on stage, French décor. Only a dozen 
           or so older gay men stand around. It’s nothing wild.

                                 PRESTON
                        This is...nice!

                                 DANIEL
                        I didn’t custom-bleach my hole for 
                        “nice.” We were promised epic.

           The guys all look dismayed. Except for Preston, who seems 
           fairly relieved as he looks at his watch.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Nancy pours Fritos into a bowl as Jake eats raw celery. From 
           the window, he notices a woman and 5-year-old boy approach.

                                 JAKE
                        Mom? Why’s your friend Rivkah 
                        walking here right before my party?

                                 NANCY
                        I invited her if that’s okay! She’s 
                        been lonely since the divorce.

                                 JAKE
                        And why is she with a tiny person?

                                 NANCY
                        She’s got her son Joshy this 
                        weekend. But don’t worry. They 
                        won’t disturb you or your friends!

           Jake shoots his mom a whiny look.
           EXT. BASTILLE PARTY BACKYARD - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           The Hamptons party is now slightly more crowded, but still 
           not crazy. The boys are talking amongst themselves.

                                 TIMMI
                        What?! But Tintin was hot and gay!

                                 DANIEL
                        So? You know my type. It’s kill 
                        Tintin. Marry Babar. Fuck Muzzy.

                                 PRESTON
                        On that disturbing note, I think 
                        it’s time for me to head out.

                                 TIMMI
                        But hot people are only just 
                        getting here! Come on, can’t you 
                        stay one more hour?!

           And then, Preston notices a familiar face arrive: it’s Raf.

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. I could probably swing that.

           EXT. JAKE’S BACKYARD - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Two kids run around Jake’s yard while Nancy and three friends 
           sit around drinking wine. Rap music blasts. Jake stands by 
           himself, testing the keg as he pours himself a beer.

           Then, Alyssa and Erin walk in. Jake greets them, anxious.

                                 JAKE
                        Alyssa! Erin! Hey -- you’ve beat 
                        most of the crowd here.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Is this some Jewish lady mixer? 
                        Because my mom will have FOMO.

                                 JAKE
                        Ha! No. I just...worry about my mom 
                        getting lonely, y’know? So I was 
                        like, sup! Mom! Invite yo friends!

                                 ERIN
                        Wow, Jake. Alyssa says you can’t be 
                        as nice as you --

                                 ALYSSA
                        Erin?! Shut up!
           Alyssa hits her arm, embarrassed. Erin realizes she’s stepped 
           in something. Jake smiles and silently sips his beer-foam.

           EXT. BASTILLE PARTY BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING

           The party is now crowded. An Édith Piaf remix plays as boys 
           dance-sway, eyeing their options. Preston glances over the 
           crowd to Raf, who is talking to other friends.

           Then, MUSIC STOPS. On stage, a man dressed like SEXY NAPOLEON 
           shouts in a fake French accent. All eyes turn to him.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        ATTENTION! We must pause zis fête 
                        now for a petit lesson d’histoire. 
                        However, I need a volunteer who 
                        speaks French. Surely one of you 
                        homosexuels studied abroad à Paris?

                                 TIMMI
                        He did! Preston studied à there!

           Timmi lifts Preston’s arm. All eyes turn to him.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        Bien! Can you please come inside ze 
                        house to prepare, pour un moment?

                                 CAMERON
                        Yes! He can!

           Preston glares at his friends as the crowd begins clapping. 
           He then looks over to Raf, who cheers too, egging him on.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        Into ze house! Don’t be shy...

           Two shirtless men in Revolution-era trousers take Preston by 
           each arm. Fine. He finally yields. Once they walk him inside 
           the house, Sexy Napoleon addresses the crowd again.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        Monsieurs et Monsieurs! We are 
                        gazzered here to celebrate ze 
                        independence of France. Ze Storming

                        album, Ze Emacipation of Mimi...

           Laughs from the crowd at this cultural in-joke.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        But before we rip off our culottes, 
                        we must punish those who punish us.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        Oppress those who oppressed us. But 
                        who in zis 1789 French kingdom, I 
                        ask you, is our enemy?

           A man in the crowd calls out.

                                 CROWD MAN
                        Um. Marie Antoinette?

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        Mais oui! Marie Antoinette! Queen 
                        of Versailles! She who scorned us. 
                        Mocked us. Who upon learning of our 
                        suffering, shouted: “Let zem eat 
                        cake!” Hohn. Imagine. Telling a 
                        nation of closeted homosexuels to 
                        eat les dense simple carbohydrates!

           More laughs from the crowd.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        So! Before our true celebration can 
                        begin...we must take down zis 
                        oppressive monarch. And zis is why, 
                        monsieurs et monsieurs, it is time. 
                        To bring out...MARIE ANTOINETTE!

           House doors SWING open. There is PRESTON: hands tied, mouth 
           duct-taped, dressed WIG-TO-TOE in a FULL extravagant MARIE 
           ANTOINETTE COSTUME. The crowd gasps, cheers, laughs, jeers. 

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        Très belle! Guards! Bring forward 
                        ze evil queen for her trial!

           The shirtless escorts DRAG Preston to the stage and sit him 
           on a THRONE. They RIP the duct tape off his mouth and begin 
           applying lipstick and blush to his face. The crowd loves it.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        Her majesty! Do you confess you are 
                        Marie Antoinette, Queen of France?

           Preston doesn’t want to participate. He looks out at Timmi, 
           Cameron and Daniel. Their eyes widen, delighted. Come on.

                                 PRESTON
                        Um...yes?

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        En Français! Do you confess you are 
                        ze wife of King Louis Seize?
                                 PRESTON
                        ...Oui?

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        Louder! Please! Do you confess to 
                        sins of living too extravagantly?

           This is miserable for Preston. Excruciating. 

                                 PRESTON
                        ...Oui.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        LOUDER! And do you confess, your 
                        majesty, to forsaking your people?

           He looks at a crowd of strangers. Gay. Rich. Nearly all 
           white. And this time, his response comes out as a SHOUT.

                                 PRESTON
                        OUI!

           Quiet. Sexy Napoleon shakes his head. Tsk-tsk-tsk. For shame.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        Well. Since her majesty confesses 
                        to the sins of a life too fabulous? 
                        We must...now...sentence her...

           A GUILLOTINE is wheeled out. The crowd GASPS. As the escorts 
           stand Preston UP, he looks devastatingly terrified.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        ...to chug a full bottle...of her 
                        nation’s finest champagne!

           The crowd cheers. A TWINK in a PERIOD BALLGOWN emerges with a 
           BOTTLE of DOM PERIGNON. He bows, presenting it to Preston.

           Preston’s eyes widen. Relief beyond belief. He CLUTCHES the 
           bottle. PRESSES it to his lips. CHUGS it in one long go. Yep.

           The crowd goes WILD. Preston LIFTS the empty bottle. Triumph.

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON (CONT’D)
                        Oui! And now zat you are absolved, 
                        please! Repeat ze motto of your 
                        people’s independence: Liberté!

                                 PRESTON
                        Liberté!

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        Égalité!
                                 PRESTON

                                 SEXY NAPOLEON
                        Fraternité!

                                 PRESTON
                        Fraterni-motha-fuckin-GOD-DAMN-té!

           Then, in his gown, Preston does it: DEATH DROP. Cheers ERUPT. 

           And then, suddenly: Confetti cannons BURST. Champagne bottles 
           POP. Strobe lights FLASH. Techno music BLARE.

           Preston stands up and looks over the crowd with dazzled 
           amazement. The party of the summer has turned the fuck up.

           EXT. JAKE’S BACKYARD - SAME TIME

           Back at Jake’s party. Barely a crowd. A few geeky-looking 
           guys. Alyssa and Erin whisper in a corner. The two children 
           bounce in a BOUNCY CASTLE. All seem bored. Jake looks bummed.

           He checks his phone. Nothing. Nancy, tipsy, calls out.

                                 NANCY
                        Jakey! Don’t you want to go in the 
                        bouncy castle?

                                 JAKE
                        No, mom. It’s okay.

                                 NANCY
                        He asks me to get him a bouncy 
                        castle? Now he doesn’t want to go 
                        in the bouncy castle!

                                 ALYSSA
                        I’ll go in the bouncy castle!

           Alyssa takes off her shoes and runs toward the bouncy castle.

                                 JAKE
                        Okay, I mean, yeah -- I’ll also go 
                        in the bouncy castle...

           EXT. BASTILLE PARTY BACKYARD - A BIT LATER

           At the now-wild Hamptons party, Cameron, Daniel and Timmi 
           pose for photos with Preston, still in Marie Antoinette drag.
                                 TIMMI
                        How amazing did that feel?!

           Preston grins, drunk on champagne and adrenaline. He looks at 
           his watch: it’s 6:48. He then looks across the crowd at Raf, 
           who waves at him, eyebrows raised.

                                 PRESTON
                        Too amazing! I need...to sober up! 
                        Think there’s coffee here?!

                                 DANIEL
                        You should take an Adderall!

                                 PRESTON
                        No! No drugs today! I really have 
                        to leave soon, for real!

                                 CAMERON
                        Adderall’s prescription, babe. Just 
                        makes you sober and alert. I’m sure 
                        Sal has some over there.

           Preston drunkenly stumbles over to Sal, who shoves dollar 
           bills into the thong of an almost-naked tightrope walker.

           EXT. JAKE’S BACKYARD - DUSK

           At Jake’s party, Alyssa and Erinn stand with Nathaniel, Finn, 
           and Adam (from the earlier house party). The boys all look at 
           their phones, laughing, mocking something. Jake walks over.

                                 JAKE
                        Sup bros. Whatcha lookin’ at?

                                 NATHANIEL
                        Dude! You never told us that P.B. 
                        Hollis is a tranny.

           Jake’s attempt at cool and casual fade. He’s confused.

                                 JAKE
                        What? What are you talking about?

                                 ALYSSA
                        Guys, you can’t say that word!

                                 FINN
                        Well, he’s at least a drag queen. 
                        And he’s definitely a homo.

                                 JAKE
                        Wait. Who told you that?
           Finn passes his phone to Jake. On Instagram, there are photos 
           of Preston, at his party, in his dress. Jake becomes sullen.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        Read these captions! “Marie 
                        Blantoinette?” “Queen Latifah of 
                        Versailles?” Look at this one:

           Jake’s sad eyes drop to a group photo: Cameron, Daniel, Timmi 
           and Preston. The caption reads: we are LIVING SINGLE #besties 
           #bffs #livingsingle #gay #ina90skindofworldimgladigotmygirls.

                                 NATHANIEL (CONT’D)
                        “We are LIVING SINGLE. Hashtag 
                        besties. Hashtag B-F-Fs. Hashtag 
                        living single. Hashtag GAY. Hashtag 
                        Ina? Ninety...Skin...Do-fworld...?”

                                 JAKE
                             (interrupting, gloomy)
                        “In a ‘90s kind of world, I’m glad 
                        I got my girls.”

           Jake looks broken. Anything but that. Alyssa clocks his mood.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Guys. Put that away. Hollis is 
                        probably gonna be here any minute.

                                 NATHANIEL
                        Really? These are from minutes ago! 
                        And there’s no hashtag latergram! 
                        Which means it has to be insta.

                                 ADAM
                        Whoa. Like, “insta...gram!” Dude!

           Adam and Nathaniel high-five. Jake, seething, passes the 
           phone back to them. He paces back into the house.

           EXT. BASTILLE PARTY BACKYARD - A BIT LATER

           Preston wades through the crowded crowd and approaches Raf.

                                 PRESTON
                        Hey there!

                                 RAF
                        Your royal highness! What happened 
                        to your “I’m not that fancy” story?
                                 PRESTON
                        Okay, I guess I’m pretty fancy! And 
                        how are you doing, gorgeous?!

           Preston, drunk, puts his hand on Raf’s chest. Raf is uneasy.

                                 RAF
                        I’m doing well! Definitely not as 
                        drunk as yourself...

                                 PRESTON
                        No! I’m sobering up! Listen, I have 
                        to leave in a minute! But can I get 
                        your number?! I really regret not 
                        getting it last time!

                                 RAF
                        Oh. Um, sure. But...

           At that moment, JASON (black, 26, cute) comes up to Raf’s 
           side with two drinks. He kisses Raf on the cheek. Preston 
           takes a step back, embarrassed.

                                 RAF (CONT’D)
                        Jason! Meet Preston!

                                 JASON
                        You mean the Queen of Versailles?!
                             (to Preston)
                        Enchantée! You are fucking divine!

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh. Thanks. Raf, I didn’t realize 
                        you, um -- how did you two meet?

                                 JASON
                        At “DickStupid” the other week!

                                 RAF
                        Yeah. That night, after we...spoke, 
                        I met Jason. And we’ve been hanging 
                        out ever since.

           Jason hands Raf one of his glasses. They clink, then kiss.

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh! That’s cool! Yeah. Anyhow, Raf, 
                        I’m uh, really sorry for --

                                 RAF
                        Don’t apologize for anything, 
                        Preston. Have a safe night.
                                 JASON
                        It was an honor, your highness!

           Deflated, Preston stumbles away from Raf. Getting dizzier and 
           dizzier in the crowd, he gets two new TEXTS on his phone.

           One from Jake: Fuck off, dude.
           And another from Jake: Not kidding.

           And then, suddenly, his phone dies.

                                 PRESTON
                        SHIT!

           EXT. JAKE’S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           The crowd finishes singing “Happy Birthday” as Nancy holds up 
           a cake in front of Jake.

                                 EVERYONE (SINGING)
                        “Happy birthday to you...”

           Jake, furious, blows out the 21 candles. They light back up.

                                 NANCY
                        Oops! Trick candles! Looks like you 
                        have to keep on wishing!

           Jake, livid, keeps blowing the candles, which keep lighting 
           back up. Nancy’s friends laugh out loud. Jake’s friends laugh 
           to themselves. Nancy’s friends’ little kids look unimpressed.

           EXT. BASTILLE PARTY BACKYARD - SAME TIME

           Preston, drunk and upset, stumbles back to Timmi, Daniel and 
           Cameron, now dancing with Sal.

                                 PRESTON
                        You guys don’t have a phone 
                        charger, do you?!

                                 DANIEL
                        No! There’s a charging station over 
                        there, but good luck getting past 
                        the Grindr hyenas.

           We see a huge line waiting desperately for battery life.

                                 PRESTON
                        Fuck!
                                 TIMMI
                        Seems like somebody’s vee thirsty 
                        for that hot caterer’s number!

                                 PRESTON
                        No! He has a boyfriend! Who he met 
                        after I left him at Dickstupid! 
                        Fuck! Tonight is just...FUCK!

                                 CAMERON
                        Whoa. Babe. Is everything okay?

                                 PRESTON
                        No! I’m fucking drunk! In a fucking 
                        gown! And my best friend knows I’m 
                        the fucking worst. FUCK!

                                 SAL
                        Jeez. I guess somebody’s Molly 
                        hasn’t kicked in yet...

           Preston’s dizziness intensifies, angrily.

                                 PRESTON
                        What? I didn’t take Molly! I only 
                        took the Adderall you gave me.

                                 SAL
                        Yeah. And “Adderall” is my code for 
                        MDMA. If you wanted Adderall, you 
                        should have asked for Adderall.

                                 PRESTON
                        Are you FUCKING serious?!

           Preston CHARGES at Sal. Cameron pulls him back, aside. On the 
           verge of tears, Preston tries to vomit into his glass. None.

                                 CAMERON
                        Preston? Friend. It’s okay. You 
                        just won’t go to Jake’s party.

                                 PRESTON
                        That’s not an option!

                                 CAMERON
                        The last time you left a party for 
                        Jake, you lost out on that caterer. 
                        Is there any reason, other than 
                        guilt, you even want to leave now?
                                 PRESTON
                        I promised him! I promised him 
                        things would stay normal with us! 
                        He just...wants me to be normal!

           Cameron puts his hands on Preston’s shoulders and speaks the 
           following with careful intention.

                                 CAMERON
                        But Babe. You’re not normal. We’re 
                        not normal. We didn’t come out to 
                        assure straight guys that we’re 
                        normal.

           Something starts to sink in to Preston: Cameron’s words? The 
           liquor? The drugs? The music? All of it.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Because, you know what? Fuck 
                        normal. We’re better than normal.

           All of it sinks in, more and more, louder and louder.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Commuting is a drag, Preston. 
                        Wouldn’t you rather just be here?

           More. More. Louder. Louder.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        Be here, friend. Be here. Be. Here.

           Preston is now fully entranced, as enter a SLOW-MO MONTAGE...

           Felix Da Housecat remix of Nina Simone’s “Sinnerman” plays as 
           we CUT between Preston, at his party, and Jake, at his.

           PRESTON: In the backyard, he sees sweaty men laughing, 
           dancing, swimming, drinking, touching.

           JAKE: In the backyard, he sees Alyssa and friends checking 
           phones and gesturing at the door, ready to leave.

           PRESTON: He sees two men sensually kissing in a hot-tub.

           JAKE: Inside his house, he sees his mom and Rivkah looking at 
           baby pictures. They point to photos, then to Jake (”Awww!”)

           PRESTON: Inside the house, he joins a crowded dancefloor. He 
           dances by himself, his MDMA trip fully kicking in.
           JAKE: Inside his bedroom, he scrolls angrily through dozens 
           of Instagram photos of Preston partying.

           PRESTON: In that costume, he starts dancing more intensely. 
           He rips off his wig, still dancing by himself.

           JAKE: He walks over to his desk. He takes out a pen and paper 
           from his drawer.

           PRESTON: He starts dancing aggressively with a RANDOM GUY.

           JAKE: He begins to write a handwritten letter. At the top, he 
           writes: Dear Mr. And Mrs. Hollis...

           PRESTON: He is now dancing aggressively with TWO RANDOM GUYS.

           JAKE: Mid-sentece, he writes words such as worried and recent 
           behavior and Preston...

           PRESTON: He and the two other guys, all high, are 
           passionately caressing each other’s bodies while they dance.

           JAKE: Mid-letter, he writes words such as spending and 
           nightlife and drugs...

           PRESTON: He takes a key bump of cocaine that one of the 
           random guys is holding up to his nose.

           JAKE: Mid-letter, he writes words such as needs to confront 
           and habits and sexuality...

           PRESTON: He lifts off the random guys’ shirts. They, in turn, 
           unbutton and lift down the top of his Marie Antoinette dress.

           JAKE: At end of note, he writes: Concerned, Jake LaPorte...

           PRESTON: He walks up the stairs with the two intimate 
           strangers in hand.

           JAKE: He walks down stairs with the sealed letter in hand.

           PRESTON: He knocks on bedroom door to check its availability.

           JAKE: He enters his kitchen and places his sealed letter in 
           the OUTGOING MAIL bin.

           PRESTON: He opens a door to a bedroom, kisses the two random 
           guys, and enters with both of them.

           JAKE: He opens the door to his refrigerator, fork in hand, 
           and removes a full party-sized bowl of macaroni salad.

           As the refrigerator door CLOSES on Jake’s face, the 
           “Sinnerman” remix ENDS and we FINISH the montage.
           INT. BASTILLE PARTY BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Preston wakes up, confused, in bed next to the two unclothed 
           guys. He sees CONDOMS on the floor next to his Antoinette 
           gown. Oh. Right. He pulls out his phone: still dead.

                                 PRESTON
                        Where the fuck are my clothes?

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - THAT SAME MORNING

           Jake, groggy from a sleepless night, dumps his empty bowl of 
           macaroni salad and a used fork into the sink.

           As he passes his mail bins, he sees the envelope addressed to 
           Mr. and Mrs. Hollis. He picks up the note. After considering 
           it for a moment, he tosses it on a blue RECYCLING BIN, piled 
           high with boxes and wrapping-paper scraps from his party.

           INT. BASTILLE PARTY KITCHEN - A BIT LATER

           Hungover in his Marie Antoinette dress -- sans wig -- Preston 
           walks into a gorgeous but debauched kitchen. He opens drawers 
           until he finds an iPhone charger.

           Once Preston plugs the charger into the wall and powers it 
           up, the screen begins flooding with TEXTS:

           From Balsamic Vinegar: Preston, where did you go?

           From Balsamic Vinegar: Kween we are WORRIED.

           From Balsamic Vinegar: Heading back to the house. Assume you 
           went to Jake’s?

           From Nancy JakesMom: Where were u tonight? Jake seems pretty 
           upset. Missed u! Xo

                                 PRESTON
                        Fuck.

           He takes his phone and makes a call:

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Hi, I need to get a cab from 
                        Montauk to Huntington, Long Island.
                             (pause)
                        FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS?
           EXT. JAKE’S STREET - TWO HOURS LATER

           Preston struggles to get his Antoinette gown out of the cab. 
           He stumbles onto Jake’s street, a lower-middle-class 
           residential street in Huntington, Long Island.

           EXT. JAKE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Preston approaches Jake’s door. Petrified. He knocks.

           Jake opens. He is wearing a headband, sneakers, gym shorts, 
           and a print t-shirt of SHAQ as a genie. Jake glares at 
           Preston. Preston half-smiles, trying to diffuse tension.

                                 PRESTON
                        Haven’t seen that shirt in forever.

                                 JAKE
                             (coldly)
                        I find it helps me jog.

                                 PRESTON
                        You jog now? That’s cool.

                                 JAKE
                        Yes. I’m on a diet. And it’s going 
                        very well, for your information.

           Preston spots the giant macaroni salad bowl in the sink. 
           Then, Jake BOLTS out the door, brushing past Preston.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Now if you’ll excuse me, Kazaam and 
                        I need to get our steps in.

           EXT. JAKE’S STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Jake puts in earbuds as he starts RUNNING. He is not very 
           fast. Even Preston, jogging in his large gown, can keep up.

                                 PRESTON
                        Look, man. I’m sorry.

           Jake pretends not to hear Preston. He angrily raps lyrics to 
           Aaron Carter’s “That’s How I Beat Shaq” as he listens to it.

                                 JAKE
                             (raps lyrics to himself)
                        “Please Aaron, are you for real?
                        One-on-one with Shaquille O’Neal?”
                                 PRESTON
                        Would you take off your headphones 
                        and talk to me? I said I’m sorry.

                                 JAKE
                             (to Preston)
                        CAN’T HEAR YOU!
                             (raps lyrics, angrier)
                        I swear I’m telling you the facts,
                        Cuz that’s how I beat Shaq...

                                 PRESTON
                        JAKE! I SAID I’M SORRY!

           Jake STOPS in place and RIPS the headphones from his ears.

                                 JAKE
                        Would you fucking STOP saying 
                        you’re sorry? “Sorry!” “Sorry!” 
                        That’s all you fucking EVER say! 
                        And you never fucking mean it.

           Preston stops running too. They’re now face to face.

                                 PRESTON
                        What do you mean I never mean it?

                                 JAKE
                        You don’t mean anything! “I’m 
                        coming to the party.” “I’ll visit 
                        you at school.” You lied about 
                        being straight for seventeen years, 
                        you’ve clearly had practice.

                                 PRESTON
                        Being in the closet isn’t the same 
                        as lying. And I’m sorry if --

                                 JAKE
                        There! Again! As if “I’m sorry” 
                        gives you permission to do every 
                        selfish everything you want. Well, 
                        I guess it’s worked! You always get 
                        every fucking thing you want...

           Jake, on verge of tears, starts RUNNING again, this time in 
           the opposite direction. Preston, now irked, follows.

                                 PRESTON
                        Since when do you know what I want?
                                 JAKE
                             (rapping lyrics again)
                        “A 3-pointer, nothing but net!
                        Come on Shaq! Had enough yet?”

                                 PRESTON
                        Has it occurred to you that the 
                        whole time we were growing up, you 
                        never bothered to actually know me?

           Jake STOPS in place again. So does Preston.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. And I suppose your new friends 
                        know you? Some rich anorexic coke-
                        heads? Who only hang out with you 
                        because they want a black friend?

           Jake starts RUNNING, again, back in the original direction. 
           Preston, now even more irked, follows again.

                                 PRESTON
                        They only want a black friend? Well 
                        that’s pretty fucking hypocritical.

           Jake STOPS again. So does Preston.

                                 JAKE
                        And what the fuck does that mean?

                                 PRESTON
                        I get your dad wasn’t around, Jake, 
                        but I don’t just exist to help you 
                        prove you’re actually black.

           Jake is now fully angry.

                                 JAKE
                        I am black. Motherfucker. More than 
                        your fucking garden-party family. 
                        So don’t talk to me about struggle.

           Preston stops shouting. He shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 PRESTON
                        Why don’t you stop feeling so sorry 
                        for yourself?

                                 JAKE
                        Why don’t you stop feeling so sorry 
                        for yourself?

           Preston, annoyed by Jake’s immature shout-back...
                                 PRESTON
                        When are you gonna stop acting like 
                        such a child?

           And then...

                                 JAKE
                        When are you gonna stop acting like 
                        such a faggot?

           That word. It lands on Preston like dirt on a coffin. 

           On Jake’s face, we can see that he immediately regrets saying 
           it. But before he can get another word out...

           PUNCH. Preston’s fist HITS Jake, square in the face. And...

           THUD. Jake FALLS to the pavement. He pants. Winded. In pain.

           Preston looks around. Not sure what he’s done. He sees 
           several NEIGHBORS who have watched the entire scene: a WHITE 
           MOTHER covers her son’s eyes; an older WHITE MAN dials a 
           number into his phone; and a WHITE HOUSEWIFE, half-hidden 
           behind a bush, holds her phone up, video-recording them.

           Upon seeing these strangers, Preston doesn’t say another word 
           to Jake. Doesn’t shout. Doesn’t say sorry. He just RUNS...

           EXT. HUNTINGTON TRAIN STATION - LATER

           Preston has been running for several miles. Panting, he 
           finally arrives at the Huntington train station.

           Upon reaching the steps of the platform, he lifts his Marie 
           Antoinette dress for his feet. However, he MISSTEPS and...

           THUD. Preston FALLS face-first on the stairs. He touches his 
           mouth, BLEEDING the same red as his lipstick. Fuck.

           INT. LONG ISLAND RAILROAD TRAIN - A BIT LATER

           Punch. Punch. We see a RAILROAD EMPLOYEE collecting tickets.

                                 ELECTRONIC TRAIN ANNOUNCEMENT
                        This is the train to: Penn Station!

           Preston, bruised with smudged makeup, sits alone in a four-
           seat booth, spreading out in his gown. A guy reading a porn 
           magazine gives judgmental looks. Preston doesn’t care today.

           Preston just stares out the window as we begin a MONTAGE of 
           the rest of this evening for him and Jake:
           Kylie Minogue’s weirdly sad, downbeat cover of her dance hit 
           “Come Into My World” plays as we follow the two hurt friends.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           Jake sits in the kitchen as Nancy, panicked, ices his face.

           INT. PRESTON’S BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT

           In the mirror, Preston removes the makeup he’s had on for 24 
           hours. He then applies new makeup to cover bruises.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jake is on his Facebook page. With a fully depressed look, he 
           types: Thanks for the birthday wishes, yo! He posts it, sad.

           INT. PRESTON’S BATHROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Preston, in workout clothes, tries to will himself to do push-
           ups. He’s haggard. After three, he fucking gives up.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jake sits with leftover cake. He scrapes off frosting that 
           reads HAPPY BIRTHDAY JAKE! He then eats the cake beneath.

           INT. 99¢ PIZZA JOINT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Preston, in the 99¢ pizza parlor around his corner, sits 
           alone at a table. He’s eating a full pizza by himself. His 
           first in a long time. He binges its old, familiar taste.

           INT. RICKSHAW INTERN CUBICLE - MORNING

           Next morning. Preston walks shyly to his desk, hoping his 
           bruises won’t be noticed. Stewart notices.

                                 STEWART
                        Rough weekend?

                                 PRESTON
                        Oh, um...yeah, I guess.
                                 STEWART
                        Did your grandma’s hip surgery 
                        happen on your face?

           Stewart’s remark suggests he’s onto Preston, who doesn’t 
           respond. He just sits down and turns on his computer.

           INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - THAT MORNING

           Jake is lying in bed, staring blankly at a YouTube video: 
           Michelle Kwan: 2002 Olympic Exhibition.

           ON SCREEN: Michelle Kwan’s exhibition performance in Salt 
           Lake City, after she lost the gold medal a second time. Kwan 
           skates in a gold dress. Tears stream down her face.

                                 SKATING COMMENTATOR (O.S.)
                        Tears of joy. Tears of sadness. 
                        More than a little irony as she 
                        skated to “Fields of Gold.”

           An empty look on Jake’s face. Then, suddenly, a PING on his 
           phone. As he looks at it, his empty look turns horrified.

                                 JAKE
                        No. Fucking. Way...

           INT. RICKSHAW INTERN CUBICLE - LATER THAT MORNING

           From his desk, Preston notices interns WHISPERING in the 
           pantry while looking his way. Assuming his face is worse than 
           he thought, Preston checks his scars with his phone camera.

           But then he notices other employees LOOKING at him. 
           WHISPERING about him. POINTING to their computers, then to 
           him. Preston also notices Stewart in Baskin’s office.

           The sound of whispers grows louder in Preston’s head. Louder. 
           Louder. Then, from behind, Baskin startles him at his desk.

                                 BASKIN
                        Hollis. Come to my office, please?

           INT. BASKIN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Preston follows Baskin into his office. He sinks into the 
           uncomfortable beanbag chair, opposite Baskin, Jed and Lest.

                                 PRESTON
                        Hey, everyone. Good weekend?
           Jed and Lest glare at him. Baskin has an impatient look.

                                 BASKIN
                        Preston, it isn’t my business how 
                        interns spend their weekends. Or 
                        dress. But when videos like this --

                                 PRESTON
                             (interrupting, confused)
                        I’m sorry -- videos like what?

                                 BASKIN
                        Don’t play pretend, okay?

           Realizing the true confusion on Preston’s face, Baskin turns 
           his laptop around. It’s open to a YouTube video, titled: Drag 
           Queen Jogger Boy Street Fight. The video already has tens of 
           thousands of views.

           Preston’s expression sinks further. He knows what he’s about 
           to see when Baskin hits play...

           ON SCREEN: We see a wide shot of Jake’s suburban Long Island 
           street. We hear the voice of a LONG ISLAND HOUSEWIFE:

                                 LONG ISLAND HOUSEWIFE (O.S.)
                        Okay. So. Drama.

           Jake in workout clothes and Preston in Marie Antoinette 
           costume come into focus. From a distance, we hear:

                                 PRESTON
                        I SAID I’M SORRY!

                                 LONG ISLAND HOUSEWIFE (O.S.)
                        See? What’d I tell you? Drama.

           For the rest of the video, we can’t make out what Preston or 
           Jake is saying, as this housewife keeps talking:

                                 LONG ISLAND HOUSEWIFE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Now I hate being nosey. But...these 
                        two are running up and down my 
                        street! Shouting! One’s dressed 
                        like a...Muppet Richard Simmons.

           She zooms in on Jake, then pans the camera over to Preston.

                                 LONG ISLAND WOMAN
                        And the black guy’s dressed like a 
                        drag queen! Not that I’m sure you’d 
                        call him a “guy.” Terms these days!

           Jake says something (inaudible) to leave Preston speechless.
                                 LONG ISLAND WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        My daughter says I now have to call 
                        everyone “they.” And I go, “I’m not 
                        the enemy here. Why on earth -- ”

           Preston punches Jake, who falls. The woman is startled.

                                 LONG ISLAND WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhh, mister-sister. He hit him! 
                        Or, I mean...they hit...them...!

           Preston turns and looks the phone right in the face.

                                 LONG ISLAND WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        No. Do they think I’m recording 
                        this? I’m not recording this...

           She pans her camera over to a bed of flowers.

                                 LONG ISLAND WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Would you look at those peonies!

           The camera CUTS to black...

           BACK IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM: Baskin, Jed, and Lest all shake 
           their heads, disappointed. Then, Jed BURSTS at Preston.

                                 JED
                        You noob! What’s the one thing we 
                        asked of you noobs?

                                 BASKIN
                        Jed? Calm! Calm.
                             (to Preston, more leveled)
                        Anyway. Preston. What’s the one 
                        thing we asked of you noobs?

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Jake sits at the table, his face in his hands. Across from 
           him, Nancy watches the video on her phone. We hear:

                                 LONG ISLAND WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Do they think I’m recording this? 
                        I’m not recording this... -- Would 
                        you look at those peonies!

           Nancy looks baffled, having now watched several times.

                                 NANCY
                        I...still don’t understand. If P.B. 
                        missed your birthday, and then came 
                        to say sorry, why did he punch you?
           Jake doesn’t respond. Just stares into his bowl of cereal.

           INT. PRESTON’S SUMMER HALLWAY - THAT SAME AFTERNOON

           Preston walks sadly into his apartment with a mostly-empty 
           banker’s box. As he comes through the door, he gets a call. 
           Deep breath. He tries to fake enthusiasm as he answers:

                                 PRESTON
                        Hi! Mom! I’m at work now, can I --

           His face sinks as he listens to her.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Oh! You saw that? Well, know how 
                        Jake and I used to make those play 
                        videos? So this weekend we --
                             (long pause)
                        Oh. Ted Baskin called?

           His face sinks further as she says more into the phone.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        Yes. I’ll pack and be home tonight.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - THAT EVENING

           Jake, on his laptop, clicks among a variety of wide-ranging 
           BLOG POSTS reacting to the video of him and Preston...

           One headline: Marie Antoinette Punching Fat Man is the 
           Weirdest Thing You’ll See This Monday.

           Another: Violent Black Man Lashes Out Against White Boy

           Another: Why Our Children Aren’t Safe Around Trans People

           Another: KWEEN of Versailles becomes Gay Viral Sensation

           Jake looks on every single one in disappointed bewilderment.

           EXT. HOLLIS FAMILY FRONT DOOR - SAME EVENING

           Preston, luggage in hand, knocks on the front door. 

           Junior opens. He glares at his son. Furious. Before Preston 
           can say anything, Junior walks away. Empty door left open.
           INT. HOLLIS FAMILY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Later that night, Preston walks through an upstairs hallway. 
           He puts his head up to a door where, off screen, Clarissa and 
           Junior are YELLING through a discussion:

                                 CLARISSA (O.S)
                        Honey! Aren’t we going to at least 
                        talk with him about it?

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        Talk? I’m not talking to that boy 
                        about his disgusting habits.

                                 CLARISSA (O.S.)
                        But maybe we should let him --

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        And cocaine use?! I didn’t raise my 
                        son to turn into some stereotype of 
                        a druggie from the projects.

           The last statement confuses Preston. Still, too sick to hear 
           another word, he pulls his head away and heads to his room.

           INT. PRESTON’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Preston walks into his childhood bedroom, covered with tiny 
           childhood SPORTSMANSHIP medals.

           As he walks to his bed, Preston gets a call. It’s Cameron. 
           Preston slowly picks up and speaks softly into the phone:

                                 PRESTON
                        Hello?

                                 CAMERON (O.S.)
                        Ugh. Finally she picks up! Babe, 
                        this video? Incredible. Literally 
                        playing at the bars right now.

           INT. “THE HUNTER” GAY BAR - SIMULTANEOUS

           Cameron is calling from a gay bar, where a BIG SCREEN is 
           showing the video of Preston punching Jake. Gay men cheer, 
           laugh, snap in excitement.

                                 CAMERON
                        You’ve out-icon’d yourself, again. 
                        Amazing. Get down here.

           Intercut with Preston on phone.
                                 PRESTON
                        Um. I can’t do that, Cameron. I 
                        can’t...see you for a while.

                                 CAMERON
                        What do you mean? You’re literal 
                        Manhattan gay royalty. This is the 
                        dream. This is what we live for.

           Preston is crying. But as he speaks, he tries to hide that.

                                 PRESTON
                        I um...need to go, Cameron.

           Preston ends the call. And then, he powers off his phone.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

           Several days later. Jake sits eating. Then, a knock on the 
           door. Jake stands to open it. To his surprise, it’s Alyssa.

                                 JAKE
                        Alyssa. Hi.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Hey! I realized it was rude of me 
                        to come to your party last week 
                        without a gift. So...here’s a gift.

           She hands him a folder adorned with a bow. He quietly opens 
           it. Inside, a biblical cartoon she’s drawn: Moses is standing 
           on Mount Sinai. But instead of the ten commandments...

                                 JAKE
                        It’s Moses holding...two posters of 
                        Do The Right Thing.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I personally imagine He Got Game 
                        would be his top Spike Lee joint. 
                        But, it’s your birthday and all.

                                 JAKE
                        Alyssa! Thanks. This is truly rad.

           He isn’t trying to perform for her. Just gives her a hug.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Um, that’s not the only reason I’m 
                        here. I came to say I, um...lied to 
                        you? I don’t have a boyfriend.

           Jake nods, slowly. Not sure how he’s supposed to react.
                                 ALYSSA (CONT’D)
                        I had one. But he treated me like 
                        shit. And, I just didn’t want to 
                        get treated like shit again.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. Um. That’s cool. I’m usually 
                        the one who gets treated like shit. 
                        Or you know, punched.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Yeah. Wanna talk about it? Some 
                        place that’ll cheer you up?

           INT. IKEA - A BIT LATER

           Jake and Alyssa sit up side-by-side on an IKEA bed, mid- 
           heart-to-heart. Both are quietly upfront as they speak.

                                 ALYSSA
                        At least I get now why Hollis was 
                        weird with Erin. But shit. Has he 
                        even apologized to you?

                                 JAKE
                        No. And, between you and me, I’m 
                        not sure he has to.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Really? What do you mean?

                                 JAKE
                        You can’t hear it on the video. But 
                        the moment before he punched me, I 
                        called him a...word. That starts 
                        with an F? And has two G’s?

                                 ALYSSA
                        Oh.

           Jake, ashamed, registers Alyssa’s disappointment in him.

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah. I know. I regret it a whole 
                        fucking lot.

                                 ALYSSA
                        Good. Because like...you’re not a 
                        homophobe, are you?

                                 JAKE
                        No, and I am not secretly in love 
                        with Preston!
           Alyssa is confused by Jake’s knee-jerk response.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. My B.

                                 ALYSSA
                        You do...love him, though, right? 
                        As a friend?

                                 JAKE
                        Maybe. I dunno. I hate what I said. 
                        But this whole summer he’s just 
                        made me feel so...ugly.

           Jake looks away. Until, Alyssa moves her pinky onto his hand.

                                 ALYSSA
                        I don’t think you’re ugly.

           He turns back. Alyssa looks into his face.

                                 JAKE
                        You only have to say that because 
                        you’re my friend.

           Alyssa shakes her head. Then, she puts her whole hand on his, 
           leans in, and kisses Jake. He smiles.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        You only have to do that because 
                        you’re my friend.

           She laughs at this joke. Then, Jake kisses her again.

           INT. AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH - MORNING

           Preston sits in church, next to his mom, dad and grandma. In 
           their Sunday best, they listen to a soprano and choir singing 
           the sorrowful Negro spiritual “Fix Me, Jesus.”

                                 SOPRANO (SINGING)
                        Fix me for my long white robes...
                        Fix me for my sorry soul...

           Clarissa puts her hand on Preston’s hand. Sympathetic. He 
           pulls it away. Both look ahead, silent, the whole time.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Nancy sits in pajamas, eating breakfast. Jake walks through 
           the door, wearing clothes from his night before. He tries to 
           play it cool as he opens the fridge. Nancy teases him.
                                 NANCY
                        And who is this stranger? Does he 
                        live here? I can’t even remember 
                        the last night he spent at home...

                                 JAKE
                        Mommmm. Shut up.

                                 NANCY
                        So Alyssa Kaplan, huh? A girl from 
                        Hebrew School...!

           She smiles to herself. Jake rolls his eyes, embarrassed.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        And to think how you used to cry: 
                        “Don’t make me go to Hebrew School! 
                        I’d rather go pee-pants again!”

                                 JAKE
                        Mommmm! I never said that.

                                 NANCY
                        Did too! Back when you were six. 
                        All because you...well, never mind.

           She quietly returns to her breakfast. Jake is now curious.

                                 JAKE
                        What? All because I what?

                                 NANCY
                        Because you...couldn’t bring P.B. 
                        You said it was lonely without him.

           Oh. Jake slumps down into a chair. Nancy takes a deep breath. 
           She recounts the following slowly, fondly, carefully.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        So I said: “I know. ‘Cause you’re 
                        not like everyone there. That’s 
                        lonely. Being different’s more 
                        lonely than being alone...
                             (beat)
                        But know what? Get used to it, stop 
                        whining, and finish your Israeli 
                        Prime Ministers coloring book!”

           Jake chuckles. Bittersweet. She smiles at him. Bittersweet. 
           He considers all this as he starts fidgeting with a napkin.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        You miss him, don’t you?
                                 JAKE
                        No. Kind of. Yeah.

           Jake stares at the napkin as he slowly tears it up. Sigh.

                                 NANCY
                        Are you still planning to go to his 
                        sister’s wedding after all this?

                                 JAKE
                        Wedding? I dunno. Doubt I’m even 
                        gonna be invited at this point...

                                 NANCY
                        What do you mean at this point? I 
                        mailed your RSVP the other week.

           Jake looks at Nancy. Confused by her casual insistence.

                                 JAKE
                        Mom, what RSVP?

                                 NANCY
                        That envelope. For Mr. and Mrs. 
                        Hollis? I saw it in the recycling 
                        and assumed Sheena knocked it over. 
                        Why? Was I not supposed to mail it?

           EXT. POST OFFICE - A BIT LATER

           Jake, panicked, SPRINTS through the post office parking lot.

           When Jake gets to the door, he pulls, pushes, pulls. It’s 
           locked. He looks at the door. Fuck.

                                 JAKE
                        Go shit yourself, Sundays!

           EXT. CLEO’S HOME - LATER THAT DAY

           Jake KNOCKS on the door until Cleo opens up, confused. She is 
           still wearing church clothes (hat way larger than her face).

                                 JAKE
                        Cleo! I need to ask you! Have you 
                        spoken to Evelyn Hollis lately?

                                 CLEO
                        Lately? No. Haven’t spoken to that 
                        woman in...two, maybe three hours.
                                 JAKE
                        Okay, so yes. Has she mentioned any 
                        news about her grandson? Bad news?

                                 CLEO
                        You must mean that his parents are 
                        keeping him at home. Since they 
                        learned he’s...like my cousin Cy. 
                        Whose brother Walter sold --

                                 JAKE
                        Cleo, do you know how his parents 
                        found out about that? Did it have 
                        anything to do with a letter?

                                 CLEO
                        A letter? Nuh uh, not a letter.

           Jake sighs. Quite relieved to hear this.

                                 CLEO (CONT’D)
                        Wait! Do you mean letter from the 
                        mail, or letter from the alphabet?

                                 JAKE
                        A letter from the mail!

                                 CLEO
                        Oh. Then, yes! Don’t know who from, 
                        though. Even Evelyn’s got no idea! 
                        Says Junior refuses to talk about 
                        it. Typical. But shouldn’t you know 
                        all this? Aren’t you his friend?

           Jake looks panicked, sorry, broken-hearted. Fuck.

           INT. PRESTON’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Preston sits alone on his childhood bed reading the queer 
           theory book HOW TO BE GAY by David Halperin.

           Suddenly, Junior BARGES in, looking upset. Preston sits up, 
           startled, like he’s been caught in some shameful act.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Preston! Get up!

                                 PRESTON
                        Dad, don’t get mad. It’s a textbook 
                        I have to read for -- 

                                 JUNIOR
                        No! It’s your grandmother. Hurry!
           INT. JUNIOR’S CAR - A BIT LATER

           Junior drives his car as Clarissa navigates from her phone in 
           the passenger seat. Both look panicked.

                                 JUNIOR
                        If she fell, why wouldn’t an 
                        ambulance have arrived yet?

                                 CLARISSA
                        We don’t know yet that she fell! 
                        Her text just says we need to find 
                        her at 575 Vanderbilt Parkway.

                                 JUNIOR
                        That’s not even close to her home. 
                        Why would she be there? I’m asking!

                                 CLARISSA
                        Honey! I don’t know!

           Preston stares out the window, frustrated, concerned.

           EXT. SPORTING COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

           Preston, Clarissa and Preston get out of the parked car and 
           start running toward a building labeled SPORTING CENTER.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Hurry up!

           Preston SPRINTS ahead to the building, out-pacing his dad.

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Okay, well slow down! Your mother 
                        can’t run that fast!

           Preston doesn’t listen. Keeps running until he’s at the door.

           INT. SPORTING COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

           Preston, Junior and Clarissa enter this COMPLETELY DARK 
           sporting center. It is silent. They call out. Echoes.

                                 CLARISSA
                        Evelyn?!

                                 PRESTON
                        Grandma?!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Mother?!
           Suddenly, we hear a CLANK: lights switching on. As they light 
           up, we see that we’re inside a large, indoor SKATING RINK.

                                 CLARISSA
                        Where are we? Is that...?

                                 PRESTON
                        ...Michelle Kwan?!

           Half-way down the rink, Olympic skater MICHELLE KWAN steps 
           and glides onto the ice. With ease, she stops in the center.

                                 CLARISSA
                        And...Jake?!

           Behind her, we see Jake, in ice skates. He STEPS on the ice, 
           HOLDS the rail, and uncomfortably PULLS his way to the Hollis 
           family’s end of the rink. He speaks into a MICROPHONE.

                                 JAKE
                        Hollises? I’m sorry if I scared 
                        you. Grandma Evelyn’s totally fine. 
                        She’s right there!

           Jake waves to BLEACHERS at the side, where Evelyn (smiling, 
           waving) and Cleo (arms folded) sit in the front row.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Mother! We thought you had a fall!

                                 EVELYN
                        A fall?! Ha! I’m never gonna die!

                                 JAKE
                        Cleo there convinced her to help 
                        me. To help me get you here today.

                                 CLEO
                        We ladies need something to talk 
                        about at bible study...

           Clarissa looks relieved. Junior looks angry. Preston looks 
           thoroughly confused. Michelle Kwan just looks on.

                                 JAKE
                        Mr. and Mrs. Hollis? I brought you 
                        here so I can say sorry to you. And 
                        your son. For writing that letter.

                                 PRESTON
                        Letter? Wait, what letter?

           Preston’s confusion grows. His parents avoid his eye contact.
                                 JAKE
                        The letter I sent your parents. Did 
                        they not tell you about it?

                                 CLARISSA
                        Your...father didn’t want to...

           Junior glares at Clarissa. Preston glares at both of them, 
           then back to Jake. Michelle Kwan is staying OUT of it.

                                 JAKE
                        Oh. Okay. Well, I was upset after 
                        my birthday. And I wanted to punish 
                        you. So, I wrote a letter telling 
                        them about your...summer.

           Preston glares at Jake. Realizing. Seething.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I never meant to mail it, Mr. and 
                        Mrs. Hollis! But, still. I should 
                        never have written it in the first 
                        place. Just like I...never should 
                        have called your son a bad word.

                                 EVELYN
                        He doesn’t mean the N-word!

                                 JAKE
                        No, a different bad word. One that 
                        also has two G’s. Not “Gargamel.”

                                 CLEO
                             (confused at the nonsense)
                        “Gargamel?”

                                 MICHELLE KWAN
                        We know what bad word you’re 
                        talking about, Jake! Move it along!

                                 JAKE
                        Right. Well, I never should have 
                        tried to hurt P.B. Because in all 
                        the time I’ve known him, he’s never 
                        wanted anything but the best for 
                        me. For everyone. So...why we gotta 
                        punish him now for wanting a little 
                        bit of best for himself?

           Clarissa looks at Preston, moved. Junior remains stoic.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I still do not understand why we’re 
                        at an ice rink. Or who she is?
           Jake wobbles over to where Michelle Kwan is standing.

                                 JAKE
                        This...is Olympic figure skater 
                        Michelle Kwan. And when your son 
                        was a kid, he thought something was  
                        wrong with him because she was his 
                        favorite athlete. Right, Peeb?

           Michelle Kwan smiles at Preston, sympathetically. He then 
           looks at his parents, who are surprised to hear all this. He 
           apprehensively decides to be honest with them.

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. That’s right.

                                 JAKE
                        Right. Well, when I was a kid, I 
                        know I was a mopey pain-in-the-ass 
                        every time the Mets lost a playoff 
                        game. Isn’t that right?

           Preston nods, and stoically snaps in agreement. We cut to 
           bittersweet looks from Michelle Kwan as Jake continues...

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        So, as I figure, you probably felt 
                        real shitty when Michelle Kwan 
                        didn’t win the gold medal at the 
                        1998 Nagano Olympics. Right?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. I did, actually.

                                 JAKE
                        And you must have been sad when she 
                        got bronze in Salt Lake City four 
                        years later. Right?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. I was.

                                 JAKE
                        And it must have been straight-up 
                        painful when, after she lost gold 
                        in 2002, she did that Olympics 
                        exhibition to the song “Fields of 
                        Gold” -- in a gold dress?

                                 CLARISSA
                        That was so heartbreaking.
           Michelle Kwan smiles back in appreciation. Preston looks at 
           his mom, surprised she knows what Jake is talking about. 
           Tearing up, Clarissa lifts her arm around Preston.

                                 JAKE
                        But someone made you think it was 
                        wrong to say you were hurting. In a 
                        way, we all did. And that’s why I 
                        want to say, in front of you and 
                        your family: I’m sorry, Peeb.

           Preston listens carefully. No longer so angry.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry you ever felt there was 
                        anything wrong with you. I’m sorry 
                        you ever felt you had to hide 
                        yourself from us. And I’m sorry 
                        that -- even when we were always 
                        together -- you had to spend your 
                        childhood so alone.

           Junior lifts his HAND and gently places it on Preston’s BACK. 
           Something that feels unfamiliar to both of them. Preston is 
           on the verge of tears. But he clamps down. Silent.

                                 CLARISSA
                        But...Jake, honey? How exactly did 
                        you get Michelle Kwan here?

           Then, from a corner behind Preston, we hear a FAMILIAR SIGH.

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh, you know. Made a call or two.

           Preston turns to see Cameron, wrapped in SPECTACULAR fur.

                                 CAMERON (CONT’D)
                        What? Had to get you to answer your 
                        texts somehow. Balsamic bitch.

           Despite the blasé tone, Cameron winks and grins at Preston.

                                 PRESTON
                        Cameron. You...? You...came to a 
                        suburban sports complex?

                                 JAKE
                        He did. And because we both missed 
                        our friend, he convinced Michelle 
                        here to skate to “Fields of Gold.” 
                        So you’d know how sorry I am.

           Preston considers. On second thought, he has another idea...
                                 PRESTON
                        Uh huh. Well. Seems to me like if 
                        you were really sorry, then you’d 
                        skate to “Fields of Gold” instead.

                                 MICHELLE KWAN
                        Yeah, I sort of agree with that...

                                 JAKE
                        What? Me skate? Nah, you really 
                        wouldn’t want to see that.

           Jake brushes it off. Preston’s parents agree with Michelle:

                         CLARISSA
           I did assume you’d be 
           skating, honestly.
                                                         JUNIOR
                                              You said the F-word, it’s the 
                                              least you can do...

                                 CAMERON
                        I cannot wait to see this.

           Cameron LIGHTS up a cigarette. Michelle Kwan STEPS OFF the 
           ice to stand next to him. She takes out her iPhone to record.

           ALL EYES ON JAKE as lights dim. He looks around as if to ask, 
           “Really?” Everybody returns looks to insist, “Mm-hmm.” Fuck.

           Eva Cassidy’s acoustic cover of “Fields of Gold” (the one 
           Kwan used at the 2002 Winder Olympics) starts to blast. And 
           with that, Jake begins his SKATING ROUTINE:

           - First, Jake moves his hands around one another in circles. 
           From there, he mimes FLAPPING wings, unbeautifully.

           - Next, Jake skates forward with his hand on his heart. He 
           then extends that arm, with GREAT YEARNING, and lowers his 
           hand until it touches the surface of the ice. He FLINCHES.

                                 JAKE
                        Oop, nope -- that’s cold.

           - Once he’s moving with more ease, Jake attempts a SPIRAL 
           SEQUENCE. He leans forward with his arms out, the way Kwan 
           used to do so gracefully. Jake WOBBLES. Cleo responds.

                                 CLEO
                        Oooh, this is bad!

           - Jake scowls at Cleo. Everyone’s face reveals they find 
           Jake’s skating hard to watch but too amusing to look away.

           - Eventually, Jake picks up speed, preparing for a JUMP. He 
           clutches his arms to his chest as he KICKS down into the ice, 
           expecting to LAUNCH into the air. Nope.
           THUD. Jake falls FLAT on the ice. Everyone gasps. But before 
           anyone else can say anything...

                                 PRESTON
                        JAKE!

           Preston BOLTS toward the ice and CLIMBS over the ledge. He 
           steps onto the ice, without skates. Jake wheezes.

                                 JAKE
                        Peeb...!

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake, I’m coming!

           Preston tries to WALK-SHUFFLE across the ice toward Jake. For 
           a moment, he seems to have his balance. Until...

           THUD. Preston falls FLAT on the ice. Everybody gasps.

                                 JAKE
                        Peeb...!

           Jake and Preston, now lying three feet apart, try to pull 
           themselves toward each other. On the ice, this takes several 
           awkward, slippery, unbalanced moments.

                                 PRESTON
                        Jake...!

           Finally, the two hurt friends meet. They grab hands, 
           balancing to hold each other up as they sit on the ice.

                                 PRESTON (CONT’D)
                        You good, man?

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah man. You good?

                                 PRESTON
                        Yeah. I mean...my life’s a damn 
                        mess. But I’m good. We good?

                                 JAKE
                        I hope so?

                                 PRESTON
                        Me too. I’m sorry I was so shitty 
                        to you all summer.

                                 JAKE
                        I’m sorry I was jealous of you all 
                        summer. 
           Preston shrugs, casually appreciating that.

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I know you’ve gotta do your own 
                        thing now. And make your own 
                        friends. And be alone with guys 
                        who, you know, aren’t me.

           Preston’s lips press together into a big, bittersweet smile.

                                 PRESTON
                        C’mon, man. I might make other 
                        friends who are guys. And I might 
                        date other guys who are guys. But 
                        Jake...you’re my boy.

           Jake smiles back.

                                 JAKE
                        No. You’re my boy!

                                 PRESTON
                        Nuh uh. You my boy!

                                 JAKE
                        Naw. You mah boiiiiii, boiiiiii.

           They hug. Tight.

           Around the rink, Preston’s family smiles. Even Cleo does. 
           Cameron too. And Michelle Kwan, beaming as she films them.

                                 MICHELLE KWAN
                        Awww! That was so...truly weird.

           Sarah Vaughan’s romantic, lilting recording of “My Man (Mon 
           Homme)” begins to play as we launch into one FINAL MONTAGE:

           INT. LONG ISLAND DINER - LATE THAT NIGHT

           Preston and Jake are eating at the diner, laughing. Each is 
           holding an ice pack on his bruised shoulder.

           Jake teasingly takes a cold, raw, plain tomato slice from 
           Preston’s plate and eats it. Ew. Preston rolls his eyes.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM DEN - LATER

           Jake sits behind Alyssa, kissing her ear -- their arms linked 
           like Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore’s in Ghost.
           We zoom out to reveal they are assembling an IKEA chair.

           INT. GAY BAR - NIGHT

           Preston sits in a gay bar with Cameron, Timmi and Daniel. 
           They all make cry-faces as Daniel holds up his phone: we see 
           GWYNETH PALTROW accepting her Academy Award for Best Actress.

           The four friends all laugh, vodka sodas in hand. Clink.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Nathaniel, Adam and Finn are sitting around a computer. They 
           look at a blog that reads: Drag Queen and Jogger Boy Make Up 
           On Ice.

                                 ADAM
                        What the actual fuck?

                                 NATHANIEL
                        They’re totally gay for each other.

           INT. JAKE’S SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           Jake and his mom are out for a jog. Jake is wearing his SHAQ 
           t-shirt. Nancy is pulling their cat, Sheena, on a leesh.

           INT. CAMERON’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Preston demonstrates a DEATH-DROP for Cameron, Timmi, Daniel 
           and Sal. Timmi attempts one, but he’s unsuccessful. Ouch.

                                 SAL
                        Don’t worry! Mommy’s got Klonopin!

           INT. HOLLIS FAMILY FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

           Preston hugs Clarissa. His luggage from the summer is packed 
           at his side. Junior walks into the room.

           After letting go of his mom, Preston approaches Junior. 
           Junior sticks out his arm for a handshake. Preston disregards 
           it. He hugs Junior. Junior yields and hugs his son back.

           INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY - DAY

           In a career advising seminar, Jake is creating a LinkedIn 
           Account. He types in a credit for this past summer.
           It reads: SENIOR DIGITAL INTERN - Cleo Home Pictures, Inc.

           INT. UNIVERSITY BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

           In the hallway of a university classroom building, Preston 
           puts his name on a sign-up sheet labeled LGBT Center.

           INT. COLLEGE DORM ROOM - NIGHT

           In Jake’s Kenyon dorm room, an episode of LIVING SINGLE plays 
           on a TV. In his lap, he’s on a FaceTime call with Preston.

           We reveal Jake is wearing his LIVING SINGLE SWEATSHIRT that 
           Preston got him as a gift. He points to it and tilts his head 
           with an egging-on look...

           INT. UNIVERSITY DORM ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Preston, in his UPenn dorm, rolls his eyes on the other end 
           of this FaceTime call.

           He begrudgingly stands up and puts on his LIVING SINGLE 
           SWEATSHIRT that Jake got him. It is way too large on him.

           Either way, Jake gives a thumbs-up. Preston smirks.

           PAN OUT on the laptop screen, where Jake smiles back. As we 
           zoom out, the PRINT TEXT on the back of Preston’s baggy 
           sweatshirt comes into view. The text reads: IN A ‘90S KINDA 
           WORLD, I’M GLAD I GOT MY GIRLS.

           FADE TO BLACK.
