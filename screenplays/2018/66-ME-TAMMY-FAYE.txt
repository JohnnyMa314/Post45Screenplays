            The totally MADE-UP story of the unlikely bond between a 
            drag queen and the queen of Christian televangelism…

           INT. EISENHOWER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - 1987 - DAY

           Like a pair of rosy-cheeked Hummel figurines, JIM and TAMMY 
           FAYE BAKKER (pronounced baker, both Caucasian, mid-forties) 
           scuttle hand-in-hand down a long corridor. Tammy Faye’s high 
           heels click-clack loudly against the tile floor.

           She barely skims five feet, radiating bubbly Pollyanna charm 
           from her stylish pumps to her zebra print head scarf. Her 
           heavily made-up Kewpie doll face flaunts aggressively thick 
           false lashes that must have taken hours to apply. 

           She is never without her signature lashes.

           Not much taller than his wife, chipmunk-cheeked Jim is boyish 
           and affable. He puts the charisma in Charismatic Christian. 

           Bodyguard/chauffeur RICK, twenty-seven, is hunky and 
           cocksure, easily keeping pace with his fun-size employers. He 
           sports a black Members Only jacket and tight acid-wash jeans.

           A phalanx of REPORTERS and FANS gathers near the entrance of

           “We love you, Tammy Faye!” and “God bless you, Tammy Faye!”

                        1987 has hardly been a banner year 
                        for Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. In 
                        fact, you might say it has been 
                        downright hellish for the 
                        evangelical Christian power couple 
                        famous for launching the so-called

           strokes the animal compulsively while he speaks.

                        broadcast in late 1978. This

                        from Eisenhower Memorial Hospital 
                        here in Rancho Mirage, California, 
                        following a nearly fatal bout with 
                        pneumonia compounded by her 
                        addiction to prescribed anxiety 
                        medication...

           Tammy stops to brace herself. Yards away, fans and reporters 
           with their cameras stand ready beyond the glass doors.

                        By all accounts, she was raised in 
                        a deeply religious household filled 
                        with love but mired in poverty, 
                        growing up in a three-room

                        Dropping out of college in order to 
                        marry, the evangelical duo quickly

                        typically ended with a handful of 
                        believers speaking in a mysterious 
                        language that no one, not even the

                        After all that her husband has been 
                        accused of, many of her critics and 
                        fans alike are asking, “Exactly who 
                        is Tammy Faye Bakker, and is she as 
                        loving, forgiving...and innocent as

           Exhaling deeply, Tammy Faye decidedly pulls the dark 
           sunglasses off and nods to Jim who is standing by the door. 
           He opens it for her. We stay on her determined but cheerful 
           eyes faced with the flashes and clicking of cameras and...

                        how you’re doing!/ Mrs. Bakker, how 
                        has your husband’s affair affected 
                        your health?

           ECU - A PAIR OF EYES

           Spandau Ballet’s “True” plays faintly in the background. The 
           eyes peer through ultra fake showgirl lashes, eyelids layered 
           in heavy shadow. The voice belonging to the eyes does its 
           best Bette Davis/Margo Channing impression.

                                 JEZZY
                        Lloyd, I am not twenty-ish. I am 
                        not thirty-ish. Three months ago, I 
                        was forty years old. Forty. Four- 
                        oh, that slipped out. I hadn't 
                        quite made up my mind to admit it. 

           INT. BETTY FORD CLINIC - JEZZY’S ROOM - DAY

           Reveal, an eighteen-year-old Latina in artfully applied 
           makeup. Giant hoop earrings tangle up in her teased out hair. 

           This is JEZZY JONES-- striking, confident beyond her years, 
           but with an open, childlike quality. She studies her 
           reflection.
           The music we hear emanates from a clock radio on the night 
           stand between twin beds. The room looks like a college dorm 
           invaded by vaudeville strippers. Shades of beige hidden 
           beneath the technicolor of strewn clothes, glitter, feathers, 
           makeup tubes and powders. 

           Hastily taped to a wall are two posters. One is All About 
           Eve. Bette Davis, a/k/a “Margo Channing,” shoots her infamous 
           “fuck you” stare, and lurking behind her is Anne Baxter’s 
           “Eve,” throwing some shade of her own. 

           The other poster has Prince, circa the 1985 Purple Rain Tour, 
           in crushed velvet, batting his bedroom eyes at us. 

           A knock at the door is followed by PEPPA, twenties, popping 
           her head in. She wears hospital scrubs and a name tag with a 
           teddy bear sticker.

                                 PEPPA
                        Look at you, pretty girl. 

           Jezzy speaks in her natural voice now, a slight lilt of 
           Chicano English by way of California Valley Girl. 

                                 JEZZY
                            (sarcastic)
                        Mamá always says... less is more.
                            (then)
                        Words to live by girl-- amiright? 

           Peppa chuckles, and they exchange a smile.

                                 PEPPA
                        Your family is here.

           Jezzy leaps out of her chair.

                                 JEZZY
                        What?! They’re not supposed to be 
                        here for two more days!

           Working herself up into a frenzy, Jezzy stuffs clothing into 
           various bags. 

           Peppa looks pained watching her.

                                 PEPPA
                        Umm... Jezzy? Why don’t you come 
                        talk to them first. You can pack 
                        your things up later, okay?

           Desperation still on her face, Jezzy pauses her haphazard 
           packing job.
                                 JEZZY
                        Why didn’t they call? Why didn’t 
                        somebody-- 

           Peppa looks away from her. 

                                 PEPPA
                        They called.

           Jezzy glances at her, quizzically, but then catches a glimpse 
           of herself in the vanity mirror.

                                 JEZZY
                        Ohmygawd. I need to change.

           She touches at her big hair, unsure of how to begin.

                                 PEPPA
                        I’m gonna miss you when you’re 
                        gone, Jezzy.

           Jezzy turns to face her.

                                 JEZZY
                        Me too. You and Bruce were the only 
                        cool ones.

                                 PEPPA
                        I’ll let your family know you’re on 
                        your way.

           Peppa gives her a wink then exits. 

           Jezzy’s gaze shifts to a photo taped to the mirror-- a white 
           man, a brown woman, a brown little boy and brown young girl. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A FLASH OF MEMORIES

           EXT. JEZZY'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

           A violent scene-- 

           The man in Jezzy’s family photo (clearly, her father) beats 
           the shit out of her with a leather belt on their front lawn. 
           She screams and tries to get away, but he grabs her by the 
           hair to keep her in place. 

           NEIGHBORS peek out from windows and doorways.
           EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

           Jezzy-- a dolled up lady of the night-- poses on a street 
           corner with other GIRLS like her... A nice car pulls up and 
           Jezzy leans into the passenger side window.

                                 JEZZY
                        Hey, handsome... lookin’ for me?

           The MAN inside the car smiles and nods. Jezzy gets in the 
           car.

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           A disheveled Jezzy is slumped over with a needle dangling 
           from her arm.

           BACK TO JEZZY IN THE PRESENT

           She sits at the vanity, faced with her reflection, painfully 
           self-conscious now. 

           Abruptly, earrings and lashes come off. She wipes her skin 
           with Pond’s Cold Cream until it glows. After brushing out her 
           tumbleweed of hair, she removes her strategically ripped tee 
           and lacy bra. 

           Shoulder pads fall from the bra to reveal... 

           She is a boy. 

           She changes into a plain tee shirt and jeans. Without a trace 
           of makeup and hair brushed into submission, she still looks 
           very much like a girl gazing into the mirror.

                                 JEZZY
                            (as Bette/Margo)
                        Now I suddenly feel as if I've 
                        taken all my clothes off.

           Unable to bear it, she applies a wisp of gloss and mascara 
           then exhales. She opens the door to her room, about to walk 
           out, when she remembers something and turns back. 

           Lovingly, Jezzy rests her cheek against the image of Prince 
           on the wall, tracing the curves of his face with her finger. 

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Are you for real?... Of course I’ll 
                        marry you, Prince. I’m just the 
                        happiest girl alive!
           She air kisses Prince’s face. 

           Outside her door, another rehab patient-- STUART, thirties, 
           an “aging” rock star, witnesses this, greatly amused. He 
           speaks in a THICK EAST LONDON COCKNEY.

                                 STUART
                        ‘e is a little fella, ‘at one.

           Caught by surprise, Jezzy’s face bursts bright red.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I seen ‘im in ‘e real once. Even in 
                        ‘em stiletto daisy roots, ‘e only

                              plexus)

           Interpreting Jezzy’s chagrin--

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to throw the Derry and Tom on 
                        ya, but if you ask me, that

                        dyanowhatimean?

           Off Jezzy’s utterly perplexed expression.

           EXT. THE BETTY FORD CENTER - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

           A manicured desert oasis sheltered by purple mountains. 

           INT. NURSE’S STATION - DAY

           We follow Peppa down a hallway, making her way into the 
           nurse’s station. 

                                 PEPPA
                        Did you send someone to get the 
                        steamer trunk from the family’s 
                        car?

           BRUCE, twenty-five, looks up from paperwork he’s filling out. 
           Off to the side, a small black and white television 
           broadcasts The Price is Right with the sound on low.

                                 BRUCE
                        Uh-huh... Our girl’s gonna bust-a-
                        nut when she sees that thing.  

           He laughs at his own joke. 
                                 PEPPA
                        You’re so mean.

                                 BRUCE
                        Aw, come on. I wouldn’t say that to 
                        his face.

                                 PEPPA
                        Her face.

           He chuckles.

                                 BRUCE
                        What-ev-ah.

           Peppa clicks her tongue and looks away from him.

           EXT. EISENHOWER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - DAY  

           With Jim by her side, Tammy Faye stands outside the hospital 
           entrance surrounded by the crowd of fans and reporters.

           She belts out the last lines of a song.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        And your midnight’s almost ohhhh-
                        over, and the sun is gonna shine 
                        again!
                            (speaks)
                        Oh, thank God, your midnight is 
                        almost over and the sun is truly 
                        gonna shine again.
                            (sings)
                        Yes, the sun is gonna shine again!

           Loud applause erupts from the gathered crowd.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you so much for the warm 
                        welcome back, everyone! I’m feeling 
                        very healthy, obviously...

           We hear laughter from the crowd.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I sensed the spirit in me, and I 
                        just had to sing that song to you 
                        today because I was living my 
                        midnight these last few weeks, but 
                        now I see the sun is about to burst 
                        through-- I am going home! 

           The crowd cheers.
           INT. BETTY FORD VISITOR’S LOUNGE - DAY 

           On tenterhooks, Jezzy sits opposite ESMÉRALDA, fifty-two, and 
           FRANCIS, fifty-six. Leaning against a wall is PAULA, twenty. 
           We recognize them as the same people in the photo Jezzy has 
           in her room. No one speaks until Jezzy finally does.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m going home... right?

           Francis is a small, wiry Caucasian man with steely grey eyes 
           and a pugilistic demeanor. He faces Jezzy squarely, elbows on 
           knees, torso jutting forward. 

                                 FRANCIS
                        Six weeks. Apparently, that’s all 
                        it takes and you’re a new man.

           Jezzy sneaks a furtive glance at Esméralda, dark and plump, 
           her indigenous Mexican features straining to conceal emotion. 

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        I don’t see any damn difference.

           Esméralda clears her throat but remains mute. 

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        You’re still a disappointment.

           Esméralda touches her husband’s arm, but he shrugs her off.

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        I won’t mince words, Esmé. Look at 
                        your son.

           Jezzy steels herself. She’s heard it all before. Francis 
           stands over her now.

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                            (to Esméralda)
                        Look at what he is and tell me 
                        you’re not ashamed.

           Esméralda stares down at her own sensible, low-heeled pumps. 

                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        This little vacation of his has 
                        cost me a fortune. 
                            (to Jezzy)
                        So you can kiss your college fund 
                        good-bye.

                                 JEZZY
                        I didn’t ask to come here! 
                                 FRANCIS
                            (turns to Esméralda)
                        And ungrateful to boot.

           Paula, painfully silent, meets her sister’s eyes. Jezzy 
           attempts a goofy face. It only makes Paula appear sadder. 
           Esméralda finally speaks. Her accent is thick.

                                 ESMÉRALDA 
                        Why would you do this, Jezzy?
                            (indicates Jezzy’s 
                              appearance)
                        Why not try... Just. This. Once?

           Jezzy looks down at her earnest but clearly fruitless attempt 
           to look like a boy. 

                                 JEZZY
                        I thought this... I thought you’d 
                        like me this way.

           Francis swivels back to her.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Jesse, enough!

                                 JEZZY
                        It’s JEZZY.

                                 FRANCIS
                        That is not your name.

                                 JEZZY
                        JEZZY is how mom says it anyway.

           He glances at his wife before zeroing back in on Jezzy.

                                 FRANCIS
                        Call yourself whatever you want. 
                        You are not my son anymore.

                                 JEZZY (SOTTO)
                        I’m your daughter. 

           He glares at her. His rising blood pressure palpable. 
           Finally, he turns to his wife.

                                 FRANCIS
                        See that? Nothing will ever make 
                        that normal. 
                            (indicates Jezzy)

           He turns back to Jezzy, desperate to get through to her.
                                 FRANCIS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you see? This is a sin 
                        against God. 
                            (then)
                        It’s why he’s punishing all you 
                        degenerates with that disease. 

           Rage simmers in Jezzy’s face. Paula cries and runs off. 

                                 JEZZY 
                        Paula!

           Heartbroken, Jezzy watches her go. TWO ORDERLIES nearly bump 
           into Paula as they drag in a huge steamer trunk on wheels. 

                                 ORDERLY #1
                        Here okay, sir?

           Francis waves them off, and they exit. Jezzy panics.

                                 JEZZY
                        What’s going on?

           Francis pulls an envelope from his pocket, hands it to her. 

                                 FRANCIS
                        A thousand dollars. 

           Jezzy won’t take it, so he tosses it onto the sofa beside 
           her. 

                                 JEZZY
                        Why’d you bring my trunk?

                                 FRANCIS
                        Do not call or try to contact any 
                        of us, including Paula. Understand? 

           Jezzy begins to weep and falls to her knees.

                                 JEZZY
                        Please, Dad-- I’ve kicked it! I’m 
                        clean! I promise!

           He turns from her, beckoning for his wife to stand.

                                 FRANCIS
                        We’re done here. No more promises. 
                        No more chances. Strike three, 
                        you’re out.

           Jezzy looks to her mother, but Francis leads Esméralda away. 
           Jezzy jumps to her feet, lurches forward and grabs at her.
                                 JEZZY
                        Mom, wait!

           Esméralda pulls away.

                                 ESMÉRALDA
                        Let go of me. Please.

           She moves quickly with Francis through the doorway.

                                 JEZZY
                        Don’t leave me, Mom!

                                 FRANCIS
                        God have mercy on your soul, Jesse.

           Jezzy follows them, but an orderly stops her from exiting the 
           building. 

           Several other REHAB PATIENTS witness this, including aging 
           rock star Stuart and a young blonde, HANNAH, thirteen. We 
           will meet her later. 

                                 JEZZY
                        Mamá! Please! Don’t go!!!

           Off Jezzy’s tortured expression.

           INT./EXT. WHITE LINCOLN CONTINENTAL/ EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - 
           DAY

           Back in her big, dark sunglasses, Tammy Faye sits in the 
           backseat of a fancy Lincoln Continental parked at a 
           convenience store. The royal blue leather seat might swallow 
           her up if not for massive shoulder pads in her suit jacket 
           keeping her afloat. 

           Glossy manicured fingers caress a little brown angel figurine 
           with blue wings and hair. Tammy Faye prays, low and raspy. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO)
                        Lord, make me an instrument of your 
                        peace...

           A noise from outside distracts her. She removes her shades, 
           revealing those crazy lashes. Jim and Rick converse as they 
           exit the convenience store, but we can’t hear what they’re 
           saying. They get in the car-- Jim in the passenger’s seat, 
           Rick in the driver’s. 

           Jim turns to face Tammy Faye with a boyish grin, eyes 
           twinkling with either mischief or kindness -- hard to tell 
           the difference with him.
                                 JIM BAKKER
                        Got you the good stuff, hun.

           He pulls a can of Diet Coke out of a paper bag. She takes it 
           gratefully, chirping in her gravelly Minnesotan twang. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Finally, civilization is at hand!

           She gently places the angel figurine in her lap and proceeds 
           to cradle the soda can in her hands.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                            (to the can)
                        Those mean doctors didn’t let me 
                        have a single drop of you for six 
                        whole weeks. 
                            (then)
                        I. Have. Missed. You.

           Laughing at her own silliness, she pops the can open and 
           takes a glorious sip. Rick and Jim exchange an amused look. 
           Rick turns the key in the car’s ignition. It starts but 
           quickly sputters and dies. He tries again. Same thing.

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        Battery?

           Rick nods.

                                 RICK
                        Sounds like.

           Tammy Faye watches them from the backseat, silent and wide-
           eyed, like a child left out of the adult conversation. 

           As Rick turns the key again with the same result, a VAGRANT 
           shuffles by in front of the car. The dirty, shoeless man dons 
           tattered clothes, long stringy hair and a scruffy beard like 
           some kind of homeless Jesus.

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        We got jumpers in the trunk?

                                 RICK
                        Nope. 

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        What’s this guy doing?

           Vagrant Jesus stands over the hood of the car, his arms 
           raised up like he’s parting the Red Sea. Tammy Faye gasps. 
           Slowly and solemnly, vagrant Jesus brings his hands down, 
           palms hovering inches from the hood.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (serious)
                        I think we’ve got a layin’ on of 
                        hands here.

           Rick and Jim chuckle.

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        If only that would do it, eh?

           The man’s hands land softly on the hood. He grins like a 
           lunatic, but his teeth are perfectly straight and white in 
           stark contrast to the dishwater hue of the rest of him.

           Rick turns the key again. This time the engine roars, easy. 
           Tammy Faye’s mouth drops. Jim chortles.

                                 JIM BAKKER (CONT’D)
                        Well what do ya’ know? Talk about 
                        some good timing.

           Rick laughs.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Thank you, Jesus!

           Jim waves to the man politely. The man continues to smile.

                                 JIM BAKKER
                            (to Rick)
                        Got any loose change? I’m sure 
                        he’ll want some beer money.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        No, Jim -- that man is an angel.

           Suddenly, the disheveled man locks eyes with Tammy Faye. He 
           clasps his hands at his heart and bows to her. Rick hands Jim 
           some quarters, but the man simply shuffles away out of sight. 

           Tammy Faye caresses her angel figurine. Complex emotions spin 
           under the armor of her clownish eyes, now sad and fragile.

           INT. BETTY FORD CLINIC - THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Jezzy slouches pathetically across from LINDSAY STICKNEED, a 
           therapist in her mid-forties. Behind Lindsay, several 
           diplomas hang on the wall bearing her name. 

           Lindsay speaks in a soothing but irksome monotone. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        A friend? Someone you trust?
           Jezzy wipes at her tearstained face and shakes her head. 
           Lindsay takes a deep cleansing breath.

                                 LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                        There must be someone you can call 
                        to pick you up.

                                 JEZZY
                        My friends are all waste cases.

           Lindsay thinks about this.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Hum. Okay. 
                            (a light bulb goes off)
                        Hey, maybe it’s a good idea for 
                        them to see how far you’ve come. No 
                        more... dancin’ with Mister 
                        Brownstone.

           Jezzy cringes.

                                 JEZZY
                        Ohmygawd, like what does that even 
                        mean?

                                 LINDSAY
                        Uh, heroin? 
                            (then)
                        Anyway, point is, they’ll see you 
                        clean. A new ma-- woman.

                                 JEZZY
                        So like you think it’s a good idea 
                        for me to leave Betty Ford with a 
                        thousand bucks in my purse and a 
                        car full of junkies?

           Lindsay thinks.

                                 LINDSAY
                        You have a thousand dollars?

           Jezzy nods.

                                 LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                        Well there you go. Problem solved.

           Jezzy looks at her, quizzically.

                                 LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                            (answers her look)
                        You’ll call a cab!
           Jezzy stands up.

                                 JEZZY
                        OK.  

           Lindsay blocks Jezzy from the door.

                                 LINDSAY
                        The road will be very long. It will 
                        be very, very hard. 

           Jezzy regards her like she’s an idiot, but Lindsay is 
           unfazed.

                                 LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                        Like the good book says. What 
                        doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.

                                 JEZZY
                        Pretty sure that’s not from the 
                        Bible.

                                 LINDSAY
                        But it’s a true-ism, isn’t it?

                                 JEZZY
                        If my family disowning me doesn’t 
                        kill me, being HIV positive 
                        probably will.

           Lindsay gasps, blind-sided. Jezzy moves around her and out 
           the door. Lindsay recovers and calls out to her.

                                 LINDSAY
                        You just need to go out and LIVE! 

           Jezzy appears queasy as she moves down the hall. 

           The young blonde rehab patient we saw previously, thirteen-
           year-old Hannah, walks by and stares. Jezzy stares back.

                                 JEZZY
                        What?!

           Hannah chuckles and turns away.

           INT. NURSE’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Jezzy approaches the nurse’s station where Peppa and Bruce 
           appear to be busy at work. Family Feud is playing low on a 
           small television at their desk. They don’t notice Jezzy 
           behind them, stopping to check out the game show.
           Emerging from an adjacent room is NURSE DAISY-- thirties, 
           tall, beefy, pale and blue eyed, attractive if her expression 
           wasn’t so severe. 

           She frowns, seeing Jezzy.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Mister Jones. Did you need 
                        something?

           The other nurses are obviously petrified of Nurse Daisy and 
           say nothing. Jezzy looks the big nurse right in the eye.

                                 JEZZY
                        Oh honey, what I need is a lot... 
                        and what you got ain’t none of it.

           Peppa and Bruce suppress giggles. Nurse Daisy’s lips tighten.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        You’ll be getting a room partner 
                        today, Mister Jones.

           Jezzy’s face falls.

                                 NURSE DAISY (CONT’D)
                        It’s imperative that you clear your 
                        space and have it ready to take on 
                        another guest. That includes 
                        removing your personal materials 
                        from the walls.

                                 JEZZY
                        Great. Last night in hell and I 
                        have to babysit the noob.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Actually, you are all paid up with 
                        two more days to go, Mister Jones.  
                        Please use the time wisely by 
                        attending group at least once more.

           Jezzy rolls her eyes.

                                 JEZZY
                        I already had my exit session with 
                        Stickneed.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        That’s fine. You don’t have to 
                        repeat that.

                                 JEZZY
                        Thank gawd!
                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Regardless, your main task is to 
                        arrange for your departure, seeing 
                        as your family will no longer be 
                        checking you out of the clinic. 
                            (hands her a pamphlet)
                        Here are several cab companies in 
                        the area you can call when the time 
                        comes.

           Jezzy takes the pamphlet and walks off, dejected. 

           INT. BETTY FORD CENTER - JEZZY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Jezzy holds her family photo for a moment before she crumbles 
           it up and tosses it into a trash can. Looking around at her 
           still messy room, she sighs and begins to remove the posters 
           from the wall. 

           EXT. BETTY FORD CENTER - DAY

           The Bakker’s white Lincoln Continental approaches the front 
           entrance.

           INT. WHITE LINCOLN CONTINENTAL - SAME TIME

           Tammy Faye realizes where they are and bolts upright in her 
           seat.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Rick?

           Rick looks at her through the rearview mirror.

                                 RICK
                        Yes, Mrs. Bakker?

           Jim intervenes, turns to face her in the back seat.

                                 JIM
                        Now Tammy Faye, there’s no need to 
                        get your feathers ruffled.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I thought you were taking me home.

                                 JIM
                        First, we need to make a pit stop.

           They pull up and stop at the glass door entrance.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        You didn’t tell me we were coming 
                        here. This place is for alcoholics 
                        and drug addicts!

           Panicked, she pulls her arms around herself protectively. 
           Rick turns to Jim with a look of concern.

                                 RICK
                            (to Jim)
                        Should I come inside with you?

                                 JIM
                        No thanks, Rick. Just help me get 
                        Tammy Faye’s things from the trunk.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        WHAT? Wait-- WHY?

                                 JIM
                            (to Tammy Faye)
                        Honey, it’s for your own good.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        You can’t make me.

                                 JIM
                            (back to Rick)
                        It’s better if you stay out here 
                        with the car. Keep it idling in 
                        case that battery surely is a dud.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        You’re nuts if you think I’m going 
                        inside, much less STAYING here.

           Jim and Rick exchange a look. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not leaving this car until you 
                        drive me home. Thank-you-very-much.

           Tammy Faye sets her lips with finality.

           EXT. BETTY FORD CENTER - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           Rick exits and waits outside the vehicle as Tammy Faye and 
           Jim remain inside the car arguing.

                                 JIM (O.S.)
                        This doesn’t need to be difficult.
                                 TAMMY FAYE (O.S.)
                        ME, difficult? Whoa, that’s a 
                        laugh.

                                 JIM (O.S.)
                        I don’t want to upset you, but 
                        there’s nothing more important to 
                        me right now than your health.

           Rick settles in and lights up a cigarette as he leans against 
           the hood of the idling car.

           INT. BETTY FORD CENTER - JEZZY’S ROOM - DAY

           The room is clear of all things Jezzy except her suitcase and 
           steamer trunk. Jezzy sorts through the trunk and eyes a 
           psychedelic blue Afro wig. She puts it on. 

           The effect is ridiculous, her somber expression against the 
           vibrant, outrageous Afro. She startles at a SHARP YELP coming 
           from somewhere outside the room. 

           INT. HALLWAY/NURSE’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Jezzy’s Afro-wigged head pops out from her doorway. Her eyes 
           narrow. A VOICE from the nurse’s station SCREAMS out.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I don’t belong here! 

           Bruce, Peppa and Nurse Daisy huddle around the screamer.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’ve already stopped the Ativan!

           The huddle moves into an adjacent room and shuts the door. 
           Still wearing her blue Afro, Jezzy traipses down the hall to 
           investigate. 

           AT THE NURSE’S STATION--

           Fancy luggage litters the floor. One bag has items spilling 
           out. Jezzy is drawn in by the LARGE BEDAZZLED SEE-THRU CASE 
           filled with enough false lashes to keep Imelda Marcos’ eyes 
           Imeldific for decades. 

           A VOICE shrieks.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You lied to me, Jim -- like I’m 
                        some kind of demented looney-tune 
                        that can’t make her own decisions! 

           The door swings open. Jezzy is faced with the rear view of a 
           diminutive, rumpled woman surrounded by Jim and the staff.

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        We all agree that you need to be 
                        here.

           Jezzy’s eyes widen, recognizing Jim Bakker.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        No-no-no!

           Tammy Faye pulls at his shirt, vacillating between bubbly 
           hysteria and throaty, munchkin-like sobbing.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t spend one more night away 
                        from home!

           Nurse Daisy casts a shadow with her hulking frame.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        We’re going to take good care of 
                        you here in the clinic, Mrs. 
                        Bakker.

           She reaches out to Tammy Faye but gets slapped away.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Don’t touch me!

           Nurse Daisy recoils. Tammy Faye immediately laments.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                            (sobbing)
                        I’m so sorry. 

           Jezzy moves in closer, curious. Nurse Daisy sees her.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        You shouldn’t be here!

           With black tears streaming down her cheeks, Tammy Faye turns 
           to see who the nurse is barking at. Utterly surprised, she 
           takes in Jezzy and her enormous blue Afro. 

           Tammy Faye and Jezzy lock eyes.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh. I -- Do I know you? 

                                 JEZZY
                        I don’t think so.

           Off Jezzy as she relives A MEMORY...

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

           Title Over:

           Reseda, California. 1979.

           The sun sets over suburbia. 

           We scan a tree-lined row of single-story homes with TV sets 
           illuminating every living room. We land on a driveway. 
           Plastered on the side of a parked van is a cartoon image of 
           Jezzy’s dad dressed as a plumber with “JONES & CO. PLUMBING” 
           in huge bubble lettering above his grinning face.

           The television hums from inside the house.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (O.S.) 
                        Jesus, we know you send your angels 
                        down to earth to protect us... 

           INT. JEZZY’S CHILDHOOD LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           ON SCREEN-- the PTL Club is broadcast. In between song verses 
           Tammy Faye speaks directly to a live audience and viewers at 
           home. 

           The ten-year-old boy version of Jezzy -- JESSE -- stands a 
           few feet from the TV, enthralled.

           ON SCREEN-- a decade younger Tammy is angelic, despite her 
           stiff blonde wig, heavily lined lips and those dramatic 
           lashes. Behind her is a CHOIR of men and women in matching 
           baby blue polyester. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE 
                        And we ask you Lord, help us to see 
                        those angels, so that we too may be 
                        instruments of your peace.

           Jesse turns around to observe his family. They all have their 
           eyes closed as they pray. On the sofa, Francis holds the King 
           James Bible against his chest. Esméralda’s hands are raised 
           to the ceiling in worship.
                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                            (sings)
                        We’re blest, we’re blest, we’re 
                        blest, we are blest! Oh, we’ve got 
                        shelter, clothing and strength. We 
                        are blest! 

           Twelve-year-old Paula kneels in front of the TV, praying in 
           earnest. Her face is puffy and red from crying. In fact, 
           she’s still crying. 

           From the rear view of this moving tableau, it seems they are 
           all praying to the television, which in a sense they are. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                            (sings)
                        We’re blest, we’re blest, we’re 
                        blest, we are blest! We don’t 
                        deserve it, but yet we are blest! 

           Esméralda SPEAKS IN TONGUES-- a droning, rhythmic sound.

                                 ESMÉRALDA
                        Shal da la do con da sha da see yoh 
                        can da lo shon do shon da lo...

           Francis and Paula also PRAY IN TONGUES -- a muted gibberish. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Remember Jesus loves you, no matter 
                        what the world may think or do... 
                            (sings)
                        We’re blest, we’re blest, we’re 
                        blest, we are blest! We don’t 
                        deserve it, but yet we are blest!

           Young Jesse stares at the BRIGHT RED WELTS along the back of 
           Paula’s thighs. He looks up at his sister’s pained 
           expression. Guiltily, he turns away and stares at the TV. 

           ON SCREEN-- Tammy Faye gazes into the camera. She locks eyes 
           with Jesse through the TV set.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        And I love you. I really, really 
                        do.

           He moves in close to the TV, tracing Tammy’s signature lashes 
           with his finger. Thoughts swirl behind his haunted eyes.

                                 NURSE DAISY (PRELAP)
                        Mister Jones?

                                                       END OF FLASHBACK
           INT. NURSE’S STATION - DAY

           Jezzy looks sad, lost in her memory. 

                                 NURSE DAISY 
                        You need to return to your room, 
                        Mister Jones.

           Tammy Faye eyes Nurse Daisy, appalled.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Excuse me, Nurse...
                            (looks at her name tag)
                        Nurse Daisy? I believe you’re 
                        mistaken. It’s obvious you’re 
                        speaking to a lady.
                            (indicates Jezzy)

           Jezzy brightens upon hearing this.

                                 JEZZY
                        Um-- yeah. The clinic has me 
                        officially checked in as a lady 
                        person, not a mister. I’m in the 
                        women’s wing-- duh.

           Nurse Jezzy looks at Jezzy with disdain, so Tammy Faye swoops 
           in, places her tiny hand on Nurse Daisy’s arm.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (sincere)
                        I can tell you are very good at 
                        your job. I see that in you, one 
                        hundred percent. And it doesn’t 
                        hurt that you’re just about the 
                        prettiest gal I’ve seen in uniform.

           The big woman is charmed. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        How about we call it a 
                        misunderstanding? Okay with you?

           Nurse Daisy nods.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        But first, I think you owe-- um...

           Tammy Faye looks to Jezzy.

                                 JEZZY
                        Jezzy.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Miss Jezzy. Yes, I-I think you owe 
                        her an apology. Please?

           Nurse Daisy looks at Jezzy, then back to Tammy Faye who beams 
           love out of every pore in her body.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Okay.
                            (looks at the floor)
                        I-- uh...

           Tammy Faye nods and rubs Nurse Daisy’s arm. The clinic staff 
           look on, holding their breath. Jim smiles, hopeful.

                                 NURSE DAISY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. Miss Jezzy.

                                 JEZZY
                            (hesitant)
                        Thank you. 

           Angle on Bruce, silently freaking out. He whispers to Peppa.

                                 BRUCE (SOTTO)
                        What just happened?

                                 PEPPA (SOTTO)
                        Tammy Faye just happened.

           Peppa smiles then moves towards Tammy Faye.

                                 PEPPA (CONT’D)
                        Mrs. Bakker--

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Please, call me Tammy Faye, or 
                        Tammy is fine too.

                                 PEPPA
                        OK, Tammy. Welcome to the Betty 
                        Ford Clinic. Why don’t you come 
                        have a chat with one of our 
                        therapists. 
                            (indicates behind her)
                        This is Lindsay Stickneed.

           Lindsay appears, hand extended, sporting an ear-to-ear grin. 
           Tammy Faye eyes her warily. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        You can just call me Linds. 
                        Everybody does.
           Perplexed looks all around from the nursing staff and Jezzy.

                                 JEZZY
                        Nobody calls you that.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Oh, sure they do--

                                 JEZZY
                        I thought everyone just called you 
                        Stickneed.

           Lindsay forces her smile further.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Well, Linds is what I want everyone 
                        to call me now.
                            (then)
                        And what color are WE feeling 
                        today, Miss Tammy Faye?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Thank you, but no. 

           Jezzy snorts out a laugh.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I am so glad to have met you all, 
                        but I really must go. 
                            (to Jim)
                        Now!

           She grabs several bags and heads for the exit. Seeing no one 
           move to help, Jezzy gathers the rest of the luggage and 
           quickly follows. Tammy Faye notices and stops.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a doll, but Jim should be 
                        carrying those. 

           BACK AT THE NURSE’S STATION, Jim implores the staff. 

                                 JIM
                        Can’t you all do something?

           Tammy Faye and Jezzy are now out of ear shot.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        We cannot force her, Mr. Bakker. 
                        Until Mrs. Bakker voluntarily 
                        admits herself, there’s really 
                        nothing we can do to compel her to 
                        stay.
           ALONE WITH TAMMY FAYE, Jezzy’s head spins with conflicting 
           emotions.

                                 JEZZY
                        I can’t believe you’re right here 
                        in front of me. My family-- we used 
                        to watch you on TV every day and 
                        twice on Sundays. 
                            (then)
                        I felt like I was looking at the 
                        most perfect woman in the world 
                        when I was looking at you.

           Tammy Faye is pained to hear these words.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        That’s quite a compliment... that I 
                        can’t possibly live up to.

                                 JEZZY
                        I know that now. 

           A beat as Tammy Faye considers how to take this until-- true 
           to her nature-- she quips cheerfully.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Well, as someone wiser than me once 
                        said, I’m not God, and I’m not 
                        running for office.

           Jezzy chuckles quietly.

                                 JEZZY
                        I prayed and prayed that I’d get to 
                        meet you one day... You would 
                        always say...
                            (mimics Tammy’s voice)
                        Jesus loves you, no matter what the 
                        world may think or do...

           Tammy Faye giggles at Jezzy’s impersonation of her.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I used to really believe that.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh, it is still absolutely true. 
                        But you’ve got to love yourself 
                        too. That’s the thing of it.

           A beat.
                                 JEZZY
                        No one’s ever stood up for me like 
                        that. The way you just did... with 
                        that awful nurse.

           Jezzy looks so young and vulnerable, Tammy Faye reaches out 
           and grabs her hand.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Honey, she doesn’t know any better. 
                        You’ve got to forgive her.

           Off Jezzy’s expression--

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, yeah-- I know. Easier said than 
                        did. Ha, ha. I am painfully aware 
                        of that fact.

                                 JEZZY
                        Either way, thanks for defending 
                        me. I just wanted you to know it 
                        meant a lot.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Anytime.

           Tammy Faye regards her wistfully.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        It’s strange, but I really do feel 
                        that we have met before.

           Jim and Peppa approach, breaking the spell.

                                 JIM
                        Tammy Faye, listen, I get that 
                        you’re upset.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (bitter)
                        You have no idea.

                                 JIM
                        Fair enough. But, I have to insist 
                        that you stay here, at least for 
                        some initial observation.

           She deflates. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Fine. You wore me down. It’s in the 
                        Lord’s hands now.
           Peppa reaches out to touch Tammy Faye’s shoulder then thinks 
           better of it.

                                 PEPPA
                        We have you rooming with Jezzy here 
                        tonight, if that’s okay.

           Tammy Faye perks up.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Really?! I would love that-- but I 
                        don’t want to be a burden on Jezzy.

           Jezzy brightens, something hopeful stirring in her.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jezzy helps Tammy Faye carry her luggage to their room, but 
           Lindsay stops them in their tracks.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Can I help you with some of those?

           Jezzy hates this woman.

                                 JEZZY
                        It’s fine. I got it.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (taking Jezzy’s cue)
                        But thank you anyway, Linds!

           Lindsay glows hearing Tammy Faye use her preferred nickname.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Can we just get a few minutes, 
                        Tammy?

           Jezzy turns and faces Lindsay squarely.

                                 JEZZY
                            (conspiratorial)
                        You got bigger fish to fry, girl. 

           The therapist’s curiosity is piqued. Bewildered but patient, 
           Tammy Faye watches their exchange.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I heard Vegas Barbara got her hands 
                        on some BASE.

           Lindsay’s eyes expand.
                                 LINDSAY
                            (unsure)
                        Vegas Barbara? 

                                 JEZZY
                        Yeah, old lady Barbara.

           Lindsay understands now.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Base, you said?

           Jezzy exaggerates looking around for eavesdroppers.

                                 JEZZY (SOTTO)
                        You know. WHITE ROCK.

           Lindsay’s face lights up, she finally gets it.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Oh... Lady Cain. Mama Coca.

           Jezzy whispers.

                                 JEZZY (SOTTO)
                        I really shouldn’t be telling you 
                        this.

           Lindsay tightens her lips and mimes zipping them. With that, 
           she scurries off. Tammy Faye and Jezzy exchange a look. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I think I may have just dodged a 
                        bullet.

                                 JEZZY
                        More like an atom bomb.

           Jezzy rolls her eyes dramatically and keeps moving.

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           Jezzy, wig-less now, watches Tammy Faye unpack.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I can’t believe they only let me 
                        bring in a few bags.

           A mountain of luggage occupies an entire corner. Jezzy 
           chuckles.

                                 JEZZY
                        Your luggage wails.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        All knockoffs. I get everything at 
                        the swap meet.

                                 JEZZY
                        NO. WAY.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’ve learned to stretch a dollar 
                        until it screams.

           Jezzy runs her fingers along the Gucci designs.

                                 JEZZY
                            (in disbelief)
                        Gawww, looks so real.

           Jezzy turns and opens up her own huge trunk filled with wigs, 
           scarves and other flashy adornments. She notices Tammy Faye 
           looking at her things with curiosity.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        If you want, you’re totally welcome 
                        to anything in here.

           Tammy Faye smiles brightly.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh my land! I’ve never seen so many 
                        beautiful things in one place.

                                 JEZZY
                        Uh... You live in a mansion and 
                        drive a Rolls Royce.

           Tammy Faye deflates a little.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh yes, we had some nice things. 
                        But not anymore.

           As quickly as she deflates, she bounces back again, rummaging 
           through the glittery dresses in Jezzy’s trunk, oohing and 
           aahing over everything.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        If ever two people were meant to 
                        bunk together, it’s us.

           They laugh.

                                 JEZZY
                        I like to dress up fancy for 
                        dinner. 
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I love doing that!

                                 JEZZY
                        After everyone eats, we usually 
                        have entertainment. I sing or this 
                        guy Stuart plays a song on his 
                        guitar. He’s a rock star. British. 
                        Everyone sort of pitches in their 
                        talents or whatever.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        You’re a singer?

                                 JEZZY
                        Among other things. I’m checking 
                        out the day after tomorrow, so 
                        we’ll for sure get something going 
                        tonight or tomorrow.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        You’re leaving?! If you’re going 
                        then I really don’t want to stay.

           Tammy catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and is taken 
           aback. Her makeup is smeared. She looks a mess.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO)(CONT’D) 
                        Lord have mercy.

           Jezzy chats away as she looks through her own belongings 
           while Tammy Faye sits in front of the mirror, horrified.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m really glad to be leaving. I’ve 
                        been here for six weeks and I 
                        already gained like seven pounds. 
                        The food is too good. Ya-know-what-
                        I-mean? And I’ve only ever talked 
                        to a therapist like three times my 
                        entire stay and it’s always that 
                        moron Stickneed asking me what 
                        color I’m feeling or am I a dark 
                        cloud, white cloud or dark cloud 
                        with a silver lining. Her color 
                        cloud bullshit just makes me wanna 
                        hurl-- excuse my French.

           Half listening to Jezzy, Tammy Faye is preoccupied with what 
           she sees in the mirror.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I look absolutely TERRIBLE.
           Jezzy leans in next to her in the mirror.

                                 JEZZY
                            (lying)
                        It’s not that bad.

           Tammy Faye eyes her -- knows she’s lying.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Let me give you a makeover.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It’s hopeless, Jezzy.

                                 JEZZY
                        Come on, let me do you up. 

           Tammy Faye looks away from the mirror dramatically. Her eyes 
           land on a black sequins dress in Jezzy’s trunk.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Where did you get all those 
                        gorgeous gowns? 

                                 JEZZY
                        I make them. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        You’re a singer AND a costume 
                        designer?

                                 JEZZY
                        I make them for the pageants. I’m a 
                        ball queen.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Ball queen? How GLAMOROUS.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m a champion in the realness 
                        category.

           Off Tammy Faye’s puzzled look.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I pass. For a real woman. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        A real woman?

           Jezzy answers her tentatively.
                                 JEZZY
                        You do realize I’m a boy who 
                        should’ve been born a girl, right?

           Tammy Faye smiles knowingly.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It’s really no contest. You’re more 
                        real than most of the women I know.

           Jezzy blushes, flattered. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never had a makeover from a 
                        pageant queen before.

           They both lean into the mirror.

                                 JEZZY
                        First, the face.

           Tammy Faye stares at her reflection, doubtful. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A WHILE LATER. 

           Tammy Faye sits with a clean face (her thick lashes are still 
           securely in place). Jezzy applies foundation to her skin.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        After you check out tomorrow, 
                        where’s home-- your family?

                                 JEZZY
                            (sharply)
                        I’m an orphan now.

           Off Tammy Faye’s curious look.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                            (holds it in)
                        It’s complicated. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’m an orphan too, in a way. I was 
                        raised by my wonderful momma and 
                        step-daddy, but I know what it’s 
                        like to not have the love of a 
                        parent.

           A humble two-story home. Snow covers the ground. The sounds 
           of a man and woman arguing inside the house.

           International Falls, Minnesota. 1945.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        My momma and daddy divorced when I 
                        was three. 

           INT. TAMMY FAYE’S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

           CARL LA VALLEY, twenties, storms out, leaving RACHEL, 
           twenties, holding a baby and THREE-YEAR-OLD TAMMY in tears.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        Losing the love of my real daddy 
                        left a deep hole in my heart.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY

           Title Over:

           Seven years later.

           TEN-YEAR-OLD TAMMY FAYE walks hand-in-hand into church with 
           her mother. Her seven SIBLINGS form a long train behind them.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        I watched my mother live with the 
                        shame of her divorce.

           A group of CHURCH LADIES shoot hostile glances at Rachel and 
           whisper angrily as she passes by with the children.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        I never understood how Christians, 
                        who were supposed to be the salt of 
                        the earth, could treat her so bad. 

           INT. CHURCH - DAY 

           Rachel noodles on the church piano before the service. The 
           MINISTER and his WIFE reproach her. We see the action but 
           only hear Tammy’s voice over.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        She was a gifted musician...
           INT. TAMMY FAYE'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

           Rachel entertains all her children and her second husband, 
           FRED, thirties, with her lovely singing and piano playing.

                                 RACHEL 
                        Sing to the mountains, sing to the 
                        sea! Raise your voices, lift your 
                        hearts! This is the day the Lord 
                        has made-- let us give thanks and 
                        rejoice!

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           The church group that glared at her outside are now 
           surrounding Rachel by the piano.

                                 CHURCH LADY #1
                        Divorcees don’t perform in the 
                        service. You know that.

                                 MINISTER’S WIFE
                        Lord have mercy on those poor 
                        children.

           Rachel pulls herself and the children away from them and 
           heads for the pews in the back of the church.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        She just wanted to praise the Lord. 

           Sitting with her children, Rachel weeps. Young Tammy Faye 
           comforts her distraught mother.

           INT. TAMMY FAYE'S CHILDHOOD HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ten-year-old Tammy Faye kneels next to her bed where all her 
           sisters are jammed together, asleep. In the adjacent bed, all 
           her little brothers are doing the same. On a small table 
           rests the little brown and blue angel figurine we saw adult 
           Tammy Faye holding previously.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        I was searching for something to 
                        fill that big hole in my heart...

           As Tammy Faye prays, the little angel COMES TO LIFE, full-
           size. She looks a lot like Jezzy. 

           Tammy Faye’s eyes widen in wonder.
                                                       END OF FLASHBACK 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY’S ROOM - DAY

           Adult Tammy Faye’s eyes widen with the shock of recognition.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It’s you!

           Jezzy looks puzzled, holding a makeup brush in one hand and a 
           color palette in the other.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You’re the little brown and blue 
                        angel!

           Jezzy looks down at her own skin.

                                 JEZZY
                        You got the brown part right. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It sounds INSANE, but this little 
                        angel figurine I have--

           Tammy gets up and proceeds to rummage through her things.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        It’s in here somewhere.
                            (then)
                        Look!

           She displays the figurine; it does resemble Jezzy. Still 
           holding her makeup tools, Jezzy looks from the figurine to 
           her blue Afro on the vanity.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TAMMY FAYE'S CHILDHOOD HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
           (FLASHBACK)

           Young Tammy Faye stares at the life-size angel before her.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        The little angel first came to me 
                        when I was ten-years-old. I prayed 
                        constantly for Jesus to fill my 
                        heart, tell me what to do, give me 
                        direction.
                                 LITTLE BLUE ANGEL/JEZZY
                        I have a message for you, Tammy 
                        Faye. Jesus has a plan for you.

           Tammy Faye’s eyes are as big as saucers.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           The minister calls out to the CONGREGATION from his pulpit.

                                 MINISTER
                        Who among you are ready to receive 
                        the baptism of the Holy Spirit?

           The congregation members hoot and holler amen’s. Ten-year-old 
           Tammy makes her way down the aisle in a euphoric daze. Arms 
           up to heaven, Tammy falls to her knees among a small crowd of 
           other BELIEVERS at the front of the church service. 

           She begins to speak in a strange tongue.

                                 TEN-YEAR-OLD TAMMY FAYE
                        Ches que dah lan ja doh. Shel da la 
                        dah no. Loh han ja la. Oh la jah. 

           Tammy’s face glows, gazing up to heaven, speaking a language 
           she doesn’t understand. 

           TAMMY FAYE’S VISION 

           EXT. HEAVEN - DAY

           We follow Young Tammy as she walks down a gilded road with 
           JESUS CHRIST, thirty-three. He wears a white robe and blue 
           sash. The life-size blue angel walks on Tammy’s other side. 

           Birds chirp, the sky is cloudless and the greenery is lush. 
           We can’t see Jesus’ face, but he holds Tammy Faye’s chin in 
           his hand and speaks in a comforting tone.

                                 JESUS
                        Tammy Faye, all things work 
                        together for good to them that love 
                        God and are called according to His 
                        purpose. Spread my message of love. 
                        Lift the burdens of the afflicted. 
                        Love them with all your heart... so 
                        that they may truly know my love.

                                                          END OF VISION
           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           The church is empty, hours later. Waiting patiently, Rachel 
           watches young Tammy Faye, prostrate on the church floor, 
           slowly come out of her trance-like state. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        It’s kind of funny. They call me 
                        the queen of televangelism...

                                                       END OF FLASHBACK

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY’S ROOM - DAY 

           Jezzy finishes up the last touches on Tammy’s makeup. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE 
                        ...but I never set out to be the 
                        queen of anything. I just wanted to 
                        do what Jesus commanded me to do.

           Jezzy turns her around to face the mirror. What Tammy sees 
           makes her gasp. 

                                 JEZZY
                        What’s wrong?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I look... fantastic.

           She really does. She looks up at Jezzy.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I know an angel when I see one. I 
                        don’t know how and I don’t know 
                        why, but it’s like you’ve been with 
                        me all my life. 
                            (then)
                        I always say be kind to everyone 
                        you meet. You never know when 
                        you’re talking to an angel.

                                 JEZZY
                        I seriously doubt Heaven’s got a 
                        bunch a queens like me in halos and 
                        wings walking around.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        And why not? Who says what angels 
                        should or shouldn’t look like?

           Tammy Faye watches Jezzy put her makeup away.
                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Why are you here, Jezzy?

                                 JEZZY
                        Why are you here?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I shouldn’t be.

           Off Jezzy’s silence.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I think God brought us together for 
                        a reason.

           She reaches out to grab Jezzy’s hand. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I can see that you have suffered a 
                        lot. It’s not fair...

           Jezzy fights her emotions.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        ... and I have suffered too. It may 
                        seem like I have a great life-- and 
                        I do, don’t get me wrong. I am 
                        grateful to the Lord for so many 
                        things, especially my children. 
                        They have been my reason for 
                        living, let-me-tell-you. But 
                        something inside of me still hurts 
                        real bad, and I don’t know if it 
                        will ever go away. 
                            (then)
                        You are a good person, Jezzy, and 
                        God does love you, no matter what.

           Jezzy pulls away from her and proceeds to busy herself with 
           cleaning up the room.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m pretty sure God has forgotten 
                        all about me.

           Tammy exhales, holding back her tears.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I know it feels like that right 
                        now. But it has to get better. It 
                        just has to.
                            (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT'D)
                        I wish I knew what to say to make 
                        it better, but I guess I’m kind of 
                        feeling the same way, if I’m being 
                        honest.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PTL STAGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Tammy Faye addresses her audience.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Thank you. Hallelujah.

           The AUDIENCE claps as Jim Bakker joins her on stage. This 
           goes on for a moment or two.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        For years, my husband and I seemed 
                        like we knew what we were doing. 
                        Sure, we spilled a few beans about 
                        our arguments, typical marriage 
                        stuff. But in reality, it has been 
                        so much worse than normal ups and 
                        downs. And I’m not talking about my 
                        husband’s very brief mistake with 
                        that money-hungry woman. That’s 
                        forgivable, ya know. Anyone can 
                        survive that in a marriage.

           Jim puts his arm around her, making a big show of giving her 
           affection. She has a huge smile plastered on, but something 
           threatens to crack underneath those pounds of eye makeup. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        For me, it hasn’t helped that 
                        sometimes I goof on my meds and end 
                        up like whoa-- Out. To. Lunch.

           Jim smiles into the camera.

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        Tammy Faye and I are so happy to be 
                        here with you today.

           Tammy Faye nods and smiles. Jim continues to hold her tight 
           as if she might crumble to the floor.

                                 JIM BAKKER (CONT’D)
                        When one of us is in trouble. We 
                        all are. Can I get an amen?
                                 AUDIENCE
                        Amen!

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        If PTL doesn’t get your financial 
                        support, well -- we’re gonna be 
                        pulled off the air. Simple as that.

           Gasps and groans from the audience.

                                 JIM BAKKER (CONT’D)
                        My fellow Christians, pick up your 
                        phones, take out your pocketbooks. 
                        Join us in the effort to save all 
                        souls for Christ!

           Off to one side of the stage are several rows of TELETHON 
           VOLUNTEERS answering phones. 

           ANGLE ON one of the studio CAMERA MONITORS showing the TV 
           IMAGE of the action on stage unfolding. A telethon number 
           appears on the bottom half of the small screen. 

                                 JIM BAKKER (CONT’D)
                        Please, make that call.

           Jim looks around, realizing that Tammy Faye has wandered off 
           and made her way to the back of the stage. 

           BACK ON THE ACTUAL STAGE

           Jim tries, nonchalantly, to get her attention.

                                 JIM BAKKER (CONT’D)
                        There you are, honey. Why don’t you 
                        come down here and join me?

           She doesn’t seem to hear, staring in awe at the stage 
           backdrop. Several sailboats and a sunset are painted on it.

                                 JIM BAKKER (CONT’D)
                            (sweetly)
                        Tammy Faye?

           Laughter from the audience. Jim grins good-naturedly. Tammy 
           Faye, in a drug induced haze, has no idea that all eyes are 
           on her.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Jim! Look at these sailboats. 
                        Whoever painted them did a 
                        wonderful job. 
                                 JIM BAKKER
                        Oh yes, Tammy. They are quite good.

           He looks back at the audience, smiles. More laughter.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Jim! Have you ever seen anything 
                        like it?

           She continues to stare at the sailboats.

           INT. BACKSTAGE AT PTL - A WHILE LATER

           We hear loud applause as Jim and Tammy Faye emerge from the 
           stage, arm-in-arm. People swarm them until they get to the 
           hallway where their separate dressing rooms are. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (V.O.)
                        It’s hard for a marriage to survive 
                        lies. But what I do know is that it 
                        really can’t survive without love.

           Alone now, Jim pushes her arm away and walks off without a 
           word, leaving Tammy Faye in a sad daze.

                                                       END OF FLASHBACK

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY’S ROOM - DAY 

           Tammy Faye sits up in bed, her feet propped up on a few 
           pillows, looking glorious in her makeover but pensive as 
           well. Jezzy reclines at her feet, painting Tammy’s toes.

                                 JEZZY
                        Ever think you might leave him?

           Tammy laughs.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh no, I love my husband. 
                            (beat)
                        I know he really loves me, too.

           Chain-smoker “VEGAS” BARBARA, sixties, appears in the 
           doorway, emaciated in a long silk kimono, full makeup and red 
           nails. She has a decayed, toothy grin. 

           Tammy looks up and smiles. Jezzy’s face falls.

                                 BARBARA
                        Tammy Faye Bakker?
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        That’s me.

                                 BARBARA
                        I watch your show, I do.

           Barbara sucks deeply on her cigarette and blows a thick cloud 
           of smoke into the room. Jezzy gets up and fans it. 

                                 BARBARA (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got those nice big wigs and 
                        the puppies sometimes come out and 
                        sit on your lap.

           Tammy Faye smiles politely.

                                 BARBARA (CONT’D)
                        Jesus! Yeah, Jesus. Always Jesus.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (sweetly)
                        That’s kind of the point.

                                 BARBARA
                        I was a prostitute once.

           Jezzy and Tammy Faye exchange a look.

                                 BARBARA (CONT’D)
                        Never very good at it. I don’t 
                        enjoy fellatio, you see.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh.

                                 BARBARA
                        Unlike this one here, I’m sure.
                            (indicates Jezzy)

           Jezzy exaggerates her shock with a gasp and hand to her 
           mouth. Tammy Faye is unsure of how to proceed.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (awkward)
                        Well... I don’t see how you could 
                        know that.

           Barbara inhales deeply on her cigarette again.

                                 BARBARA
                        And here you are at the Betty Ford. 
                        See I always knew you TV Barbie 
                        Dolls were a sham. With your fake 
                        boobs and fake hair.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Don’t forget fake eyelashes.

           Jezzy coughs and speaks loudly to Barbara like she’s hard of 
           hearing.

                                 JEZZY
                        Barbara, I have ASTHMA. So I need 
                        you to smoke out in the hall!

           Barbara puts her cigarette out in a nearby coffee cup. 

                                 BARBARA
                            (to Tammy)
                        I like my crystal. What’s your 
                        poison?

           Jezzy helps Tammy Faye stand. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Poison? I-- uh... I’m not sure.

           Tammy Faye’s toes are still drying, so it’s awkward when she 
           and Jezzy shuffle out of the room slowly.

                                 JEZZY
                        Gotta take Tammy Faye to her 
                        electric shock treatments. Sorry, 
                        Barbara.

           Barbara stands in the doorway, looking confused. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Close on Tammy Faye and Jezzy further down the hall.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Do you really have asthma?

           Jezzy shakes her head.

                                 JEZZY
                        I wasn’t gonna let that shady bitch 
                        read you all day.

           Tammy Faye bursts out laughing.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh, I’m used to it. Just water off 
                        a duck’s back to me.

           Tammy Faye mimes brushing something off her shoulder.
                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        And for the record, these are real.
                            (indicates her boobs)

           They both erupt in giggles then stop abruptly when...

           They see Lindsay Stickneed coming from around the corner. 
           Jezzy physically lifts Tammy up and out of sight. They lean 
           against a wall. Close call.

                                 JEZZY
                        Come on, this way.

           We have VARIOUS SEQUENCES of them running around trying to 
           avert Lindsay but seeing her nonetheless and barely escaping 
           her... until they stop at the nurse’s station. 

           Bruce looks up from his perch. Jezzy gives him a pleading 
           look and indicates towards a doorway labeled “meditation 
           garden.” He smirks and nods, so Jezzy pulls Tammy Faye 
           through that doorway.

           INT. MEDITATION GARDEN - DAY 

           They enter an indoor garden. Jezzy listens at the door.

                                 Lindsay (O.S.)
                        Bruce, have you seen Tammy Faye?

                                 Bruce (O.S.)
                        Can’t say that I have. 

                                 Lindsay (O.S.)
                        Well, I’m done for the day. If you 
                        see her, let her know I’m very 
                        sorry I missed her.

           Jezzy exhales in relief and sits next to Tammy Faye on 
           carpeted steps arranged in a semicircle, surrounded by potted 
           plants, a small pond and tropical flowers. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        This room... is so relaxing! 

                                 JEZZY
                        They don’t usually let us in here 
                        without supervision, but Bruce is 
                        cool.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Kind of warm, isn’t it?
                                 JEZZY
                        Too much?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I like it. I know I should be 
                        worried it’ll melt my face off, but 
                        there’s just something about a 
                        warm, humid room that calms my 
                        nervous condition. 

           A beat.

                                 JEZZY
                        Are you really done with those 
                        pills you used to take?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I don’t ever want to see another 
                        Ativan as long as I live... Jezzy, 
                        I nearly killed my children because 
                        of that drug.

                                 JEZZY
                        Seriously?

           Tammy fans at her eyes.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh Lord... I’m probably going to 
                        cry.

                                 JEZZY
                        It’s okay, you don’t have to talk 
                        about it.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        But I want to tell you. I need to 
                        tell you.
                            (then)
                        I got really sick with pneumonia. 
                        My throat was killing me from all 
                        the coughing and hacking, so I 
                        started taking cough medicine, but 
                        I was still on the Ativan, too. 
                        They’re prescribed mainly for my 
                        fear of flying... that’s a whole 
                        other thing, but anyway, the mix of 
                        medicines and a really high fever 
                        sent me over the edge... I was in 
                        bed, trying to sleep, and I had the 
                        most awful hallucinations! I saw 
                        these big purple elephants falling 
                        from the sky into my bedroom. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT'D)
                        My son told me later that I kept 
                        screaming, “ELEPHANTS! They’re 
                        gonna crush us!”... Oh, that poor 
                        child. He yelled out for the 
                        hallucinations to stop, in the name 
                        of Jesus! 

           Jezzy listens with rapt attention.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Jim was busy, off building another 
                        building at Heritage USA or 
                        whatever he was doing, so a family 
                        friend had to call our doctor to 
                        come get me. They put me on a 
                        private jet for California-- we had 
                        to fly to Eisenhower-- for privacy, 
                        mainly. The last thing we needed 
                        was to make another splash in the 
                        headlines. I got on the plane with 
                        him and my kids. That’s where the 
                        worst of my hallucinations 
                        happened...

           She pauses for a moment to collect her thoughts.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        The floor and the walls of the 
                        airplane cabin were swarming with 
                        rats. Thousands and thousands of 
                        them! I remember trying to scream, 
                        but my lungs were too weak for any 
                        sound to come out. I panicked and 
                        tried to get off the airplane while 
                        we were 30,000 feet up in the air. 
                        I pulled at the emergency exit, but 
                        luckily I was in too weak a 
                        condition to open it... Oh Jezzy, 
                        every time I think about it I get 
                        this sick feeling in the pit of my 
                        stomach. I could have killed all of 
                        us... my two precious children. I 
                        was not in control of myself, and I 
                        don’t ever want to feel like that 
                        again. 
                            (then)
                        I’m not addicted to Ativan. I just 
                        needed to be educated, you know? 
                        Once I understood what it was doing 
                        to me, it really wasn’t a problem 
                        for me to quit.
                                 JEZZY
                        Ohmygosh, Tammy-- that’s such a 
                        crazy story.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Well, it’s all true.
                            (then)
                        What about you?

                                 JEZZY
                        Huh?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Why are you here... at Betty Ford?

           Jezzy hesitates.

                                 JEZZY
                        Umm... heroin.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Serious stuff.

                                 JEZZY
                        My parents couldn’t take it 
                        anymore, I guess, so this was it 
                        for them-- my third go at rehab. 

           Tammy Faye pats Jezzy’s hand.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        How are you feeling this time 
                        around?

           A beat.

                                 JEZZY
                        Truth?

           Tammy nods. Ashamed, Jezzy looks at the floor.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I miss it. Like my body doesn’t 
                        need it now, but I just keep 
                        thinking how nice it would be to 
                        just turn my life off for a 
                        while... I’m kind a scared to leave 
                        here, to tell you the truth... It 
                        feels like this giant brick is 
                        stuck in my chest...

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I know that feeling.
                                 JEZZY
                        It’s like the worst feeling in the 
                        world. So yeah, sometimes I just 
                        wanna feel that weightless thing. 
                        Like everything’s gonna be okay and 
                        I’m not this terrible person 
                        anymore--

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Why do you think you’re a terrible 
                        person? 

                                 JEZZY
                        I dunno.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Have you ever murdered anyone?

                                 JEZZY
                        Uh, no.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        OK. So, what’s so terrible about 
                        you then?

           A beat as Jezzy thinks.

                                 JEZZY
                        Everything. 

           Tammy puts her arm around Jezzy, comforting her.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO)
                        You are a miracle... God made you a 
                        miracle and how can that possibly 
                        be terrible?

           Another beat.

                                 JEZZY
                        I think my dad had this stupid idea 
                        that they could rehab me wanting to 
                        be a girl right out of my system. 

           Off Tammy Faye’s appalled expression.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        As if, right?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Is your father an intelligent man?

           They exchange a look and laugh. 
           After a a couple beats--

                                 JEZZY
                        He’s an angry man. My dad. Real 
                        mean. I sometimes wonder if he 
                        wouldn’t have ended up being so 
                        mean if it weren’t for me. Like if 
                        I was the perfect son, football 
                        player, good grades, Ivy League 
                        bound... making him proud... would 
                        he be happy then?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Probably not, Jezzy. 

           Jezzy nods.

                                 JEZZY
                        My mom and my sister... we used to 
                        be best friends. The three of us. 
                        They’re scared of him, so I don’t 
                        really blame them. I know my Mom,  
                        deep down in her heart-- she was 
                        okay with me being... this way... 
                        In another life, she might’ve even 
                        like encouraged me to just be 
                        myself, ya know? 
                            (then)
                        But the look in her eyes... the 
                        first time she realized I was 
                        hustling for drugs... It was 
                        just... disappointment. Epic, sad-
                        as-hell disappointment. Awful.  

           Tammy takes this in.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        She loves you, Jezzy. She was 
                        probably disappointed in herself. 
                        She probably blames herself for 
                        your pain.

                                 JEZZY
                        You’re just saying that to make me 
                        feel better.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        No, I mean it.
                            (then)
                        I think my son is experimenting 
                        with drugs.

                                 JEZZY
                        Yeah? What kind of drugs?
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I don’t know exactly. But I have to 
                        remember not to look at him the way 
                        your mother looked at you.

                                 JEZZY
                        You won’t be able to help it, 
                        Tammy. 

           Tammy stands, suddenly agitated.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I-I need to call Jim and just force 
                        him to pick me up in the morning.

                                 JEZZY
                        There’s a strict rule here about 
                        waiting five days before patients 
                        can call out. 

           Tammy’s hands fly to her face.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’ll go bananas if I have to stay 
                        here one more day, especially with 
                        you leaving so soon. I have to get 
                        out of here and back home, Jezzy. I 
                        mean it. I just have to.

           Off Jezzy, wheels turning.

           INT. LOBBY/NURSE’S STATION - A WHILE LATER 

           Tammy Faye sits in a chair by the nurse’s station, thumbing 
           through a magazine. Nurse Daisy, Peppa and Bruce are behind 
           the counter when we hear a horrific SCREAM. The three nurses 
           run out towards the direction of the sound. 

           Tammy casually places the magazine down and looks around to 
           see if she’s alone.

           INT. ADJACENT WING - MOMENTS LATER

           Jezzy screams bloody murder again at...

           Barbara, in the hallway, completely in the nude, proudly 
           displays her skin and bones physique while smoking a 
           cigarette. Slung over one withered shoulder is a big rubber 
           bag with a long narrow tube and large plastic syringe 
           extending from it. 

           Nurses come running. Patients peek out from their rooms.
           INT. THE NURSE’S STATION - SAME TIME

           Tammy Faye sits alone in the station with a phone to her ear. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        If you don’t pick me up first thing 
                        in the morning, I’m leaving you-- I 
                        mean it, Jim.

           She pauses to listen.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, thank the Lord! I just knew you 
                        wouldn’t let me down. 
                            (then)
                        I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have 
                        threatened you. It’s just, my 
                        nerves are shot. 
                            (she begins to cry)
                        I miss you and the kids so-- so 
                        much. Okay, see you tomorrow, hun. 
                        Love you too.

           She hangs up and breathes a sigh of relief through her tears. 

           INT. ADJACENT WING - MOMENTS LATER

           Nurse Daisy excuses herself from the old woman’s room. 
           Barbara stands in the doorway, fully clothed now, lighting up 
           an ever-present cigarette.  

           Jezzy appears from around a corner. She checks to see that 
           the coast is clear and sidles up to Barbara. Jezzy slips a 
           folded twenty dollar bill into Barbara’s outstretched hand.

                                 JEZZY
                        Ten extra for the giant douche bag. 
                        Nice touch, Barb.

           Pleased with herself, Barbara nods before Jezzy slips away 
           unseen.

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - LATER

           Jezzy and Tammy Faye crack up in laughter.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        They heard that scream all the way 
                        to San Francisco.
                            (then)
                        That was one of the nicest things 
                        anyone’s ever done for me. 
                                 JEZZY
                        Aw, it was nothing. I got your 
                        back, girl.

           This visibly moves Tammy Faye.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Just so you know, I’ve got your 
                        back, too.

           Tammy Faye organizes her things in preparation for her 
           morning departure. Jezzy watches her.

                                 JEZZY
                        Can I tell you something? It’s 
                        kinda personal.

           Tammy Faye senses the importance of what Jezzy has to say and 
           looks at her, nodding her head. 

           They sit down.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I’m HIV positive. 

           Tammy Faye’s calm smile falls away. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’m so sorry.

           She hugs Jezzy.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to let me help you.

                                 JEZZY
                        No. I have to figure it out for 
                        myself.

           Tammy Faye pulls back to face her.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’m not asking. I’m telling you. 
                        Jim and I know some great doctors. 

                                 JEZZY
                        No way I’m scabbing off you and 
                        your husband.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I just found you, Jezzy, I’m not 
                        letting you go.
           They sit in silence for a beat until Peppa walks by and 
           knocks on the door frame.

                                 PEPPA
                        Dinner’s in five. 

           She walks away and knocks on the next door.

                                 PEPPA (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        Dinner’s in five.

           Jezzy attempts to lighten the mood.

                                 JEZZY
                        Let’s dress up.

           Tammy Faye is pulled from her thoughts.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Okay.

                                 JEZZY
                        Your makeup is totally on point. 
                        But now for the finishing touch.

           She pulls out the black sequined gown Tammy Faye admired 
           earlier. Tammy looks down at her own body like the dress 
           couldn’t possibly be her size. 

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        It’ll totally fit you.

           Tammy Faye closes the door to their room and proceeds to 
           remove her clothes and slip right into the dress in front of 
           Jezzy. 

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Like a hand in glove. 

           Tammy Faye looks at herself in the mirror, pleased.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        How the heck are we the same size? 
                        You’re way slimmer than me.

           Jezzy is thrilled, but something gives her pause.

                                 JEZZY
                        I gotta teeny weeny confession to 
                        make.

           Tammy Faye continues to admire herself in the mirror.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        What’s that?

                                 JEZZY
                        I kind a like-- impersonate you.

           She turns to look at Jezzy, confused.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        It’s totally out of love and 
                        respect, but I’ve been obsessed 
                        with you my whole life. I’m not a 
                        stalker or anything. I just love 
                        your style, Tammy Faye-- always 
                        have-- and I like thought you 
                        should know that I do you at some 
                        of my drag shows.

           INT. A DRAG SHOW STAGE - NIGHT

           Jezzy, in full Tammy Faye drag, belts out a song.

                                 JEZZY (SINGS)
                        Well, somebody touched me! Oh, 
                        somebody touched me! I was in 
                        darkness, but now I see!

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - EVENING 

           Jezzy tries to read Tammy’s face as she processes this.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m sorry. It’s too weird, right?

           Tammy Faye grins at her.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It’s not weird. Okay, it’s a little 
                        unusual, but I’m flattered. I mean 
                        it. I really am.

           Jezzy sighs in relief.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You should dress up like me 
                        tonight.
                                 JEZZY
                        Are you serious?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        As a heart attack. 
                            (then)
                        I wanna see what I look like!

           Jezzy laughs at this and proceeds to scramble through her 
           trunk. She stops and thinks for a moment then turns to Tammy 
           Faye, reverential and nervous.

                                 JEZZY
                        Um... Do you think you could show 
                        me how you do your lashes? I, uh-- 
                        I can’t do them as good as you.

           Tammy pulls out her giant eyelash kit. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I call this quantity over quality. 
                            (then)
                        You know what? We should do a duet 
                        tonight-- as the two Tammys!

           Jezzy’s mouth drops.

           PRELAP - Violins and horns swell. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           ECU -- JEZZY AND TAMMY FAYE’S MATCHING FACES

           With identical crazy lashes and smiles, Jezzy and Tammy Faye 
           sing “If Life Hands You a Lemon/You Start Making Lemonade!”

                                 JEZZY & TAMMY (SING)
                        If life hands you a lemon, you 
                        start making lemonade! 

           We pull out to see...

           INT. SMALL, DARK STAGE - NIGHT

           Tammy Faye and Jezzy, both dressed to the nines, perform on a 
           tiny black box stage with red velvet curtains behind them. A 
           spotlight shines on them from somewhere.

                                 JEZZY (SINGS)
                        If the heat of the day gets a 
                        little too hot, you just start 
                        thinking shade!
                                 TAMMY FAYE (SINGS)
                        You thank God for the situation and 
                        you praise him for the day he made.

           In the audience, other Betty Ford PATIENTS sway along. 
           Barbara, cigarette dangling from her lips, shakes her bony 
           ass. 

                                 JEZZY & TAMMY (SING)
                        Oh, if life hands you a lemon, you 
                        start making lemonade! I said you 
                        start making lemonade!

           Tammy Faye and Jezzy hold actual lemons and mime squeezing 
           them into a pitcher with a giant spoon that magically appears 
           out of nowhere. 

           Spotlight on Jezzy now. She throws the lemon over her 
           shoulder, which Tammy Faye catches. 

                                 JEZZY  (SPEAKS)
                        You know we all get sidetracked 
                        just a making those plans of what 
                        we wanna be and do. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JEZZY’S CHILDHOOD LIVING ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Twelve-year-old Paula helps ten-year-old Jesse dress up like 
           Tammy Faye-- makeup and high heels, a costume wig of crazy 
           blonde curls. The PTL Club is on TV in the background.

                                 JEZZY (V.O)
                            (speaks)
                        And you know all too often we don’t 
                        even consult God about what he has 
                        in mind for me and you.

           Esméralda enters with a basket of laundry. Paula and Jesse 
           dance around in their mother’s heels. Esméralda joins the 
           fun, dancing around with them until they all look up, 
           terrified, when Francis appears in the doorway.

                                 JEZZY (V.O) (CONT’D)
                            (sings)
                        Well, we plot and we scheme, we 
                        struggle and we fret... And we’re 
                        amazed when we’re pruned by God’s 
                        blade.

           Esméralda pulls at Francis’ arm as he whacks the crap out of 
           Jesse, ripping the dress off of him. 
           He shoves Esméralda to the floor and proceeds to pull the 
           leather belt from his waist to whip Paula. We only see his 
           hand grip the belt before it comes down, repeatedly. His 
           steely eyes burn.

                                 JEZZY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                            (speaks)
                        But you know what he’s trying to 
                        teach us that when he hands us a 
                        lemon...

           Off little Jesse’s tear-filled eyes, helpless, watching his 
           sister being beaten.

                        Ah, when life hands you a lemon, 
                        you start making lemonade!

           They dance around, fanning each other with large yellow 
           feathers.

                                  JEZZY (SINGS)
                        If the heat of the day gets a

                        thinking shade!

           They pose, back to back.

           We are back on little Jesse and his family, now praying to 
           the television set with their hands up and their eyes closed. 

           This is the same moment Jezzy flashed back to when she first 
           met Tammy Faye in person.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SINGS)(V.O.)

           Young Jesse stares guiltily at the BRIGHT RED WELTS on the 
           back of Paula’s legs.

           They turn to the audience at the same time.

                        Aha!

           The big spotlight is on Tammy Faye now.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You know there’s times when we 
                        think we’ve hit our highest low yet 
                        and there’s just nothing left to go 
                        wrong.

           private plane she, her two kids (Jamie Charles and Tammy Sue) 
           and her DOCTOR are on.

                        sneak in and steal our happy song.

           Wading through a sea of rats at 30,000 feet, Tammy Faye 
           rushes the emergency exit, but the doctor and her kids pull 
           her away before she can open it.

                        we’re afraid we just can’t make the 
                        grade. You know we can throw in the

           INT. BETTY FORD CENTER - NIGHT

           All is quiet and dimly lit in the nurse’s station and 
           hallways. A male NIGHT NURSE watches television with the 
           sound very low. 

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM  - NIGHT

           The full moon is shining down through the window on Tammy 
           Faye and Jezzy. 
           They face each other from their separate beds. They’re both 
           in pajamas, but Tammy is still in full makeup.

                                 JEZZY
                        You really think it’ll work?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I know it will. If there’s one 
                        thing I know how to do, it’s put on 
                        a good show.

                                 JEZZY
                        I can’t believe I’m taking my act 
                        on the road with Tammy Faye!

                        We’ll start with smaller venues 
                        around here and up along the coast. 
                        After we catch some heat, we can do 
                        the bigger shows in Los Angeles. 

           She studies Jezzy for a moment.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        You sure you want to do this?

                                 JEZZY
                        Beyond sure.

           Jezzy smiles but her thoughts darken.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Tammy Faye?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Yeah?

                                 JEZZY
                        What if you change your mind?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Why would I do that?

                                 JEZZY
                        What if when you get home, back to 
                        your life and your husband, you 
                        realize that maybe it’s not such a 
                        great plan to go on the road with a 
                        drag queen? I mean, it’s kind of a 
                        crazy idea, if you think about it.

           Tammy Faye reaches her hand out and Jezzy takes it.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I promise you, we are going to 
                        stick to this plan. 

           A beat.

           Jezzy begins to weep. Tammy quickly moves to comfort her.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? 

           Jezzy sits up and wipes her eyes.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m scared.

           Tammy Faye wipes Jezzy’s tears and puts her arm around her.

                        I’m here, Jezzy. Right here, honey.

                                 JEZZY
                        I don’t want to die.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh, Jezzy.

           Tammy Faye holds her close, almost cradling her like a baby.

                                 JEZZY
                        My dad says God’s punishing me cuz 
                        I’m this way. What if he’s right? 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        No-no. 

                                 JEZZY
                        What if I die alone, no family, 
                        nobody? No one remembers me or 
                        misses me. 

           Tammy Faye is stricken by Jezzy’s vulnerability.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I love you, Jezzy. We’re family 
                        now, and God hasn’t forgotten you. 
                        It’s why he brought us together. 
                            (then)
                        I’m your momma now.

           Jezzy smiles through her tears. They hug. 

                                 JEZZY
                        I love you, too.
           Off Jezzy, at peace for once in a long time.

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - LATER

           Jezzy sleeps. Tammy sits up in bed in the dark, eyes closed, 
           praying. A blue light appears, illuminating her face. Her 
           eyes pop open.

           TAMMY’S VISION

           Jesus Christ and the Little Brown & Blue Angel stand at the 
           foot of her bed. They are dressed like warriors. Jesus holds 
           a medieval looking sword. His face is in shadow, but we see 
           the angel clearly (she looks like Jezzy), also holding a 
           sword in her hand.

                                 LITTLE BLUE ANGEL
                        Tammy Faye, you must prepare for 
                        battle.

           Tammy Faye blinks, and they’re gone. She jumps out of bed and 
           tries to wake Jezzy.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Jezzy! Wake up!

           Jezzy is roused, but very sleepy.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I just saw Jesus and you -- the 
                        Little Angel. They visited me.

           Jezzy, disoriented, rubs her eyes.

                                 JEZZY
                            (smiles sleepily)
                        That’s nice.

           She falls back asleep. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (to herself)
                        Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.

           Awestruck, Tammy stares at the spot where Jesus and the angel 
           stood. A realization hits and her expression darkens.

           INT. HALLWAY & LOBBY - MORNING

           Happy as clams, Tammy Faye and Jezzy come down the hallway, 
           loaded down with luggage. 
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        We are going home, Jezzy. 
                        Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

           Jezzy laughs.

           In the lobby they set their belongings by the door and don’t 
           even bother to sit down. 

           TIME LAPSES where they eventually sit, watch the clock, and 
           wait until Nurse Daisy approaches.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Tammy, your husband just called. 

           Tammy stands.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Why didn’t you let me talk to him?

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        He sends his apologies that he 
                        couldn’t speak to you himself, but 
                        he was in a rush and asked me to 
                        relay that he got pulled into an 
                        emergency meeting. He won’t be able 
                        to collect you this morning. He 
                        isn’t sure if he’ll be able to come 
                        for you today at all.

           Without a word, Tammy lifts a few of her bags and walks away 
           down the hall. 

           A moment later, Jezzy grabs the rest of their luggage and 
           hobbles back down towards their room.

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A CLEANING WOMAN is vacuuming when Jezzy enters. The luggage 
           Tammy carried with her is thrown onto one of the twin beds. 

           The cleaning woman sees Jezzy and points to the closet.

           Jezzy unloads the rest of the luggage onto the other twin bed 
           and waits for the woman to finish. Taking her sweet-ass time, 
           the woman finally unplugs the vacuum before exiting. 

           Jezzy stands with her ear to the closet door. The room is 
           silent. She knocks gently. Tammy Faye opens the door.

                                 JEZZY
                        You okay?
           Tammy looks perfectly fine.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh, hi Jezzy. 

           She notes the luggage.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for bringing my luggage. I 
                        guess we should see what’s on the 
                        to-do list for today.

           Jezzy’s eyes follow Tammy as she walks out of the room.

           INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Lindsay facilitates a group counseling session. Seated in a 
           circle with her are Jezzy, Tammy Faye, Barbara, Hannah and 
           Stuart.

           CLOSE ON young and blonde Hannah.

                                 HANNAH
                        He would never do the things my 
                        bitch-ass mother says he did.

                                 LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        How does that make you feel?

           Hannah laughs. 

           We scan the faces in the group... 

           Tammy Faye listens politely, hands folded in her lap. 

           Jezzy looks like a kid in detention, checking the clock on 
           the wall repeatedly. 

           Stuart, chin in hand, struggles to keep his eyes open due to 
           either fatigue or cigarette smoke curling in his direction.

           Barbara chain smokes, inexplicably tapping ashes into her 
           hand and slipping them into the pocket of her kimono.

                                 HANNAH
                            (mimics her)
                        How does that make you feel? 

           Lindsay stares at her blankly.
                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, you are like the WORST 
                        therapist in the history of 
                        therapists.

           Lindsay keeps it together.

                                 LINDSAY
                        I hear what you’re saying, but this 
                        isn’t about me, Hannah. Help me-- 
                        help us understand... What is it 
                        like being you?

           All eyes are on the girl, a simmering volcano. The room is 
           silent for a moment until--

                                 HANNAH
                        OK, Stickneed. Sounds like you 
                        really wanna hear something to make 
                        you feel better about your own 
                        boring vanilla existence. 

           Lindsay is obviously hurt by this, but covers with one of her 
           weird smiles. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Maybe when you go home tonight, all 
                        alone, you can jerk off to what 
                        it’s like being me--
                            (to Stuart)
                        Wait. Is it still called jerking 
                        off, if you’re a girl?
                            (to Jezzy)
                        Hey, what’s it called if a girl-- 
                        Oh, right-- you’re not really a 
                        girl! Ha, ha.

           If this stings Jezzy, she doesn’t let it show, but it clearly 
           bothers Tammy Faye.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Hannah, please do not speak to my 
                        friend like that. Jezzy is most 
                        definitely a girl.

           Awkward silence. Jezzy and Tammy exchange a look of great 
           affection.

                                 HANNAH
                        Um, okaaaay. First off, my mom is a 
                        bitch--

                                 JEZZY
                        You already said that.
           Hannah glares at Jezzy for a moment before continuing.

                                 HANNAH
                        The reason she sent me to Betty-
                        fucking-Ford is not because she’s 
                        worried about my “drinking” 
                        problem, it’s because she’s 
                        jealous. My daddy prefers me to 
                        her, if ya know what I mean.

                                 LINDSAY
                        What do you mean?

           Hannah sets her gaze on Lindsay.

                                 HANNAH
                        What do you think I mean?

                                 LINDSAY
                        I just want to clarify--

                                 HANNAH
                        My DADDY likes me to suck him off! 

           Tammy Faye winces then immediately prays, hands raised in 
           supplication.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO)
                        Oh, sweet Jesus! Please Lord, 
                        deliver this child with your grace 
                        and mercy.

           Hannah laughs.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Thank you for sharing, Hannah. That 
                        was very brave of you.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (shocked)
                        Is that it? Shouldn’t we stay on 
                        Hannah a little bit longer?... Do 
                        the authorities know about this? 
                            (to Hannah)
                        How old are you, sweetheart?

                                 HANNAH
                        Thirteen, two months ago.

           Tammy Faye’s hands fly to her face.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh, no! You poor thing!
           Lindsay appears at a loss for words.

                                 BARBARA
                        Tickling the kitty.

           All eyes turn to Barbara.

                                 LINDSAY
                        What was that, Barbara?

           Barbara takes a long drag of her cigarette.

                                 BARBARA
                        Tickling the kitty... In my day, 
                        that’s what us girls called jerking 
                        off. Or, sometimes we’d say-- 
                        checking for oil. 

           More awkward silence. 

                                 STUART
                            (to Tammy Faye)
                        I know you. Your ‘usband bilked 
                        like a ton a money from his merch 
                        or whatevah. 

           Tammy Faye dabs at her eyes with a tissue.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Shagged his secretary, in’it true?

                                 JEZZY
                        Shut up!

           Tammy Faye reaches out to pat Jezzy’s arm before she mimes 
           brushes something invisible off her own shoulder.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It’s okay.

                                 STUART
                            (to Jezzy)
                        Aw come on love, I din’t mean 
                        noffin by it.

                                 LINDSAY
                        Stuart, let’s hear about YOU. 

                                 STUART
                        I’m an open book, whad’ya want ta 
                        know?
                                 LINDSAY
                        Whatever you feel like sharing 
                        about yourself.

           He thinks for a minute, a mischievous smile forming.

                                 STUART
                        A’ight, I’ll start with me 
                        childhood.

           Lindsay perks up.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        I remembah the day me mum lef me. I 
                        was just a wee lad. Cheeky sod I 
                        was, but still. I says to her, mum, 
                        how can you just leave me standin’?

           Lindsay nods, actively listening.

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Alone... in a world that’s so cold.

           Jezzy looks up at him-- catching onto something. Hannah 
           catches it, too.

                                 HANNAH (SOTTO)
                        So cold.

                                 LINDSAY
                        What was that, Hannah?

           Hannah shrugs, feigning innocence.

                                 LINDSAY (CONT’D)
                        Stuart, please continue.

           Stuart gazes off into space.

                                 STUART
                        I dunno, Linds... Maybe I’m just 
                        too demanding.

           Hannah and Jezzy both fight the urge to laugh. 

                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I’m just like my father.

                                 HANNAH
                        Too bold?

           Stuart maintains his poker face, but Hannah cracks up, making 
           Jezzy laugh as well. Tammy Faye observes this, baffled.
                                 LINDSAY
                        Please, ladies... someone is 
                        sharing.

                                 STUART
                        It’s all good, Linds. Hannah’s 
                        right, too bold.

                                 LINDSAY
                            (energized)
                        Oh. Okay... okay. Typically, I 
                        would stick to refraining from 
                        comments, but -- and let me know if 
                        you disagree, Stuart -- I think 
                        we’re getting somewhere here. You 
                        really seem to be opening up... 
                        This is good... Keep going.

                                 STUART
                        Maybe you’re just like my mother.

           He looks right at Lindsay. 

                                 LINDSAY
                        Do I... remind you... of your 
                        mother?

                                 STUART
                        She’s never satisfied.
                            (then)
                        She’s never satisfied-- me mum.

           Seeing Jezzy and Hannah silently lose it, Tammy Faye leans in 
           to whisper to Jezzy.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO)
                        What’s going on?

                                 JEZZY
                        Prince.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        What?

           Stuart winks at Jezzy before he stands and yells out--

                                 STUART
                        Why do we SCREAM at each other?!

           Lindsay straightens up in her chair. Barbara stands and 
           leaves the room without a word. 

           Prince’s “When Doves Cry” erupts in our heads as Stuart 
           completes the verse while gyrating his hips.
                                 STUART (CONT’D)
                        This is what it sounds like...
                            (sings)
                        When doves cry... YEOW! YEOW! YEOW! 
                        YEOW! YEOW! YEOW!

           Stuart stops, and the music in our heads stops. 

           Jezzy and Hannah laugh, but Tammy Faye is focused on Lindsay 
           who appears to be shrinking in her chair. The laughter dies 
           down and Tammy is up on her feet, kneeling by Lindsay. 
           Lindsay just stares at her hands.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (softly)
                        Linds? Are you all right?

           The others sit back in their seats. Tammy Faye lightly 
           touches her hand. Lindsay speaks quietly, painfully.

                                 LINDSAY
                        I don’t know why I thought I could 
                        do this. Hannah’s right. I’m the 
                        worst therapist ever.

           Tears form in Lindsay’s eyes.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh, honey, that’s not true.

                                 LINDSAY
                        You don’t need to lie to me. I know 
                        I’m no good at this.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        What I know is that you really care 
                        about people.

           Lindsay looks around at the others. Hannah and Stuart still 
           look amused, but Jezzy has lost her smile.

                                 LINDSAY
                        You all think I can’t hear you when 
                        you make fun of me in the hallways.

                                 HANNAH
                        No, we know you can hear us.

                                 JEZZY
                        Geez, Hannah!

           Lindsay emits a short, mirthless laugh. Hannah rolls her eyes 
           at Jezzy.
                                 LINDSAY
                        But, I do love people... I love 
                        helping people... I don’t know why 
                        I’m just so bad at it.
                            (then)
                        Both my parents were addicts. My 
                        dad died when I was seven. Heroin. 
                        My mother... she was bipolar. Self-
                        medicated. Anything you can think 
                        of, she took it... I was fifteen... 
                        I came home from school and found 
                        her. She’d taken most of a bottle 
                        of tranquilizers and cut her 
                        wrists... There was blood 
                        everywhere... all over the place. I 
                        tried to get her to wake up and... 
                        I slapped her and... I was just a 
                        kid. I tried to... I tried to shake 
                        her. But she wouldn’t... she 
                        wouldn’t wake up. I got blood all 
                        over my clothes... 
                            (then)
                        The thing that gets me is she knew 
                        I would find her. It was just her 
                        and me. I had nobody else. She knew 
                        I would find her there.

           Tammy holds Lindsay in her arms now, comforting her.

           CLOSE ON Jezzy, deeply moved. She stands and joins Tammy Faye 
           in hugging Lindsay.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m sorry, Lindsay. I’m so sorry 
                        for everything.

           Hannah and Stuart watch, stunned. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I was lying about my dad. 

           Everyone looks at her.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I was just messing with you all. I 
                        don’t really suck my dad off-- 
                        that’s fucking disgusting.

                                 JEZZY
                        You are such a bitch!

           This stings Hannah. 
                                 HANNAH
                        Hey, Tammy Faye? You know your 
                        friend’s got a full-on penis 
                        underneath that dress, right?

           Jezzy and Tammy Faye exchange a look. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Hannah, I know you’re in pain, but--

                                 HANNAH
                        It’s not like I’m trying to insult 
                        him-- or her or whatever, gawd it’s 
                        SO confusing... 

           Seeing that Lindsay has recovered somewhat, Tammy Faye goes 
           back to her chair.

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        ...and he clearly prefers to bone 
                        other dudes, doesn’t that make him 
                        a sinner?

           Jezzy’s eyes shoot daggers through Hannah.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        We’re all sinners, but our sins can 
                        be washed away by the blood of 
                        Christ.

                                 HANNAH
                        Gross... But only if Jezzy stops 
                        doing the gay stuff, right?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I said we’re all sinners, didn’t I?

                                 HANNAH
                        Okay, but let’s say Jezzy’s dad 
                        came asking you for advice on what 
                        to do about Jezzy. Like, would you 
                        tell him that you agree it’s a sin 
                        if Jezzy’s with another guy-- 
                        sexually? Or not?

           Jezzy watches Tammy collect her thoughts.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Well, the Bible says sex should 
                        happen only in marriage... between 
                        a man and a woman.

           Jezzy and Tammy exchange a look. Something in Jezzy 
           immediately changes. She is wounded and defensive.
                                 JEZZY
                        Oh, right-- and since I’m not 
                        really a woman... so yeah, it’s a 
                        sin. Got it.

           A long, awkward beat before Jezzy looks at Tammy again.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        You’re exactly like my father, you 
                        know that? But, you’re just so 
                        sweet about it. I’m not sure which 
                        is worse. Deep down both of you 
                        believe I’m a degenerate and both 
                        of you are hypocrites... He beats 
                        his children and his wife, but God 
                        punishes me with this disease. You 
                        steal money from little old 
                        grandmas, but I’m the sinner-- oh, 
                        right, I forgot. We’re all sinners.

           Tammy is clearly shocked.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Jezzy, I don’t steal!

                                 JEZZY
                        Yes, you do. That little old lady 
                        believes you, believes that if she 
                        gives you her whole Social Security 
                        check, God is gonna bless her ten-
                        fold. But it doesn’t happen, does 
                        it? She ends up broke until her 
                        next check, eating cat food out of 
                        a can, praying to God she’ll find 
                        her next meal and enough money to 
                        pay for heat when winter comes. And 
                        YOU go home in your million dollar 
                        Rolls Royce and your fur coat and 
                        sit on your gold plated toilet 
                        seat, shitting all over the people 
                        who believe all the lies you tell 
                        them, just like I believed that God 
                        loves me no matter what the world 
                        may say or do... and just like I 
                        believed that you love me-- you 
                        really, really do.

           With that she gets up and exits, leaving Tammy stunned.

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jezzy grabs all her belongings from the room and heads down 
           the hall towards the nurse’s station.
           INT. NURSE’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Bruce and Peppa are seated at the desk. Nurse Daisy is 
           standing, reading something off a clipboard. They all look up 
           when Jezzy stops in front of them with her luggage.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Are you checking out, Miss Jezzy?

           Nurse Daisy’s kindness disarms Jezzy.

                                 JEZZY
                        Yes... please.

           Nurse Daisy nods with a sincere smile.

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Let’s get you a cab then.

           She picks up a phone and proceeds to dial.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Tammy Faye and Lindsay walk slowly, arm-in-arm, comforting 
           each other. They near Tammy’s room.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I need to call my husband.

           Lindsay nods.

           INT. NURSE’S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Jezzy sits with her luggage at her feet. Her back is to the 
           nurse’s station, but she can hear what’s happening behind 
           her. Tammy Faye approaches with Lindsay. It pains her to see 
           Jezzy there. She looks away and speaks to Bruce.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’d like to make a call.

           Fully aware that Nurse Daisy is watching him...

                                 BRUCE
                        Tammy, we have a very strict five 
                        day--

                                 NURSE DAISY
                        Let her use the phone, Bruce. 

           Bruce nods and hands Tammy the phone.
           ANGLE ON Jezzy, listening. As Tammy becomes increasingly 
           emotional, the guilt on Jezzy’s face deepens.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (O.S.)
                        Hello? Rick? Yes... Is Jim there?   
                            (pause)
                        I know he’s there, please let me 
                        speak to him... Why are you doing 
                        this? I’m so sick right now. I need 
                        him to come get me. Why won’t he 
                        talk to me?!

           Back on Tammy-- she cries into the phone. Lindsay puts her 
           arm around her.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I’m like a prisoner here. Please 
                        put him on the phone, Rick!

           After a moment of listening, Tammy hands the phone back to 
           Bruce. She turns around and sees Jezzy still there, her back 
           to her. Tammy blinks slowly and shuffles away.

           CLOSE ON Jezzy. She hears a loud bellowing coming from the 
           direction of the room she shared with Tammy. The sound of a 
           lamp shattering comes next, along with Tammy’s screams.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I wanna die! I wanna die! I wanna 
                        die... I wanna die... 

           Jezzy sees a yellow cab roll up to the front entrance. She 
           stands up and grabs her luggage, ready to leave.

           She pauses, hearing....

                                 TAMMY FAYE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Please Lord, I wanna die...

           Jezzy pulls herself together and heads for the glass doors 
           while Tammy’s voice continues to ring out.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I keep asking God to kill me, but 
                        he never listens...

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Tammy is a rumpled mess on the floor. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO)
                        God doesn’t listen...
           Lindsay tries to hold her but gets pushed away. Meanwhile, 
           Bruce is cleaning up the broken lamp Tammy must have thrown 
           across the room.

           Tammy finally gets up off the floor.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO) (CONT’D)
                        I just want to be alone right now.

           She walks inside the bedroom closet and closes the door 
           behind her.

           Lindsay and Bruce exchange a helpless look.

           INT. TAXI CAB - DAY (TRAVELING)

           For several long beats we stay on Jezzy in the back seat, her 
           expression a testament to all the heartache she’s faced in 
           the last twenty-four hours.

           She blinks away tears until finally...

                                 JEZZY
                        Stop the car, please.

           We hear the crackle of tires on gravel as the cab begins to 
           slow down.

           INT. BETTY FORD CENTER ENTRANCE/LOBBY/HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jezzy pushes through the doors to the entrance... runs 
           towards the nurse’s station lobby... then she runs down the 
           hallway to Tammy’s room.

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - DAY

           She enters the room as Bruce is leaving with the remains of 
           the broken lamp. Lindsay brightens seeing Jezzy.

                                 JEZZY
                        Where is she?

           Lindsay indicates the closet door then steps out of the room. 
           Jezzy kneels beside the door. She speaks quietly. We hear 
           muffled crying coming from inside the closet.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Tammy? It’s me. Please let me talk 
                        to you.

           A long beat.
                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Tammy, I’m sorry... I didn’t mean 
                        to say the things I said. Those 
                        were really shitty things to say, 
                        and there’s no excuse... I’m just 
                        so, so sorry.

           The door creaks open halfway. Tammy is a hot mess of makeup, 
           snot and tears. She manages to meet Jezzy’s eyes before 
           gently pulling her... 

           INSIDE THE CLOSET.

           They are packed tightly together, crouching awkwardly.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Um... okay. 

           Tammy sniffles.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry... for everything.

           Tammy pats Jezzy’s hand.

                                 TAMMY FAYE 
                        I saw all these demons coming at 
                        me...

                                 JEZZY
                        When? Now? Just now?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        No. Remember how I told you about 
                        those hallucinations I had when I 
                        was really sick?

                                 JEZZY
                        Yeah.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I saw something... something so 
                        horrible--

                                 JEZZY
                        The falling elephants? 

           Tammy shakes her head.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Oh the rats, you said. Thousands 
                        and thousands of them.
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Yes, but I’ve never told anyone 
                        about what else I saw... Demons. 
                        Devils. They were coming at me-- 
                        all at once. Screaming my name over 
                        and over with their grotesque faces 
                        and mouths. I knew I was in hell. 
                        Jezzy, I’m so scared I’m gonna go 
                        to hell for all the things I’ve 
                        done. 

           A beat. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Part of me liked to believe I was 
                        just dumb, unaware of all the 
                        things we were doing. But I’m not 
                        stupid. I’m not stupid at all. I am 
                        quite aware of what has been going 
                        on all around me, even on those 
                        pills... I knew.
                            (then)
                        People who have never been poor 
                        like me growing up... we didn’t 
                        even have indoor plumbing... They 
                        don’t know what it’s like. What 
                        it’s like to finally have 
                        everything you ever wanted. It 
                        makes you crazy. That’s not an 
                        excuse. It’s just an explanation. I 
                        know those demons were coming for 
                        me, for all the things I’ve done. 
                        I’m so scared Jezzy. What if God 
                        rejects me?

           They both cry and hold each other. After a few beats, Jezzy 
           pulls away to face Tammy.

                                 JEZZY
                        Please, stop being so hard on 
                        yourself... You’ve gotta forgive 
                        yourself. This is hell-- right here 
                        on earth. Those demons weren’t 
                        real. You imagined them because you 
                        felt guilty... but God loves us no 
                        matter what. I know I said those 
                        awful things, but I feel it in my 
                        bones that God really does love us. 

           Tammy looks into Jezzy’s eyes, wanting to believe it like she 
           does.
           OUTSIDE THE CLOSET DOOR-- we see Jezzy and Tammy emerge. 
           Tammy immediately goes to the mirror to check out the mess 
           she’s become.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (looks in the mirror)
                        Oh, Lord. Just awful.

           She opens a cylinder of loose powder about to apply some to 
           her face, but she pauses to look at Jezzy.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you for coming back.

           Jezzy smiles weakly and sits down on one of the beds, 
           watching Tammy attempt to fix her face at the vanity. Tammy 
           glances at Jezzy and stops what she’s doing.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        All that stuff that Hannah was 
                        asking me was just her trying to 
                        get at you.

           Jezzy shrugs.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know something. If 
                        your father asked me for advice 
                        about you, I would defend you. I 
                        would tell him to love and cherish 
                        you anyway.

           This hits a painful chord in Jezzy. She let’s out a heavy 
           sigh and starts to walk out of the room. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Wait! What did I say? 

           Reluctantly, Jezzy turns around to face her.

                                 JEZZY
                        Tammy, there is nothing wrong with 
                        me.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I know that.

                                 JEZZY
                        Nope. You DON’T know that.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Just tell me! Please! Tell me what 
                        is so wrong with what I said.
                                 JEZZY
                        You would tell my dad to love me... 
                        anyway?

           Tammy Faye takes this in. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I guess I can see how that doesn’t 
                        sound so good. But you know I don’t 
                        mean anything bad by it. I promise 
                        I will try to do better, but this 
                        is all new to me. I need time to 
                        catch up... 

           Jezzy paces, exasperated.

                                 JEZZY
                        I don’t have time for you to catch 
                        up, and I can’t wait for the whole 
                        world to catch up with me either. I 
                        don’t expect everyone to 
                        understand, but I need YOU to 
                        accept me. I need YOU to love me. 
                        To see that what I am or am trying 
                        to be is not a defect.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Honey, I DO accept you.

                                 JEZZY
                        No you don’t!
                            (mimics Tammy Faye’s voice)
                        Oh Jezzy, God loves you just the 
                        way you are! You’re more real than 
                        most of the women I know! Oh, Mr. 
                        Jones, sorry your son’s a 
                        disgusting degenerate, but try to 
                        love that piece of shit...

           Jezzy grabs the canister of makeup powder and SLAMS IT DOWN.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        ...ANYWAY!

           The loose white powder flies all over Tammy Faye, covering 
           her hair and face-- sticking to every single eyelash.

           Frozen in shock, neither of them moves a muscle until--

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean... to do that.

           Tammy Faye touches her powder soaked face and turns to the 
           mirror to see the damage.
                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        Tammy, I’m so--

           Before she can finish, Tammy Faye grabs the canister of loose 
           powder that is still half full and throws the remaining 
           powder at Jezzy’s stunned face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           ECU -- TAMMY FAYE’S EYES

           Tweezer between her fingers, Jezzy’s hand carefully glues and 
           sets a single fake lash onto Tammy Faye’s nearly bare lids. 

           It is a painstaking process.

           INT. COMMUNITY BATHROOM - DAY

           Jezzy and Tammy Faye sit cross-legged on a long bathroom 
           counter, both of them free and clear of any powder. The 
           bright bathroom spotlight illuminates the delicate work Jezzy 
           is doing on Tammy Faye.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Not even Jim has seen me without my 
                        lashes.

                                 JEZZY
                        I’m honored, but it is my fault you 
                        lost your lashes to begin with.

           Tammy peeks in the mirror as Jezzy uses the tweezer to grab 
           another lash from the case, carefully dabbing it with tacky 
           glue.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It’s okay. I got you back real 
                        good.

           Jezzy chuckles.

                                 JEZZY
                        Ready?

           Tammy closes her eyes, allowing Jezzy to add another lash. 

           TIME-LAPSE as Tammy Faye’s lashes become increasingly fuller 
           with Jezzy’s help.

           CLOSE ON both women in full makeup, looking into the mirror. 
                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I can breathe again.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Yes! That’s exactly what it feels 
                        like-- the same feeling I get when 
                        I’m flying in an airplane and it’s 
                        beginning its descent. Like you’re 
                        holding your breath until those 
                        wheels touch the tarmac. 

           Jezzy smiles at her in the mirror. Tammy Faye exhales loudly.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Jezzy, I can’t possibly understand 
                        what you go through every day. I’m 
                        going to make mistakes-- a lot. I 
                        just hope you can forgive me. And I 
                        honestly do accept you. 

           A beat as Jezzy lets this sink in. 

                                 JEZZY
                        Thank you. 
                            (then)
                        I shouldn’t have gotten so mad.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Honey, you can be mad at me all you 
                        want. I just need you to know that 
                        I would never say something to hurt 
                        you on purpose. 

           A beat.

                                 JEZZY
                        Are you a woman?

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Is this a trick question?

                                 JEZZY
                        Nope.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Then, yes.

                                 JEZZY
                        What if I told you-- what if 
                        everyone told you, “Tammy, you’re 
                        definitely a man.”
                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        It wouldn’t matter. I know I’m a 
                        woman because that’s what my body 
                        tells me.

           Jezzy gives her a look that suggests “ditto.” 

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Oh.

           Tammy Faye gets it, the realization washes over her.

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - DAY

           All their luggage is packed and organized neatly. They stand 
           by the window.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I don’t see the cab.

                                 JEZZY
                        I had to send it away, so a new 
                        one’s gonna pull up in about 
                        fifteen minutes...

           She indicates the front entrance of the building visible from 
           the room’s large window.

                                 JEZZY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll load up my stuff. Gonna have 
                        to tie my steamer trunk to the 
                        roof, so that might take a few 
                        minutes.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        While you’re doing that, I’ll put 
                        all these outside the window, 
                        right?

           Jezzy shakes her head.

                                 JEZZY
                        Uh-uh... we need to move your 
                        luggage like now, before the cab 
                        even shows up.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Oh. 
                                 JEZZY
                        It’s gonna be fine. We just can’t 
                        let the staff see you outside, but 
                        it’s also way too much for you to 
                        do all by yourself.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        What if we get someone to help us?

                                 JEZZY
                        I dunno... We totally can’t trust 
                        anyone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JEZZY & TAMMY FAYE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Stuart heaves the largest Gucci bag through the window. Jezzy 
           stands outside, catching it. She looks around and runs off 
           across the center’s pristine lawn. 

           Stuart shoves two more pieces outside and follows her. Tammy 
           appears in the window with two smaller bags and awkwardly 
           saddles the window sill, trying to exit in high heels.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Barbara stands watch outside of Jezzy and Tammy’s room, 
           casually leaning against the door frame smoking, of course.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BETTY FORD CENTER - DAY

           Miraculously, Tammy Faye has managed to cross the lawn 
           without breaking a heel where she meets up with Jezzy and 
           Stuart. They’ve piled Tammy’s expensive luggage on the 
           sidewalk right at the entrance to the center.

           While Tammy speaks, Stuart moves the luggage into a less 
           conspicuous spot.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                            (out of breath)
                        Okay, just one more bag left. It’s 
                        right outside the window... but 
                        it’s got my lashes, so I think I’ll 
                        just hold onto that one until it’s 
                        time.
           Jezzy nods in approval.

                                 STUART
                        Aw-right, ladies. This is great 
                        fun, yah... Dunno why we’re bein’ 
                        all stealth or whatevah, but hey... 
                        cool. Very cool.

           Tammy Faye grabs his hand and looks him in the eye.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Thank you so much for helping me 
                        break out of here, Stuart. You are 
                        a very fine young man, and I’m 
                        certain you will beat whatever 
                        demons you’re fighting right now.

           Stuart is visibly moved. They have a moment until--

                                 JEZZY
                        Yeah, thanks, Stuart-- and please 
                        don’t say anything about this.

           He looks up.

                                 STUART
                        If anyone finds out, it ain’t gonna 
                        be cos I tole ’em. 

           He nudges his chin in the direction of a LARGE WALL LENGTH 
           WINDOW on the side of the building.

           ANGLE ON a dozen rehab PATIENTS on exercise equipment, 
           watching them -- all with bemused looks on their faces. Two 
           MALE PATIENTS stand at a ping-pong table-- paddles up, game 
           interrupted. Hannah, vaguely amused, stands at the glass with 
           her arms crossed, peering out at them.

           Jezzy and Tammy Faye freeze, unsure of how to proceed when a 
           white Lincoln Continental pulls up the lane. It stops right 
           in front of them.

           We see Jim Bakker’s pudgy face slowly appear as the window 
           lowers. He’s smiling from ear-to-ear.

                                 JIM BAKKER
                        Hi, hun! Sorry I’m late, but you’ll 
                        never guess the day I had--

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Zip it, Jim.

           Off Jim’s puzzled look.
           INT. BETTY FORD CENTER - LOBBY - DAY

           Jezzy and Tammy stand with an elegant, statuesque woman--
           BETTY FORD herself. She glows from within, it seems.

           Lindsay, Nurse Daisy, Peppa and Bruce surround them at a 
           distance, as do Hannah, Barbara and a few other lookie-loo 
           patients who witnessed Tammy’s “great escape” moments ago. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I feel awfully silly now, Mrs. 
                        Ford. Trying to escape.

                                 BETTY FORD
                        Please, call me Betty.

           Tammy Faye basks in the woman’s strength of presence.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        You have some absolutely wonderful 
                        people working here, Betty.

           Lindsay and the nurses stand up a little straighter hearing 
           this. 

                                 BETTY FORD
                        I certainly agree with you.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        And me leaving-- or trying to 
                        escape-- is no reflection on them. 

           Betty places her hand gently on Tammy Faye’s shoulder.

                                 BETTY FORD
                        The power to leave always rests 
                        with you.

           Tammy Faye nods sheepishly, fully aware of the irony.

                                 BETTY FORD (CONT’D)
                        But, if you don’t get help here, 
                        please Tammy, get help somewhere.

           With that, Mrs. Ford glides away. Tammy and Jezzy are left 
           with all eyes on them.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’m really sorry everyone. I didn’t 
                        mean to make such a spectacle with 
                        my botched escape attempt.

           Laughter all around. Some patients call out to her.
                                 PATIENT #1
                        It was fun to watch!

                                 PATIENT #2
                        Anything to keep our minds off 
                        things.

           Tammy Faye smiles... and locks eyes with Hannah, but the girl 
           looks away.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I know a lot of you have been hurt. 
                        I have been hurt, horribly, on more 
                        than one occasion. And it’s a hard 
                        thing sometimes to forgive people. 
                        Right now, I could just spit at 
                        that man outside waiting for me.

           She points to Jim, outside the glass doors waiting by the car 
           with Rick.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        But I have to forgive him... or 
                        else it hurts me.
                            (then)
                        I didn’t mean to go a preachin’ but 
                        whoa-- watch out!

           While the small crowd erupts in laughter and cheers, Tammy 
           turns to speak to Jezzy only.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (SOTTO) (CONT’D)
                        Jezzy, I not only love and accept 
                        you. I want to celebrate you. You 
                        are the bravest, most beautiful and 
                        talented person I have ever met.

           Jezzy melts and hugs her tight. Tammy then turns back to the 
           crowd.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        I want to tell you all a story, if 
                        it’s okay with our nurses here...

           Nurse Daisy smiles and nods. More patients have emerged and 
           stopped to listen.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        In ancient civilization, if you 
                        killed somebody, instead of them 
                        putting you in a jail like 
                        nowadays, you know what they did? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        They took that dead person and they 
                        strapped that dead body to your 
                        back... And you know what ended up 
                        happening? That dead body ended up 
                        killing the person that was 
                        carrying him!
                            (beat)
                        I had a dead person on my back for 
                        a long time... it was my biological 
                        father who had abandoned me and my 
                        family when I was three years 
                        old... and I carried that man on my 
                        back until I heard a voice inside 
                        me say, “Tammy, lay him down. Just 
                        lay him down. I’ll take care of 
                        him!”  

           Scanning the attentive faces, we land on Hannah wiping a tear 
           from her face.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        And one day I finally unstrapped 
                        that dead body from my back. I laid 
                        that body down and I said, ”God, 
                        he’s not a part of me anymore... 
                        and I live!”

           The crowd claps and cheers.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Many of you may have a lot of 
                        people who have hurt you strapped 
                        to your backs. It may be your mom 
                        for leaving you when you needed her 
                        most. 

           She regards Jezzy who has tears in her eyes.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                            (to Jezzy)
                        It may be your dad or some other 
                        family member never accepting you 
                        for the wonderful being that you 
                        are. 
                            (back to the crowd)
                        You need to unstrap whoever hurt 
                        you. Get ‘em off your back and go 
                        forward and live. 

           Stuart wipes a tear, and Barbara smiles her toothy grin.

                                 TAMMY FAYE (CONT’D)
                        Lay ‘em down, let ‘em go and LIVE!
           We hear claps and cheers. People swarm Tammy Faye. After a 
           few hugs, she exits the building arm-in-arm with Jezzy.

           EXT. BETTY FORD CENTER ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

           We follow Jezzy and Tammy Faye as they approach the cab and 
           the Lincoln, both parked on the curb. Jezzy’s steam trunk is 
           tied down to the cab’s roof. Jim and Rick wait by the Lincoln 
           with its trunk still open, filled with Tammy’s luggage. 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        Come ride with me to our house. The 
                        cab can follow us with your 
                        luggage.

                                 JEZZY
                        Are you sure you want me to come 
                        home with you? 

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I’ve never been more sure about 
                        anything in my life.

           Jezzy feels hunky Rick’s admiring gaze. She locks eyes with 
           him and smiles -- THEY HAVE A MOMENT. 

           Tammy and Jim both catch this. 

           Jim turns and whispers something in Rick’s ear, which causes 
           Rick to grimace and turn away from Jezzy. 

           Tammy sees this, too. Jezzy looks like the wind has been 
           knocked out of her. She walks to the cab and gets in.

           INSIDE THE CAB...

                                 JEZZY
                        Can you drive me to Los Angeles?

           The CAB DRIVER turns to look at Jezzy and smiles broadly.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        For you beautiful lady, I’ll take 
                        you wherever you want to go.

           OUT ON THE CURB, Tammy looks pensive... then she makes a 
           beeline for the cab and gets in next to Jezzy. 

           BACK BY THE LINCOLN... Jim and Rick exchange a confused look. 

           They watch as the cab driver emerges from his car and 
           proceeds to transfer Tammy’s luggage to the cab. Jim walks 
           over to Tammy’s closed window and yells.
                                 JIM BAKKER
                        Tammy, what ARE you DOING?!

           She ignores him for a few seconds. He knocks at the window 
           several times until, finally, the window rolls down with an 
           audible ZEEEEEP. 

           Tammy stares straight ahead as he speaks to her.

                                 JIM BAKKER (CONT’D)
                        Tammy, I already said I’m sorry. 
                        Look, I’ll say it again-- I AM 
                        SORRY I DIDN’T COME GET YOU SOONER!

           Tammy turns to him and smiles.

                                 TAMMY FAYE
                        I forgive you, Jim.

           ZEEEEP! The window rises up as...

                                 JEZZY
                        Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

           MUSIC UP-- “Tammy Faye, I Love You” by Steven Wesley Guiles.

                                 STEVEN WESLEY GUILES 
                        Tammy Faye, I love you/ Don’t ever 
                        let no one come break your heart...

           INSIDE THE CAB AS IT DRIVES AWAY--

           Tammy Faye and Jezzy laugh like little kids.

           THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW-- we see Jim throw his arms up in 
           frustration. He shrinks further and further from view.

                                 STEVEN WESLEY GUILES
                        Sister don’t you break down/ Leave 
                        those haters coming back for 
                        more...

           Tammy Faye and Jezzy finally exhale and take in the moment.

                                 STEVEN WESLEY GUILES (CONT’D)
                        Standing still never suited you/ Or 
                        crying alone in your bed/ You’ve 
                        got heart like San Francisco/ 
                        You’ve got lips that raise the 
                        dead... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVEN WESLEY GUILES (CONT’D)
                        Tammy Faye, I love you/ Don’t ever 
                        let no one come break your heart/ 
                        Sister don’t you break down/ Leave 
                        those haters coming back for more/ 
                        Tammy Faye I love you/ When your 
                        eyes look into mine/ Sister you are 
                        sweetness/ Of sweet, sweet love 
                        divine... Locking doors never 
                        suited you/ Or looking down, caving 
                        in/ You’ve got heart big as Texas/ 
                        You speak love like a heroine...

           We watch Jezzy and Tammy Faye-- the giddiness and excitement 
           of their newfound freedom gradually transforms into something 
           more contemplative as they head off into the unknown.

                                                              FADE OUT.
            LATER… Tammy Faye becomes a beloved ICON of the LGBTQ community.

            -After her one-day stint at Betty Ford, Tammy eventually divorces Jim while he’s 
            incarcerated for wire and mail fraud and bilking his PTL ministry.

            -Tammy is seen as an outcast and a joke in the Christian televangelism world, mainly 
            due to her acceptance of the LGBTQ community, which includes her support of 
            patients with HIV/AIDS beginning at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the early 
            1980s.

            -In 1996 she co-hosts a secular talk show with gay actor Jim J. Bullock called the Jim 
            J. & Tammy Faye Show. She quits the show when she ﬁnds out she has cancer for the 
            second time.

            -Over many years, Tammy Faye actively participates in a number of Gay Pride events 
            nationwide, including judging Tammy Faye lookalike drag contests.

            -In 2004, after having battled cancer twice previously, Tammy has a slight comeback  
            when she stars in the reality series The Surreal Life alongside infamous porn star Ron 
            Jeremy and rapper Vanilla Ice.

            -In 2007, Tammy has her third and ﬁnal battle with cancer. Weighing only 65 lbs, she 
            makes her last appearance on the Larry King Live Show. One of her last messages is her 
            deep love for the LGBTQ community. She tells Larry King that they were the only 
            ones who stood by her when she was at her lowest, and she will love them forever for 
            it.

            -She dies the next day on July 20, 2017. Randy McCain, openly gay pastor of Open 
            Door Community Church, ofﬁciates at her funeral.
