           OVER BLACK: The Supremes’ “Where Did Our Love Go” starts to 
           play. And as we hear the first lyrics “Baby, baby, where did 
           our love go?” we come up on: 

           EXT. PARK - DAY 

           CHYRON: 1989

           THREE BABY GIRLS in the arms of their MOTHERS. We zoom in on 
           the babies as they reach out for each other. It’s so cute you 
           wanna die, but don’t die til you get to the big twist on page 
           92. It’s great. We really wrote the shit out of this script.  

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

           It’s Halloween. Our three little babies are now little girls, 
           dressed up as the THREE BLIND MICE. They’re SIX-YEARS-OLD 
           now, so they actually deserve names: 

           ROSE: rational, smart, sarcastic. JO: manic, creative, 
           impulsive. NATALIA: gregarious, has a pathological need for 
           everyone to love her.

                                 ROSE/JO/NATALIA
                        Trick-or-treat!

           A WOMAN drops candy in their buckets. The girls look at their 
           haul, and immediately swap sweets. We push in on Rose... 

           INT./EXT. ROSE’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - DAY

           Rose, now 11, looks down at the front yard where her MOM and 
           DAD are yelling at each other. We can’t hear what they’re 
           saying, but we see that her dad’s bags are PACKED. 

                                 NATALIA (O.S.)
                                (whispering)
                        Rose.

           Rose turns to see Jo and Natalia (also 11 now, because that’s 
           how time works) at her door. Jo hugs Rose as Natalia pulls 
           out a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA from her backpack. 

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        My mom says tequila fixes 
                        everything. 

           Natalia pours them each a full Dixie cup of tequila. 

                                 JO
                        And my dad said tequila always has 
                        a worm in it. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Jo pulls out a ZIPLOC BAG OF EARTHWORMS. Jo plops a worm into 
           each cup. Rose, depressed, looks apprehensive.

                                 NATALIA
                                (re: the window)
                        Forget about them, all we need is 
                        the three of us. 

                                 JO
                        We’re like “The Three Amigos.” 

           Rose smiles and Natalia hands her a cup of tequila. 

                                 NATALIA
                        The Three Amigas. 

           They clink and drink. Then IMMEDIATELY double over, VOMITING. 

           EXT. MICHIGAN VS. WISCONSIN FOOTBALL GAME - TAILGATING - DAY

           Our girls are now in college. Rose wears a COLUMBIA 
           sweatshirt. Jo wears a WISCONSIN t-shirt. Natalia wears a 
           tiny UM tank top and short-shorts.  

                                 NATALIA
                        You guys came to visit on the BEST 
                        weekend! We’ll tailgate for 12 
                        hours and then whoever’s still 
                        upright will go to the game! 

           JUST THEN: a random GUY walks by, grabs Natalia, and KISSES 
           HER. Rose and Jo freak out. Rose blows her RAPE WHISTLE.

                                 JO
                        Oh shit!

                                 NATALIA
                        Remember I was telling you about my 
                        new boyfriend Jake--

           But before she can finish, Jo SLAPS JAKE IN THE FACE.

                                 JO
                        I am so sorry, it was already in 
                        progress.

           EXT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - BUILDING - DAY

           Our girls, now wearing business casual, stare up at the Real 
           Estate Agency. They each carry a MANLY BRIEFCASE. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                                (to Natalia)
                        I can’t believe your mom got us all 
                        jobs. And briefcases.

                                 JO
                        I’m gonna fill mine up with cigars.

                                 NATALIA
                        Okay first day of work selfie!

           She holds up her phone and they all lean in close.

           ANGLE ON: three pictures. Everyone looks good in the FIRST 
           TWO PICTURES. But in the third, Jo’s eyes are half-closed, 
           Rose has hair in her mouth, and Natalia looks EXTRA HOT. 

                                 ROSE
                        I vote the first or second. 

                                 JO
                        Yeah. Please burn the third. Like, 
                        legit set your phone on fire. 

           Rose and Jo head in. Natalia hangs back. She considers, then 
           picks the THIRD, making an Instagram post with the caption: 

                                 NATALIA (V.O.)
                        “The Three Amigas getting down to 
                        #Bizness!” 

           As the photo racks up “likes,” the song turns from The 
           Supremes into Soft Cell’s cover of the same song: “Where Did 
           Our Love Go.” This version is more angsty. You’ll get why...

           INT. 2 BEDROOM 2 BATH 1720 SQ FT HOUSE - DAY

           Jo is finishing staging a house. She sprays some “Cookie 
           Scent” in the oven, then opens a box of store-bought cookies 
           and carefully arranges a plate of them in just the right 
           spot. Natalia enters, impressed. 

                                 JO
                        And thus concludes the staging of 
                        my first house. KA-BOOM. 

           She takes a bow.

                                 NATALIA
                        Oh my God, so good. 
                                (then)
                        So, just a couple teeny notes. If 
                        that’s cool...
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           The camera speeds-up as Natalia directs Jo to move everything 
           in the house -- in particular they move the plate of cookies 
           7 times. Finally Natalia leaves, literally PATTING JO ON THE 
           HEAD. Jo closes the door and shouts to the heavens.

                                 JO
                        Ahhhhh!

           EXT. 3 BEDROOM 3.5 BATH + DEN 2160 SQ FT HOUSE - DAY

           MAGGIE, late 30s, a successful businesslady who rocks a skirt-
           suit, shows Rose and Natalia the real estate agent ropes. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        The trick to selling a house like 
                        this is to make sure the frat boys 
                        next door aren’t home during your 
                        open house. 

           Rose and Natalia follow Maggie to the front door.

                                 ROSE
                                (sotto, to Natalia)
                        We should just pay for them to go 
                        on a booze cruise.

                                 NATALIA
                        Girl! That’s so smart!
                                (to Maggie)
                        What if you just paid for them to 
                        go on, like, a booze cruise?

           Rose gives her a look like WTF. Natalia doesn’t notice. 

                                 MAGGIE
                                (impressed)
                        Natalia! You know what? I think 
                        you’re ready to handle your first 
                        solo commission. 

                                 NATALIA
                        I mean, you’re the boss! 

           Natalia walks out with Maggie. Off Rose, alone in the house--

                                 ROSE
                        Seriously?! 

           INT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           EIGHT men and women sit around a coffee table covered in 
           snacks. Everyone holds a copy of GONE GIRL. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Rose sits close to her boyfriend DANTE (a cute, nerdy rocket 
           scientist who loves Legos -- think Chadwick Boseman in Clark 
           Kent glasses. We know we’re mixing Marvel and DC, but this 
           movie will be the crossover event of the summer). 

                                 JO
                        In sum, yeah, I guess I’d agree 
                        that girl really got gone. So 
                        should we vote on the next book--

           Natalia pipes up, sitting on the lap of a bro-tastic energy 
           drink rep, JAKE, the guy from the college football game 
           (think Chris Pratt like 6 weeks after he’s stopped his 
           Jurassic World diet). 

                                 NATALIA
                        Oh wait but I already picked one. 

                               JO
                                                                ROSE
                   (whispered, to self)
                                                     (whispered, to self)
           Please be short.
                                                  Please be Sartre.

                                 NATALIA
                        Infinite Jest! 

           Rose and Jo both blanche. (NOTE: through the next few scenes 
           Rose and Jo NEVER SEE each other’s reactions.)

                                 DANTE
                                (whispering to Rose)
                        Is that the one about the time 
                        traveling court jester?

                                 ROSE
                        Shh, babe.

                                 NATALIA
                        And, honestly, you guys have to 
                        read the whole book or it’s not 
                        even worth showing up. 
                                (pointed, sorta joking)
                        Rose. 

                                 ROSE
                        That happened once! And I only missed 
                        the last ten pages because that was the 
                        week I had gallbladder surgery! 

                                 NATALIA
                        So you were on bedrest and not 
                        reading? 
                                (off Rose’s dismay)
                        JK JK, babe, relax! 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           INT. JO’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jo reads Infinite Jest in bed, with her ONE-EYED DOG, TOBY. 

                                 JO
                        It. Doesn’t. Make. SENSE!

           Jo throws the book. Toby adorably fumbles out of the bed (his 
           depth perception sucks) and runs to retrieve the enormous book. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Why do you have to be such a good 
                        boy!!

           Jo sweetly picks up Toby and the book, then sighs and starts 
           to read again. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rose reads as Dante gets into bed. 

                                 ROSE
                        This book is so inane. We’re 
                        supposed to vote on which book we 
                        read. 

           Dante kisses her neck. Rose doesn’t stop reading. But she does 
           distractedly reach under the covers to GIVE HIM A HANDJOB.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        How could anybody like this? 

                                 DANTE
                                (not about the book)
                        Oh it’s terrible. 

                                 ROSE
                        I mean, why does it even exist?

                                 DANTE
                                (still not about the book)
                        Read a little faster, baby. And 
                        maybe with a little lube.

           INT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           The same book club holds Infinite Jest. Rose and Jo are speed 
           reading the last pages, as Natalia brings out a cheese plate. 

                                 ROSE
                                (closing the book)
                        Done! I’m a goddess! 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO
                                (closing the book)
                        Finished! Boom. 
                                (like, “suck my dick”)
                        Y’all can infinite my jest! 

                                 NATALIA 
                                (conspiratorial) 
                        Honestly, I read the first ten 
                        pages and was like, “Meh, I’ll just 
                        wait for the movie.” I heard Wes

           Rose takes a deep breath, hiding her frustration. But Jo, in 
           anger, CRUSHES the cracker she’s holding.

                        pleeeeeeeaseeeeee! 

           Off Jo ANGRILY GETTING ON HANDS AND KNEES to clean up crumbs.

           INT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - BREAKROOM - DAY

           Jo is eating her 5th “fun size” candy bar, Rose eats a donut. 

                                 ROSE
                        Are we doing anything for Labor Day? 

                                 JO

                        threesome?  

                                 ROSE
                                (with a smile)
                        The answer’s still no.

                        don’t take.

           Natalia walks by the door, then DOUBLES BACK when she sees 
           the two girls sitting together. 

                                 NATALIA

           Rose and Jo look at what they’re eating and die a little.

                        Day trip, but...

           He hops off the horse and into the stands. He gets on one 
           knee -- it goes up on the JUMBOTRON. The crowd cheers! 
           Natalia freaks, but has the presence of mind to give Rose her 
           phone to film what follows.  

                                 NATALIA
                        I had no idea!

                        Yeah you just happened to get a 
                        manicure today...

                        Nothing, so happy for her!!

           Jake pulls out a huge DIAMOND RING. Jake and Natalia get on 
           his horse and ride off. Natalia turns back to wave at Jo and 
           Rose. But they’re distracted by the Clown, who turns to Jo: 

                                 RODEO CLOWN
                        Wanna ride my bull? And by bull I 
                        mean penis. 

           Natalia watches as Rose throws her soda on the clown and Jo 
           gives her a high-five.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - WEDDING VENUE - DAY

           We weave through a sea of BRIDESMAIDS in horrific yellow 
           taffeta. We reach the bathroom where Natalia touches up her 
           hair, looking gorgeous in a beautiful wedding dress with a 
           long train. She is flanked by Jo and Rose, who look awful.  

                                 NATALIA
                        You guys like your dresses, right?

           holding her dress. 

           It’s not #1...

           The girls walk up to the building: Rose from the left, Jo 
           from the right, and Natalia down the middle. 

           Independently, Rose and Jo spot Natalia. They abruptly stop. 
           Each turns and hurries back towards their cars to avoid her.

                                 NATALIA
                        Amigaaaaaas! 

           Caught, Jo and Rose both freeze. Each takes a deep breath, 
           and then turns around with a big smile on her face.

                        So I’m finally coming up for air 
                        post the Espositos’ McMansion sale. 
                        It was such a hassle, the giant 
                        commission was almost not worth it. 
                        Anyway, I thought of the perfect 
                        baby present for Maggie. 

           ANGLE ON: Maggie exiting a corner office and waddle-running 
           full-speed towards the bathroom, sporting a big baby-bump.

                        For Maggie! She hasn’t been able to 
                        dye her hair for nine months. Can 
                        you imagine?

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t think she’s ever dyed her 
                        hair.

                        I know. 

                                 JO
                        I thought I was in charge of her 
                        present.

                                 NATALIA

                        I can find the texts.

                        No, I believe you gurlll. Sorry, 
                        things have just been so crazy, 
                        with work, and the honeymoon phase, 
                        you know how it is. 

                                 JO
                        I do not, because I’m extremely 
                        single. But I got her a first 
                        edition of Winnie the Pooh. She 
                        said her mom used to read it to 
                        her, so I thought it’d be special--

                                 NATALIA
                        Of course! I totes defer to you. 
                        It’s just, giving birth is traumatic 
                        and I don’t want her to think we’ve 
                        forgotten about her, ya know. Babes 
                        before babies! But you should 
                        totally give her that. If you want 
                        to do something different. But like, 
                        still Venmo me for the group gift.
                                (remembering)
                        Oh bee-tee-dubs, I have an EPIC idea 
                        for this year’s Labor Day trip. I’ll 
                        send you the deets this week!

           He hands the phone to Rose. She lets the call ring and ring.

                        Hard pass. I can’t handle her crazy 
                        Labor Day plan right now. I think 
                        it’d kill me. 

                                 DANTE
                        Maybe if you’re dreading it so much 
                        you should just skip this one. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh honey. That’s not how it works.

                                 DANTE
                        I love you. But I do not understand 
                        your friendships. 

           Rose drops the groceries and picks up three of Dante’s Lego 
           characters. She demonstrates with Legos while she talks. 

                                 ROSE
                        Okay, it’s like this: Jo, Natalia, 
                        and I have always been a crew. We 
                        have a lot of Lego-memories and a 
                        ton of mutual Lego-friends. But 
                        Natalia changed in college, and 
                        since she moved back, Lego-Natalia 
                        always peer pressures Lego-Rose. 
                        And says mean things to her but 
                        then says “JK!” And sucks up to our 
                        Lego-boss. Lego-Rose would love to 
                        stop hanging out with Lego-Natalia, 
                        but she’s built her whole Legoland 
                        with her so it’d mean re-starting 
                        from scratch. 

                                 DANTE

           INT. JO’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Jo re-packages the Winnie the Pooh to return it. Toby 
           scampers after her as she grabs tape, scissors, etc. 

                                 JO
                        Yes, Toby, I know we just got this 
                        in the mail, but we have to send it 
                        back. Yes, it was almost too 
                        thoughtful.

                        highlights! I know, Toby, it is 
                        super insulting to get a woman 
                        beauty treatments she didn’t ask 
                        for.

                        But Natalia always gets her way. 
                        Because she’s a Jedi master of 
                        manipulation!

                        great pun! 

           Toby licks Jo’s face a few times. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        God, I need a boyfriend. 

           INT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - BREAKROOM - DAY

           Jo and Rose walk with Maggie as they carry a half-eaten cake 
           and office baby shower detritus into the breakroom. Maggie 
           looks at the fridge, which is plastered with former 
           employees’ BABY ANNOUNCEMENTS. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        What if my baby is a real potato 
                        face? Or has wrinkly raisin cheeks? 
                        Or what if his head is shaped like 
                        a croissant?  

                                 ROSE
                        I think you may just be hungry.

                                 WOMEN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        I have so many egg salads.  

           ANGLE ON: JILLIAN, a weird account manager (think Lake Bell), 
           sitting in the corner. She has many tupperwares of egg salad. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        Want one?

           All the women ignore her.

                                 JO
                        Don’t worry, your baby’s gonna be 
                        hot. Like, a real pedo magnet.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Aw, thanks. I can’t believe today’s 
                        my last day before maternity leave. 
                        I’m gonna miss so much work.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Just as Rose and Jo are about to respond, Natalia sweeps in.  

                                 NATALIA
                        Six months is nothing, lady! You’ll 
                        be fine.

           Jo and Rose’s phones BLOOP. We see Natalia has texted them 
           both: “She’s screwed! (skull emoji)” 

                                 MAGGIE
                        I hope you’re right. Now if you’ll 
                        excuse me, I have to go sit on the 
                        toilet and dream of a time when I 
                        wasn’t constipated.

           As Maggie walks past, Natalia calls after her: 

                                 NATALIA
                        But you’re glowing, babe. Like, I 
                        need sunglasses to even look at you!

           Natalia grabs a yogurt and whispers to Rose and Jo:

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        That thing is just gonna leave her 
                        body de-stroyed.

           She puts a dab of honey on her yogurt.

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        God I’m such a disgusting condiment 
                        whore.
                                (then)
                        So tonight we’re all celebrating 
                        Mags at the Club Terrazio!

                                 ROSE
                        But tonight’s Dante’s math talk.

                                 NATALIA
                        Ooooh, that was tonight?

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. Remember I texted you about it 
                        last week and asked if you wanted 
                        to come?

                                 NATALIA
                        Well I don’t think we can really 
                        say no to our pregnant boss, so...

                                 JO
                        I guarantee you Maggie doesn’t want 
                        to go pregnant clubbing. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 NATALIA
                                (shrugging)
                        Mamma wanna partay. 

           Rose stares at Natalia, agog. Rose catches Jo looking at her, 
           and plasters a big fake smile on her face. CUT TO:

           EXT. DOUCHE-CENTRAL NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Jo and Rose wait in line outside the club. Jo wears leather 
           pants over a bodysuit. Rose wears an old t-shirt, jeans, and 
           ugly SKECHERS SNEAKERS. Like, really awful Skecher Sneakers. 
           Is this stage direction a pointed rebuke from one writer to 
           the other? No. Not at all! This is fiction!

                                 ROSE
                        I feel weird.

                                 JO
                        Yeah, you also look weird. Number 
                        one rule of clubbing: don’t wear 
                        Skechers.

                                 ROSE
                        There’s no reason to make my feet 
                        hurt if I’m not trying to get a guy!

                                 JO
                        It’s a miracle Dante still wants to 
                        have sex with you.

                                 ROSE
                        He has the same pair in gray. 

                                 JO
                        You two are my favorite weirdos. Is 
                        he mad you’re missing his math talk?

                                 ROSE
                        He was mad but then I called him an 
                        acute angle. Math puns always get 
                        me out of the doghouse.

                                 JO
                        I hope you appreciate that dude 
                        because they don’t make ‘em like 
                        him anymore. 

                                 ROSE
                        You’ll find your Dante. You just 
                        gotta stop dating dumb guys who you 
                        get bored with after a week. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           ANGLE ON: A HOT GUY breathes on his hand and sniffs it to 
           check his breath. Then gives Jo a thumbs up. Jo swoons, then: 

                                 JO
                                (sighing)
                        I know you’re right. 
                                (then, re: phone)
                        Damn, it’s been over an hour. Nat 
                        better show up soon.

           An Uber pulls up. A hand waves out the window.

                                 ROSE
                        Speak of the--

           The door opens and... it’s JILLIAN (the egg salad girl), 
           wearing a way-too-tight dress and insane pink metallic heels.

                                 JILLIAN
                        Let’s get turnt! 

                                 JO
                        Lord help us. 

           Jillian heads straight to the front of the line. 

                                 ROSE
                        Jillian, we already tried talking 
                        to the bouncer--

                                 JILLAIN
                        Did you seduce him?

                                 ROSE
                        Um... no?

                                 JILLIAN
                        Amateurs.

           Jillian lifts her boobs up in her dress and walks off. 

                                 JO
                        I mean, she’s not going to-- 

                                 JILLIAN
                        Come on! We’re in!

                                 JO
                        That actually worked?! 

                                 JILLIAN
                        Of course. He’s my brother. 

           Jo and Rose follow, horrified.

           INT. CLUB - LATER

           The three girls stand around with drinks, a little tipsy. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        My family lurves clurbs! My mom, my 
                        dad, my uncle who might be my dad--

                                 ROSE
                                (sotto, to Jo)
                        We have to get out of here. 

           Jo nods. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        ...my cousin who’s a burlesque 
                        dancer. My cousin who does 
                        burlesque yo-yo-ing--

                                 JO
                        Hey, Jillian? I gotta pee and I’m 
                        wearing a bodysuit and Rose’s gotta 
                        come help me unclasp and re-clasp 
                        my crotch buttons. How about you 
                        stay here and...
                                (looking around)
                        ...hold this floor spot for us? 
                        It’s a really good one and I don’t 
                        want to lose it.

                                 JILLIAN
                        Aye aye, cap’n! Happy clasp’n!  

           INT. CLUB - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose walk into the bathroom full of SCANTILY CLAD 
           WOMEN (who are also smart and kind, and who shouldn’t be 
           objectified or shamed for their fashion choices, you guys). 

                                 ROSE
                        Bodysuit. Nice excuse. 

                                 JO
                        Oh no, that’s very real. 

           Jo pulls Rose into a tiny stall and pulls down her pants. 
           Throughout the scene they squat, bend, and balance on things 
           in an effort to get her out of her bodysuit. (Note to the 
           Boys: a bodysuit is essentially a swimsuit with crotch-
           buttons -- but to the casual observer it just looks like a 
           tight-fitting shirt. They’re very hot right now.) 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        How the hell did you even get into 
                        this??

                                 JO
                        My neighbor -- ow -- helped. I 
                        collect his mail when he’s out of 
                        town, he gets me into impossible 
                        outfits. Community -- shit -- is 
                        important.

           Both girls’ phones BLOOP. Rose pulls hers out as Jo continues 
           to struggle.

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Natalia? Read it to me.

                                 ROSE
                        “Sorry, couldn’t touch my phone, 
                        Mags wanted to get mani-pedis! She 
                        was peeing herself too much to go 
                        clubbing. Eek. Poor girl is GROSS!”

           The phones bloop again. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        “She couldn’t get the foot massage 
                        tho cause it might make her go into 
                        labor lol”

           The phones bloop again.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        “Winky face emoji.”

           Bloop.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        “Barf face emjoi.”

           Bloop.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        “Going home to send you all the 
                        Labor Day stuff! Girls Trip 2019!” 

           Bloop.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        “American flag emoji. Twin girls 
                        emoji. American flag emoji”

                               JO
                                                           ROSE (CONT'D)
           What a bitch.
                                                  I can’t believe her.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           A beat as they process, then:

                               JO
                                                           ROSE (CONT'D)
           Wait, what?
                                                  What did you say?

                                 JO
                        I was just... swearing at my suit.

                                 ROSE
                        Were you? 

                                 JO
                        ...yes? 

           They stare at each other a long time. 

                                 ROSE
                        Jo. Are you also a little bit...

                                 JO
                        Completely furious with Natalia? 
                        Yes! 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh my God, seriously? Me too!

           They both look like they’re about to cry with relief and 
           euphoria. Because the discovery of mutual dislike is the best 
           feeling in the entire universe. Maybe better than love. 

           The beginning strains of “I’m Coming Out” by Diana Ross start 
           to play. 

           INT. CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose burst out of the bathroom. The club lights hit 
           them like they’re in a goddamn music video. They do a few 
           steps of tasteful choreo, hi-five Jillian, and bust out--

           EXT. CLUB - LINE - MOMENTS LATER

           The music keeps going. Jo and Rose dance out. Jo KISSES the 
           dumb guy in line. 

                                 ROSE
                        Let’s go get non-vegan cheese! 

                                 JO/ROSE
                        Non-vegan cheese!

           INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT

           Rose and Jo split a giant plate of cheese fries and drink one 
           milkshake with two straws. They laugh so hard they can’t 
           breathe. Some other patrons turn to look at them.

                                 ROSE
                        Remember that time Natalia changed 
                        our softball jerseys to crop tops 
                        without telling us--

                                 JO
                        Did you see the crop-top burn I 
                        got? It went all the way around. I 
                        couldn’t lie down for a week!

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAWN

           Rose and Jo are still in their club-clothes. They’ve been out 
           all night. They’re walking home, giddy. 

                                 JO
                        ...and last year when she spoiled 
                        The Bachelor two weeks into the new 
                        season. 

                                 ROSE
                        I pretended I was laugh-crying but 
                        I was cry-crying!

           TWO OLDER WOMEN (ROXANNE & SHANIQUA) power-walk toward them. 

                                 ROXANNE
                        Whoa. You girls are glowing. 

                                 SHANIQUA
                        Oooh are y’all in love? Or 
                        pregnant? Is this a mommy-to-be 
                        situation? 

                                 ROSE
                        No, we just found out we both hate 
                        the same friend. 

                                 ROXANNE
                        Greatest feeling in the world. 

                                 ROXANNE/SHANIQUA
                        Fucking Denise.  

                                 JO/ROSE
                        Fucking Denise!!

           They all laugh. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Rose and Jo sit on the floor, now in sweatpants. Jo’s 
           bodysuit is unclasped and dangling outside her pants. Dante 
           brings them coffee. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 DANTE
                        Wow. You were both feeling the same 
                        thing the entire time?!  

                                 JO 
                        Just the last couple years, but 
                        damn. It’s so nice to know it 
                        wasn’t all in my head. 

           Bloop! Rose and Jo’s phones both chime. Both cringe. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oop. Here it is. For Labor Day this 
                        year she wants to do... Hashtag 
                        “Girls Trip Gone Wild.” As in, 
                        recreate the Reese Witherspoon 
                        movie, “Wild.” 

                                 JO
                        Oh my God, she is actually satan! 
                        Also that hashtag is way too long. 

                                 ROSE
                        I can’t go on that trip. I can’t be 
                        that close to the edge of a cliff 
                        with her! I don’t trust myself! 

                                 DANTE
                        So don’t go. You’re in this 
                        together now. Just tell her you’re 
                        done being friends. 

                                 JO
                        Okay, sure, Dante. 

                                 ROSE
                        We’ll totally do that...

           INT. MALL - DAY

           Jo, Rose, and Natalia walk past a fountain in a mall.  

                                 JO
                        So we’re done being friends. 
                        Because we don’t want to be. 

           Natalia immediately starts sobbing. 

                                 NATALIA
                        You two talked about me behind my 
                        back and decided to friend break-up 
                        with me? After all these years?! 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Shame!

           Pregnant Maggie emerges from the fountain like a zombie. 
           She’s followed by members of their book club, softball 
           players in crop-tops with sunburned stomachs, and (budget 
           allowing) giant-humanoid Legos. 

                                 EVERYONE 
                                (pointing at them)
                        SHAME! SHAME! SHAME! 

           The crowd marches up to Jo and Rose and overtakes them. Then 
           hangs them from “The Wall” a la “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - AS THEY WERE

                                 DANTE
                        I get that that’s a “No,” but I do 
                        have issues with you mashing-up Game 
                        of Thrones and Handmaid’s Tale.  

                                 JO
                        The point is: we can’t just break-
                        up with her. 

                                 ROSE
                        But maybe now that we have each 
                        other, we can find ways to avoid 
                        her?

           INT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - FRONT ENTRANCE

           Rose and Jo, each holding a salad, try to surreptitiously 
           pass Natalia’s desk to get out to the PATIO--

                                 NATALIA
                        Amigas! 

           Jo jumps, spilling her salad everywhere. 

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        Awww were you guys avoiding me 
                        because you know my fat ass is on a 
                        diet and I have trouble watching 
                        you eat so much? You’re so sweet. 
                        But you can’t ditch me that easy. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh. Good. 

           EXT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose eat Rose’s salad. Natalia watches them.

                                 ROSE
                        So Nat, Jake’s been going to 
                        Florida a lot for work, huh? 

                                 JO
                        Yeah! You think y’all would ever 
                        move down there? 

           Natalia starts laughing hysterically. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Florida? With my hair? Never. 
                        Besides, Jake and I have always 
                        said Minneapolis is the only place 
                        to raise a family. We’re never, 
                        ever, ever leaving. For anything. 
                        Ever.

           INT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - BOOK CLUB - DAY

           All the same Book Clubbers hold WAR & PEACE. 

                                 JO
                        When it’s not war it’s peace, 
                        amirite? So should we vote on the 
                        next book--

                                 NATALIA
                        I’ve got one! Let me grab it. 

           As soon as Natalia’s gone, Rose and Jo turn to the others. 

                                 JO
                        Hey! Would anyone want to start a 
                        second, smaller book club? 

                                 ROSE
                        Where we pick books democratically? 

                                 JO
                        And keep the existence of the club 
                        secret so no one gets offended?

                                 BOOK CLUBBER #1
                        Oh. I feel like we’re all too busy 
                        for another club. 

                                 BOOK CLUBBER #2
                        Plus, I hate making choices. 
                        Democracy isn’t really my “thing.”

           Just then, Natalia re-enters, carrying “The Life-Changing 
           Magic of Tidying Up.” 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 NATALIA
                        Alright. You can all stop talking 
                        about me now: I already know how 
                        cute my outfit is today.

           Off Jo and Rose, frustrated... 

           EXT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - BABY SHOWER - NEXT DAY 

           Blue balloons decorate the porch of a beautiful suburban 
           home. Rose and Jo walk up to the house as slowly as possible. 
           Natalia opens the door.

                                 NATALIA
                                (hurrying them in)
                        Come on. I can’t be out here too 
                        long. A skunk’s been haunting the 
                        porch, and you know how my nose is.
                                (then, conspiratorial)
                        Y’all, throwing a baby shower for 
                        your boss is stress-ful.

                                 ROSE
                        We said we could help. 

                                 NATALIA
                        You don’t hear me complaining! But 
                        just know, if I ever become the 
                        boss, I’ll never make you guys do 
                        this. And I’ll never call you out 
                        for your fake sick days. Rose. 

                                 ROSE
                        I had gallbladder surgery!

                                 NATALIA
                        I know! JK! Oh Maggie’s calling me. 

           Natalia heads inside. Jo starts to follow, but realizes Rose 
           isn’t following. Rose is starting to hyperventilate. 

                                 ROSE
                        I know “gallbladder” is a dumb 
                        word, but I almost died in that 
                        surgery. And all she did was post a 
                        “get-well” selfie of herself in a 
                        bikini!

           Jo rubs her back, as Rose spins out, sniffling. 

                                 JO
                        It’s okay! You’re okay! 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                                (crying frustrated tears)
                        No I’m not! We’re trapped! We’re 
                        stuck with her until we die!

                                 JO
                        We’ll figure something out, I prom--

                                 NATALIA (O.S.)
                        Ladies! Door! Skunk! Nose!

           INT. NATALIAS'S HOUSE - BABY SHOWER - LATER

           A bunch of WOMEN sit around Maggie as she opens presents. 
           Natalia films her, getting very buddy-buddy with Maggie. 

                                 NATALIA
                        What a haul! Maggie’s gonna be 
                        queen of the mammas! 

                                 MAGGIE
                        A Diaper Genie! 

                                 JILLIAN
                        Look inside! 

                                 MAGGIE
                                (opening it, faux-excited)
                        It’s full of egg salad! Amazing. 
                        Thank you, Jillian. And thank you 
                        all for coming. It’s so great to 
                        know I have amazing friends. 
                                (starting to spiral)
                        Even though I’m never gonna get to 
                        see you ever again after the baby 
                        is born.
                                (melting down)
                        I’ll just disappear into that dark 
                        night. In a year you’ll pass me on 
                        the street and you won’t even 
                        recognize me. I’ll have vanished from 
                        your collective consciousnesses. And 
                        also I’ll be fat and in sweatpants 
                        and have jelly in my hair. 

                                 NATALIA
                        But you’re gonna rock that jelly so 
                        hard, girl! You’re a goddess!

           As Natalia keeps ass-kissing, Jo turns to Rose.

                                 JO
                        Jeez. Are we really never gonna see 
                        Maggie again? I’m gonna miss her.

                                 JO (CONT'D)
                        She’s my favorite boss. Who do you 
                        think will replace her?

                                 ROSE
                        Oh my God, Jo. That’s it! 

                                 JO
                        Yeah, I should be boss! Or should 
                        I? I mean, I have the confidence, 
                        but none of the skills. Like, hard 
                        none. But Sheryl Sandberg would 
                        tell me to lean in. Does that mean 
                        I literally just--
                                (leaning forward, then)
                        I feel it!

           But Rose’s already in the hall, gesturing for Jo to follow. 

           INT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo follows Rose into the bathroom. Rose shuts the door. 

                                 JO
                        Oh. I didn’t wear a bodysuit, I can 
                        go pee alone--

                                 ROSE
                        No, no! I know what we have to do. 
                        We don’t have to break-up with 
                        Natalia. Or lose the rest of our 
                        friends, or our jobs, or our 
                        sanity! We just have to do one, 
                        easy thing. 
                                (a beat)
                        We have to get her pregnant. 

           Rose gives Jo a look, like, “Well?” 

           EXT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - LATER

           Rose and Jo walk out, drinking from BABY BOTTLES full BOOZE. 

                                 JO
                        It’s crazy. Would it even work?

                                 ROSE
                        I mean, Maggie’s right. After 
                        people have babies, they disappear! 
                        Remember Eleanor in accounting?

                                 JO
                        No.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        Exactly! And Natalia wants kids 
                        someday. So it’s not like we’re 
                        playing God. 

                                 JO
                        We’re just lighting a fire under 
                        God’s ass.

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. We’re taking stuff off God’s 
                        plate. 

           They both take a thoughtful sip of their boozy bottles. Rose 
           looks at Jo.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        So are we really doing this?

           Jo thinks for a second, then she smiles. 

                                 JO
                        Oh yeah. Mamma wanna partay. 

           They CHEERS with their baby bottles.

                                 ROSE
                        Please don’t say that again. 

                                 JO
                                (agreeing)
                        It felt terrible. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           Rose paces, holding a notepad, while Jo sits on the couch. In 
           the background, Dante does math on a whiteboard.

                                 ROSE
                        Okay, we have exactly three months 
                        before Labor Day weekend. That 
                        means two ovulation cycles to get 
                        her pregnant and incapable of going 
                        on our “Wild” girls trip.   

                                 JO
                        Copy that. First step: come up with 
                        the first step.  

                                 ROSE
                        Right, so I think--

           Rose goes to erase Dante’s whiteboard. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 DANTE
                        Whoa what are you doing?!

                                 ROSE
                        We have top secret family planning 
                        to do. 

                                 DANTE
                        And I support you surreptitiously 
                        trying to get your best frenemy 
                        pregnant, but you know this board 
                        is for math only. 

                                 ROSE
                        You can do it on a sheet of paper! 
                        You just like using big markers! 

           She tries to grab the markers from him and twists his arm.

                                 DANTE
                        Careful! That’s my math arm!

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        How about we use this? 

           Jo pulls out an old poster board that’s covered in magazine 
           clippings and glitter. It reads: NATALIA’S VISION BOARD.

                                 DANTE
                        Why do we have Natalia’s old vision 
                        board?

                                 ROSE
                        She said she didn’t have room at 
                        her house but also said I couldn’t 
                        throw it away. 

                                 JO
                        Ughhh! Let’s manifest a baby! 

           IN QUICK CUTS: we see them rip off pictures from the Vision 
           Board: WEDDING DRESSES, MANSIONS, CRATE & BARREL FURNITURE, 
           ten different pictures of CHRISSY TEIGEN. 

           THEN IN QUICK CUTS: we see Jo and Rose replace them with 
           pictures of BABIES, MAGAZINE LETTERS, and RED STRING. Finally 
           Rose and Jo step back from their creation. Dante looks at it. 

                                 DANTE
                        If anything ever happens to 
                        Natalia, you better hope the cops 
                        don’t find this. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           REVEAL: In MAGAZINE RANSOM LETTERS the board reads “Get Rid 
           of Natalia.” Baby pictures are connected by red string.  

                                 JO
                        This is a straight up murder board. 
                        I see that now. 

                                 ROSE
                        Also, I think our plan is... 
                        underdeveloped? 

                                 JO
                        No, it’s all there! She has sex. 
                        She gets a baby. 

           ANGLE ON: a pic of MAGIC MIKE connected by string to a baby. 

                                 ROSE
                        Yeah, we need help. I think we have 
                        to go to an expert. 

                                 JO
                        Ooh I’m pretty sure my neighbor’s a 
                        gigolo, we could ask--

                                 ROSE
                        I think DeLorean’s a pimp, but no, 
                        I mean--

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Rose and Jo stand in the doorway of a waiting room FULL OF 
           PREGNANT WOMEN. 

                                 ROSE (V.O.)
                        An OBGYN.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A NURSE (think an Ava Tramer type) leads Rose and Jo into an 
           exam room. There’s an exam table with a robe on it.  

                                 NURSE
                        The doctor will be in to see you 
                        shortly. Just change into the robe. 

           The Nurse closes the door. Rose hands Jo the robe. 

                                 ROSE
                        Go ahead. 

                                 JO
                        Wait what? No, you do it!
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Jo tosses the robe to her. 

                                 ROSE
                        But I don’t even want to have kids. 

           Rose throws it back to Jo.

                                 JO
                        Yeah, but I didn’t groom for a hoo-
                        ha exam.

           Jo throws it. They keep throwing it throughout the scene.

                                 ROSE
                        You don’t need to groom your hoo-ha 
                        for an OBGYN.

                                 JO
                        Are you kidding me? 

                                 ROSE
                        Wait, you do?  

                                 JO
                        Always. At minimum I shave. 

                                 ROSE
                        But OB’s look at hundreds a day. They 
                        probably don’t even see hair anymore. 
                        It’s like how we don’t see oxygen.

                                 JO
                        I can see oxygen. 

                                 ROSE
                        I’ll let you borrow my Roomba for a 
                        month. 

           Rose throws Jo the robe. A beat. 

                                                                      CUT TO:

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           DR. MOBY, 36, disheveled, serious, picture Chris Evans 
           playing Josh Gad, enters and finds Rose in a chair and Jo 
           lying in the robe on the exam table, her legs in stirrups. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Hello, you must be--

                                 JO
                        I didn’t shave. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 DR. MOBY
                        And I’m Dr. Moby. 

                                 ROSE
                        You’re Moby... the OB? 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Correct.

           Rose and Jo share a look, then burst out laughing. 

                                 JO
                        That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard! 

                                 ROSE
                        You could’ve done literally 
                        anything else. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Well, yes. But I saw my mom’s 
                        vagina at a very young age, so, 
                        here we are.
                                (to Jo)
                        You’re the one who will be carrying 
                        your baby? 

                                 JO
                        Oh, no, we’re not a couple. And I 
                        can’t have a baby til I find the 
                        right guy and then have two years 
                        of no-strings attached sex first. 
                        To be clear, by no-strings I mean 
                        no consequences. Not “no BDSM.”

                                 ROSE
                        Jo.

                                 JO
                        I’m just saying I’m sex positive. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Then who’s getting pregnant? 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh, neither of us. We’re just 
                        looking for some tips on how to get 
                        into the idea of having a baby. 

                                 JO
                        Yeah, like, how does a person 
                        contract “baby fever”?
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 DR. MOBY
                        That’s not a real disease. 

                                 JO
                        Um, it’s got “fever” in it. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Well, I did go to medical school. 
                        So I know a lot about medicine. 

                                 JO
                        Well, I’ve watched every episode of 
                        Grey’s Anatomy, so I know a lot 
                        about medicine too. And making out 
                        in elevators. 

           A beat, they GLARE at each other. Rose clears her throat.

                        What we’re trying to ask is if there 
                        are certain trends you see in women 
                        when they start wanting to get 
                        pregnant. For example, are they 
                        hanging out with babies all the time.

                        Surrounding a woman with babies is 
                        literally the last thing you should 
                        do. Babies are generally disgusting 
                        and upsetting. Why do you think I’m 
                        an OB and not a pediatrician? Babies 
                        are so terrible that they evolved to 
                        look adorable so we wouldn’t kill 
                        them. The best way to give someone--

           INT. ROSE’S CAR - DAY

           Rose drives Jo and Natalia. Jo sits in the back.  

                                 NATALIA
                        Maggie said she wanted all of us to

                                 ROSE
                        Yep. Natalia, can you navigate?

                                 NATALIA

                        What’s the address? 

                                 JO
                        Here, let me just--

           Jo reaches up and snags Natalia’s phone. She types the 
           address, then, when Natalia isn’t looking, she goes into her 
           Instagram, searches “#Babies,” and follows every account. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Have you guys started breaking in 
                        your hiking boots yet? We should go 
                        “Wild” but not the part of “Wild” 
                        where she gets bloody feet lol.

           Jo hands back Natalia’s phone, and then texts Rose a picture:

           The girls get out of their parked car. 

                                 ROSE
                                (mediocre lying)
                        Huh. This is the address? It can’t 
                        be right.

                                 JO
                        That’s sure odd as heck, Rose. I’ll 
                        call Maggie to sort it out. But how 
                        about we wait inside with the air 
                        conditioning...

           We see they’re walking into...

           INT. BABY GAP - MOMENTS LATER

           Have you ever been in a Baby Gap? It’s the cutest place on 
           earth. It could give Casey Anthony baby fever. Natalia walks 
           in on her phone. Rose and Jo immediately follow, cooing: 

                                 ROSE/JO
                        So cute!! / Babies!

           Jo and Rose surreptitiously high-five. 

           INT. OBGYN OFFICE - NEXT DAY

           Jo lies in the robe on the table, while Rose sits in the 
           chair. Dr. Moby enters, looking at a chart. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Didn’t expect to see you two back 
                        so soon. So I’m guessing it worked 
                        and you want to get pregnant? 

                              ROSE
           Christ no. 
                                                                 JO
                                                  Didn’t you hear me last time? 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Then why are you here? 

                                 ROSE
                        Well, we liked the “seeing babies, 
                        without being with babies” thing. 

                                 JO
                        So what else you got? Give us that 
                        fever!

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Please don’t shout “fever” in an 
                        office full of pregnant women. 

                                 JO
                        You’re not the boss of me! I’ll 
                        yell FEVER if I want to!

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Stop it! Shh! Fine!  
                                (huge sigh)
                        Okay. I guess a lot of women start

           INT. JO’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Rose brainstorms with a pad and paper, while Jo tries 
           unsuccessfully to get a video of Toby riding Rose’s Roomba. 

                                 ROSE
                        Who do we know who has a baby? 

                                 JO
                        I mean, Maggie.

                                 ROSE
                        That baby is literally 3 hours old. 

           Jo holds up her phone to show a text from Maggie: a photo of 
           her holding the baby, plus, “He’s out, fuckers! I’m in love!”

                                 JO
                        But look at that cute lil potato 
                        face.  

                                 ROSE
                        Mags couldn’t stop talking about 
                        how constipated she was the whole 
                        pregnancy. That will not appeal to 
                        Natalia.

                                 JO
                        Did Mandy Evanston ever have kids?

                                 ROSE
                        That girl who dealt Adderall? I 
                        don’t think she was pregnant, I 
                        think she was just heavy. 

                                 JO
                        Oh right. But she’s so skinny now. 
                        Maybe she got lap band surgery like 
                        Al Roker.

           Toby walks away from the Roomba. Rose tries to get Toby to 
           come over to her but he ignores her.

                                 ROSE
                        Why does he hate me so much?
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO
                        I told you, just rub your fingers in 
                        ham juice and he’ll fall in love.

                                 ROSE
                        Yeah, I’m not doing that.

           Jo puts her fingers in a tub of deli ham and places them on 
           top of the Roomba to lure him back.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Jo walks Toby through the park as they continue 
           brainstorming. Rose is scrolling Instagram on her phone. 

                                 ROSE
                        Ooh what about Karen?

                                 JO
                        Karen Flammagan from Girl Scouts??

           Rose shows Jo an Insta post of Karen’s family. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Oooh twins!

                                (scrolling)
                        Wait. She didn’t lose all the baby 
                        weight. 

                                 JO
                        She looks pretty good, though.

                                 ROSE
                        But not Nat good. Remember how mad 
                        she got when she thought her elbow 
                        looked fat in her engagement pic?

           Rose and Jo walk by a Mommy & Me playgroup singing the ABCs 
           on a nearby playground. 

                                 MOMS
                        Q R S T U V... 

           Rose starts to pass them, but Jo stops. Then pulls Rose over 
           to the group. 

                                 ROSE
                        What are you doing?

                        you sing with me?

           Jo starts clapping as she joins the circle. Rose begrudgingly 
           joins in too. 

                                 MOMS/JO/ROSE
                        Yayyy!

                        you human-mothers, but we are 
                        ladies. And we were just wondering

           All the moms lean in, interested. Rose and Jo scan the group. 
           These women are all beautiful -- as every woman is. But TWO 
           are just clearly way hotter. 

           Rose and Jo “casually” and “randomly” point at the hot ones.

           EXT. JO’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Rose and Jo, dressed in their “Mom Dinner” Finest (think 
           khakis, button-downs, and pearls), are ready to head out to 
           dinner. Jo gives instructions to a WAG dog-walker, TIFFANY.

                                 JO
                        He really doesn’t like puddles, so 
                        if you see one just pick him up like 
                        a football and run the other way. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Got it.

           Tiffany sits down with Toby and starts to play with him. Jo 
           heads to the kitchen.

                                 JO
                        I just need a quick bite.

           She pops a few Eggos in the microwave.

                                 ROSE
                        We’re literally about to go to 
                        dinner.

                                 JO
                        But Natalia’s always at least 45 
                        minutes late. I just need something 
                        to hold me over. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh shit, you’re right. Can I have 
                        one?

           Jo hands Rose an Eggo. 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Yo can I get one of those? Instead 
                        of a tip?

                                 JO
                        Uh, sure.

           She walks an Eggo over to Tiffany just as her phone rings.

                        I did not realize he was autistic, 
                        no. Hello? Kiki?

           Jo hangs up.

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Well. I think Kiki’s a maybe.

                                 ROSE
                        Crap. How are we gonna find a hot 
                        mom we can pay to come to dinner 
                        with us in 20 minutes? Well, plus, 
                        the 45 minutes Natalia will be 
                        late. So whatever that math is.

                        I’ll do that mom shit for 40 dollars 
                        and another Eggo.

                                 ROSE
                        Really? Are you a mom?

                                 TIFFANY
                        Helllll no. Babies are the devil.

                                 ROSE
                        Right??

                                 TIFFANY
                        But I’m an act-or. You know that 
                        girl eating the breadsticks in that 
                        Olive Garden commercial?

                                 JO/ROSE
                                (excited)
                        Was that you??

                                 TIFFANY
                        I played the customer right behind 
                        her. You can see my hands getting 
                        croutons at the salad bar. 

           Jo shrugs.

           INT. TAPAS TOWER - NIGHT

           Jo, Rose, Tiffany, and HOLLAND (a super hot skinny mom we saw 
           at the park) sit at a table, waiting for Natalia to arrive.

                                 JO
                        How’d you get your body back so 
                        fast, Holland? You’re smokin’.

                                 HOLLAND
                        It was a ton of work. I did Pilates 
                        6 times a week. And ran a marathon 
                        last month.

                                 ROSE
                        Amazing. You are truly an 
                        inspiration. But pleeease don’t 
                        mention any of that when our friend 
                        shows. 

                                 JO
                        Just say your body snapped back, 
                        okay? 

                                 ROSE
                        And remember our motto:

                        Being a mom is the bomb!

           Natalia approaches.

                                 JO
                        It’s showtime, ladies. 

                                 ROSE/JO
                        Heyyyyy girl!! 

                                 JO
                        You’ll never guess. We ran into my 
                        second cousin. And her... friend, 
                        who is also legitimately a mom! I 
                        invited them to join us, hope 
                        that’s okay. They were just telling 
                        us about dat mommy life.

                        Holland was just explaining how she 
                        lost her baby weight. 

                                 HOLLAND
                        My body just snapped back. Like a 
                        rubber band.

           Natalia nods. Rose gives Holland a surreptitious thumbs-up.

                        I’ve been meaning to ask, how’s 
                        your vagina? 

                                 TIFFANY
                        Yeah, my vagina healed so fast. It 
                        was like I was 12 again. Before I 
                        even started using tampons.

           Natalia looks grossed out. Jo motions for Tiffany to stop.

                        What were you saying about how much 
                        thicker your hair is now, Holland?

                                 HOLLAND
                        That my hair is so much thicker now?

                                 NATALIA
                        Can I touch it?

           Natalia seems into this. Rose and Jo give each other a look. 
           Shrug. Motion for Tiffany to continue.

           Natalia starts to look confused. Rose and Jo try to motion 
           for her to stop. But Tiffany just keeps going... 

           TIME CUT:

           Jo eyes Holland. Holland gives her a look like “Do I have 
           to?” Jo glares at her.

                        ...Honestly, my elbows have never 
                        looked skinnier.

           Natalia leans in, by far the most excited she’s been this 
           whole time.

           INT. OBGYN OFFICE - EXAM ROOM

           Dr. Moby comes in and sees it’s Rose and Jo.

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Well, I thought my day couldn’t get 
                        worse after my parents announced 
                        their divorce. But here you are. Do 
                        you have any real medical questions 
                        this time? 

                                 JO
                        You just wanna see my vijay. Well, 
                        it’s in tip top shape now, so--

           Jo puts her legs in stirrups.

           Rose and Jo stare up at a very quaint suburban cottage. 
           Neither wants to walk up to it.

                                 ROSE
                        I don’t want to bring Natalia’s mom 
                        into this. 

           Through the window they see NATALIA’S MOM washing an OLD 
           MAN’S feet. You know, like Jesus.

                                 JO
                        Honestly, I brought it up because I 
                        do feel a little weird about it.

           Rose and Jo walk up to a very fancy COUNTRY CLUB in tennis 
           skirts, popping their Lacoste collared shirts. 

           A VERY CREEPY OLD MAN passing by on a golf cart checks them 
           out. He gets distracted and drives into a bush. 

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A table-clothed establishment with very PREPPY PATRONS. Jo 
           and Rose talk to a HOSTESS.

                        You look good, Doctor. Like Freddie 
                        Highmore in The Good Doctor. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        I don’t know the show. 

                                 JO
                        Honestly, me neither. I just saw an 
                        ad on a bus once. I wanna says it’s 
                        like House but more problematic? 

           Dr. Moby points out a WELL-DRESSED OLDER COUPLE. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        The Chesneys are over there. 
                        They’re expecting you, right?  

                                 JO
                                (winking)
                        Yes.

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Why are you winking at me?

                                 JO
                                (winking again)
                        Don’t worry about it.

           They head off, leaving behind an exasperated Dr. Moby. 

           Jo and Rose walk past MEREDITH and PATRICK CHESNEY, then 
           double-back and pretend to recognize them.  

                                 ROSE
                        Oh my goodness, Mr. and Mrs. Chesney? 

                                 JO
                        Jo and Rose. We’re friends of your 
                        son’s wife. Remember? We made the 
                        speech at the wedding about how 
                        love is like an oyster and some 
                        hold pearls but most are just gross 
                        and very slimy but also you can eat 
                        them and they are an aphrodisiac?

           Meredith clearly remembers the speech. And not fondly.

                        Of course. What a surprise.
                                (eyeing their outfits)
                        Do you belong to the club?

                                 JO
                        Just joined. There was a great Groupon. 

                                 ROSE
                        Do you mind if we just...

           Rose and Jo pull up chairs to their table. 

                                 JO
                        We’re just so exhausted. It’s been 
                        a real doozy of a week at the ol’ 
                        real estate firm we work at with 
                        your daughter-in-law. It makes me 
                        think about my priorities.

                                 ROSE
                        Speaking of, you know what I’ve 
                        been thinking a lot about recently, 
                        Meredith? 

                                 MEREDITH CHESNEY
                        I can’t imagine.

                                 ROSE
                        Babies. It’s so hard to be a 
                        working woman and have kids today. 

                                 MEREDITH CHESNEY
                        Well some people shouldn’t have 
                        children...

                                 ROSE
                                (pushing ahead)
                        Childcare is so expensive. I wish 
                        my parents--

                         ROSE (CONT’D)
                                                                 JO
           Lived nearby.
                                                     (crossing herself)
                                                  May they rest in peace. 

           Rose throws Jo a look like “WTF”? 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        I mean, may they continue to “rest 
                        in peace.” In Arizona. Where they 
                        retired. Wish they had retired 
                        nearby.

                                 ROSE
                        Yep. I’ve been thinking a lot about 
                        how if I just knew grandparents 
                        were gonna be involved, it’d make 
                        all the difference. 

                                 JO
                        Maybe if they started buying me 
                        some expensive baby items. Like a 
                        crib or... 
                                (stumped)
                        ...a second crib, it’d really help 
                        me get to a place where I felt 
                        ready to do the fricking thing. 

                                 MEREDITH CHESNEY
                        Language, please. You are in a place 
                        where Vice Presidents have dined.

           Still, Meredith can’t help but exchange a look with her 
           husband, intrigued. Rose and Jo go in for the kill.

                                 ROSE
                        You know, without my parents 
                        getting involved, I might put off 
                        having kids for years. 

                                 JO
                        I might just freeze my eggs. Pull a 
                        Janet Jackson and not have babies 
                        until I’m 50.

                                 ROSE

           Will probably be gone. 
                                                  May they rest in peace. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                                (off Rose’s look)
                        Will be gone. To Arizona too. 
                        Resting peacefully there.

                                 ROSE
                        But look at you guys! You’re so 
                        cool and young. You’ll probably 
                        still be able to pick up your 
                        grandkids if Natalia doesn’t have 
                        them for another 30 years. 

           Meredith gives her husband a concerned look.

           Natalia scrolls through hiking backpacks on her laptop as 
           Rose and Jo watch.

                                 JO
                        That one looks cool. Like Ninja 
                        Turtles meets Winter’s Bone.

                                 NATALIA
                        That backpack would literally kill 
                        you. You should really only hike 
                        with an internal frame backpack. 
                        And you have to get a waterproof 
                        one. Otherwise it’ll get mildewy 
                        and you know my nose. 

           Rose texts Jo: “No way am I buying that.” 

           Jo texts Rose: “Worst case scenario: u could def fit her body 
           in there (skull emoji)” 

           Natalia’s phone bloops. Rose and Jo jump. They didn’t text 
           her accidentally, right? They both quickly hide their phones.

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        Weird. It’s an email from Jake’s 
                        mom.

                                 ROSE
                        Oh? 

           Her phone bloops again. Natalia reads it. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Yeah. She said I should start 
                        looking out for a bunch of baby toy 
                        deliveries at the house.

                                (under her breath)
                        I said “cribs,” not toys. Cheap-ass. 

                                 NATALIA
                        And she said she and her husband 
                        are always “here to help” with 
                        anything if I ever need it. Weird. 
                        Wonder what that’s all about.

                        This is my last idea. Then I really 
                        need you to stop coming back for 
                        non-medical reasons. You are an 
                        abject waste of my time and

                                 JO
                        Don’t you dare use the word 
                        “abject” as though we all know what 
                        it means.

           Dante turns to see Rose standing in the doorway with yellow

                        Wait. If you’re fully committing to 
                        acting like a sexy Lego, you must 
                        need something from me. And it must 
                        be something I really wouldn’t want

           Dante, wearing a backwards baseball cap and a basketball 
           jersey and feeling very insecure about it, walks up to 
           Natalia’s husband Jake at the bar. Which is playing soccer. 

           Jake is a thousand times more manly than Dante, and Dante is 
           very conscious of that. 

                                 JAKE
                                (sports announcer-y)
                        Daaaante in the house!

                                 DANTE
                        Sup, bro? Glad you could watch this 
                        bout with me!

           He tries to do a complicated handshake with Jake. He fails 
           and ends up hugging him instead.

                        So, tell me. How’s the energy drink 
                        biz hang-a-langing? 

                                 JAKE
                        Dude, it’s been nuts. I have to fly 
                        to Florida every weekend because 
                        CrayCray is co-sponsoring the X 
                        Games in Tampa this year. 

           He unzips his hoodie to reveal a “Tampa X Games” shirt. The 
           designer (obvi a man) used the same font as TAMPAX TAMPONS.

                                 DANTE
                        Yeah, but it kinda looks-- 
                                (going macho)
                        Badass! So, bro, with all that 
                        traveling, what’s the state of your 
                        relation-ship? Is that ship on rocky 
                        seas? Or is it very stable and ready 
                        to take on huge life changes? 
                                (hastily adding)
                        Bro. 

                                 JAKE
                        You know, dude. I think it’s stable. 
                        But how do you ever know, man? 

                                 DANTE
                                (sensitive)
                        Well, you just have to make sure 
                        they feel supported and heard. 
                                (then, manly)
                        But also, you know, just take ‘em. 

                                 JAKE
                        Where? 

                                 DANTE
                        Sorry, what? 

                                 JAKE
                        Take ‘em where? 

                                 DANTE
                        Oh, um, I meant-- 
                                (backpedaling)
                        I dunno. The spa? A store?

                                 JAKE
                        Oh, cool. Nat likes stores. 

                                 DANTE
                        I just feel like if I were in 
                        Florida for the Tampax Games all 
                        the time, I’d want to make sure m’ 
                        girl knew I was there for her one-
                        hundo and stable, bro.

           Off Jake, considering...

           INT. ROSE & DANTE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Dante walks in, visibly shaken. Rose and Jo perk up.

                                 ROSE
                        So???

                                 DANTE
                        I think I told him to rape her. 

                                 ROSE
                        Hoo boy. 

                                 DANTE
                        But he said he’s gonna make sure 
                        his relationship is stable.

           Rose rubs his back as Jo pulls out the Vision Board. 

                                 JO
                        So that means... we did it, right? 
                        All of Moby the OB’s suggestions. 

           Rose and Dante look at the board. 

                                 ROSE
                        Now we just have to see if she’s 
                        pregnant.

                                 JO
                        Let’s figure it out ASAP. We 
                        should’ve bought tickets for “Girls 
                        Gone Wild” like, yesterday. 

                                 DANTE
                                (to Jo)
                        What if you just ask her if she’s 
                        pregnant? 

                                 JO
                                (to Dante)
                        What if you just ask Jake? 

                                 ROSE 
                                (to them both)
                        What if we just Gone Girl her? 

                                 JO
                        We keep saying we’re not trying to 
                        kill her, but then everyone keeps 
                        circling back to murder. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        No, no, the toilet trick. From Gone 
                        Girl. When she steals her 
                        neighbor’s pee to fake her 
                        pregnancy. All we have to do is 
                        drain a toilet, collect Nat’s pee, 
                        and then use a pregnancy test! 

                                 JO
                                (pinching Rose’s cheeks)
                        You’re a visionary, you know that?  

           INT. ROSE & DANTE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rose comes out of the bathroom wiping her hands on her shift 
           dress. Dante is pulling GARMENT BAGS out of the closet. 

                                 ROSE
                        Okay toilet’s drained. Just tell 
                        everyone at the party to use the 
                        front hall bathroom. Natalia will 
                        only use ours because she refuses 
                        to use “public” toilets. 

           Dante nods, unzipping one of the bags. We don’t see inside. 

                                 DANTE
                        Man, I feel weird about this 
                        viewing party...  

                                 ROSE
                        I know. It feels pretty 
                        insensitive. But it’s the only show 
                        everyone watches that’s in season. 
                        We’ll just make sure everyone knows 
                        I’m the host, and I’m a woman, and 
                        women are allowed to be as sexist 
                        as they want because that’s what 
                        feminism is.
                                (convincing herself)
                        So it’s fine, right...? 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           They open the door to find Natalia and Jake. REVEAL: Rose and 
           Dante are both DRESSED like handmaids from The Handmaid’s 
           Tale. Natalia and Jake are dressed like THE COMMANDER and 
           SERENA JOY from the show. 

                                 ROSE 
                        Hiiii! You guys look amazing. 

           Rose hands Natalia a cup of juice. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Here, Nat, try the “Blessed be the 
                        Fruit” Juice. Drink up. 

           TIME CUT: The party is more full now. We see a couple women 
           from the baby shower. Jo (dressed as Aunt Lydia) is chatting 
           with Natalia, while petting Toby (the one-eyed dog wears a 
           cone and a red robe, just like the one-eyed handmaid Janine). 

                                 JO
                        This show is so chilling. 
                        Especially because the only ladies 
                        who survive are the ones who 
                        already had babies, you know? 

                                 NATALIA
                        Speaking of babies, are we 
                        carpooling to Maggie’s Sip & See? 
                        New baby, baby!!

                                 JO
                        Mmm-hmm. More juice, Nat? 

           There’s a knock on the door. Rose crosses to get it.

                                 ROSE
                        That’ll be the food. 

           She opens the door: it’s Tiffany! She carries takeout bags. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Oh hey! Tiffany! I didn’t know you 
                        worked for Postmates too. 

                                 TIFFANY
                                (opening takeout bag)
                        This shit smells amazing. You 
                        having a party?

           Tiffany reaches into one of the bags she’s delivering and 
           starts eating a taco. She eyes the screen in the back. 

                                 TIFFANY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, this show’s supposed to be 
                        fuckin’ chilling.

           Rose shrugs as Tiffany enters and makes herself at home, 
           passing Dante, who is talking to Jake in the corner. 

                                 DANTE
                        Hey I just want to clarify 
                        something I said the other day... 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           A KNOCK on the door. Rose opens it to find Dr. Moby, dressed 
           up in a NICE (but normal) SUIT AND TIE. 

                                 ROSE
                        Dr. Moby! 

                                 JAKE
                        Dude, Dr. M! 

                                 ROSE
                        You know each other? 

           Jo texts Rose: “Why’d u invite the tight-ass with the tight-
           ass?”

                                 JAKE
                        Um. Yeah. We met at the club. Been 
                        squash buddies for years! 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        How are you doing, Natalia? 

           Rose: “I thought he could help with the test.”

           Jo: “I guess he would be a good (doctor emoji) for the (devil 
           emoji).” 

                                 JO
                                (to Moby)
                        Real interesting outfit.  

                                 DR. MOBY
                        Rose said to dress up. 

                                 JO
                        Yeah. Like Handmaid’s Tale.

                                 DR. MOBY
                        That’d be deeply insensitive.

                                 JO
                        And you thought it’d be less 
                        insensitive to just ignore a 
                        woman’s request?? Typical you. 

           JUST THEN: The door flies open and Jillian, dressed in her 
           same clubbing outfit, runs in. She beelines for the bathroom. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        I need a bathroom! Too much egg 
                        salad! TOO MUCH EGG SALAD. 

           She shakes the handle on the front hall bathroom door. It’s 
           occupied. Jillian runs toward the BEDROOM. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        No no no!

           Rose and Jo both run after her, trying to block the door to 
           the bedroom. Natalia gives them a look like, “WTF?”

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        You can’t go in there. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        I shit you not, I will shit on your 
                        floor. 

           A beat. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose and Jo wait outside the bathroom. Jillian comes out and 
           exhales dramatically. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        Well that was a doozy of a doody. 

           Jillian wipes her hands on her dress and heads back to the 
           party.

                                 JO
                        She just took a giant crap in a 
                        toilet that doesn’t have water in it. 

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. Yes she did. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose gag as they enter. 

                                 ROSE
                        Natalia will not go in here. 

                                 JO
                        No. No, she won’t. Well...

           Jo pulls out Toby’s DOGGY POO BAGS. 

                                 ROSE
                        No. 

                                 JO
                        How badly do we want this?

           A beat. Rose takes a Doggy Poo Bag. Jo and Rose each put a 
           bag on their hand. As they drop out of frame... 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Pretend it’s a dog’s. Pretend it’s 
                        a dog’s. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - LATER

           Jo (with Toby on a leash) grimaces as she throws the poopy 
           trash bag down a trash shoot, then presses the elevator 
           button. Dr. Moby exits the party. They exchange a glare. 

                                 JO
                        I have to take him out. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        I have an early egg extraction. 

           They awkwardly stand, waiting for the elevator. 

                                 DR. MOBY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, who could I have acceptably 
                        dressed as?! 

                                 JO
                        You could’ve at least tried. Nick 
                        just wears all black.

           BING! The elevator arrives. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Dr. Moby get on the elevator. 

                                 DR. MOBY
                        You’re crazy, you know that?  

                                 JO
                        Okay, “Moby the OB.” 

           They glare at each other. The elevator doors close. A beat. 

           THEN: they start HARDCORE MAKING OUT. In an elevator. Grey’s 
           Anatomy-style. Toby watches with his tongue out, like a perv.

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Rose and Dante wave goodbye to friends as they leave. 

                                 TIFFANY/JILLIAN
                        That show is so CHILLING. 

           They give each other a look, like they’re soulmates.

                                 JILLIAN
                        How do you feel about clubs?

                                 TIFFANY
                        I recently banged the DJ at Liftoff 
                        while the bartender watched...

                                 JILLIAN
                        No way. Those are my cousins!!!

           They walk out together, followed by Natalia and Jake.

                                 ROSE
                        Wait, Nat, don’t you wanna pee 
                        before you leave? You don’t wanna 
                        have another Target Toy Aisle 
                        incident. 

                                 NATALIA
                        OMG shut up, I was seven. But 
                        you’re right.

           Rose sighs with relief. Then grimaces as Natalia grabs her.

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        Come with me, babe! 

           Natalia pulls Rose into... 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose stands while Natalia pees. This could be a nice re-
           bonding moment for Natalia and Rose. But sadly, it won’t be. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Do you think Jo’s been acting 
                        weirder lately? I’m like, legit 
                        concerned. This is the age where 
                        people go schizo, ya know. If she 
                        keeps being such a hot mess, she’s 
                        never gonna find a guy to take care 
                        of her and we’re gonna have to. Her 
                        life is so depressing.

                        Your flush is broken. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh, yeah. Don’t worry about it. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Oh, no, hon, are you having trouble 
                        making ends meet? I noticed all the 
                        snacks were from Costco. And you 
                        haven’t made a big sale in a while.

                        I’m inferring, since Maggie said if 
                        she doesn’t come back, I’ll be head 
                        of sales...

           Natalia washes her hands as Rose tries not to snap. 

                                 ROSE
                                (really struggling)
                        ...How... great... for... you...

                        Babe, this Labor Day Trip isn’t too 
                        expensive for you, is it? Just let 
                        me know, kay kay? 

           Rose SEETHES, at wits end. 

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose and Dante ad lib goodbyes with smiles. The second the 
           door closes, Rose runs to...

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS

           Rose tears open a PREGNANCY TEST and plunges it in the pee. 

                                 ROSE
                                (angry, to Dante)
                        Set an alarm!

           TIME CUT: Dante and Rose sit on the floor, waiting for the 
           results. It’s like they’re in a cute PREGNANCY AD. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                                (emotional)
                        This baby could change our lives 
                        forever. 

                                 DANTE
                                (taking her hand)
                        It’d be such a blessing.

           They hear a door open, and Jo (her hair disheveled) enters. 

                                 JO
                        What’d I miss? 

                                 ROSE
                        We’re waiting for the results. 
                        Where have you been? 

           Jo hesitates, and is saved by the... BEEP! The test is done. 
           They all hold their breath as Rose slowly turns it over.

                        Okay, well, we have one more 
                        ovulation cycle to go before Labor 
                        Day! We’ll just introduce her to 
                        more hot moms, tell Jake’s parents 
                        to step it up--

                                 ROSE
                        Fuck that. I’m sorry, but enough 
                        with this weak “baby fever” 
                        bullshit. It’s not about the trip. 
                        It never has been. Natalia controls 
                        us. She’s cruel and condescending 
                        and makes us hate our lives and I 
                        can’t take it anymore. I’m done 
                        seeing her face. It’s time to give 
                        that bitch a baby -- by any means 
                        necessary.

           Rose stands in front of Jo with the Vision Board. She rips 
           off all the prescriptions. 

                                 ROSE
                        No more of this crap.

                                 JO
                        Okay, well she’s on the pill. We 
                        can convince her to go off it. Tell 
                        her Marie Kondo recommends the 
                        rhythm method. Or that one with the

                                 ROSE
                        That’ll take too long. We’ll have 
                        to just make her pills ineffective 
                        somehow. Maybe Dr. Moby knows a 
                        way? Let’s make an appointment--

           Jo and Moby make-out furiously on his couch.

                                 JO
                                (out of breath)
                        Goddamn you’re so annoying and hot.

                        Back at ya. 

                                 JO
                        Hey. Um, quick quesh: Is there 
                        anything that makes birth control 
                        stop working? 

                                 MOBY
                        We’re gonna use a condom. 

           Jo pulls away. Weirdly excited by this. 

                                 JO
                        Seriously?! 

                                 MOBY
                        Yeah. Are you okay with that? 

                                 JO
                        Obviously! You’re like the one guy 
                        today who’s not trying to get away 
                        with raw-dogging. Which is both a 
                        gross act and a gross phrase. 

                                 MOBY/JO
                        I mean, STDs!

           A beat. They make out EVEN MORE furiously...

                                (out of breath)
                        But hypothetically, ya know how 
                        drinking makes antidepressants less 
                        effective. Is there anything that 
                        makes birth control not work? Like 
                        tangerines? Or crack?

                        I mean, some antibiotics. Is this 
                        your version of dirty talk?

                        Oh, yeah, he said antibiotics may 
                        make it less effective. But it’s

           Rose is doing research on “The Pill” on her laptop in bed. 
           Dante tries to kiss her neck. 

                                 DANTE
                        You’re so tense. Are you excited 
                        for our spa trip next weekend? Get 
                        a little couples massage action--

                                 ROSE
                        Very excited. But if we have sex 
                        right now, I’m just gonna fake it. 

                                 DANTE
                        I appreciate your honesty. But damn.

                                 ROSE
                        How do we get her to think she’s 
                        having safe sex when she isn’t? 
                        What’s the female equivalent of 
                        poking holes in a condom...  

           Rose has an idea. She picks up her phone.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Jo. I want to buy drugs.

           Through the phone, we hear Jo SCREAMING with excitement.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

           Jo and Rose walk up to a ramshackle suburban home. It used to 
           be nice. It isn’t anymore. 

                                 JO
                        Okay, so turns out my drug dealer 
                        decided to go sober after seeing 
                        Won’t You Be My Neighbor. But I 
                        realized we know another dealer!

           Rose recognizes the house.

                                 ROSE
                        Mandy!

           They knock. MANDY, 29, bedraggled, skinny, opens the door. 

                                 JO
                        Um, Mandy Evanston? 

                                 MANDY
                        Who’s asking?  
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO
                        Jo and Rose. We used to go to 
                        school together. 

                                 MANDY
                        So? I don’t care how you know each 
                        other.

                                 ROSE
                        No, she means we went to school 
                        with you.

                                 MANDY
                        Oh. 
                                (beat, then)
                        So?

                                 JO
                        Well, we were wondering if you 
                        still sell Adderall? 

                                 MANDY
                        Are you kidding?! That was middle 
                        school. 

                                 ROSE
                        Oh. 

                                 MANDY
                        I sell meth now. 

                                 JO
                        Oh! 

                                 MANDY
                        How do you think I got this body? 

           Mandy smiles, revealing she has no teeth. 

                                 ROSE
                        Very... impressive.

                                 JO
                        Well we’re in the market for 
                        something other than meth. Do you 
                        sell... anything else? 

                                 MANDY
                        They don’t call me Methy Mandy 
                        because I sell anything else. 

                                 JO
                        Oh.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 MANDY
                        But I can give you the name of my 
                        kingpin.

                                 ROSE
                        Oh! What’s his name? 

                                 MANDY
                        I’m not just gonna give it to you! 

                                 JO
                        This is a real rollercoaster.

                                 MANDY
                        He’s a king pin. I gotta make sure 
                        I’m not sending him no narcs. 

                                 ROSE
                        Methy Mandy, we give you our word 
                        as alumni of Woodrow Wilson 
                        Elementary. 

                                 MANDY
                        Naw. Prove it. If you’re not a 
                        narc, then do a hit. 

           Mandy holds out a pipe. Jo looks at Rose.

                                 JO
                        We have Maggie’s Sip & See this 
                        afternoon--

                                 ROSE
                        By any means necessary. 

           INT. SPACESHIP - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose are super high, holding hands in a SPACESHIP. The 
           ship pulls up to a giant SMILING BOWLING PIN WEARING A CROWN.

                                 JO
                        Look, it’s the King Pin. 

           INT. MANDY’S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           REVEAL: The “king pin” is actually a PAPER TOWEL HOLDER.

           We pull back to see Jo and Rose are now inside Methy Mandy’s 
           house. A LARGE TV plays an NBA game. 

           Rose curtsies low to the paper towel holder. 

                                 ROSE
                        Your majesty, it is an honor.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO
                        Do you know Meghan Markle?

                                 METHY MANDY
                        You’re drooling.

           Mandy rips a piece of paper towel from the roll. 

           From Rose and Jo’s POV, the King Pin’s face rips off in a 
           geyser of blood. Rose and Jo cry out in horror as Methy Mandy 
           dabs their faces with the king’s skin/paper towel. They flail 
           around, BREAKING the paper towel holder.

                                                                 JO
                              ROSE
           Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
           ooooooooooo!
                                                  You killed the King! Long 
                                                  live the King!

           Methy Mandy sprays them in the face with some Lysol.

                                 METHY MANDY
                        Chill out. Those paper towels 
                        aren’t the king pin! I’m the king 
                        pin. I was all along. I just needed 
                        to know you weren’t narcs before we 
                        could do business.

           The Lysol has sobered them up a little. A very little bit.

                                 ROSE
                        Wow, that’s a big deal for a woman. 
                        Congrats. Hashtag ladyboss. 
                                (disgusted)
                        Noooo! Meth makes me say hashtag!!

                                 JO
                        Shouldn’t it be Queen Pin?

                                 METHY MANDY
                        Tried it, people thought it was a 
                        sewing thing.

                                 JO
                                (jittery)
                        Well, Ms. King, we were hoping you 
                        could hook us up with a lil 
                        somethin’ somethin’. 

                                 ROSE
                        It’s actually not even a drug, 
                        really. It’s like the opposite of a 
                        drug.

                                 METHY MANDY
                        Just tell me what you need. I don’t 
                        judge. 

                                 JO
                        Fo sho fo sho fo sho. We’re trying 
                        to buy a pack of birth control 
                        pills that’s just full of placebos.

                                 METHY MANDY

                        sell you meth, but fake BC? That 
                        shit’s nuts.

                                 JO
                        It’s not for us!

                                 METHY MANDY
                        You’re gonna entrap a man for 18 
                        years?! That’s some sinister ass 
                        shit! 

                                 ROSE
                        It’s not about entrapping a dude. 
                        It’s about entrapping a woman. 
                        Hashtag feminism.

                                 JO
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’re trying to 
                        get our ex-best friend knocked up.  

                                 METHY MANDY
                                (covering ears)
                        I won’t be implicated in this.

           Mandy, hands still over her ears, starts pushing them towards 
           the door with her hips:

                                 METHY MANDY (CONT’D)
                        Lalalalalalala.

                                (scratching a ton)
                        If a drug dealer won’t give it to 
                        us, who will?

           As they turn to leave, they spot Mandy’s TV screen. It shows 
           an ARENA BOX FULL OF WOMEN at a basketball game. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 NBA ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And there are all of the beautiful 
                        wives of our Timberwolves. 

           The camera pans to show HOT MODEL after HOT MODEL. Then at 
           the end of the box is a REGULAR LOOKING MOM who has FIVE KIDS 
           running around her. 

           From Rose’s methy POV, a halo shines on the NBA MOM. She 
           speaks directly to them through the TV.

                                 NBA MOM
                                (like the ghost of 
                                 Christmas past)

                        baller man? Fake birth controlllll!

           INT. TARGET CENTER ARENA - CONCOURSE - NIGHT

           Rose and Jo, decked out in Timberwolves gear, walk past the 
           exclusive Box Seats in the arena. 

                                 JO
                        So I hate meth. But also love it. 

                                 ROSE
                        I feel like space ate part of my 
                        soul.

           Jo and Rose’s phones BLOOP. 

                                 JO
                        Crap. Natalia sent us pics of 
                        Maggie’s new baby from the Sip & 
                        See. Double crap. The baby’s 
                        adorable. We should be there.

           Jo shows Rose a photo of Maggie and her baby. The baby wears 
           little overalls. It’s disgustingly cute.

           Rose scrolls to the next photo. It’s Natalia holding the 
           baby, who’s now crying and wearing a beanie hat that says “I 
           (picture of a HEART) my (picture of an ANT) Natalia!”

                                 ROSE
                        Don’t get distracted. It’s go time.

           They pass a box of ALL BUSINESSMEN, a box with a BACHELOR 
           PARTY, and a box full of HOT WOMEN and the one REGULAR 
           LOOKING NBA MOM with her FIVE KIDS. Bingo. 

           Jo and Rose walk up to SECURITY.  
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO
                        Hey there. We need to talk to one 
                        of the women in this box. 

                                 SECURITY
                        Players’ families only.

                                 ROSE
                        Listen, sir. I don’t want to sound 
                        dramatic, but this is kind of a 
                        life or death situation. 

           The Bouncer just stares at them. Jo turns away. 

                                 JO
                                (whispering to Rose)
                        Alright, I got this. 

           Jo manually pulls-up her boobs, like Jillian at the club. 

                                                                  SMASH CUT: 

           INT. TARGET CENTER ARENA - ESCALATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose go down the escalator. 

                                 JO
                        So, just to clarify, that Jillian 
                        move only works because of incest?

           As Jo puts her boobs back, the CREEPY OLD GUY (remember the 
           one who crashed his golf cart) comes up the escalator. He 
           leers at Jo from behind.  

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        Hey! I know you! 

                                 JO
                        I don’t think so.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        From the country club! I never forget 
                        a tush. Wanna come in our box? Heh. 

           Jo starts to shake her head “no,” but Rose nods. 

                                 ROSE
                        Yes. Yes we do.

                                 ROSE
                        We’re never getting past security. 
                        But we can talk to the wives from 
                        here. It’s only three boxes over. 

                                 JO
                        How are you gonna get there--

                        Just keep him occupied. 

                                 JO
                        No, please don’t make me--

           But Rose isn’t listening. She leans out of the Creepy Guy’s 
           box. Meanwhile, the Creepy Guy holds out a HOT DOG for Jo.

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        So tell me, when you golf do you 
                        play one hole or two? 

                                 JO
                        Isn’t it 18 holes? 

           He giggles. 

           INT. TARGET CENTER ARENA - BETWEEN BOXES - SAME TIME

           Rose climbs out of the box and looks down. There’s a solid 
           drop. She takes a sharp intake of breath and starts shimmying 
           along the glass wall of the first balcony towards the second, 
           humming the Mission: Impossible theme to herself.

           Rose waits for an exciting moment in the game before 
           attempting to shimmy past the BACHELOR PARTY BOX unnoticed. 

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Time out on the floor!

                                 ROSE
                        That’s not good.

           Rose tries to stay very still until the game resumes, but the 
           drunk partiers suddenly notice her hanging awkwardly from the 
           glass wall of the box.

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Heyyyyy.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 PARTY GUY 1
                        I thought you said the stadium 
                        didn’t allow strippers!

                                 PARTY GUY 2
                        Show us your tits!!

                                 ROSE
                        Oh, flattered, but no, I’m...

           They start throwing $1s at her. 

                                 PARTY GUYS
                        Take it off! Take it off!

                                 ROSE
                        Please keep your voices down! I 
                        don’t want anyone to notice--

                                 PARTY GUYS
                        Tits! Tits! Tits!

           Rose sighs, realizing she has to show them her tits. She 
           pulls up her t-shirt and pulls down her bra, then smushes her 
           boobs against the glass of the box. They look really weird, 
           all flat and veiny.

           The guys start booing her and taking their $1s back.

                                 PARTY GUY 1
                        Put it back on! Put it back on!

                                 ROSE
                                (pulling down her shirt)
                        Fine, just please stop yelling! 

           Rose shimmies on. She gets to the BUSINESSMAN BOX. She’s just 
           about to make it past undetected when--

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
                        Oh and the refs are gonna need to 
                        review that one-- 

                                 ROSE
                        Dammit.

           She goes still, but the BUSINESSMAN turn and notice Rose. 

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Hey! You! Stop!

           Some of the JUNIOR BUSINESSMEN quickly cover up business 
           plans and binders. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        ...Who?

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Obviously you. Who sent you? Was it 
                        Telecon? Pharmatech? It was 
                        probably Novamark, those fuckers.

                                 BUSINESSMAN 2
                        Should I call the cops, Chad?

                                 ROSE
                        Oh God please don’t--

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Naw. I want her to go back to Marty 
                        with a message: tell him to first, 
                        kill himself. And then go fuck 
                        himself. Like a fucking 
                        necrophiliac freak. He can send as 
                        many spies as he wants, but he’s 
                        never gonna get anything out of us. 
                        We’re rock solid, you hear? 

                                 ROSE
                        Okay. I will tell him that if you 
                        let me go on my way. 

                                 BUSINESSMAN 2
                        And tell him this too.

           He starts to unzip his pants. All the OTHER BUSINESSMEN start 
           to do the same. 

                                 ROSE
                                (hurrying along)
                        Got the message! 

           Before the pants come all the way off, Rose shimmies away. 

           She finally makes it to the Family Box! A HOT MODEL sees her 
           peek over the ledge and does a double-take. 

                                 HOT MODEL
                        What the-- Security--!

                                 ROSE
                                (dripping sweat)
                        No, no, no, wait! I know I look 
                        crazy. And honestly there was a lot 
                        of nudity on my way over here that 
                        I’m gonna have to unpack later. But 
                        I just need to ask that mom over 
                        there one question. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 HOT MODEL
                        About what?

                                 ROSE
                        It’s kind of sensitive. 

                                 HOT MODEL
                        Secur--!

                                 ROSE
                        Okay! Okay, listen, I need to 
                        acquire a packet of birth control 
                        that looks real but is fake. 

           A long, tense beat. 

                                 HOT MODEL
                        Oh. That’s all? 
                                (turning to the room)
                        Hey! This girl needs a packet of 
                        fakies. Anyone got an extra? 

           EVERY SINGLE WOMAN (including the one mom) opens her purse. 

           INT. ARENA - CREEPY OLD GUY’S BOX - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose, frazzled and sweaty, crawls back over the ledge into 
           the Creepy Old Guy’s box. Jo is holding him off, just like in 
           the Instagram Videos of all their Labor Day Trips. 

                                 JO
                        Oh thank god. 

           They run out. 

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        Hate to see you leave, but love to 
                        watch that tush go! 

           INT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - BREAKROOM - DAY

           Rose and Jo pour coffee, while Rose whispers. 

                                 ROSE
                        She should be ovulating this 
                        weekend. We just need to switch out 
                        her pills for the fakes and get 
                        Jake to bang her. 

                                 JO
                        Isn’t Jake going to Tampa every 
                        weekend? Natalia would rather let 
                        her eyebrows grow out than go to 
                        Florida.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        So we give him a reason to stay. 

                                 NATALIA (O.S.)
                        Hey amigaaaaas. 

           Rose and Jo both JUMP as Natalia enters the breakroom. 

                                 ROSE
                        Hey! Natalia! We were just talking 
                        about the saddest thing. 

                                 NATALIA
                        What’s wrong, babe? Your 
                        gallbladder acting gall-bad again? 

                                 ROSE
                                (annoyed)
                        No. It is not. I don’t have one 
                        anymore.
                                (back on track)
                        Dante just found out he’s gotta... 
                        be a speaker at this math... 
                        conference this weekend. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Oh wow that’s the worst. 

                                 ROSE
                        It’s just, he had booked this non-
                        refundable spa trip and now we 
                        can’t go. 

                                 JO
                        Fuck! He was so excited. Wait... 
                        can I use your reservation?!

                                 ROSE
                                (giving Jo a look)
                        I thought you had that appointment 
                        with the doctor. 

                                 JO
                        Yeah, and I would love to have that 
                        appointment at a resort--
                                (realizing)
                        I mean, that’d be totes unprofesh. 
                        To meet a doctor. At a resort. 
                        Nevermind. I can’t use it. 

                                 JILLIAN (O.S.)
                        I’ll use it. 

           REVEAL: Jillian is sitting in the corner, eating egg salad.

                                 ROSE
                                (no patience)
                        No, Jillian. It’s only for couples. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        I’ll take Tiffany. We’re besties 
                        now, so... 

                                 ROSE
                        You can’t take it because there’s a 
                        hygiene rule at the pool and 
                        frankly you’re not gonna pass with 
                        the amount of egg salad you eat.

           Jillian looks a little ashamed for once. Jo looks at Rose, 
           like, “That was harsh.”

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. But it’s not my policy.
                                (like it’s a new idea)
                        Oh hey! Natalia! You should use it!

                                 NATALIA
                        That sounds amaze. But Jake’s gotta 
                        go to Tampa--

                                 ROSE
                        Tell him to take a weekend off! 
                        This place is great. There’s a 
                        waterslide...

                                 NATALIA
                        Oh wow, waterslides are his fave. 
                        And you know, the other day he said 
                        he wanted to do more to make sure 
                        our relation-ship was stable... 
                        Okay, mamma, I’m in!

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           Rose and Dante are fighting. 

                                 DANTE
                        You just gave it to them?? 

                                 ROSE
                        Babe, it’s for the greater good. In 
                        the long run our lives are going to 
                        be so much better. 

                                 DANTE
                        That was supposed to be our special 
                        time, Rose! I had plans. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        I know, I know. There’s a giant 
                        Lego train town 0.3 miles away. But 
                        I’ll drive you there after we get 
                        Natalia knocked up!  

                                 DANTE
                        That’s not--

           Rose gets a call.  

                                 ROSE
                        It’s Jo. Sorry babe, we have to 
                        coordinate--

           Rose walks out of the room. Dante opens a sock drawer. 

                                 DANTE
                        It wasn’t all about the Legos... 

           He opens a RING BOX: inside a Lego train conductor holds a 
           DIAMOND RING.

           EXT. ARROW WOODS RESORT - POOL - DAY

           Jake stands near the top of the waterslide, waiting in line 
           with a bunch of little kids. 

           He gives an excited thumbs up to Natalia, who’s lounging by 
           the pool in sunglasses and a huge floppy sun hat, taking 
           selfies with different filters.

                                 JAKE
                                (shouting)
                        I’m gonna go down on my belly this 
                        time!!

                                 NATALIA
                        Lookin’ good, babe!

           A boy, CASEY, 6, is holding up the line, scared to go down.

                                 JAKE
                        You scared, dude? 

           Casey nods. 

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        I used to be scared. But then I 
                        conquered my fear. 

                                 CASEY
                        How? 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JAKE
                        Well, I met something scarier. 
                                (a beat)
                        The tickle monster! 

           Jake moves to tickle Casey. Casey squeals with delight and 
           hurries down the slide to avoid Jake.

           ANGLE ON: Rose and Jo, wearing trench coats and sunglasses, 
           trying to go incognito as they spy on their targets.

                                 JO
                        Jake’s gonna be a great dad.

                                 ROSE
                        Yeah. But let’s get him his own kid 
                        to tickle instead of a stranger’s. 

           Jake lands in the water with a huge splash. Natalia flags 
           down a WAITER and makes an order. 

           Rose motions for Jo to follow her as she trails the waiter. 
           Jo lingers for a beat, smiling at Jake playing with Casey.

           EXT. RESORT - POOL - BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose and Jo see the Waiter drop off the order with the 
           BARTENDER, and head back to the pool. 

           The Bartender preps a BEER and a DAIQUIRI. Rose and Jo 
           exchange a look. That’s definitely Natalia’s. 

                                 ROSE
                                (re: the Bartender)
                        I’ll Viagra the beer. Distract him.

                                 JO
                        Why am I always the distractor? I 
                        can do things! I want to be the do-
                        er! 

           But Rose is already at the end of the bar. Jo, at a loss, 
           grabs the Bartender’s hand. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Heyyyyy. So... You know how love is 
                        like an oyster...

           As Jo starts the wedding speech, Rose opens a small BAGGIE OF 
           BLUE PILLS. She drops one in the BEER and moves out of the 
           way, just as the Waiter comes back to take the order. 

           Rose gives Jo a thumbs-up. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, that’s all. Thanks for 
                        listening. 

           Rose watches the Waiter with a smirk, as he drops-off the 
           drinks... TO AN ELDERLY COUPLE. SHIT.  

           The Bartender preps ANOTHER BEER AND DAIQUIRI. Rose motions 
           for Jo to distract again. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                                (grabbing his hand)
                        It’s got a hard shell on the 
                        outside. But once you get to the 
                        middle, you find something really 
                        beautiful. 

           Rose puts a new Viagra in the Beer. The Waiter takes it to... 
           a HONEYMOONING BLACK COUPLE. WHOOPS.

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Sure it can be slimy and gross, but 
                        it also might just hold a pearl. 
                        Also, it’s an aphrodisiac. When I 
                        first met Jake, I thought--

           Rose drops a Viagra in another BEER AND DAIQUIRI ORDER.  

                                 BARTENDER
                        Who’s Jake? 

           The Waiter brings the order to... A GAY COUPLE. Fuck. 

                                 JO
                        Jake’s my friend’s husband. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        And you’re in love with him? 

                                 JO
                                (to the bartender)
                        Ha! No. I’m not in love with 
                        anyone... 
                                (realizing)
                        Except maybe one guy. Who I also 
                        hate. He’s seen me at my craziest. 
                        And I know he thinks my craziness is 
                        hot, but I want him to see me as 
                        more than hot-crazy. 

           Rose spots a BEER AND MILK ORDER. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                                (to self)
                        Who drinks milk at a pool? 

           She shrugs, dropping a Viagra in the beer. As the Waiter 
           takes it away, she sees the beer’s label: it’s a ROOT BEER. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Shiiiiit. 

           The Waiter drops off the Root Beer and Milk to two LITTLE 
           BOYS -- one is Casey from the waterslide. Before Rose can do 
           anything about it, Casey CHUGS the whole root beer. Ooooops.

                                 JO
                        Do you think Moby could ever love 
                        me? Can a slam piece ever become a 
                        main squeeze? 

           Rose spots a BEER and OJ order. She’s down to her last 
           Viagra. With a prayer, she drops it in the beer. 

           The Waiter delivers the order to... NATALIA AND JAKE! HOORAY! 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        There’s just something about him. 
                        He’s sort of... intoxicating. 

           Rose yanks Jo away. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Okay, good talk!

           EXT. RESORT - POOL - LATER

           Rose and Jo sneak past the pool area, where the ELDERLY MAN, 
           BLACK HONEYMOONER, and a BUNCH OF OTHER MEN all have BONERS. 

           MOMS start noticing the sea of boners, and pulling their KIDS 
           away in a panic. 

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        There must be something in the 
                        water!

                                 MOM
                        Sure pervert. 

           The Mom pulls her son, Casey, away only to realizes Casey has 
           the BIGGEST BONER of them all. 

                                 MOM (CONT’D)
                        There’s something in the water!
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Everyone starts running out, shrieking, in a total panic. Jo 
           looks at Rose.

                                 ROSE
                        Just keep moving. 

           In the midst of all the commotion, Rose swipes a waiter’s KEY 
           CARD and pockets it.

           INT. RESORT - HALLWAY - LATER

           Rose and Jo creep around the hallway. Rose spots the room. 

                                 ROSE
                                (reading the numbers)

                                 JO
                                (like Lil Jon’s song)
                        Damn she fine.

                                 ROSE
                        Now is no time for Lil Jon.

           She swipes the key card.

           INT. RESORT - ROOM 369 - CONTINUOUS

           Rose and Jo enter Natalia and Jake’s hotel room. Their 
           luggage is half unpacked on the bed. 

                                 JO
                        Damn this a nice suite. Dante 
                        shelled out. 

                                 ROSE
                        Just find her birth control. 

           Jo looks in Natalia’s toiletry kit and finds it. 

                                 JO
                        Got it! 

           Rose hurries over with the FAKIES. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Rose... are you sure? 

                                 ROSE
                        Yeah, it’ll work. It’s the same 
                        type of packaging. 

                                 JO
                        No, I mean... giving her placebos? 
                        The Viagra was one thing, but--
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           JUST THEN: they hear someone walk up to the door. 

                                 JAKE (O.C.)
                                (like Lil Jon)
                        369. Damn she fine. 

           Rose quickly switches Natalia’s birth control for the fakies. 
           Jo and Rose look around for a place to hide. They hear 
           someone swipe a card in the door. FUCK. Rose spots the door 
           to an ADJOINING ROOM. She quickly grabs Jo and, using the KEY 
           CARD, swipes them into--

           INT. RESORT - ROOM 367 - CONTINUOUS

           Jo and Rose quickly shut the adjoining door, just as Jake and 
           Natalia walk in. They both breathe a sigh of relief. Until--

           From the BATHROOM they hear the MOM from the pool WAILING. 

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        My baby! My poor baby boy!

                                 CASEY (O.S.)
                                (happily yelling)
                        Why is my thingy so hard? 

           A DAD’s voice joins the chorus. 

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        No, it hasn’t been longer than 
                        eight hours, but dammit he’s SIX 
                        YEARS OLD. Really? No idea? You’re 
                        the goddamn CDC! 

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        No we have not tried manually stimu--

           Jo and Rose’s eyes go WIDE. Throwing caution to the wind, 
           they run past the bathroom--

                                 DAD (O.S.)
                        What was that--

                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        PERVERTS!

           Rose and Jo RUN down the hallway. 

           INT. MOBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Moby sleeps with his arm around Jo, who stares at the 
           ceiling, depressed and a little bit haunted. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JO
                        I think I did something bad. 

                                 MOBY
                                (groggy, wry)
                        Very, very bad.

                                 JO
                        No, I mean... actually bad. 

                                 MOBY
                                (waking up, sincere)
                        Oh. Can I help? 

           Jo realizes she can never, ever tell him what they did.

                                 JO
                        No, it’s okay.

           He pulls her in tight and she snuggles into him, trying to 
           relax.

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dante waits for Rose in bed. Rose is on her phone, going 
           through all of Natalia’s social media, like an addict. 

                                 DANTE
                        So it’s done. 

           No response.

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        Rose? Rose? Rose!

                                 ROSE
                        I wanna see the exact moment it 
                        happens. Any minute. I can feel it.  

           Dante, sad, rolls over in bed. He turns off his bedside lamp. 
           Rose continues to stare, lit only by the glow of her phone. 

           INT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - CUBICLES - NEXT DAY

           Jo, exhausted, wearing a skirt and bodysuit, drinks coffee. 
           Rose, peppy, walks up to Jo. She JUMPS.

                                 ROSE
                        Whoa! What’s wrong with you? 

                                 JO
                        Hey. I need to talk to you--

           Natalia walks in -- grabbing a real estate yard sign. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 NATALIA
                        Amigas! I’m just running in and out. 
                        Today’s craze. But listen, Rosé, I 
                        wanted to say thanks. That resort 
                        was perf. And, we kinda needed it. 
                        So lucky I have you bitches.
                                (hoisting the sign)
                        BRB. Jake and I are having lunch 
                        with his ‘rents today. They made 
                        paella. It’s like, “Love me less!” 

           Natalia crosses out. Leaving Jo and Rose. A long beat.

                              ROSE
                                                                 JO
                   (vindictive)
           I think that bitch’s glowing.

                                                  I feel awful. 

           Rose and Jo exchange a look. 

                              ROSE
                                                            JO (CONT'D)
           What’s up with you? 
                                                  Are you serious? 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        It was one thing when we were 
                        giving her baby fever. But fake 
                        birth control? We crossed a line. 

                                 ROSE
                                (annoyed)
                        Oh come on, Jo. 

                                 JO
                        You don’t want kids. You don’t get 
                        it. But getting a woman pregnant 
                        without her consent? 

                                 ROSE
                        She wants a baby someday!

                                 JO
                        I mean, if you ever messed with my 
                        pills...

                                 ROSE
                        Well, yeah, that’d be irresponsible. 

                                 JO
                        How is that any different? 

                                 ROSE
                        I just mean, Natalia can actually 
                        take care of a baby.

                                 JO
                        What the hell? Just because I 
                        haven’t had a serious relationship--

                                 ROSE
                        Listen, Jo. It doesn’t matter. We 
                        did it. It’s done. We can’t undo it. 

                                 JO
                        Yes we can.   

           A beat. 

                                 ROSE
                        You are not telling Natalia what we 
                        did. 

                                 JO
                        Of course not. She can never know.

           Jo pulls out a box of PLAN B. 

           (Note to the Boys/Non-Sexually Carefree Readers: a single Plan 
           B pill comes in a large cardboard box that is then further 
           secured in reinforced plastic, like an expensive electronic.)

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        All we have to do is switch out her 
                        next birth control pill for this--

                                 ROSE
                        You are not giving her that.

                                 JO
                        It’s her body. It should be her 
                        choice--

                                 ROSE
                        So you think it’s too much to force 
                        a woman to get pregnant, but you’re 
                        totally cool giving her a mini-
                        abortion without her consent??

                                 JO
                        Plan B is not a mini-abortion! It’s 
                        an emergency contraceptive!

                                 ROSE
                        Oh, sorry I’m not dating an OBGYN. 

                                 JO
                                (angry)
                        Yeah, me too! Everyone should! They 
                        get to take home the stirrups!
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Rose grabs Jo by the arm. A tense beat. 

                                 ROSE
                        We worked so hard for this. Don’t 
                        you dare.

           Jo jukes left and heads right. Rose slips and falls.  

                                 JO
                        Ha ha Skechers!

           Jo sprints out. Rose scrambles after her. THE CHASE IS ON!

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Rose and Jo speed down the street in their cars. A medium-
           speed pursuit that diligently observes the rules of the road. 

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Jo and Rose screech to a halt, parking and leaping out of 
           their cars. Jo sprints across the front yard. 

           Rose tackles her. Jo tries to wiggle out from under her. Rose 
           holds her by the skirt, accidentally pulling it off. 

                                 JO
                        My skirt! 

           Rose reaches up and grabs the next article of clothing -- 
           Jo’s BODYSUIT. Jo keeps plowing ahead, dragging Rose on the 
           ground behind her.

                                 ROSE
                        You are not putting that Plan B in 
                        her birth control!  

                                 JO
                        Yes. I. Am!

           And with that Jo’s bodysuit unclasps, making Rose lose her 
           grasp. Jo sprints off. Rose hits the ground in anger. 

                                 ROSE
                                (”damn you!”)
                        BODYSUIT!! 

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo (in just her unclasped bodysuit) sprints to the back of 
           the house. She spots NATALIA AND JAKE in the kitchen window 
           and ducks. Jo army crawls around, looking for a way in. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           She spots an OPEN WINDOW on the Second Floor underneath a 
           FIREWOOD STORAGE BIN. If she can just climb it--

           Rose SPRINGS UP to block her. She spots a WOOD AX and grabs 
           it like a serial killer. 

                                 JO
                        Holy shit! Are you serious? 

                                 ROSE
                                (realizing how she looks)
                        Wha-- I mean, no. I just wanna move 
                        it so no one gets hurt. 

           Rose throws it away, but blocks Jo from the bin. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not letting you in this house. 

           Jo jumps on the bin. Rose WWE throws her off. Jo shrieks. 

                                 NATALIA (O.S.)
                        What was that?!

           Rose and Jo both freeze. They hear the backdoor opening. They 
           both dive into the nearby bushes, just as...

           Natalia and Jake peek around the side of the house. 

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        Huh. Must’ve been Sir Skunks-a-Lot 
                        again. 

           They head back inside. In the bush, Rose and Jo breathe a 
           sigh of relief. 

           Then they hear a RUSTLE. Both their eyes go big. 

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose and Jo sprint toward their cars, away from a SKUNK 
           waddling after them in hot pursuit. But as they run towards 
           the street, they spot JAKE’S PARENTS getting out of their car. 

           Rose and Jo quickly double back. The skunk HISSES. 

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo, half-clothed and dripping in SKUNK JUICE, sprints back to 
           the Wood Bin. She scrambles onto it. Then, with an abysmal 
           display of upper body strength (and flashing us with her open 
           bodysuit) she pulls herself through the open window. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Rose, EYES RED from a face-full of SKUNK JUICE, runs up just 
           as Jo’s feet disappear inside. Jo turns back and gives Rose 
           the finger before locking the window. 

                                 ROSE
                        Mother fu--

           She eyes the ax. A beat. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Nope, we’re not murderers.

           A beat. She grabs the ax. 

           INT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - SAME TIME

           Jo creeps down the hall, past the stairs facing the front 
           door. JUST THEN: the door bell rings. Jo, panicking, 
           awkwardly summersaults into... 

           INT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - JAKE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Jo tumbles into a 30 RACK OF CRAY-CRAY ENERGY DRINKS. They 
           clatter everywhere.

                                 JAKE (O.C.)
                        Did you hear that?

           FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose peeks around the side of the house. Jake’s parents ring 
           the bell. Natalia walks out and greets them. 

           Just as Natalia is about to close the door, Rose crawls up 
           and stops the door with the edge of the ax. 

           INT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - JAKE’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Jake comes up to check his office. Jo is standing in front of 
           a life-size display of SKATEBOARDERS for the TAMPAX GAMES. 
           She stands very still in a dope-ass ollie pose, like she’s in 
           Scooby-Doo... 

           Jake shrugs and shuts the door. Jo exhales. Then shakes her 
           head at the TAMPAX display. All the skateboarders hold white 
           skateboards that are dipped red at the end, a la tampons.

                                 JO
                        But seriously do no women work at 
                        this company?

           INT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Natalia brings ICED TEA to Jake’s Parents in the living room. 
           Rose is hiding behind a wall, just out of sight. She creeps 
           past the front door towards the stairs. Meredith sniffs.

                                 MEREDITH CHESNEY
                        What on earth is that horrid 
                        smell??

           JUST THEN: there’s another ring of the doorbell. Rose swears, 
           ducking into the front hall closet. 

           Natalia opens the door, and from the closet, Rose sees:

           IT’S DR. MOBY. Fuck. Rose, conflicted, texts Jo. 

                                 ROSE (V.O.)
                                (texting)
                        Abort! Abort!

           INT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           Jo closes the door to Natalia’s bedroom when her phone 
           vibrates. She reads Rose’s text and rolls her eyes. Jo texts 
           back: “Yeah. That’s what I’m doing.”

           Jo pulls out the box of Plan B. Then spots Natalia’s toiletry 
           bag sitting on her dresser, still unpacked from the trip. She 
           opens the bag: there’s the birth control. And... a BDSM choke 
           collar in Jake’s size. 

                                 JO
                        Alright, Natalia! 

           Jo starts trying to open the box of Plan B. But it’s so 
           reinforced, it’s impossible to pry open. Jo looks for 
           something sharp and spots the choke collar. 

           INT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - FRONT HALL CLOSET - SAME TIME

           Rose gets Jo’s texts.  

                                 ROSE
                        Fuck. 

           Rose texts Dante: “SOS Natalia’s house.” Through the crack in 
           the door, Rose sees Natalia talking to Moby in the living 
           room, just out of earshot of Jake’s parents. 

                                 MOBY
                        Are you gonna be okay today? I know 
                        it seems scary, but I’ll be there 
                        to help.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 NATALIA
                        Yeah. It’s really nice to have you 
                        here. 

                                 MOBY
                        Is there somewhere I can make a 
                        quick call, before we talk? One of 
                        my patients texted me and I can’t 
                        tell from the emoji if she’s in 
                        labor or has heartburn.

                                 NATALIA
                        Of course. Use our room upstairs.

                                 ROSE
                        Double fuck. 

           Just before Moby walks toward the stairs, Rose sprints out of 
           the closet and bounds up the stairs as quietly as she can. 

           INT. NATALIA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo’s finally sawed open the Plan B with the choke collar. She 
           takes out the Plan B pill and opens Natalia’s Birth Control. 
           Then she notices something... 

                                 JO
                        Hold on...

           Rose rushes into the room, closing the door. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Rose I think Natalia--

                                 ROSE
                        Moby’s here. 

                                 JO
                        What?! 

                                 ROSE
                        He’s coming up!

           They hear Moby climbing up the stairs. In one continuous 
           movement, Jo opens the window and steps out. Like fucking 
           Tommen on “Game of Thrones.”

           There’s a loud CRASH. 

                                 JO (O.S.)
                        Oh. FUCK!

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo in her bodysuit, covered in skunk juice, rolls in pain. 
           Natalia, Jake, Jake’s parents, and Moby come running around 
           to the side of the house. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Oh my god!

                                 MOBY
                        Jo?! Are you okay? What happened?

                        Where did you come from? 

           Jake looks up to the bedroom window and Rose ducks down. 

                                 JAKE (CONT’D)
                        Rose? 

                                 ROSE (O.S. FROM BELOW WINDOW)
                        Hey friends...

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose and Jo stand in front of Natalia, Jake, Jake’s parents, 
           and Moby. Dante comes running up, then slows down, seeing the 
           scene before him.  

                                 ROSE
                        So funny to see you all. We were 
                        just in the area. Thought we’d...

                                 JO
                        Thought we’d... surprise you... I 
                        can’t do this. 
                                (in one breath)
                        We broke into your house to give 
                        you Plan B to offset the fake birth 
                        control we replaced from your real 
                        birth control at the resort this 
                        weekend.

           Everyone looks aghast. Natalia doesn’t react. 

                                 MOBY
                        Wait -- what? 

                                 ROSE
                                (looking down, ashamed)
                        We thought if you got pregnant 
                        maybe we wouldn’t have to go on 
                        your Labor Day trip.

                                 JAKE
                        You did that just to get out of a 
                        trip?!

                                 JO
                        Well, it wasn’t just the trip... 
                        lately it’s been really hard to 
                        hang out... with you Nat. 

                                 JAKE
                        Are you serious?  

                                 ROSE
                        We didn’t know what else to do.

                                 JAKE
                        Besides secretly get your best 
                        friend pregnant?! 

                                 MOBY
                        Wait, is that why you were talking 
                        to Jake’s parents at the club?!

                                 JAKE
                        You talked to my parents? 

                                 MEREDITH 
                        They did have some valid points 
                        about Natalia getting pregnant. 

           This is the one thing that doesn’t set Jake off. Instead he 
           gets quiet, and takes Natalia’s hand, supportive.

                                 JAKE
                        Mom, just leave it--

                                 MEREDITH CHESNEY
                        So what if she did get pregnant? I 
                        mean really, Jacob. It’d be the least 
                        she could do since she couldn’t land 
                        us the Esposito Estate. 

                                 JAKE
                        Seriously Mom. 

                                 JO
                        Nat... have you been taking your 
                        birth control? When I went to put 
                        the Plan B in, it looked like you’d 
                        stopped. 

           Natalia finally sniffles. Jake starts to say something, but 
           she squeezes his hand. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 NATALIA
                                (crying)
                        No, Jake it’s okay. This isn’t how 
                        Dr. Moby said I should tell 
                        everyone, but Meredith, Patrick: we 
                        invited you here today to explain--
                                (to Jo and Rose)
                        You two didn’t get me pregnant 
                        because we’ve been trying for over 
                        a year and I can’t. I’ve been doing 
                        IVF with Dr. Moby. But it’s not 
                        working because my eggs are bad. 
                        Like, totes rotten.
                                (spinning out)
                        I mean, I know it might seem like I 
                        have everything. The job, the house, 
                        the man, the hair. But Jake’s in 
                        Tampa all the time! And I can’t have 
                        babies! Now we’re gonna have to pay 
                        $40 k to a rando to be an egg donor. 
                        And my two besties would rather I 
                        get pregnant and disappear than hang 
                        out with me, so... 

                                 ROSE
                        Nat--

           Jake shakes his head.

                                 JAKE
                        You two need to leave. Now. 

           Natalia walks back inside. Jake follows, rubbing her back. 
           Jake’s parents follow. Leaving Jo, Rose, Moby, and Dante. 

                                 JO
                                (to Moby)
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were her 
                        doctor? 

                                 MOBY
                        First of all, doctor-patient 
                        confidentiality. Second, are you 
                        fucking serious? All those times 
                        you came to my office... Jesus, Jo, 
                        I could lose my license for this. 

                                 JO
                        I’m sorry-- I didn’t mean--

                                 MOBY
                        Yeah, well, you did. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

           Moby turns to leave. Jo grabs his hand. He shakes her off and 
           walks away. 

                                 ROSE
                        Jo, I’m sorry--

                                 JO
                        Just stop. You know what? Natalia 
                        can be annoying. But at least she 
                        isn’t cruel. I should never have 
                        gone along with this.  

           Jo runs off. Rose goes to Dante, who backs away. 

                                 DANTE
                        I just... I just need a little time. 

           Dante starts to walk away and turns back. 

                                 DANTE (CONT’D)
                        You know, you guys wanted to get 
                        rid of Natalia because she was 
                        treating you badly. But look at all 
                        the people you hurt trying to get 
                        rid of her. 

           Rose is left all alone. 

           INT. JO'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jo chugs wine on the couch. Toby, depressed, lies on the 
           floor. Rose’s Roomba keeps bumping into him over and over. 

                                 JO
                        I know, Toby. I shouldn’t have 
                        tried to get one of my best friends 
                        pregnant. It was a bad idea. And 
                        you’re right, I should’ve said 
                        something when we started crossing 
                        serious ethical lines. But it’s too 
                        late. I made a lot of dumb mistakes 
                        that made me lose maybe the only 
                        guy I ever loved -- other than you. 
                        And I went from two best friends to 
                        none. Other than you. Really you’re 
                        all I have now--

           It’s at that moment that Toby finally gets on top of the 
           Roomba and rides it out of the room, leaving Jo very, very 
           alone.

           INT. ROSE & DANTE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Rose walks around her empty apartment with a bottle of wine. 
           She spots the vision board, and tries to tear it up. She 
           doesn’t have the upper body strength. 

           In frustration she throws the board at the wall. It dislodges 
           a LEGO MAN from a shelf. She picks up the Lego. 

                                 ROSE
                                (in a Lego voice)
                        Hey Rose, why are you all alone? 
                                (as herself)
                        Oh, because I’m a monster friend 
                        and a terrible girlfriend and 
                        everyone hates me. Now I have no 
                        friends, not even annoying ones who 
                        are more like family than friends. 
                        Why are you alone, Mr. Lego? 
                                (as the Lego)
                        Well, Dante went to stay at a motel 
                        and he forgot me. But my hip joints 
                        are a little stiff, so maybe it was 
                        intentional. 

           EXT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - BUILDING - DAY

           Jo, Rose, and Natalia all see each other walking in. Natalia 
           keeps walking. Rose and Jo stop. 

                               JO
                                                                ROSE
           After you.
                                                  Just go.

           They both move ahead and get stuck in the doorway together at 
           the same time.

                                 JO
                        Get off me.

                                 ROSE
                        I didn’t--

                                 JO
                        Move!

           They shove past each other, angry.

           INT. TWIN CITY REAL ESTATE - BREAKROOM - LATER

           Rose eats her lunch alone. She sees Jillian walk by. 

                                 ROSE
                        Hey! Um, do you wanna get lunch? 
                        Together? 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 JILLIAN
                        Seriously? I called that resort. 
                        They don’t have a hygiene policy.  
                        You’re just a mean girl. Now 
                        everyone knows about my E. Coli.

                                 ROSE
                        What? I honestly didn’t know you 
                        had E. Coli -- are you okay? 

                                 JILLIAN
                        I actually just tested negative. 
                        Tiffany and I are going to Chipotle 
                        to celebrate.

           Rose spots Jo and Natalia eating alone at their desks, but 
           doesn’t approach them.  

           INT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Rose lies fully-clothed on the bed, looking at a framed photo 
           of Dante. She gets up and walks over to the dresser, takes 
           out one of Dante’s shirts, holds it up to her face, and 
           inhales deeply. Then she looks down at his drawer and sees 
           the RING BOX. Fuck. 

           BLOOP! She gets a phone notification. She leaps for it. 

           INT. JO’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jo miserably dunks her fingers in ham juice and holds it out 
           for Toby. He doesn’t come. 

           BLOOP! She gets a notification and leaps for it.  

           SPLIT SCREEN: Rose and Jo, excited at the prospect of getting 
           texts from their boys or from their ladies, have instead 
           gotten a CANCELLATION EMAIL for the “GIRLS GONE WILD” AIRBNB. 

           Miserable, they both click off their phones and see their 
           iPhone lock screen -- both girls have the same PHOTO of Jo, 
           Rose, and Natalia together at high school graduation. 

           Then both, determined, walk out their front doors as we hear 
           the opening drums of The J. Geils Band covering “Where Did 
           Our Love Go.”

           EXT. ROSE & DANTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Rose is in the alley standing over a METAL TRASH CAN. She 
           drops a LIT MATCH inside. It goes up in flames. Then she 
           picks up her SKECHERS and drops them inside.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

           Jo rings the doorbell then RUNS. 

           The door opens to reveal: Casey (the boner kid) and his Mom. 
           They look down and see -- TEN CASES OF ROOT BEER. And a book 
           for kids about puberty.

           EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

           Rose walks up and finds Jillian and Tiffany hanging out with 
           the BOUNCER from the First Act.  

                                 ROSE
                        I wanted to give you guys this. 

           Rose hands them her HIKING BACKPACK. Tiffany is psyched but 
           Jillian SHRUGS. 

                                 ROSE (CONT’D)
                        Open it. 

           Jillian opens it. 

                                 JILLIAN
                        EGG SALAD?!

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Jo flags down the Creepy Old Guy on his golf cart. 

                                 CREEPY GUY
                        I knew you’d come back. They always 
                        do. 

           Jo rolls her eyes and pulls ROXANNE, one of the old ladies 
           from the first act who hated her friend Denise, into frame. 

                                 JO
                        Not me. 

           The Creepy Guy gives Jo a look, like “Naw, she’s not for me.” 
           Then Jo turns Roxanne around to show her BIG TUSH. The Creepy 
           Guy smiles. Roxanne WINKS. 

           INT. MOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Dante, miserable, walks down the hall to his room. He opens 
           the door to...

           INT. DANTE’S MOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           Rose is inside with a HALF-ASSEMBLED LEGO TRAIN SET. She 
           looks up from assembling it. Dante freezes. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 DANTE
                        What’s this? 

                                 ROSE
                        This is a deluxe Lego set. And I’m 
                        not counting it as your Christmas 
                        present. I just want to be better 
                        to all the people I was shitty to. 
                        You are so good to me, so patient 
                        with me, and I take you for 
                        granted. I’m sorry. I want to show 
                        you I can meet you halfway from now 
                        on.

           Dante hesitates. Then sits down beside her. 

                                 DANTE
                        That piece doesn’t go there. 

           Without smiling, they start building the train set. 

           INT. OBGYN OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Moby is reading a chart. 

                                 NURSE
                        Doctor, a girl who was pretty but 
                        smelled a little bit like ham just 
                        dropped this off for you. 

           The Nurse hands Dr. Moby a WRAPPED PRESENT with a CARD. He 
           opens it to reveal: a DVD BOX SET OF “THE GOOD DOCTOR.” But 
           with a printout of Dr. Moby’s face taped on top of Freddie 
           Highmore’s face. The card just reads: “You’re not a ‘Good 
           Doctor.’ You’re a GREAT doctor. And I’m the worst. I’m sorry.”

           INT. MAGGIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Rose is hanging out with Maggie (who is in sweatpants and who 
           does have jelly in her hair, but who also looks great). She’s 
           helping Maggie take care of her new baby son. The baby pukes 
           on Rose but she forces a smile and gives Maggie a thumbs-up. 

                                 ROSE
                        It’s cool. Totally cool. He’s an 
                        angel. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He’s a devil.

                                 ROSE
                        I didn’t want to be the one to say 
                        it.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 MAGGIE
                                (baby voice)
                        You’re such a little devil, aren’t 
                        you? Mommy loves you, you fucking 
                        evil maggot.

                                 ROSE
                        By the way, I’m looking for a new 
                        OBGYN... 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM

           An OBGYN waiting room. We see the doctor’s name is Dr. Helene 
           Nessbaum. Not Dr. Moby.

           Rose sits on one of those overly cushy chairs that is 
           supposed to make you feel better about waiting to get a 
           speculum shoved up your vagina. She looks anxious and tries 
           to focus on her Entertainment Weekly Magazine. (On the cover 
           we see that the NBA not-hot mom is expecting yet again.)

           In the background, the door opens and someone walks in. The 
           person checks in at reception, then sits down across from 
           Rose. We see that it’s JO.

                                 JO
                        Rose?

           Rose looks up from her magazine.

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ROSE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 JO
                        I can go to whatever doctor I want, 
                        it’s a free country.

           They both sit in silence for a beat.

                                 ROSE
                        Look, I’m so sorry, Jo. I should 
                        have listened to you. I never--

                                 JO
                        No, it’s not your fault. I’m 
                        equally responsible. We shouldn’t 
                        have done it in the first place. I 
                        just wish...
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        Can I show you something? I’ve 
                        wanted to text it to you for ages.

           Rose shows a pic of her burned Skechers. Jo busts out laughing.

                                 JO
                        Holy shit! You’re a real woman now. 
                        I never thought this day would come!

                                 ROSE
                                (emotional)
                        Me neither. 

           An awkward beat. 

                                 JO
                        Did you hear Wes Anderson’s 
                        Infinite Jest went into production?

                                 ROSE
                        Maybe we can see it when it comes 
                        out?

                                 JO
                        Absolutely not.

                                 ROSE
                        Oh. Okay.

                                 JO
                        But we could go see the gender-
                        swapped remake of Gone Girl that 
                        was written by two white dudes...

                                 ROSE
                        Gone Boy. Sounds awful. And 
                        perfect. 

           They smile at each other.

                                 JO
                        So what are you doing here?

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - EXAM ROOM

           Rose and Jo are in the exam room together. Both in gowns this 
           time. DR. NESSBAUM (think an Ari Berkowitz type) enters.

                                 DR. NESSBAUM
                        Hello, I’m Dr. Ne--

                                 JO
                        I shaved.
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 DR. NESSBAUM
                        Oh, thank you. I actually really 
                        appreciate that. I know I’m 
                        technically-- 
                                (”air quotes”)
                        “not supposed to care,” but it 
                        really does make my job so much 
                        better.

                               JO
                                                                ROSE
           I knew it!
                                                     (crossing her legs)
                                                  Shit.

                                 DR. NESSBAUM
                        I love that you both put on gowns 
                        to support each other. Which one of 
                        you will be carrying the baby?

                                 JO
                        Oh, no. We’re not a couple.

                                 DR. NESSBAUM
                        Then which one of you is getting 
                        pregnant?

                                 ROSE
                        Neither of us.

                                 DR. NESSBAUM
                        I don’t think I follow.

                                 JO
                        That happens to us a lot. Don’t 
                        take it personally. 

                                 ROSE
                        Let us explain...

           INT. ROSE’S CAR - DAY

           Rose and Jo ride in the car. They have a big cardboard box in 
           the backseat. The RADIO plays the end of The J. Geils Band’s 
           “Where Did Our Love Go,” then turns to an ad: 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (ON RADIO)
                        It’s Labor Day and that means big 
                        BIG savings--

           Rose parks and turns the car off. Rose and Jo exchange a look. 
           They both take a deep breath and get out of the car at...

           EXT. NATALIA'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose ring the doorbell. They hear footsteps. Then a 
           voice through the door: 

                                 NATALIA (O.S.)
                        Go away. 

                                 ROSE
                        Just give us one second, please. 

                                 NATALIA (O.S.)
                        I’m busy! 

                                 JO
                        Liar. It’s Labor Day. You have no 
                        plans. And that’s our fault. 

           A beat. Natalia opens the door a crack. 

                                 NATALIA
                        I don’t want to talk to you. Like, 
                        ever again.  

                              ROSE
                                                                 JO
           We know. 
                                                  We’re the worst. 

                                 JO (CONT’D)
                        Will you at least hear us out? 

           Natalia sighs and lets them inside. 

                                 NATALIA
                        You can come in. But you can’t sit 
                        down. And I’m not giving you any 
                        bevs.

           INT. NATALIA’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jo and Rose stand before Natalia, who sits on her couch. 

                                 ROSE
                        All friendships hit a rough patch. 
                        Somehow for twenty years we managed 
                        to avoid ours. And we had a good 
                        run. But when it finally came, we 
                        didn’t know how to handle it. And 
                        we handled it all wrong. 

                                 JO
                        We are so sorry. We shouldn’t have 
                        tried to get you pregnant. Like 
                        seriously. That was really crazy. 
                        We lost our minds for a hot minute. 
              (Please) Maternity Leave

                                 ROSE
                        But more than that, we should’ve 
                        talked to you instead of talking 
                        about you. If we had just had the 
                        hard conversation, sure, it would’ve 
                        been awkward, but we would’ve gotten 
                        through it. Instead we screwed 
                        everything up. 

                                 NATALIA
                        Yeah. You’re right. You were real 
                        pussies. 

           Jo and Rose nod, eyes downcast. 

                                 NATALIA (CONT’D)
                        But I was a pussy too. I felt like 
                        we were all growing apart. And I was 
                        scared that you guys were getting 
                        closer without me. And I panicked. I 
                        should’ve said something, but 
                        instead I figured I’d just become 
                        our group activity planner and 
                        videographer, and that’d be how I 
                        secured my spot. You guys wouldn’t 
                        leave me behind because you’d need 
                        me. But I wasn’t having any fun 
                        either. I should’ve just talked to 
                        you guys about it. 

           A beat. They all process this. 

                                 ROSE
                        So what do you think? If we all 
                        promise to communicate better, can 
                        we survive this? 

                                 NATALIA
                                (shrugging)
                        Communicating sounds like a good 
                        start. But I don’t know... Let’s 
                        get some tequila and I’ll see if I 
                        still want to punch you both. 

                                 JO
                        That sounds fair. But we’re not 
                        drinking, actually.

                                 ROSE
                        We’ve both got a doctors 
                        appointment in the morning. We’re 
                        donating our eggs. To you.

                        But we’re gonna mix ‘em up like a 
                        smoothie so we don’t know whose you 
                        end up using.

           Oh-so-carefully, Natalia wipes tears away to avoid mussing up 
           her eye-makeup.

                        I really missed you, amigas. 

           They all hug, then Jo pulls back and shouts:

                        Natalia, what’s wrong with you??

           They finally get into the lobby, then put their arms around

           The elevator opens and inside is... DR. MOBY! Rose, Jo and
