                                                            OVER BLACK:

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        What if it takes too long?

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        I’ll wait forever if I have to.

           CLOSE ON:

           BEN HASKINS, handsome enough but in the early stages of 
           letting himself go. He’s just starting to bald, the type of 
           mid 30s that looks closer to 40.

           Ben’s eyes are glowing, filled with love. His head bobs in 
           and out of frame.

           CLOSE ON:

           KAT HASKINS, the mid 30s partner in crime of his, her auburn 
           hair up to keep it out of her face. Her eyes match his, 
           overwhelmed with emotion.

           Her lips part, and she exhales, breathy.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           And we see now that Ben and Kat are making love. Slow, 
           passionate and real. But also something desperate about it. 
           There’s a sadness here underneath it all.

           Back on Ben, whose eyes now look to be holding back tears.

                                                                 FLASH OF: 

           Ben as a teenager, surrounded by laughing male classmates. He 
           locks eyes with a teenage Kat across the school cafeteria. 
           She smiles his way, something that pierces his soul.

           Back on Kat in the bedroom, sharing Ben’s look of longing.

                                                                  FLASH OF:

           Next to a huge oak tree, teenage Kat watches a nervous Ben 
           play the acoustic guitar, stifling a giggle.

           In the bedroom, Ben breathes in deeply, absorbed in Kat.

                                                                  FLASH OF:

           Inside a church, Teenage Kat places a comforting hand on 
           Ben’s. A picture of Ben and an Older Woman (his mother) on 
           top of a casket. 
           Back in bed, Ben’s hand tightens around the sheet, twisting.

                                                                  FLASH OF:

           Ben and Kat, late twenties, getting married in that same 
           church. A glistening but humble ring slides onto her finger.

           Back on Ben and Kat. Making love. Becoming one. A love that 
           transcends time.

           Just as Kat nears climax, she can no longer hold in--

                                 KAT
                             (nearly a whisper)
                        Don’t leave me, Ben.

                                                             QUICK FLASHES:

           Ben and Kat in their first home. Kat painting on a canvas. 
           Ben with a class of students. Kat and Ben against the sunset.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           ONSCREEN TEXT: Chicago - 2009

           The room dark. Ben sits, face illuminated by a blue glow. We 
           find him flipping through the last few images we just saw on 
           his first generation iPhone. He closes out of the pictures. 
           On the lockscreen we see the date: Thursday, November 5

           Behind him, Kat sleeps, back toward him. He turns to her, 
           watching her body rise and fall with each breath. There’s 
           something he has to do... and he doesn’t want to do it.

           Ben stands, walks off, but we stay on Kat’s sleeping body. On 
           the nightstand, more pictures of the couple together.

           A moment later, Ben’s hand pops back in to drop a note and a 
           CD labeled “FOR KAT” on the bed.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAWN

           Ben looks up at a medical clinic, unsure of himself, breath 
           visible in the winter air. The Chicago skyline sits in the 
           distance. We’re on the undeveloped, rough edge of town. 

           A deep breath. He walks up the steps and opens the door.

           FADE TO BLACK
                                          TITLE:

                              THE SECOND LIFE OF BEN HASKINS

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - MORNING

           --two eyes wide awake. Blue, piercing. Staring forward. 
           Focused on nothing in particular.

           ETHAN JOYCE (29) lies motionless in his bed. Like he hasn’t 
           slept all night. He exhales, morning time blues. 

           We find Ethan shirtless, chiseled, wavy brown hair. He’s 
           beautiful. Blessed in the physical sense. Life tends to give 
           you what you want when you look like this. 

           Outside the window, the Chicago skyline glistens in the 
           sunrise. But there’s something different to it. Unfamiliar, 
           ultramodern buildings join the Willis Tower and Marina City.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - MORNING

           Ethan stands in front of the same medical clinic Ben just 
           visited. Again, there’s something different. It’s clearly 
           undergone renovations. A developed area, high rises all 
           around, no longer the edge of town. 

           The summer sun beats down on the asphalt.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: Chicago - 2029 

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           A Doctor’s GLOVED HANDS hold Ethan’s head, shining a light 
           into those piercing blue eyes. The DOCTOR (50s, paunchy) puts 
           his arms at his side. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, there’s nothing physically 
                        wrong with you.

           The Doctor looks a shirtless Ethan up and down, noting his 
           built torso.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Far from it, actually. You’re in 
                        perfect health.
                             (perplexed)
                        You said this has been going on a 
                        while?

           Ethan simply nods. 
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You’re going to need to speak to an 
                        assessor.

           INT. THERAPY ROOM - LATER

           Ethan sits in a plush leather chair. It’s a different part of 
           the facility, cozier and more personal. CLAIRE MORRISON 
           (early 40s), professional yet empathetic, jots down 
           information on a notepad.

                                 CLAIRE
                        How long have you been having these 
                        feelings, Ethan?

           Ethan takes his time to respond, the truth hard to admit.

                                 ETHAN
                        Every day for the past... I dunno, 
                        two years. Maybe three. It’s like 
                        I’m in a fog.

                                 CLAIRE
                        What have you done to alleviate 
                        what you’re experiencing? 

                                 ETHAN
                        Oh God... everything. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Please elaborate, for my record.

                                 ETHAN
                        Tried therapy. I quit drinking. 
                        Quit smoking. Quit drugs. Started 
                        the new drugs they told me to take. 
                        Started exercising. Started 
                        praying. Gave to charity, what 
                        little I could. Apologized to those 
                        I’ve wronged. Confronted the people 
                        who’ve wronged me. 
                             (then)
                        None of it worked.

           Claire remains professional, composed.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Mhmm. You mentioned a lack of 
                        money. Perhaps financial hardship 
                        is making you shortsighted--

                                 ETHAN
                        It’s not that... okay? I’m just 
                        done. Let me be done. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        You know, you’re not supposed to 
                        try to talk me out of this, legally-
                        speaking.

           Claire bites her bottom lip, he’s correct.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s a big decision. A permanent 
                        one. You need to be aware of that.

           The heavy silence assures us that Ethan is indeed aware.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Have you told those close to you?

           Beat. He considers.

                                 ETHAN
                        Everyone I want to tell.

           More silence.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m ready.

           Claire stifles her emotion, this part never gets easy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Okay. One more question.

           INT. OPERATION ROOM - LATER

           The Doctor places Ethan into a chair. He sits still, staring 
           at the bright lights above him. 

                                 CLAIRE (V.O.)
                        Are you willing to participate in 
                        our remodeling program?

           In the chair, Ethan breathes hard. Somehow simultaneously 
           nervous and at peace.

                                 ETHAN (V.O.)
                        Yes.

           The Doctor places a hand on Ethan’s shoulder.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Thank you for your generosity, 
                        young man.

           Ethan smiles back, eyes watery.
                                 ETHAN
                        Will it hurt?

                                 DOCTOR
                        You won’t feel a thing.

                                 ETHAN
                        And it’ll all be over... just like 
                        that?

           The Doctor nods, producing a long, thin syringe.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Are you ready, Mister Joyce?

           The full reality sets in for Ethan, but he remains steadfast.

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m ready.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Okay, I’m going to count down from 
                        five...

           Ethan grips the arm rest. Closes his eyes. 

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Four...

           The syringe moves closer to the back of Ethan’s neck. He 
           breathes what he knows will be his last breath.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Three... two...

           The syringe makes contact, puncturing the skin. 

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        One.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 1. (Just Like) Starting Over

           ONSCREEN: Darkness and silence. A vague shape begins to form, 
           slowly revealing itself to be that of a WOMAN, before quickly 
           fading back to black.

           Suddenly, we’re interrupted by a loud, frantic GASP OF AIR.

           INT. OPERATION ROOM - LATER

           Ethan’s eyes POP open. But something about the way he moves 
           feels different.
           He struggles in his chair, arms tied down. The Doctor watches 
           Ethan writhing about. He holds a futuristic, cylindrical, 
           GLOWING BLUE DEVICE.

           He puts his hands up, trying to soothe Ethan.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mister Haskins, please calm 
                        yourself.

                                 ETHAN
                        Where am I?

                                 DOCTOR
                        We’ll explain everything in a 
                        moment. Try to relax.

           The Doctor looks at Ethan, bedside manner on display. Ethan 
           does his best to comply.

                                 ETHAN
                        What’s going on? Did you do it?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Welcome back to the physical world, 
                        Mister Haskins. I know the initial 
                        readjustment period can be 
                        disorienting. First, can you please 
                        tell me your name?

                                 ETHAN
                        Benjamin... uhhh, Ben. Ben Haskins.

           Ethan’s gone. His body belongs to BEN HASKINS now.

                                 DOCTOR
                        That’s correct, Mister Haskins. Do 
                        you have any idea where you are 
                        right now?

           Ben thinks for a moment, examining his hands.

                                 BEN
                        You... you’ve resurrected me.

           Ben exhales as he says the words. Heavy.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Well, remodeled. But yes.

                                 BEN
                        How long have I been gone?
                                 DOCTOR
                        Your consciousness has been 
                        suspended for nineteen years and 
                        six months--

                                 BEN
                        Nineteen years? Jesus. 

           That number hits Ben hard.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (mumbling)
                        I... I thought...

                                 DOCTOR
                        But the procedure appears to have 
                        been a success. You’re very lucky, 
                        Mister Haskins.

           Breathe in, breathe out. 

                                 BEN
                        I... I can’t believe it. Is Kat 
                        here?

                                 DOCTOR
                             (ignoring that)
                        Now, you may find some differences 
                        between your old life and your new 
                        one -- different taste in foods, 
                        different mannerisms, physical 
                        abilities, and so on--

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, great. Where’s my wife?

                                 DOCTOR
                        In a moment, Doctor Morrison will 
                        get you up to speed on your 
                        personal life.
                             (changing the subject)
                        Would you like to see what your new 
                        body looks like, Mister Haskins?

           The Doctor outstretches a mirror. Ben grabs it, hand shaking. 
           He holds it up. Looks at his incredibly handsome face, the 
           face that used to be Ethan Joyce’s.

                                 BEN
                        Holy shit.

           INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY

           Ben sits in the same plush chair where Ethan was interviewed. 
           He watches a holographic clock tick in the corner of the 
           office, a host of thoughts warring behind his gaze.
           The door opens as Claire enters the room. She reads a 
           clipboard.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Good afternoon, Mister Haskins. And 
                        congratulations on your successful 
                        remodel.

                                 BEN
                        Thanks. This... is really weird.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Of course it is. For all intents 
                        and purposes, you just traveled 
                        twenty years into the future.

                                 BEN
                             (no shit)
                        Yeah. 

                                 CLAIRE
                             (trying to spin it)
                        Beats cancer though, right?

           Ben doesn’t acknowledge that, focusing back on the clock, 
           specifically the date: 05/11/2029. It hardly seems real.

                                 BEN
                        You musta been, like, nine when I 
                        died.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Try twenty, but thank you for the 
                        flattery. 

                                 BEN
                        And how old am I now?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well, legally speaking you’re 
                        thirty-five, but your body is about 
                        six years younger.

           Ben runs his hands through his hair.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know how I feel about being 
                        in the body of someone who killed 
                        himself. It’s kinda creepy.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It’s best to try and not think 
                        about that, Ben. Yes, your body 
                        used to belong to someone else.

                        But they are gone. They chose to 
                        end their life. This is your life 
                        now, and it’s yours to do what you 
                        want with it.

                                 BEN
                        Right. Have you guys called my wife 
                        yet?

           Claire reveals a little emotion at that.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ben, this is never easy, but I 
                        suppose it’s easiest if I’m... as 
                        forthright as possible. Your wife 
                        has chosen to detach herself from 
                        you.

           Ben blinks. That doesn’t sound good.

                                 BEN
                        What the hell does that mean?

                                 CLAIRE
                        She has legally forbidden you from 
                        reaching out to her.

           Ben looks like someone knocked the wind out of him.

                                 BEN
                        That’s not possible.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I’m sorry.

                                 BEN
                        There... there must be some 
                        mistake.

                                 CLAIRE
                        There’s no mistake.

                                 BEN
                        She said she’d wait forever.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (voice-of-reason)
                        Twenty years is a long time, Ben.

                                 BEN
                        It’s a lot shorter than forever. 
                        Why would she--

                        Why did this take so long? I 
                        thought I was one of the first.

                                 CLAIRE
                             (well-rehearsed)
                        Demand has been high. Higher than 
                        expected. And the process has gone 
                        through a lot of fine-tuning. 
                        Priorities shift. It’s only been 
                        the last couple of years that 
                        things have really picked up.

           Eyes watery, Ben’s despair is evident in his words. 

                                 BEN
                             (pleading)
                        Can you... can you at least let me 
                        know if she’s okay?

                                 CLAIRE
                        I can’t. In fact, it might be 
                        easier to just assume she isn’t.

           Claire places her hand on top of Ben’s. She feels his pain.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Ben, you have a lot of 
                        information to process. This isn’t 
                        going to be easy. Grieving never 
                        is.

           Ben’s hand shakes. He tries to slow his breathing.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        There’s a whole world out there 
                        waiting for you. You just need some 
                        time to get adjusted. Why don’t we 
                        get you Re-ID’d and have you rest 
                        for a bit? 

                                 BEN
                        Re-ID’d?

           INT. MACHINE - LATER

           Ben lies on his back in a glowing machine vaguely reminiscent 
           of a tanning bed. A soothing, slightly computerized female 
           voice speaks over ambient music.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Welcome back, Ben. Today is 
                        Thursday, May 11th, 2029. You have 
                        been suspended for nineteen years, 
                        six months and four days.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Please place your hands on the pads 
                        on each side of you.

           Ben complies, nervous. He winces as the pads activate.

                                 BEN
                        Wh-what are you doing?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        We’re modifying your fingerprints 
                        to match those of your old body. 
                        Now open your eyes...

           Now Ben really squirms as the panel above his head opens, two 
           lights shining brightly as lasers emanate outward. We watch 
           as Ben’s eye color changes from blue to brown.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        When you step out of this chamber, 
                        your identity will once again be 
                        Benjamin Joseph Haskins. The 
                        institute will provide your housing 
                        for the next six months while you 
                        look for new employment.

                                 BEN
                        Uhh... okay.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Good luck, Ben. And congratulations 
                        on your new life.

           EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

           Ben stands outside the remodel facility. He stares out at the 
           Chicago skyline. He takes in all the changes of the last two 
           decades. In his arms, a small bag of his belongings. 

           Such a strange sensation, but unquestionably a beautiful 
           summer day. A car pulls up in front of Ben, the passenger 
           door opening in front of him. Ben looks over each shoulder 
           before realizing the car is for him.

           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Ben gets into the car, tossing his bag next to him. 

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Good afternoon, Benjamin.

                                 BEN
                        Hi.
           Confused, Ben looks to the front seat to find no driver. He 
           leans in closer.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           On closer inspection, there’s no steering wheel either.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        It will be two hours, five minutes 
                        to your destination.

           The car takes off, gently blowing Ben’s mind.

                                 BEN
                        Two hours? Where are we going?

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Milwaukee.

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Please put on your seatbelt.

           Ben sighs, complying.

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           The car comes to a stop outside of a large apartment building 
           on a relatively busy corner of downtown Milwaukee. Light 
           summer drizzle.

           Ben steps out of the car, bag in hand. He looks around at 
           various PEDESTRIANS, all of whom smile in his direction. 

           Weirded out, Ben looks at himself, thinking there’s something 
           off about his outfit. He catches himself in the reflection of 
           a window, a reminder of how attractive he is now.

                                 BEN
                             (to himself)
                        Right.

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           A door opens, Ben entering a moment later. The lights 
           automatically turn on as he walks in. Ben surveys the place, 
           sparse but nicer than your standard government housing.
           Art on the walls catches his attention, as does the acoustic 
           guitar and small electric piano in one of the corners.

           Ben walks to a desk nearby. On top of it: a phone (like an 
           iPhone but entirely translucent), a small paperback (A Grief 
           Observed by C.S. Lewis), and a bottle of PILLS.

           The phone lights up at Ben’s touch, and a hologram of Claire 
           displays above it.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Ben, welcome to your transitionary 
                        home. You’ll find some of your old 
                        possessions are here to help ease 
                        your way back into society. 

           Ben looks out his window, taking in the nighttime city scene.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You’re probably wondering what 
                        you’re doing here. The previous 
                        occupant of your body lived in 
                        Chicago. Since you have no 
                        immediate family residing in 
                        Illinois, recent laws now prohibit 
                        you from entering the state for a 
                        period of five years, in order to 
                        protect you and people who knew 
                        your body’s previous occupant. So, 
                        welcome to Milwaukee.

           Ben frowns, looks to the items on the desk.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve loaded an app on your phone 
                        called STAGES that I believe will 
                        be very helpful in your recovery. 
                        And I’ve found that the book is 
                        also a great tool for patients who 
                        have returned to similar 
                        difficulties after being remodeled. 
                        It’s a short read and full of 
                        incredible wisdom, I promise. 
                        You’re not alone, Ben.

           Sighing, Ben softly shakes the bottle of pills.

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        A scan of your brain chemistry 
                        identified a slight imbalance in 
                        your serotonin levels. The pills 
                        should help with that. Now please 
                        get some rest.
           Ben looks out the window, spotting a WOMAN in the street 
           going crowd. In a blink, she’s gone. Did he just imagine it?

           INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Exhausted, Ben looks up at the light, annoyed. He looks 
           around for any sign of a light switch. Nothing. Great.

                                 BEN
                             (might as well try)
                        Lights... off?

           The lights comply and shut off. Ben allows a small smile of 
           accomplishment before COLLAPSING onto the bed. It’s been an 
           eventful day. The holographic clock reads 8:34 PM.

           ONSCREEN: Total darkness. Once again, colors swirl. A WOMAN 
           comes into focus. We get a better look this time (auburn 
           hair, warm smile, surely Kat) until the whole image falls 
           apart as--

           INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Ben’s (now brown) eyes BOLT AWAKE. It’s still dark outside. 
           He looks to the clock next to him: 10:15 PM. 

                                 BEN
                        Shit.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 2. I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Shirtless, Ben shuffles around the room, unsure what to do. 

           On the back of his neck, we see a small, circular SCAR, a 
           byproduct of his remodeling. It’s cool looking, the type of 
           scar you show to girls at parties.

           He grabs his new phone, tries to make sense of it. He finally 
           gets to the phone app, dials a number from memory. It rings.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 BEN
                        Um... hello.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Who is this?
                                 BEN
                        Is Kat there?

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Kat? I don’t know any Kat, buddy.

           Click. The phone hangs up. Ben sighs, navigates home on his 
           phone, and sees the Stages app staring back at him. Nothing 
           better to do, he clicks on it.

                                 STAGES

                        Please prepare to confront your 
                        grief.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, okay. I’m prepared.

                                 AI KAT (O.S.)
                        Hey, Benny-boo.

           Ben’s jaw wavers, his eyes immediately watering. He turns 
           around, startled and moved as he sees before him--

           --a ghostly hologram of KAT as he knew her. She looks just as 
           wonderful as he remembered.

                                 BEN
                        Kat? I don’t...

           Ben can hardly breathe.

                                 AI KAT
                        I know it must be hard to see me, 
                        but it’s best if you can confront 
                        this head on, looking right at me 
                        while you do it.

                                 BEN
                        Right.

                                 AI KAT
                        Plus I kind of look like Princess 
                        Leia, right?

           Ben can’t help laughing, but quickly melts back to sadness.
                                 BEN
                        Why did you do it, Kat? You said 
                        you’d wait forever.

           AI Kat looks down sympathetically.

                                 AI KAT
                        Lovers frequently employ hyperbole, 
                        Ben. It’s not even physically 
                        possible for a person to “wait 
                        forever”.

           As Ben process that--

                                 AI KAT (CONT’D)
                        Besides, I’m just a recreation of 
                        Kat. I can’t speculate on what she 
                        was feeling or why she did things. 
                        I’m here only to help you move on.

                                 BEN
                        How am I supposed to move on? I’m 
                        in a world I don’t recognize 
                        without the only person I want to 
                        be with.

           AI Kat walks toward Ben, mere inches separating them.

                                 AI KAT
                        Why don’t we start by remembering 
                        something nice? A memory you 
                        particularly enjoy.
                             (encouraging)
                        Close your eyes. Think.

           Ben complies, closes his eyes, and when he opens them--

           EXT. BEN AND KAT’S TREE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           The real Kat (aka PAST KAT now) sits by Ben (in his original 
           body, which we can call PAST BEN now) on a picnic blanket in 
           front of the ENORMOUS OAK TREE we last glimpsed in the 
           opening. 

           Current Ben watches the memory, walking through the scene. 

                                 PAST BEN
                        Feels like I’m wasting my time with 
                        them sometimes. Like they don’t 
                        really care about history at all. I 
                        just... I wish that I could 
                        convince them that history isn’t 
                        just a bunch of outdated made-up 
                        stories.

                                 PAST BEN (CONT'D)
                             (passionate)
                        It’s real. It’s happening now. And 
                        we’re all a part of it. Our 
                        sixteenth president walked this 
                        very ground, and our forty-fourth 
                        might live just a few miles away.

                                 PAST KAT
                             (admiring)
                        You should be happy, Ben... you’re 
                        shaping young minds. You’re doing 
                        something that matters.

                                 PAST BEN
                        No, you’re doing something that 
                        matters! You’re pursuing your 
                        dreams. Your art. I’m just... 
                        making the most of my back-up plan.

                                 PAST KAT
                        Oh, so I’m your back-up plan now?

                                 PAST BEN
                             (smiles)
                        You know that’s not what I meant. 

                                 PAST KAT
                        You care, Ben. You do. You need to 
                        fight for those kids... just like 
                        you fight for everything you care 
                        about.

           That touches him. Past Ben smiles wide at Past Kat. 

                                 PAST KAT (CONT’D)
                        Now play me something. Or did you 
                        bring that guitar just for us to 
                        look at it?

           He grabs a nearby guitar and begins playing the opening notes 
           of “You’ve Really Got A Hold On Me” by Smokey Robinson.

                                 PAST BEN
                             (singing softly)
                        I don’t like you/but I love you...

           Ben’s voice is impressive, gently commanding.

                                 AI KAT (V.O.)
                        Describe to me what you’re seeing.

                                 BEN
                        Kat and I on a picnic. I’m playing 
                        “You’ve Really Got A Hold On Me.” 
                        Feels like an eternity since I’ve 
                        heard it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        Your-- Kat’s parents always gave me 
                        a hard time about using it as our 
                        wedding song.

                                 AI KAT (V.O.)
                        I just looked up the lyrics. To be 
                        fair to them, it does sound 
                        borderline abusive.

                                 BEN
                        To us, it was always about loving 
                        someone unconditionally.

           Past Ben wraps up his short rendition and places the guitar 
           down. Past Kat looks to him, overwhelmed by love.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        And now, you’re about to...

                                 PAST KAT
                        I want to try to have a baby again.

           Past Ben smiles wide, patting the nearby oak tree. “Ben + 
           Kat” is carved into it.

                                 AI KAT (V.O.)
                        About to what, Ben?

                                 PAST BEN
                             (looking at tree)
                        This guy always brings me luck.

                                 PAST KAT
                        You mean he always helps you get 
                        lucky.

           As they kiss, Ben turns away, not ready to think about this. 

                                 BEN
                        That’s enough for now.

           He closes his eyes, and when he opens them again--

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           He’s back, AI Kat still there too.

                                 AI KAT
                        That wasn’t so bad, right? The 
                        first step is always the hardest.

           Ben is bitter now.
                                 BEN
                        You don’t even sound like her.

                                 AI KAT
                        It’s normal to have a negative 
                        reaction to seeing the happiness 
                        you once had. Why don’t you try to 
                        remember something uncomfortable? A 
                        bad moment in your marriage.

           Angry, Ben rushes to the phone, hitting buttons on it.

                                 BEN
                        How do I turn you off?

           He figures it out and AI Kat disappears, leaving him alone 
           again. He breathes heavy, distressed by that encounter. He 
           looks back to his phone, determined, and grabs it.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Ben pops two of the serotonin pills with a glass of water, 
           hoping they’ll do something to get him out of his 2029 blues. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (pacing, on phone)
                        Well, I’m just calling because 
                        we’re coming up on the fortieth 
                        reunion.
                             (then, faux-casual)
                        Sure, it’s not for a couple more 
                        years, but I’m getting all the 
                        contact info in line. So, speaking 
                        of, do you know what ever happened 
                        to Kat Haskins?

           Ben sighs and hangs up. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Alright, phone, try the next name 
                        on the list.

           The phone starts ringing.

                        school. How’s it going?

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Ben is spread out lethargically on the couch, acoustic guitar 
           on his lap.
                                 BEN
                        How could none of them know where 
                        you are?

           AI Kat appears.

                        There’s a reason they call it 
                        detaching.

                        have to say my name for me to

                                 BEN
                        No. Go away.

           AI Kat disappears. Ben’s left to his depression in the dark. 
           He touches the neck of the guitar with his left hand, forming 
           a chord, strums at the strings with his right.

           An atonal noise rings out. Ben looks at the guitar, confused. 
           He plucks the strings in order to see if they’re in tune. 
           They are. He tries at the chord again, same horrible noise.

           He raises his left hand, simply stares at it.

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - MORNING

           Ben sits in a circle of SUPPORT GROUP ATTENDEES, people of 
           all different races and genders. They all have that same scar 
           on the back of their necks -- all REMODELS. An ASIAN MAN 
           speaks up--

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        I don’t know how to feel. I’m 
                        living as a man now.

                        Beggars can’t be choosers, right? 
                        They expedited my case ‘cause of my 
                        kids, but I thought they’d at least 
                        give me a female body. All I was 
                        thinking about was getting back to 
                        them. I didn’t read the fine print.

           The GROUP LEADER nods, sympathetic.

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        How are things with your family?

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        How are my kids supposed to 
                        comprehend that their black mother 
                        is alive again but now she’s an 
                        Asian man? They can hardly look at 
                        me. Not to mention my husband. He 
                        didn’t sign on for this.

           Ben furrows his brow, a reality check setting in.

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        These things take time. He’ll learn 
                        to accept this new life.

                                 ASIAN MAN
                             (tearing up)
                        What if he doesn’t? I don’t know 
                        what I am without him... I-I don’t 
                        know if I could go on--

                                 GROUP LEADER
                        Stop that. You can’t pin your 
                        entire reason for living on others. 
                        You must embrace the life you have. 
                        It’s what we’re all here to learn.

           The Asian Man dries his tears, nods.

           A seemingly POSH WOMAN scans the crowd before speaking up.

                                 POSH WOMAN
                        I just got out... so I guess I’m

           Ben takes that in.

                                 POSH WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        This stupid ass girl whose body I 
                        got was from Ohio, so I can’t go 
                        there ever? It’s not my fault my 
                        grandma moved to Akron while I was

                        What’s it matter? I still don’t 
                        have anyone here. Sometimes I 
                        wonder why I bothered to do this.

           A nod from Ben, he’s starting to feel that way too.

                        My dad’s gone now, though that’s 
                        not a huge surprise. He had me kind 
                        of later in life.

           He pulls a pill bottle from his jacket, shakes it.

                        else you want to talk about?

           Ben sits up straighter, forcing himself to talk about this 
           with the group.

                             (voice catching)
                        My wife detached. I can’t find her. 
                        And I’m in this weird new body I 
                        can’t get used to.

                        Man, get on Rendezvous and go find 
                        a new wife. You got a hot new body 
                        and you want to complain about it?

                             (frustrated)
                        I didn’t ask for this body. I 
                        wanted to wait. To see if treatment 
                        could be an option. I did this for 
                        my wife, and she left me. I mean, I 
                        know... it’s been a long time, I 
                        get that. But for her to legally 
                        forbid me from seeing her? What is 
                        that?! She was... I mean we went 
                        through everything together. We had 
                        all our firsts together. First 
                        love. First loss. She was there for 
                        me when my mom passed away. I was 
                        just a kid. I don’t know what I 
                        would’ve been if I didn’t have her. 
                             (somber)
                        And now I don’t. I’m stuck in this 
                        new city with no wife, no job, no 
                        music, no friends... I have 
                        nothing.

           Beat. The group processes that.

                                 ASIAN MAN
                        Yeah, well, my family is here, and 
                        they don’t want me around. 

           Ben tries to take this to heart as the Group Leader jumps in.

                        Why don’t you shift your focus? Is 
                        there anything you do like about 
                        your new body?

           Ben exhales, thinking.

           The phone beeps, and Ben looks at it -- a notification from

                        I... we were trying to have kids. 
                        The doctor saw something that 
                        concerned her, recommended I follow 
                        up with a general practitioner.

           Knock. The DOCTOR enters, sits at her desk. Ben turns away.

                                 DOCTOR
                        This was... unexpected, but we 
                        found something serious. I’m sorry, 
                        Ben, but... you have a very 
                        aggressive brain cancer.

           Past Ben and Past Kate’s faces fall, tears already coming.

                                 BEN
                        I can’t do this.

           Ben closes his eyes, and opens them to--

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           He’s back with AI Kat.

                                 AI KAT
                        Confrontation pushes us toward 
                        healing. It’s good to feel these 
                        emotions so you can move past them. 
                        The opposite of happiness isn’t 
                        despair... it’s nothing.

           Ben sighs, closes his eyes, again, opens them to--

           INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           We’re in Ben and Kat’s house. It’s warm, a bit messy. 

           We recognize some of the art from the walls of Ben’s future 
           apartment. Old history books lie about. Ben’s piano and 
           guitar also evident, an easel with a HALF-FINISHED SELF-
           PORTRAIT OF KAT.
           This is normally a happy home, but not today.

                                 PAST BEN 
                        It just doesn’t seem natural.

           Ben reads a medical pamphlet titled “REMODELING: IT DOESN’T 
           HAVE TO BE THE END”. On the cover, a silhouette with a 
           glowing light in his head. Ben appears disturbed as he reads.

                                 PAST BEN (CONT’D)
                        They’re gonna rip my thoughts out 
                        of my head? That’s... I dunno, Kat.

           Kat sits on the edge of the couch, head in her hands. Not 
           understanding her husband’s resistance.

                                 PAST BEN (CONT’D)
                        What if it doesn’t work? I... I 
                        could die.

                                 PAST KAT
                        You’re already dying, Ben.

           Ben looks hurt by that comment. Kat doesn’t look any better 
           about having just said it.

                                 PAST KAT (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, but if we’re going to 
                        talk about this... if we’re going 
                        to make a decision, we need to 
                        accept the reality of the 
                        situation.

                                 PAST BEN
                        The doctor said that alternative 
                        treatments for my type of cancer 
                        are only a year or two away. I 
                        could live that long. He said so.

                                 PAST KAT
                        “Best case scenario” was what he 
                        said. It could be as little as six 
                        months.

                                 PAST BEN
                        We could at least enjoy that time. 
                        Together. We could travel. We could 
                        do all the things we’ve always 
                        wanted to do. We could even try... 

           Ben stops himself, not wanting to sound crazy.
                                 PAST BEN (CONT’D)
                        If I do this, I have to do it now. 
                        And the chance of my consciousness 
                        surviving the procedure is only 
                        fifty percent.

                                 PAST KAT
                        Well, the chance of us having a 
                        child that has a single memory of 
                        you is close to zero.

           Kat stands, tears breaking free, overwhelmed with anxiety.

                                 PAST KAT (CONT’D)
                             (breaking down)
                        I’m sorry, Ben. I just... I can’t 
                        lose you forever. I don’t know what 
                        I’d do without you. 
                             (trying to reason)
                        And they’re practically offering 
                        this to us for free! What are the 
                        odds that they discover your cancer  
                        just in time for experimental 
                        trials? Maybe... maybe it’s a sign 
                        that you’re supposed to do this.

           Ben stands, wraps his arms around Kat, pulling her close.

                                 PAST BEN
                        I love you more than anything in 
                        this world, Kat. I’d move mountains 
                        for you. 
                             (then)
                        But I don’t want to be someone 
                        else. I want to be myself. I want 
                        to be me and I want to be with you.

                                 PAST KAT 
                        Well, which one do you want more?

           Tears stream down Ben’s face as well as he reflects on that.

                                 PAST BEN
                        What if it takes too long?

                                 PAST KAT
                        It won’t.

                                 PAST BEN
                        But what if it does?

                                 PAST KAT
                        I’ll wait forever if I have to.

           Ben pulls Kat in even tighter, closes his eyes.
                                 PAST BEN
                        I just, I don’t know if I can, Kat.

           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Eyes open. He’s back with AI Kat.

                                 BEN
                        I’m gonna get drunk.

                                 AI KAT
                        You’re already drunk judging by 
                        your speech patterns.

                                 BEN
                        More drunk then.

                                 AI KAT
                        Okay. Would you like me to go?

           Ben thinks about that for a moment.

                                 BEN
                             (soft)
                        No.

           INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           Ben wakes up, hungover. His phone beeps, notifications 
           exploding. He groans, not prepared for sunlight.

                                 BEN
                        Oh my God, shut up!

           Ben throws a pillow toward his phone, and it quiets. The 
           silence now disturbs him.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Fine, what do you want?

                                 PHONE
                        Forty new notifications from 
                        Rendezvous. 

           Ben sits up, surprised.

                                 BEN
                        What the hell is Rendezvous?

                                 PHONE
                        A dating app. You created an 
                        account last night. Said you were 
                        going to try to embrace this life.
           He grabs his phone, opening the app to see a list of matches.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t remember doing this.

           Ben scrolls through his matches, beautiful women (and men) of 
           all different races and ages.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        These people are interested in me?

           He thinks better, sets his phone down. He looks to the C.S. 
           Lewis book, the pill bottle, considering. Changes his mind--

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Kat?

           AI Kat appears.

                                 AI KAT
                        Yes, Benny-boo?

                                 BEN
                        You don’t know where she is?

                                 AI KAT
                        I do not.

                                 BEN
                        And you’ll never help me find her? 
                        And she doesn’t want to see me?

                                 AI KAT
                        I won’t. And she doesn’t.

           Ben takes that in, wanting to accept it, to try to move on.

                                 BEN
                        Tell me what to do.

                                 AI KAT
                        There’s still more confrontation to 
                        be done. Let’s see another memory.

                                 BEN
                        No. Something else. And not some 
                        ancient book or sugar pills. 

                                 AI KAT
                        Moving on takes time, and many 
                        things can help.

           AI Kat approaches, activating the phone screen to display the 
           many Rendezvous matches again.
                                 AI KAT (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps meeting new people?

           Ben looks at the matches, considering.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Ben sits across from an attractive PIERCED WOMAN (late 20s). 
           Her style is on the extreme side, even for the future. Ben 
           nurses his drink, smiling through pain. The Pierced Woman 
           senses something off.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Ben waits for a cab as an ATHLETIC WOMAN (30s) wanders down 
           the street, disappointed by a bad date.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Ben, tipsy, bags under his eyes, sits across from a WOMAN 
           about ten years younger than him (in appearance at least). 
           She stares at him lustily.

           INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and the Younger Woman make out in a stall. He stops.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry... I can’t.

           He leaves. She shrugs, fixing her dress.

           INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - NIGHT

           In the same stall, Ben now makes out more aggressively with a 
           very enthusiastic OLDER WOMAN (early 50s).

           INT. OLDER WOMAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The Older Woman stares off into the night, not exactly 
           pleased by the encounter, as Ben gathers his clothes in the 
           background.

           END MONTAGE
           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Ben, drunk, dark bags under his eyes, sits alone, eating bar 
           food (fried appetizers) and drinking his third fourth scotch. 
           No bartenders, just electronic screens to order from.

                                 ABBY (O.S.)
                        You waiting for someone?

           He turns to see ABBY (late 20s) nursing a beer. She’s spunky, 
           jaded, blunt. Something about her just glows. When her eyes 
           connect with Ben’s, she falters. He does have beautiful eyes.

                                 BEN
                             (grumbling)
                        Rendezvous date. Don’t think 
                        they’re coming though.

           She looks away from Ben, feeling palpably self-conscious.

                                 ABBY
                        Ugh... Rendezvous is the worst. It 
                        totally does not work as well as 
                        they say.

                                 BEN
                        Preaching to the choir.

           Abby laughs, still nervous. Ben notices her unease.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, no, sorry, it’s just-- 
                        you’re... you-you’re really hot.
                             (thinking)
                        Like so hot. Can I buy you a drink?

                                 BEN
                        I might be good on those.

                                 ABBY
                        One more with me? To make up for 
                        the staring.

           INT. BAR - LATER

           Abby now sits across from Ben, lot of empty glasses between 
           them. She’s still admiring him. Another drink appears in 
           front of Ben through the table. 
                                 BEN
                        So my wife is gone, not to mention 
                        that she’s past fifty by now and 
                        I’ve gotten younger, so who knows 
                        if we would even work anymore.
                             (exhales)
                        Your breakup story beat that?

           Abby grins, guarded.

                                 ABBY
                        I dunno, but it was pretty gnarly. 
                        I just... It was a fucked up 
                        situation.

           Ben looks at Abby, sympathetic to her plight.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        But, uh, tell me more about your 
                        wife.

                                 BEN
                        You don’t wanna talk about it?

                                 ABBY
                        It’s still fresh. I’m digesting.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t understand why you want to 
                        hear my sob story.

                                 ABBY
                             (genuine)
                        It helps me stop thinking about my 
                        shit. Plus, it’s weirdly nice to 
                        know someone else is going through 
                        it too.

                                 BEN
                        Alright, I tell you more, and then 
                        you gotta give me something.

                                 ABBY
                        Let’s call it a deal.

           A lightbulb goes off in Ben’s drunken head.

                                 BEN
                        Next part’s a bit of a field trip. 

                                 ABBY
                        Field trip?

                                 BEN
                        How far can these driverless cars 
                        go?
           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Ben and Abby, both drunk, in the back of a driverless car.

                                 ABBY
                        How much further is it?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                        Thirty-five minutes.

                                 ABBY
                        This is not how I pictured this 
                        night going.

           Ben’s about to respond, but he’s distracted by the CHECKPOINT 
           the car is slowing down for ahead.

                                 BEN
                        What is this?

                                 ABBY
                        We’re crossing the state line.

           His eyes go wide at the sight of POLICE OFFICERS.

                                 BEN
                        Now might be a good time to mention 
                        that it’s illegal for me to be in 
                        Illinois.

                                 ABBY
                        What?!

                                 BEN
                        What do we do?

                                 ABBY
                        Pretend you’re asleep. Don’t wake 
                        up no matter what.

                                 BEN
                        You can’t be serious.

                                 ABBY
                        Do it!

           Ben does as told, taking the extra measure to hide his neck 
           scar. The car stops next to the Officers. Abby’s window rolls 
           down.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Reason for visit?

           Abby turns on the charm.
                                 ABBY
                        Late night road trip. 

           The OFFICER, female, narrows her eyes.

                                 OFFICER
                        IDs?

           Abby grabs hers, nudges Ben--

                                 ABBY
                        Honey? Your ID?

           Ben doesn’t respond.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, he’s had a little too much 
                        to drink. Made a bit of a scene.
                             (faux-searching)
                        Where is his wallet?

           Abby hands her ID over, hoping it’s enough. The Officer 
           analyzes it.

                                 OFFICER
                        I really need to see both.

           Abby puts on a brave face, leans out of the car like she’s 
           conspiring with the Officer.

                                 ABBY
                        My husband... it’s the anniversary 
                        of his brother’s death. And every 
                        year he goes out drinking and loses 
                        his keys or his phone or his wallet 
                        and ends up taking a ride to his 
                        grave. I... it’s just something I 
                        have to let him do.

           The Officer sympathizes, handing Abby her ID back.

                                 OFFICER
                        Y’all have a good night.

           The car continues on as Abby’s window rolls up. Ben keeps his 
           eyes closed, breathing a sigh of relief.

                                 BEN
                             (soft)
                        You’re a pretty good liar.

                                 ABBY
                        I’ve had some practice.
           EXT. BEN AND KAT’S TREE - NIGHT

           Ben and Abby stand next to Ben and Kat’s tree, the one we’ve 
           seen them at in previous scenes.

                                 ABBY
                        So, this is where you strangle me 
                        and call me by your wife’s name.

                                 BEN
                        You actually think the things you 
                        say are funny, huh?

                                 ABBY
                        I can’t believe I went on a ninety 
                        minute drive with a weird depressed 
                        felon for a first date AND saved 
                        him from being arrested.

                                 BEN
                        I’m not a felon. It’s a Class-A 
                        misdemeanor. 

                                 ABBY
                        Thanks for the clarification. 
                             (looks around)
                        So... what is this place?

                                 BEN
                        This is where we spent a lot of 
                        time, me and Kat. We both grew up 
                        in this town... together. We used 
                        this as a sort of meeting spot. 

           Ben’s getting lost in the memories.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        We had our first kiss here. Got 
                        back together after our first big 
                        fight. We decided to have a baby 
                        here. This is where our important 
                        things happened.

                                 ABBY
                        And she’s still out there?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know... They wouldn’t even 
                        tell me.

           Abby walks around the tree. She stays there, staring off, 
           keeping distance between them.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s your turn now, you know? 
                             (off her silence)
                        Oh, c’mon, you’re gonna hide from 
                        me? Tell me about your guy.

                                 ABBY
                        So presumptuous. Gotta get with the 
                        times, old man.

                                 BEN
                        Sorry, your... gal?

                                 ABBY
                             (laughs)
                        He was a he.

                                 BEN
                        Was?

           Beat.

                                 ABBY
                        Is. Easier to think of him in the 
                        past tense, I guess.

           Ben smiles at Abby, maybe the first genuine smile he’s had in 
           this body. Shades of the old Ben. He gets it.

                                 BEN
                        What was he like?

                                 ABBY
                        He was... 
                             (deep breath)
                        ...a dick. Just really selfish. 
                        Always said it’s cause he was too 
                        “in his head”. More like, in 
                        someone else’s bed. Then he’d try 
                        to flip it around on me. Tell me I 
                        was too reserved. I wasn’t 
                        impulsive enough. I can be 
                        impulsive, you asshole!

           Abby lets out a sigh, feeling good to get that out. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                             (calmer)
                        You do know, you know.

                                 BEN
                        What?
                                 ABBY
                        You do know if she’s out there. If 
                        she were gone, you would feel it. 
                        She’s out there, and part of her 
                        does want you to find her.

                                 BEN
                        You can’t know that.

                                 ABBY
                        Look on the other side of the tree.

           He joins her, sees three words carved into the tree right 
           beneath the familiar “Ben + Kat”: Elk St, Galena.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Galena’s only a few hours away.

           Ben’s head is spinning.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        She knew you would come here. 

                                 BEN
                        But she detached.

                                 ABBY
                        Then why would she write this?

                                 BEN
                        Maybe... 
                             (believing it)
                        Maybe you’re right. She would want 
                        me to fight for her. She always 
                        pushed me to fight for the things I 
                        care about. She’s why I did this 
                        whole thing.

                                 ABBY
                        Then let’s go!

                                 BEN
                        Let’s? 

                                 ABBY
                        I’m coming with you.

           Abby quickly makes her way to the car. Ben stares after her a 
           beat before he gets moving. He’s really doing this.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 3. Darkness on the Edge of Town
           INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Ben and Abby stand at a ticket machine at a train station, 
           virtually empty outside of a JANITOR mopping up floors. Ben 
           watches, realizing this may be his only work option soon.

                                 BEN
                        So that’s the one thing they still 
                        have people do manually?

                                 ABBY
                             (to machine)
                        Two tickets to Galena.

           The ticket machine speaks back smoothly, artificially--

                                 MACHINE
                        That will be one hundred and 
                        seventeen dollars, please.

           Abby looks to Ben, hand outstretched. He cringes.

                                 BEN
                        Kinda broke. Kinda unemployed, 
                        remember?

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, right.

           With a shrug, Abby scans her phone against the machine. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        I can pay your way... for now.

           The machine clicks, spits out two tickets, which Abby grabs.

                                 MACHINE
                        Thank you for your purchase.

                                 BEN
                        You don’t think I’ll get caught, 
                        right? I don’t want to go to jail.

                                 ABBY
                        Just keep a low profile and you’ll 
                        be fine.

           Abby hands the ticket. Ben pulls his collar, hides his scar. 

                                 BEN
                        You don’t have to do this.
                                 ABBY
                        It’s fine. You can pay me back 
                        later.

                                 BEN
                        No, I mean... you don’t have to 
                        come with me.

                                 ABBY
                        It’ll be good for me too.

                                 BEN
                        Don’t you have work or something?

                                 ABBY
                        I can work from anywhere.

                                 BEN
                        Doing what?

                                 ABBY
                        Future shit. You wouldn’t 
                        understand.

           Ben shrugs that off.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        If I don’t go with you, I don’t 
                        trust that you’ll do this.

                                 BEN
                        Why do you care so much what I do 
                        anyway?

           Abby takes a deep breath, unsure how to best get this out.

                                 ABBY
                        Because... he gave up on me. He 
                        just threw our relationship away 
                        without a fight. And I know your 
                        wife detached and you’re supposed 
                        to respect that and all. But fuck 
                        that. She is your soulmate. She’s 
                        who you’re supposed to be with.
                             (beat)
                        He gave up on me. And I’m not 
                        letting you give up on her.

           Ben stares back.

                                 BEN
                        Okay... cool.
           INT. TRAIN - PASSENGER CABIN - NIGHT

           The train moves smoothly, the car rocking back and forth 
           peacefully. Ben looks up to the destination display above, 
           which shows the arrival times at each of the stops. 

           He scans to Galena: ETA 8:05 AM. Looks to the time: 3:17 AM. 

           As Ben leans his head against the window, he looks to Abby 
           across from him, who has her laptop in front of her, which is 
           curved and transparent.

                                 BEN
                        We should probably get some sleep.

                                 ABBY
                        Go for it. I don’t really sleep 
                        much.

                                 BEN
                        People don’t need to sleep in the 
                        future?

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, we have this new invention 
                        called “a shit ton of caffeine”.

           Ben smirks at that. Head down, he pulls his phone out. His 
           thumb hovers over the STAGES icon. Just as he’s about to open 
           it, he gets a notification on his phone: PLEASE REPORT TO THE  
           EMPLOYMENT OFFICE BY NEXT MONDAY.

           Ben frowns at that, swipes away the notification. He slides 
           his phone back in his pocket as his eyes droop shut, sleep 
           taking hold of him as darkness fills the screen.

           INT. TRAIN - PASSENGER CABIN - MORNING

           Ben’s eyes flutter awake in the blinding morning sunshine, 
           visibly struggling with his thoughts. 

                                 ABBY (O.S.)
                        I miss you too, sweetie!

           He looks out the window and sees the small but idyllic town 
           of Galena, IL shining by a small riverside. Rockwell couldn’t 
           have painted it better. The train approaches rapidly.

           Ben turns to Abby, watching her blow a kiss to a YOUNG MAN 
           via video chat, who he sees through her translucent screen.
                                 YOUNG MAN
                             (over computer)
                        You’re too much, Sarah! I don’t 
                        deserve you.
                             (sighs)
                        What are you doing today?

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, just visiting some family.

           Abby turns her laptop to the window to give the Young Man a 
           view.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Check it out. Pretty, huh?

           Ben watches with a furrowed brow, thoroughly confused. 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                             (over computer)
                        Beautiful!

           The train slows down as it nears Ben and Abby’s destination.

                                 ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.)
                        Next stop, Galena Station.

           Abby turns her attention back to the Young Man.

                                 ABBY
                        Well, this is my stop so I gotta 
                        go. Talk to you soon!

                                 YOUNG MAN
                             (over computer)
                        Have a nice weekend, babe.

           Abby x’s out of the window and the Young Man’s image 
           dissolves. She turns to Ben.

                                 ABBY
                        Morning, sunshine. Just in time.

                                 BEN
                        Uhh... what was that?

                                 ABBY
                        What was what?

                                 BEN
                        “Babe,” “visiting family,” “Sarah”? 
                                 ABBY
                        I told you I do future shit. 
                             (off Ben’s look)
                        I’m a proxy. It’s my job.

                                 BEN
                        What exactly do you do?

                                 ABBY
                        I role play as a fictional 
                        girlfriend to those in need.

                                 BEN
                        Huh? So you’re like a... a... pr--

                                 ABBY
                        A prostitute? No. It’s all digital. 
                        I text them, call them, video chat 
                        them. I help people who struggle 
                        with socializing. And no, it’s not 
                        sexual. People need someone to talk 
                        to. Someone that cares about them. 
                        And that’s me. I’m their 
                        approximation of a relationship.

           Ben just stares back. This is beyond his comprehension.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Society may look advanced to you, 
                        but a technologically advanced 
                        society is a lonely one. 
                        Everything’s automated. No one 
                        knows how to talk to each other 
                        anymore. Unemployment is down, 
                        disease is down, poverty is down... 
                        and yet suicide rates are up. 
                        That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? 
                        Because rather than try to heal 
                        people, we’ve just decided that if 
                        you don’t wanna live anymore that’s 
                        just fine... because there’s a 
                        hundred dead people who would be 
                        happy to take your body.

           Ben nods, trying to digest that.

                                 BEN
                        And you don’t find that this job 
                        interferes with your own relation--
                             (off Abby’s furrowed brow)
                        Sorry, I’m not trying to sound 
                        judgmental.

                                 ABBY
                        You think what I do is weird. I get 
                        it. It’s cool.
           The train comes to a stop and the doors open. As Abby stands--

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        But I have a counseling degree and 
                        I’m cheaper than a psychiatrist. 

           Ben shrugs as he gets up and follows her.

           EXT. GALENA - MAIN STREET - DAY

           Ben and Abby walk down main street Galena, passing old-timey 
           storefronts and brownstones. The town’s a real gem from 
           another era. Abby navigates them via the map on her phone.

                                 ABBY
                        Elk Street’s just a few blocks up.

           Ben nods. As usual, he feels the stares and smiles coming 
           from all the TOWNSPEOPLE he passes, just from merely 
           existing. Abby notices his discomfort.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        You’re hot now. Get used to it.

           EXT. GALENA - ELK STREET - DAY

           Abby and Ben round a corner in the more secluded area of 
           town. Ben looks up to the street sign, confirming that it is 
           “Elk Street” after all.

           He looks to see a row of seemingly endless houses.

                                 BEN
                        She couldn’t have written down a 
                        house number?

                                 ABBY
                        Let’s get to knocking.

           EXT. PORCH - DAY

           Ben and Abby stand on the porch of the first house. Ben takes 
           a deep breath as he knocks. After a second, he hears the 
           sound of footsteps. As the door opens, we focus on Ben. 

           Ben speaks to the YOUNG WOMAN who answered, just out of our 
           sight line.

                                 BEN
                        Look, this is going to sound weird, 
                        but is there any chance...
           ANOTHER DOOR opens, a new NEIGHBOR now in front of Ben. Ben’s 
           conversation from the previous shot carries over--

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...you know a woman who lives here, 
                        or maybe used to live here...

           Another new neighbor opens a door, looks at Ben suspiciously.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m not sure when...

           Another door. Another neighbor.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...could’ve been anytime in the 
                        last twenty years, I guess...

           Yet another door opens. This time an ELDERLY MAN AND WOMAN 
           stand on the other side. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...goes by the name of Kat.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Sorry, young man, I don’t think 
                        I’ve ever known anyone with that 
                        name.

           As the Elderly Woman shuts the door, Ben stops her.

                                 BEN
                             (desperate)
                        Are you sure? Kat Haskins? That 
                        doesn’t ring a bell to you at all?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Kat Haskins?

           The Elderly Woman’s eyes light up with a hint of recognition.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh... you mean Katherine. Wow, I 
                        haven’t seen her in... ten years, 
                        it must’ve been.

           Ben’s breathless. The Elderly Woman turns to the Elderly Man. 

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ed, you remember Katherine, don’t 
                        you?
                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        Of course! Such a sweet young 
                        woman. 

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        And a wonderful artist, too! Used 
                        to sell her paintings in the 
                        gallery on Main Street.

           The Elderly Man, clearly in the early stages of dementia, 
           suddenly has a realization of his own. He points to Ben, 
           hands trembling.

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                             (smiling)
                        You must be Owen!

                                 BEN
                        Excuse me?

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        I can’t believe how big you’ve 
                        gotten!

           The Elderly Man grabs Ben’s bicep.

                                 ELDERLY MAN (CONT’D)
                        Strong too! What a fine young lad.

           The Elderly Woman removes her husband’s hand from Ben’s arm.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Oh, Ed, come on! This is a grown 
                        man. Owen must still be a teenager.
                             (to Ben)
                        Right?

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry. Owen?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                             (beat, confused)
                        Didn’t you say you were a friend of 
                        Katherine’s?

                                 BEN
                        I haven’t seen her in a long time.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Well, it must have been quite a 
                        long time. Owen is Katherine’s son. 

           That hits Ben like a freight train, though the Elderly Woman 
           doesn’t notice.
                                 ELDERLY WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        She and... what was his name again, 
                        that nice man? Raymond! She and 
                        Raymond were such doting parents. I 
                        was so happy for them when they 
                        became as successful as they did.

           Ben nearly hyperventilates, trying to stay calm. Abby 
           notices, places a hand on his shoulder, tries to comfort him.

                                 ABBY
                             (taking over)
                        And you have no idea where they 
                        moved?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Sorry, honey. It’s been so long. 
                             (smiles)
                        It was nice to meet you both.

                                 ABBY
                             (smiles)
                        You too.

           As the Elderly Woman shuts the door, Ben simply stares 
           forward, at nothing in particular. He breathes heavily.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Ben, it’s gonna be okay. Say it 
                        with me. It’s going... to be--

           Ben is about to burst into tears as he rips free from Abby’s 
           embrace and runs straight for the wooded clearing nearby.

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Legs on fire, Ben sprints through the dense woods recklessly. 
           Tears pouring free, mixing with sweat. He trips on himself, 
           tumbling to the ground and letting out a primal wail of pain, 
           emotional and physical. 

           He pulls his phone from his pocket.

                                 BEN
                        Why?! Why’d you do it!

           No response from the phone.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        KAT!

           AI Kat’s hologram appears in front of Ben.
                                 AI KAT
                        Ben, you appear to be having a 
                        severe emotional episode.

                                 BEN
                        You said you’d wait forever!

                                 AI KAT
                        Do you want me to alert the 
                        authorities?

                                 BEN
                        You said you couldn’t live without 
                        me!

                                 AI KAT
                        Are you a danger to yourself or 
                        others?

                                 BEN
                        I did it all for you!

                                 AI KAT
                        Ben, I do not believe that I’ll be 
                        able to address any of your claims 
                        in a way you’ll find satisfactory 
                        at this moment.

           Ben lets out a furious wail as he THROWS his phone at least 
           thirty feet. He’s pure emotion, collapsing into a sobbing 
           heap. As he squeezes his eyes shut tightly, we cut to--

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A door opens, spilling light into a dim room and revealing 
           Kat. The real, past version. She looks a mess. 

           As she walks into the room, she soon notices that it has been 
           lit with at least THIRTY CANDLES. A romantic dinner lovingly 
           set at the dining room table. 

           Ben emerges from the shadows. He and Kat stare at each other, 
           neither wanting to say anything and ruin the moment.

                                 PAST KAT
                        Ben... I’m sorry--

                                 PAST BEN
                        Stop. You don’t have anything to be 
                        sorry about. Let’s just... 
                             (holding back tears)
                        Can we just not talk about it? For 
                        one night? Pretend everything is as 
                        it should be?
           Kat smiles, nodding.

                                 PAST KAT
                        I’d like that.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER - FLASHBACK

           Ben and Kat laugh hysterically as they share food, wine, 
           jokes, stories. 

           “You’ve Really Got a Hold on Me” plays over the scene.

           At the moment, they’re not Ben and Kat, Doomed Couple. 
           They’re two teenagers in love.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER - FLASHBACK

           The song continues to play. And we’re back at our opening.

           Ben and Kat make love. Slow, passionate and real. With that 
           underlying desperation and sadness.

                                 KAT
                             (almost a whisper)
                        Don’t leave me, Ben.

                                 ABBY (PRE-LAP)
                        BEN!

           EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

           Back in the present, Ben still weeps on the ground in the 
           middle of the woods. In the distance, Abby spots him.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, thank God!

           As she reaches him, Ben sits up, still a wreck. Abby places 
           her arms around him, hugging him.

                                 BEN
                        Why didn’t she wait for me?

                                 ABBY
                        It’s been a long time, Ben.

                                 BEN
                        But... why would she want me out of 
                        her life completely? How could she 
                        never want to see me again?
                                 ABBY
                        Sometimes people do things we don’t 
                        understand. 

           Abby looks into Ben’s eyes, both of them connecting.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go ask her why.

                                 BEN
                        But how? We’re back to square one.

                                 ABBY
                        No, we’re not.

           EXT. GALENA - MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON

           The sun sets as Ben and Abby make their way to Main Street. 

                                 BEN
                        That’s the place.

           Ben points to a sign that reads “Galena Gallery”. Suddenly, 
           his hand trembles.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, my God. That’s...

           We see what Ben’s seeing. The half-finished self-portrait of 
           Kat we last saw in their home, now finished.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...that’s her.

           Abby looks, impressed by both the art and Kat’s beauty.

                                 ABBY
                             (smiles)
                        I see why you like her so much.

           They approach the window. Ben stares at the painting for a 
           moment, trying to control his emotions this time. 

           Abby looks to a note beneath the painting: “Self-Portrait in 
           Blue - Katherine Newberry, 2014.”

                                 BEN
                        Katherine Newberry?

           As Ben processes that, Abby types on her phone.

                                 ABBY
                        Found her.
                                 BEN
                        What?

           Abby turns her phone to Ben. A website that reads “Celebrate 
           Raymond and Katherine Newberry’s Vow Renewal and Fifteenth 
           Anniversary!”

           Ben takes the phone, seeing Katherine (not Kat) as she is 
           now: in her fifties, gray tinges in her hair, still radiating 
           that essence he so loves... with a new partner by her side. 

           Next to her, he gets a look at this husband of hers. This 
           Raymond. He’s thoroughly average in every way. There is a 
           sweetness about him, though Ben certainly can’t see that now.

           Beneath their picture is an address in Chatsworth. Ben looks 
           at it, hardening. He’s committed now. He’s getting her back.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Still feel like being impulsive?

                                 ABBY
                             (smiles)
                        Let’s stop them.

                                 BEN
                        Stop them? They’re already married.

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, but... so are you, right?

           Ben takes that in.

                                 BEN
                        Let’s stop ‘em.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           Colors swirl to form a woman again, this time we can make her 
           out as Kat in her 30s, her auburn hair flowing as if 
           underwater. With a burst, she dissolves into darkness.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 4. Where Do I Go From Here?

           INT. TRAIN - PASSENGER CABIN - EVENING

           Back in their private area just the two of them.

           Ben opens his eyes. Abby sits across from him, staring out at 
           the rural landscape before them. 

                                 BEN
                        Four years.
                                 ABBY
                        Until?

                                 BEN
                        That’s how long she waited to get 
                        married again.

                                 ABBY
                             (moving on)
                        So, what’s our plan when we get 
                        there?

                                 BEN
                             (distracted)
                        Four years. That’s... nothing. 

                                 ABBY
                        It’s a small town. We’ll find the 
                        party and pretend to be guests. 
                        Maybe we could wear disguises?

           Ben gives a look. They continue their separate conversations.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Got it. No disguises.

                                 BEN
                        Just long enough to switch 
                        presidents. She couldn’t even wait 
                        one presidential term for me.

                                 ABBY
                        You know what? She won’t recognize 
                        you anyway. New body and all that.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Abby? 

           Abby turns to see PETER (late 20s), thin, tall, sporting wire 
           frame glasses, at the door of their cabin. She immediately 
           looks uncomfortable. There’s something between them.

                                 ABBY
                        Peter. What are you, uh, doing 
                        here?

                                 PETER
                        Oh, work has me going out to the 
                        boonies. You know how it is.
                             (awkward)
                        So, what about you? How’s it going?

           Peter takes a step further into the cabin, noticing Ben for 
           the first time. He falters, gasps.
                                 PETER (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?

           Abby stands, pushing Peter back out of the cab.

                                 ABBY
                        Let’s talk out here.

           Ben watches through the window, puzzled, as Abby and Peter 
           have a heated conversation. Peter gestures wildly at Ben. 

           He can’t hear them, but he can tell large emotions are flying 
           around. His curiosity is captured as he watches the seemingly 
           never-ending argument.

           After a moment, Abby points down the cabin, and Peter 
           obliges, continuing on his way, shaking his head. She takes a 
           second to compose herself, then returns to Ben.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                             (acting normal)
                        So, where did we land on the 
                        disguises?

                                 BEN
                        What the hell was all that?

           Abby hesitates.

                                 ABBY
                        He’s... just a friend. Was making a 
                        big deal out of nothing. Said I’m 
                        moving on too fast. I explained the 
                        situation and also told him it’s 
                        none of his business. Honestly 
                        it’s, like, it’s no one’s decision 
                        when I get to date again.
                             (quickly)
                        And of course we’re not even 
                        dating. So it doesn’t matter.

                                 BEN
                        He seemed really angry.

           Abby wants to move on from this conversation.

                                 ABBY
                        He’s... an emotional guy.

                                 BEN
                        If there’s gonna be trouble, I need 
                        to know. I can’t get caught up in 
                        anything while I’m here or I could--
                                 ABBY
                        You could get arrested, I know! 
                        It’s gonna be fine, Ben.

           Ben scrunches his face, lets this one slide.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. Right.

           Beat. Tension diffuses as Abby’s eye is drawn to the window.

                                 ABBY
                        Wow, look at that.

           Ben turns to see the train approaching the station. Sunset is 
           in full effect, and in the distance, hot air balloons of all 
           colors and designs dot the sky. It’s magical.

           INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

           Ben and Abby sit at a bar, two of only five CUSTOMERS in the 
           place. It even has an actual BARTENDER (50s) - how quaint and 
           throwback. They both nurse drinks.

                                 ABBY
                        What are you gonna say to her?

                                 BEN
                        I have no earthly idea.
                             (acting)
                        “Hey, Kat, it’s me, your long lost 
                        love who you didn’t wait for. I’m 
                        back.”
                             (normal)
                        Too much?

                                 ABBY
                        I’d lose the Kat part. Seems like 
                        she’s pretty solidly Katherine now.

                                 BEN
                        Katherine. Sounds so foreign to me.

           The Bartender, rural politeness kicking in, jumps in--

                                 BARTENDER
                        Y’all here for the vow renewal?

           Ben and Abby are momentarily unsure what to say.

                                 ABBY
                        Yeah, of course.
                                 BARTENDER
                        They’re so wonderful, those two. 
                        Real Chatsworth royalty. Glad some 
                        out-of-towners made it. Wait, let 
                        me guess, you are...

           Ben and Abby wait, letting her fill in the blank. She points 
           to Abby.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Raymond’s... cousin’s... step-
                        daughter? 

                                 ABBY
                        Guilty-as-charged.
                             (extending hand)
                        Abby.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Abby! That’s right. Haven’t seen 
                        you since you were... God, you 
                        must’ve been five years old.

           The Bartender shakes Abby’s hand and turns to Ben. Before she 
           can guess--

                                 ABBY
                        And this is my husband... 

           Abby nudges Ben, who offers his hand.

                                 BEN
                        Ben.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Nice to meet you, Ben! I’m Susan. 
                        Katherine and Raymond are like 
                        family to me. Part of me’s jealous 
                        you two are real family to them.

           Abby forces a laugh.

                                 BEN
                        Hey, what’s up with all these hot 
                        air balloons?

                                 SUSAN
                        Abby hasn’t told you? Chatsworth 
                        has a festival every year. Kind of 
                        a big deal around here. 
                             (reverent)
                        Wait until you see Raymond’s and 
                        Katherine’s balloon. 
                                 BEN
                        Sounds lovely.

                                 SUSAN
                        Where you staying the night?

                                 BEN
                        We hadn’t thought that far ahead 
                        actually.

                                 SUSAN
                             (laughs)
                        Typical Gen Z. 

           Unprompted, Susan pours Ben another drink.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, hell, you’re staying here 
                        then. I have a room upstairs. I 
                        won’t take no for an answer.

                                 ABBY
                        That’s so kind of you.

                                 SUSAN
                        Please. It’s nothing at all.

           Susan leans on the bar, getting closer.

                                 SUSAN (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me, how long have you two 
                        been married?

           Ben and Abby share a sly grin, enjoying playing along.

           INT. TAVERN - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben and Abby lie in the small queen bed, pillows lined 
           between them to separate their sides. They face away from 
           each other.

                                 BEN
                        I can’t believe I’m going to see 
                        her tomorrow.

           For the first time (maybe because of the alcohol), Abby looks 
           unsure about all this.

                                 ABBY
                        Are you sure... this is the right 
                        thing?
                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 ABBY
                        I just mean... maybe you’re not 
                        supposed to do this.

                                 BEN
                        You’re the one who’s been 
                        encouraging me this whole time.

                                 ABBY
                        I just... You have a new body. 
                        Things are different for you now. 
                        It’s been so long. How do you know 
                        it’ll be the same?

           Ben takes a moment to answer.

                                 BEN
                        I have traveled beyond my natural 
                        lifespan into another body with the 
                        sole purpose of returning to my 
                        wife. That can’t be for nothing.

           Abby takes a breath, airing out her insecurities--

                                 ABBY
                        I think... I’m scared to see the 
                        real thing. If what you have with 
                        her is real and true and it doesn’t 
                        look like what I had, then... maybe 
                        it was all a lie.

                                 BEN
                             (gently)
                        Why won’t you tell me what 
                        happened?

           Abby shakes her head.

                                 ABBY
                        I can’t.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe I could help.

           She says nothing. Ben presses on.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Was it that guy, back on the train? 
                        Was that your ex?

           Not wanting to respond, Abby’s eyes start to water.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Abby?

                                 ABBY
                             (reluctant)
                        Kind of... he was a-a...
                             (searching for the words)
                        A former client. He started 
                        stalking me a couple months ago, 
                        insisting that our relationship was 
                        real. Maybe I even started to 
                        believe it for a second. I should 
                        never have told him my real name. I 
                        got too close.

                                 BEN
                        That’s why you came with me?

                                 ABBY
                        I thought I could get away from 
                        him, but I guess he tracked me 
                        down.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe you shouldn’t be a proxy 
                        anymore.

                                 ABBY
                        It’s not normally like that. It 
                        makes me feel good. There’s always 
                        risks with jobs like this, but I’m 
                        helping people grow, doing 
                        something that matters.

                                 BEN
                        That’s why I loved teaching.

           Abby swallows, unsettled.

                                 ABBY
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 BEN
                        Okay.

                                 ABBY
                        When you went to get the procedure 
                        done, you said you left while she 
                        was sleeping?

                                 BEN
                        Yes.
                                 ABBY
                        Did you... did you even try to say 
                        goodbye? Did you at least leave her 
                        a note?

                                 BEN
                        I did.

           Abby inhales shakily, emotional. She turns toward him.

                                 ABBY
                        What did it say?

           Trembling, Ben rolls to face Abby, less than a foot from her. 
           These words singed into his memory.

                                 BEN
                        Goodbye my sweet Kat. I made my 
                        decision. I want to be with you, 
                        whatever I have to do and whoever I 
                        have to be to make that happen. 
                        I’ll see you soon -- in the next 
                        life.

           Abby tries not to cry.

                                 ABBY
                        That’s really nice. I bet she 
                        appreciated that.

                                 BEN
                        Not enough apparently.

           Abby looks deeply into his eyes, her longing palpable. But 
           she forces herself to pull away, flipping over.

                                 ABBY
                        We should get some sleep. Big day 
                        tomorrow.

                                 BEN
                        Thought you didn’t sleep.

                                 ABBY
                        Tonight’s an exception.

           Ben turns away.

                                 BEN
                        Good night, Abby.

                                 ABBY
                        Good night, Ben.
           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE’S FARM - DAY

           An unbelievably picturesque farm. A place where you could die 
           happy. Hot air balloons are docked all around the property.

           The sun shines down on the enormous barn, which has been 
           decorated for the party, with a banner, streamers, and even a 
           temporary dance floor.

           It’s empty now, but will soon bustle with guests and waiters.

           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE’S FARM - LATER

           And now it does. Laughter and happiness abound.

           A self-driving car approaches, and out hop Ben and Abby, 
           looking stunning in their fancy clothes. Ben takes a deep 
           breath, preparing himself. Abby looks on, concerned.

                                 BEN
                        Let’s go.

           He strolls toward the barn, on a mission. She slowly follows.

           INT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE’S BARN - SAME

           Ben and Abby enter, looking around at the unfamiliar guests 
           in this beautiful venue. 

                                 BEN
                        She certainly did okay for herself, 
                        didn’t she?

                                 ABBY
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Oh, excuse me.

           Ben’s bumped into from behind, and as he turns, his breath is 
           completely taken from him, and time slows down. Because he is 
           standing in front of--

           --KATHERINE NEWBERRY. Even more stunning in person. We see 
           her from his POV, and to him she is perfect in every way. Any 
           anger that’s been building in him momentarily vanishes.

           Time resumes as Ben fumbles--

                                 BEN
                        Oh, no, it’s... It’s no problem, Ka-
                        Katherine.
                                 KATHERINE
                        Have we met? So sorry if we have.

           She subtly looks him up and down (he is rather handsome, 
           after all). Something about her a little more refined.

                                 BEN
                        No, um--

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Honey?

           Katherine turns to see RAYMOND NEWBERRY, jovial, portly, 
           larger than life in person. He radiates positivity.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Is it time?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Almost.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (smiling, to Ben)
                        We’ll have to continue this later. 
                        Excuse me.

                                 BEN
                        Of course.

           Raymond shoots a courteous smile to Ben and Abby. He and 
           Katherine head for their table at the head of the reception.

                                 ABBY
                        So that’s her?

           Ben’s fixated on her, can’t tear his eyes away.

                                 BEN
                        Yes, it is.

           Abby places an arm on Ben’s shoulder, feeling for him.

                                 ABBY
                        Let’s find a place to sit.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 5. You’ve Really Got A Hold On Me

           INT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE’S BARN - LATER

           Ben and Abby sit amongst a group of unfamiliar, mostly older 
           FACES. Wine glasses are filled with healthy pours. Ben 
           receives a notification on his phone: REMINDER - YOU HAVE 
           THREE DAYS TO CHECK IN WITH THE EMPLOYMENT OFFICE.
           Ben stares forward, where Raymond and Katherine laugh to 
           themselves at a table at the head of the room. 

           A BAND onstage plays a light rock and roll standard.

           Ben does his best to hide the seemingly impossible amount of 
           resentment building, threatening to bubble to the surface. 
           Abby notices, placing a hand on top of his.

                                 ABBY
                             (low)
                        Breathe.

           He does as requested, still simmering.

                                 BEN
                             (eyes on Raymond)
                        Who the hell does this guy think he 
                        is? I mean, just look at him. The 
                        self-satisfaction... Could he think 
                        more highly of himself? 

           Raymond’s smile grows, laughing heartily. Nothing arrogant 
           about him, but Ben is understandably in a mood.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (imitating)
                        Look at me! Look at my lavish 
                        estate! Look at my hot air balloon! 
                        Look at my beautiful wife...

           Ben gets emotional upon saying that last part, as if 
           realizing the reality of the situation for the first time. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I just... I can’t believe this. It 
                        all feels like some nightmare.

           Abby gives his hand a squeeze. Ben sighs.

           A WAITER arrives at the table, placing plates of food in 
           front of each of the ATTENDEES. The steak for Abby. The fish 
           for Ben. His face contorts upon seeing it.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (mutters)
                        Jesus, I can’t catch a break.
                             (to Abby)
                        Switch with me?

                                 ABBY
                        But I love steak.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, and I hate fish.
                                 ABBY
                        No, you hated fish. In your old 
                        life, your old body. Maybe give it 
                        a try? 

           Ben curls his lip.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be a baby. 
                             (pushy)
                        Try it.

                                 BEN
                        Fine.

           Ben shakes his head, but picks up his fork and knife. Cuts 
           into the fish and forces himself to take a bite. Within the 
           first two chews, we see his expression change. He likes it.

                                 ABBY
                        Told you. Some things are different 
                        for you now.

           Ben’s attention is grabbed by a HIGH-PITCHED DING -- fork 
           against glass. The band quiets down.

                                 RAYMOND (O.S.)
                        If I could have your attention for 
                        a moment, ladies and gentlemen. 

           Everyone in the crowd turns to look upon Ray and Katherine. 
           It’s clear that the community holds them both in extremely 
           high esteem. Raymond picks up a microphone.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to take a moment to 
                        express our gratitude to you all 
                        for being here this weekend. 
                        Spending a whole weekend 
                        celebrating us. Don’t you have 
                        anything better to do?

           Laughs throughout the room, though lacking from Ben.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        When we first got to Chatsworth all 
                        those years ago, Katherine and I... 
                        we didn’t know a soul. We just knew 
                        we needed a fresh start. I barely 
                        had a dime to my name. We had to 
                        have a courthouse wedding. 
                        Katherine said she didn’t care.

           Raymond smiles in Katherine’s direction.
                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        And I’m sure she even believed it. 

           Everyone laughs again. Raymond’s a charming guy.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        But... I knew I had a real catch in 
                        Katherine. I had the woman of my 
                        dreams. I had to do right by her. 
                        And I had to do right by our 
                        wonderful son, Owen. They deserved 
                        a beautiful life, and I was keen on 
                        providing it.

           Hints of emotion start to come through in Raymond’s voice. 
           Katherine takes his hand in hers. Ben hates the sight.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        So I got to work. And I busted my 
                        ass. But I... we couldn’t have done 
                        it without all of you. You offered 
                        us a chance out of the goodness of 
                        your hearts. You lent us a hand 
                        when we were down. You made 
                        Chatsworth our home.
                             (choked up)
                        And I’m not sure if I can ever 
                        return the favor.

           An audible “aww” from the audience. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE
                        You deserve it, Ray!

           Applause rings out at that sentiment. This is killing Ben.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Now... I know that I’ve already 
                        asked so much of you, but now I’m 
                        gonna have to submit you to just a 
                        little bit of torture.
                             (smiling)
                        Get up here, Owen!

                                 KATHERINE
                             (laughs)
                        Oh, no.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Oh yes. It’s time.

           Just beyond the tent, Ben sees a TEENAGE BOY stealthily put 
           out a secret cigarette as he rushes to the stage. 
           Thin, shoulder-length hair, too-cool-rich-kid air about him -- 
           this is OWEN NEWBERRY, Raymond and Katherine’s son.

           And Ben is startled to see how much he looks like him.

           Chatter spreads throughout the room as Owen takes the stage, 
           sitting down at the piano. And now, seeing him in this 
           musical fashion, it’s undeniable to Ben that he’s looking at 
           his own son. He visibly stops himself from making a scene.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Now, I may not have the best 
                        singing voice, but I always told 
                        you I’d throw you that big wedding 
                        one day, honey. I told you I’d get 
                        up onstage and sing our song for 
                        you, didn’t I, Katherine?

                                 KATHERINE
                             (smiling)
                        You did. I don’t remember saying 
                        you should, though.

                                 RAYMOND
                        But you didn’t say I shouldn’t, and 
                        that, my dear, was your fatal flaw! 
                             (turns to stage)
                        Owen, a one-two-three, two-two-
                        three...

           And with that, Owen launches into the opening notes of... you 
           guessed it... “You’ve Really Got A Hold On Me” by Smokey 
           Robinson.

           Ben instantly can’t believe his ears. He watches Katherine as 
           she enjoys it along with everyone else at this party. All 
           thoughts of Owen temporarily forgotten.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        I don’t like you/but I love you...

           The fact that Raymond’s voice is fairly decent only making 
           this worse. Owen smiles as he plays the song. 

           Abby squeezes Ben’s hand, trying to calm him.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                             (more confident)
                        Seems that I’m always/thinking of 
                        you...

           Ben’s grip tightens on his wine glass, nearly shattering it. 
           He’s ready to throw the glass square at Raymond’s head. To 
           expose this whole charade. Abby senses it.

                                 ABBY
                             (whispers)
                        You’ve come this far, Ben. Don’t 
                        blow it now.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Though-oh-oh/you treat me badly/I 
                        love you madly...

           Ben DOWNS his glass in a single gulp, stands abruptly. Abby 
           seizes with worry. What’s he going to do?

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        You’ve really got a hold on me.

           Ben simply CHARGES away from the scene to the bathroom door.

           Raymond passes the mic to a SINGER who takes over the vocal 
           duties. He outstretches his hand to Katherine. She takes it, 
           and they move to center stage to dance.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                             (to crowd)
                        Everybody, come on!

           They do as requested, the dance floor immediately fills.

           Abby keeps her eyes on the bathroom door, feeling Ben’s pain.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Ben SPLASHES his face with cold water, trying to come to his 
           senses. He dries his face with a fancy towel, tosses it in a 
           metal bin. He stares at himself in the mirror, the sound of 
           his song -- his and Kat’s song -- muffled through the door.

           After a moment, he paces away from the sink. We hold on the 
           sink just long enough to see Ben charge back into frame and 
           KICK THE SHIT out of the metal bin several times.

           He breathes to himself. Leaves. A moment later, a stall door 
           opens behind him, a terrified OLDER MAN peering out.

           INT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE'S BARN - LATER

           Still daylight. Ben is drinking wine again, getting 
           officially tipsy to deaden his feelings. The dance floor is 
           crowded, now everyone dancing to an upbeat country two-step 
           song. The kind of dance where you switch partners.
                                 ABBY
                        You just gonna sit around pouting 
                        all night?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know what the hell I’m 
                        doing here, Abby.

           Another sip of wine.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You were right.

                                 ABBY
                        About?

                                 BEN
                        This being a mistake. I need to get 
                        back to Milwaukee or I’m gonna lose 
                        my apartment--

                                 ABBY
                        Dance with me.

           Abby grabs Ben’s hand.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Come on.

                                 BEN
                        What’s that gonna accomplish?

           She practically yanks Ben to his feet and toward the center 
           of the dance floor, encouraging him to get into it.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What are we doing?

                                 ABBY
                        I’m trying to create a moment for 
                        you. Just... follow my lead, okay? 

           Ben is not good at the two-step, but he does his best to lead 
           Abby while learning what he’s doing. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        And get rid of the sad sack vibe. 
                        Show some confidence.

           Ben sees Katherine not far from him, radiantly beaming. Abby 
           moves them in her direction. Katherine briefly notices Ben, 
           an exchange of glances.
           Ben continues to stumble on his feet. He and Katherine are 
           close. Just as everyone switches partners... Ben misses her 
           by a few steps.

           Instead he ends up with Susan, the Bartender from the 
           previous night. Her eyes light up with recognition.

                                 SUSAN
                             (loud)
                        Ben! So good to see you again.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah... you too. Thanks for letting 
                        us crash at your place again-- 

           Susan notices Ben’s rustiness. 

                                 SUSAN
                             (chuckles)
                        You really are an out-of-towner.

           Everyone switches off again, Ben back with Abby.

                                 ABBY
                        Try this again?

                                 BEN
                        Let’s.

           Abby again moves them closer to Katherine. Everyone switches 
           off again, and this time Katherine practically glides into 
           Ben’s arms. 

           Time stops. He’s actually touching her. Holding her. 

           It almost feels unreal.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Hi there.

           Ben has to shake himself out of a daze.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Ben, was it?

           Ben’s eyes grow wide until he realizes Katherine must’ve 
           overheard Susan. Still, hearing her say his name... it’s 
           almost easy to forget about everything he’s been through.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah... yeah. 
                             (hard to say)
                        Congratulations, by the way.
                                 KATHERINE
                        Oh, why thank you. 
                             (smiling)
                        I mean... not really an 
                        accomplishment. We’ve just stayed 
                        married a while. 
                             (laughing)
                        Anyone can do it.

           Ben nods along, having to swallow the irony there.

                                 BEN
                        Well... not anyone.

           Using all his focus, Ben tries not to embarrass himself as he 
           dances, which Katherine finds charming.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Not from around here, are you?

                                 BEN
                        That obvious, huh?

           Abby dances with another partner nearby, keeping her eyes 
           steadily on Ben and Katherine.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Sorry... who are you here with?

           Before Ben can answer that, the music comes to an abrupt 
           halt. Raymond at the microphone again. Ben rolls his eyes.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Sorry, everyone. But it’s magic 
                        hour. Anyone that wants a ride 
                        should head out to the field now!

           Raymond smiles at Katherine, she returns in kind. 

                                 KATHERINE
                             (to Ben)
                        Do join us!

           Ben looks at Katherine, at her pleading eyes, the ones that 
           have always been able to talk him into just about anything. 
           That talked him into this very situation, when you really 
           think about it.

           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE'S FARM - FIELD - SUNSET

           The colorful hot air balloons sit in the summer sunset 
           awaiting their passengers.
           Raymond, Katherine, Abby, and Ben all stand in front of the 
           most magnificent of them all - Raymond and Katherine’s - just 
           as impressive as Susan described. Raymond leads each of them 
           on, bottle of wine and four glasses in his hand. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        Watch your head.

           Ben hides his nerves as he boards the basket, followed by 
           Abby. A goggle-wearing PILOT is already inside.

           Everyone onboard, Raymond jumps in himself.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Now, probably a little late to ask, 
                        but are either of you scared of 
                        heights?

           Abby shakes her head, as does Ben, but less convincingly.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                             (chuckles)
                        The wine helps with that.
                             (to Pilot)
                        Let’s do it, Chuck!

           Chuck complies, opening a propane valve unleashing an 
           impressively large flame. The balloon gently lifts off.

           INT. HOT AIR BALLOON - LATER

           The hot air balloon now flies high above the town of 
           Chatsworth. The softly undulating green hills below coupled 
           with the sea of other hot air balloons dotting the summer sky 
           provide an intoxicating image.

           Raymond and Katherine look to the sky. Abby keenly watches 
           Chuck - studying his maneuvers. Ben only looks at Katherine.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Beautiful, isn’t it?

                                 BEN
                             (eyes on Katherine)
                        Truly.

           Raymond turns back to Ben and Abby.

                                 RAYMOND
                        I’m sorry if this is awkward but...
                             (points to Abby)
                        You’re my cousin-in-law’s kid, 
                        right?
           Abby smiles, playing along as always.

                                 ABBY
                        That’s me.
                             (before Raymond can guess)
                        Abby.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Huh, I thought it was Maggie. My 
                        memory’s failing me.

           Raymond pulls out a wine opener, starts to open the bottle.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        Abby and Ben... what a beautiful 
                        couple.
                             (nudging Katherine)
                        Aren’t they a beautiful couple, 
                        honey?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Must be nice to be young.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Hey, we were young once...

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s been a while, Ray.

           Raymond pours the first glass of wine, chuckles.

                                 RAYMOND
                        That it has.

           He hands a glass of wine to Abby, then Ben.

                                 KATHERINE
                        So... what do you guys do for work?

                                 BEN
                             (pointed)
                        Oh, I’m a teacher... 
                             (then)
                        ...a professor.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Wow, at your age? What field?

                                 BEN
                        History...

           Katherine’s brow furrows.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                             (again deflecting)
                        Art history.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Handsome, young intellectual. 
                        Nothing intimidating about that.

           Raymond smiles at Ben.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Don’t mind him. He’s awkward like 
                        that.
                             (to Abby)
                        What do you do, Abby?

                                 ABBY
                        I’m a proxy.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Wow. Very cool.

           As Abby looks away, Katherine leans into Raymond.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                             (hushed)
                        What’s a proxy?

           Raymond simply shrugs.

                                 KATHERING
                             (sip of wine)
                        Well, you both seem to be doing 
                        well. Definitely better than we 
                        were doing at your age, huh, 
                        Raymond?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Uhh... yeah, putting it lightly. No 
                        direction. Our son’s the same 
                        way... probably gonna live here 
                        ‘til he’s thirty. Apple doesn’t 
                        fall far from the tree.

           Awkward. Ben tries not to glare. Abby takes a sip of wine, 
           impressed. She inadvertently lets out--

                                 ABBY
                        This is really good wine.

           Ben looks at Abby, annoyed she’s giving Raymond compliments. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        You like it? We’re just getting 
                        into the wine game. It’s 
                        challenging... but fun.
                                 BEN
                        You made this?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Cool, right?

                                 BEN
                             (sighs)
                        Rich, charming winemaker. Nothing 
                        intimidating about that.

           Raymond laughs to himself.

                                 CHUCK
                        That’s max altitude.

           Raymond puts his arm around Katherine, Ben does the same to 
           Abby to maintain the illusion. Nevertheless, there’s 
           something there between them. Abby rests her head on his 
           shoulder. It’s comforting.

                                 RAYMOND
                        That’s stunning. Let me get a photo 
                        of you two.

           He grabs Ben’s phone, using it to take a pic of Ben and Abby.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Do a kissing one.

           Ben looks uncomfortable, Abby smiles awkwardly.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, uh--

                                 KATHERINE
                        C’mon!

                                 BEN
                        ...okay.

           Ben and Abby kiss as Raymond snaps a photo.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Wait, Raymond, do it the other way. 
                        It looks nicer.

                                 RAYMOND
                             (turning the phone)
                        Whoops.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Kiss again.
           Stuck, Ben and Abby kiss again. And awkward as it may be, 
           they can’t help but like it. They look into each other’s 
           eyes, impossible to deny, until--

                                 RAYMOND
                        There we are.

           Raymond hands the phone back. Together, they all watch the 
           natural splendor in front of them. Something all the 
           holograms and self-driving cars in the world couldn’t match. 
           Ben even feels a moment of peace, albeit fleeting... his 
           problems briefly insignificant in the face of this beauty.  

           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE'S FARM - FIELD - NIGHT

           It’s night time as the hot air balloon carrying Katherine, 
           Raymond, Abby, and Ben touches down. Back to earth and all 
           its problems. Others land behind it in quick succession.

           INT. HOT AIR BALLOON - CONTINUOUS

           Raymond kisses Katherine playfully on the neck, chuckling.

                                 RAYMOND
                        I think I’m drunk.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I think so, too.

                                 RAYMOND
                        You know what that means, right?

           Katherine nods, amused. Raymond turns to Abby and Ben.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        You guys wanna go swimming?

                                 KATHERINE
                        It’s pointless to resist once he 
                        suggests it.

                                 SHERIFF (O.S.)
                        Raymond Newberry?

           The quartet turn, startled to see a SHERIFF standing nearby. 
           Ben’s immediately nervous.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Can I help you?
                                 SHERIFF
                        Very sorry to bother you on this 
                        beautiful evening, but we got a 
                        call about a possible illegal 
                        remodel who traveled into town via 
                        train.

           Ben’s breath catches in his throat. He reaches to cover his 
           scar, tries hard to not look conspicuous.

                                 RAYMOND
                        And what does that have to do with 
                        any of us?

                                 SHERIFF
                        Well, I knew you had this big 
                        event. Figured anyone coming into 
                        town would be here for this.

           Raymond stiffens, irritated at the implication. Ben is more 
           than happy to let him handle it.

                                 RAYMOND
                        If you’re suggesting looking at the 
                        IDs of each and every one of my 
                        guests, I would retort that you 
                        better come back with a warrant.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Didn’t mean to offend, Ray, but you 
                        want to play it that way, so be it.

           The Sheriff walks off, and Ben allows himself to exhale.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Now, weren’t we about to go 
                        swimming?!

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben checks himself out in the mirror. He tightly ties 
           Raymond’s way-too-big-for-him trunks around his waist, throws 
           a too big t-shirt on for extra measure. 

           He looks self-consciously at his scar. Opens the medicine 
           cabinet to find band-aids and places one carefully over it.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben comes quietly down the stairs into Raymond and 
           Katherine’s spacious, well-decorated living room. 
           Katherine’s art decorates the walls. Ben takes a moment to 
           admire it, even if he doesn’t think it belongs here.

           The reflection of the pool lights fill the room with a murky 
           blue haze. We hear laughter and splashing through the walls. 

           Before he makes it out of the room, something in the corner 
           catches Ben’s eye -- A SILVER URN. Ben scrunches his face, 
           drawn to it. Wondering if maybe... just maybe...

           He reaches the urn, picks it up to see if there’s any kind of 
           markings on it, anything that labels that he might be holding 
           the ashes of his own deceased body--

                                 OWEN (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Ben nearly DROPS the urn at the sound of that. Startled. 
           Turns to see Owen with a TEENAGE GIRL, eyes both bloodshot. 
           They hold bottles of alcohol.

                                 BEN
                        Oh... sorry I was just, looking 
                        around.

                                 OWEN
                             (droll)
                        Do you often walk through people’s 
                        living rooms and start picking up 
                        their urns?

                                 BEN
                        I wouldn’t say often, no. 
                             (again)
                        Sorry.

                                 OWEN
                        All good, man. To each their own.

           Owen looks to the Teenage Girl behind him, back to Ben.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        You never saw us.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, yeah. Of course not.
                             (setting down urn)
                        Same here. Cool?

           Owen nods. He and the Teenage Girl go upstairs, giggling. Ben 
           looks after them, wishing he could say more to Owen.

           EXT. POOL - NIGHT

           Ben makes it outside, where Raymond, Abby, and a few other 
           PARTYGOERS swim and loudly converse. All drunker than Ben.
                                 ABBY
                             (slurring)
                        There you are!

           Ben turns to Abby, seeing her in her swimsuit at the edge of 
           the pool. For the first time realizing how truly beautiful 
           she is. 

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Get in!

           Ben takes his shirt off, gets in the water.

                                 RAYMOND
                             (chuckles)
                        Jesus, I need to get back to the 
                        gym. What the hell is your workout 
                        regimen?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t really exercise.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Yeah... okay.

           POP! The sound of a champagne bottle opening.

                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Who wants champagne?!

                                 ABBY
                        Champagne!

           They all turn to see Katherine with the overflowing bottle. 
           Looking at her, Ben remembers how infectious and full of life 
           his wife always was. 

           Raymond swims up to her, taking the champagne bottle from her 
           hands and drinking directly from it.

                                 RAYMOND
                             (slurring)
                        How’d you know I wanted champagne? 
                        You’re a genius!
                             (to Ben)
                        Did you know she’s a genius? I 
                        can’t believe I’m finally wifing 
                        her up.

           Ben’s ears perk up at that. “Finally?”

                                 KATHERINE
                        Raymond!
                                 RAYMOND
                        What?! They’re cool.
                             (giggling, quieter)
                        That courthouse story... it’s all 
                        crap. Truth is we just never got 
                        around to legally making it 
                        official. That’s why this weekend’s 
                        so special.

           Raymond sees Katherine’s annoyed, changes his tune. The words 
           are heavy on Ben’s mind.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                             (to Katherine)
                        Fine, I’ll change the topic! What 
                        was I saying? Oh yeah... how you’re 
                        a genius.
                             (to Ben and Abby)
                        You guys see all that art in our 
                        living room -- pretty nice, huh?!
                             (points to Katherine)
                        It’s all her! All of it! She’s 
                        brilliant.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (rolls her eyes)
                        Brilliant’s a bit of a stretch, 
                        Raymond.

                                 RAYMOND
                        No, it isn’t! Don’t undersell 
                        yourself, sweetie.

           Another swig of champagne. He passes the bottle to Abby.

                                 ABBY
                             (blurts)
                        Ben’s a musician!

           Katherine perks up at that information. Abby comes from 
           behind Ben, putting her arms around him and resting her head 
           on his shoulder. 

                                 RAYMOND
                        That right? Whatcha play, maestro?

                                 BEN
                        Oh... I don’t really play anymore. 
                        I certainly wouldn’t say maestro--

                                 RAYMOND
                        Owen wants to be a musician. I want 
                        to support it, it’s just... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAYMOND (CONT'D)
                        I don’t know any musicians that 
                        ever made enough money to live on.

                                 BEN
                             (looking at Katherine)
                        Huh, I wonder where Owen inherited 
                        his musical abilities. 
                             (to Raymond)
                        I guess I don’t know any successful 
                        musicians, either... probably why I 
                        went the teaching route. Or maybe 
                        it was because my parents never 
                        supported me. Who knows?

           Raymond scrunches his face, wondering if that was supposed to 
           be a burn. “What’s the deal, man?”

                                 KATHERINE
                        Teaching’s still creative though.

           Raymond shakes it off. The bottle makes its way to Ben. He 
           takes a swig. Feeling more bold.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, yeah you’re right. I mean... 
                        I am grateful for what I do. I’m 
                        shaping young minds. I’m doing 
                        something that matters.

           Ben looks directly at Katherine as he says the words, 
           practically begging her to remember her own words. She 
           does... and we can see she’s wondering now. A moment between 
           them that no one else notices, until it’s broken by--

                                 ABBY
                        I don’t feel so good.

           Abby quickly swims to the edge of the pool, leans over it, 
           and throws up on the ground.

                                 RAYMOND
                        You okay over there?

                                 ABBY
                             (wipes mouth)
                        Yeah, yeah... just not used to this 
                        much drinking. But I’m fine--

           Abby throws up again. Embarrassed.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (”please go”)
                        You should probably take her 
                        inside.
                                 RAYMOND
                        You guys can just stay in the guest 
                        room tonight.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

           As Ben swims away, Katherine notices Ben’s band-aid has come 
           undone, exposing the REMODELING SCAR on the back of his neck. 

           She’s doing everything she can not to freak out. Raymond 
           doesn’t notice. He swims closer, putting his arms around her.

           As Ben helps Abby out of the pool, Raymond calls after them--

                                 RAYMOND
                        Get your ass back here quick, Ben!

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Abby lays on the bed, still loopy but mostly in control. Ben 
           holds a glass as she gargles mouthwash.

                                 BEN
                        Okay, spit.

           Abby spits the mouthwash into the glass. Closes her eyes as 
           she turns to her side.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ben looks in the mirror, staring at his reflection. He takes 
           a deep breath.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben walks out of the bathroom through the darkened bedroom. 
           As he passes the bed, Abby gently grabs his arm--

                                 ABBY
                             (sleepy)
                        Don’t go.

           Ben sits down next to her on the bed, brushes her hair behind 
           her ear. He looks at her for a moment, feeling protective. 
           Feeling better even.

                                 BEN
                        You need to get some rest.

           As Ben tries to get up--
                                 ABBY
                        Ben... ?

                                 BEN
                        Yes, Abby?

           Ben turns back to Abby just as she lunges at him, KISSING HIM 
           PASSIONATELY. 

           He’s completely caught-off-guard... but he reciprocates. 
           She’s a beautiful woman and for a brief moment, it feels 
           good. It feels right. Things escalate quickly.

           But then he remembers Katherine. And it doesn’t help that 
           they’ve both had so much to drink. He pulls away. They just 
           stare at each other.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think this is a good idea.

                                 ABBY
                        I... I know. 

           He sighs, frustrated. Mad at Abby, but mostly mad at himself.

                                 BEN
                        Why would you do that?

                                 ABBY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 BEN
                        You encouraged this. And now you 
                        kiss me?

                                 ABBY
                        I’m sorry. I just don’t... want to 
                        lose you to her. I thought-- I 
                        thought there was something here.

                                 BEN
                             (lashing out)
                        I know you pretend to be in a bunch 
                        of relationships, but this isn’t 
                        one of them. You’re not my proxy. 
                        And you know what, maybe that’s why 
                        you couldn’t have a real 
                        relationship of your own.

                                 ABBY
                        That’s not...

                                 BEN
                        Just... go to bed.
           Ben gets up, paces out of the room, already regretful. He 
           shuts the door behind him. Alone in the dark, Abby tears up.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 6. How Deep Is Your Love?

           EXT. POOL - NIGHT

           Ben approaches the pool, where Katherine now sits alone, feet 
           dangling in the water.

                                 BEN
                        Where is everyone? Where’s Raymond?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Pulled an Abby. Is it too soon to 
                        say that?

           Ben sits, putting his feet in the water too. 

                                 BEN
                        I won’t tell if you don’t.

           The bright lights from the house reflect off the pool, 
           casting shadows on Ben and Katherine as they sit in silence.

           Ben prepares himself for the big reveal, but before he can--

                                 KATHERINE
                             (teary-eyed)
                        Is it really you?

           Ben looks deep into her eyes, and the moment seems to last 
           forever. He gives a slight nod, looks away.

                                 BEN
                        I was wondering when you would 
                        figure it out.

           A sob bursts out of Katherine.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Oh, God.

           They both sit with the revelation for a moment. Ben breaks 
           the silence with--

                                 BEN
                        You said you’d wait forever, Kat.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Ben... I... I know that I owe you 
                        an explanation.
                                 BEN
                        Forever. That’s what you said. It’s 
                        why I did this.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Let me... let me tell you what 
                        happened. I need to know you 
                        understand.

                                 BEN
                        Well, right now, I’m not sure I’m 
                        going to.

           Katherine takes a deep breath, calming herself. And just as 
           she opens her mouth to speak, we--

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - 2009 - MONTAGE

           Kat sleeps soundly, arm hanging over the edge of the bed. 

           As she turns to her other side, she moves to put her arm 
           around Ben, startling awake to see he’s not there.

           Kat blinks herself out of sleep. In Ben’s place, she simply 
           finds a note and a CD labeled “For Kat”. Her eyes blink in 
           horror as she realizes where he’s gone. She grabs desperately 
           at her cell phone, dialing a number. 

           She speaks into the phone MOS, her emotion rising with each 
           passing second. She throws it down, collapsing into tears.

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING - MONTAGE

           Kat wakes, despondent. A box with Ben’s silver urn by her. 
           She dials a number on her phone, her face falls further at 
           what she hears, and she hangs up.

           She gets out of bed and places Ben’s CD in a CD player. 
           Pushes play.

           Another day. Another disappointing call. Ben’s urn nearby.

           Nightfall. She lays in bed awake, unable to move.

           Morning. She looks at her phone. Headline: “With Record Low 
           Successes, Will The Remodel Program Be Shut Down?” Despair 
           fills her face.
           INT. BATHROOM - MONTAGE

           Kat looks at a pregnancy test, unable to believe what she is 
           seeing. She breaks into a sob.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - MONTAGE

           Apathetic to everything around her, Kat pushes a grocery cart 
           through the produce section. A PRODUCE EMPLOYEE carefully 
           stacks apples into a perfect pyramid nearby. She grabs one, 
           no care for his work.

           As she walks down the aisle, the Employee watches her, 
           smiling, and we see that it is a YOUNGER RAYMOND.

           Another day. Kat’s belly is growing. She walks through the 
           produce again. This time Raymond gets the nerve to hand her 
           an apple, telling her about it MOS. She forces a smile.

           Another day. Kat’s in her third trimester. Raymond meets her 
           at the edge of the produce section, a basket of various 
           fruits ready for her. She looks oddly at him, unsure why he’s 
           taken an interest in her.

           INT. BEDROOM - MONTAGE

           Kat hangs up another disappointing phone call. Her belly 
           about to burst at this point. She hoists herself out of bed, 
           distraught to be going through this on her own. Discarded 
           paintings litter the floor around her.

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - MONTAGE

           Raymond helps Kat to her car, talking awkwardly MOS. Kat 
           allows herself a small smile as she thanks him.

           INT. BEDROOM - MONTAGE

           Kat alone, sleep-deprived, BABY OWEN screams his head off 
           near her. She looks at a photo of Ben, tears fill her eyes.

           She gets up and turns the CD player on, the music melding 
           with Owen’s cries.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - MONTAGE

           Raymond perfects another pyramid of oranges. His smile nearly 
           bursts out of his face when he sees Kat approaching. This is 
           the first time he’s seen baby Owen, and he is smitten.
           Kat can’t help but soften when she sees Raymond interacting 
           with Owen.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MONTAGE

           Owen’s older now, crawling around the floor. 

           Kat sits in front of a painting, suddenly furious at it. She 
           can’t look at it anymore, and she smashes it to the ground.

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - MONTAGE

           Raymond carries Owen as Kat pushes her cart to her car. She 
           smiles watching them together.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MONTAGE

           Kat and Raymond sit on the couch, watching a toddler Owen run 
           around the room. Raymond gestures to the nearby photo of Ben, 
           but Kat shakes her head, not wanting to talk about it.

           Nighttime. Owen lies asleep in Raymond’s arms. Kat holds the 
           photo of Ben, talks animatedly about him MOS. Tears stream, 
           but it’s clearly cathartic. Raymond nods sympathetically.

           EXT. PARK - MONTAGE

           Raymond and Kat lay on a blanket in a park, watching hot air 
           balloons in the distance. Raymond blathers excitedly, 
           pointing at nearby farmland. Kat giggles at his enthusiasm.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MONTAGE

           Raymond sits as Kat paints him. She’s a master to watch, her 
           brushstrokes finding the exact right pattern to follow.

           INT. PARK - MONTAGE

           Raymond, Kat and Owen back at the park. Kat sets Owen down, 
           only to turn and find Raymond on one knee. Tears in both 
           their eyes. Kat’s hesitation gives way. She nods and Raymond 
           ties a small string around her finger, one that will be 
           replaced by something far more expensive in the near future.
           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - MONTAGE

           Katherine speaks to a RECEPTIONIST, teary-eyed as she fills 
           out forms to officially DETACH herself from Ben.

           EXT. ELK STREET - MONTAGE

           Katherine, Raymond, and Owen move into a house on Elk Street, 
           waving across the street to the Elderly Woman and Man that 
           Ben and Abby spoke to.

           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE’S FARM - MONTAGE

           Katherine, Raymond, and a seven-year-old Owen look at their 
           empty farm for the first time, full of possibility. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. POOL - SAME

           Ben sits with that for a long beat, processing it all.

                                 KATHERINE
                        I didn’t mean for it to happen, 
                        Ben. It just did. 

           Ben’s completely lost in thought.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I was so alone and so depressed, 
                        and Raymond, he...

                                 BEN
                        Does Owen know?

           Katherine stares back, unable to answer, which tells Ben 
           everything he needs to know.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Kat.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (inhaling)
                        You don’t know how many times I’ve 
                        tried to tell him. I just... it 
                        would be like losing you all over 
                        again. 
                             (holding back tears)
                        It was selfish of me, but... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KATHERINE (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t want him to know that one 
                        day you might be out there, and he 
                        would never know because of the 
                        choice I made to move on... the 
                        hardest choice I ever made.

                                 BEN
                        So you told him Raymond was his 
                        father?

                                 KATHERINE
                        If I was going to lie... why not at 
                        least give him the happiest lie? 
                             (breaking)
                        I’m sorry, Ben.

           Ben looks at Katherine, not wanting to see her in pain.

                                 BEN
                        God, I didn’t... 
                             (softening)
                        I can’t imagine how hard that was 
                        for you, being on your own.

           Surprised by the olive branch, Katherine places her hand on 
           Ben’s.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (teary-eyed)
                        I tried to get your remodel 
                        expedited when I found out I was 
                        pregnant, but they said they only 
                        speed them up for people who 
                        already had kids when they died. 
                        Kids that would remember them.

           Katherine is a mess now, having relived all of that. Ben 
           can’t help but want to comfort her. He’s never been able to 
           see her sad like this.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        So... do you?

                                 BEN
                        Do I what?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Understand?

           Ben takes a moment, lightly kicking his feet in the water.

                                 BEN
                        I want to be happy for you, Kat. I 
                        just... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        to wake up and hear that you... 
                        that you didn’t even want to see 
                        me? You have to know that nearly 
                        killed me.

           Beat. Silence. Katherine turns away, unable to hold his gaze.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What was it like, being suspended? 
                        Do you remember it at all?

                                 BEN
                        It was... like a dream. A twenty-
                        year, timeless dream. Like one of 
                        those dreams where you’re asleep 
                        for five minutes but it feels like 
                        days have passed. The kind of dream 
                        where you know you’re dreaming but 
                        can’t wake up, where the people 
                        with you... you know they’re not 
                        real, nothing but ghosts of the 
                        people that inhabit your heart. The 
                        people you just want to force 
                        yourself awake for, so you can wrap 
                        your arms around them and never let 
                        go. And I spent every moment of 
                        those twenty years with your empty 
                        reflection, thinking only of how I 
                        could get back to you, the real 
                        you, and never let go again.

           Ben is in tears himself. Katherine looks back to him. Their 
           eye contact forceful, magnetic. 

                                 KATHERINE
                             (breaking)
                        Benny-boo...

           And as if they’re being pulled to each other, their heads 
           tilt and their lips collide. Hungrily, sloppily. They’ve both 
           been waiting twenty years for this, in one way or another.

           They get up, still kissing, and make their way into the 
           poolhouse, shutting the door behind them. The lights flicker 
           off the pool, dancing on the door.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alone in the guest room, a distraught and tearful Abby looks 
           down at the poolhouse, having just witnessed that. She 
           fumbles around for her phone, unlocking it. She opens an app, 
           exhaling as she looks for a car to call.
           INT. POOLHOUSE - LATER

           Ben and Katherine lay in bed, though oddly neither one looks 
           all that happy. A long beat as they avoid eye contact and 
           process what just happened. 

                                 BEN
                        Hey, I meant to ask. The urn out 
                        there...?

           She glances at him, knows what he’s gonna say.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yeah.

                                 BEN
                        Weird.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Ben, I...
                             (emotional)
                        Oh, Jesus, what have I done?

                                 BEN
                        What? What’s wrong?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m married.

                                 BEN
                             (incredulous)
                        Yes, to me.

           Katherine gets out of bed, hastily getting dressed.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Wait, slow down. This is insane. 
                        Why are you getting so worked up?

                                 KATHERINE
                        I cheated on my husband!

                                 BEN
                        I’m your husband! You and Raymond 
                        never made things official, he said 
                        it himself. And I came all this way 
                        for you. I came back from the dead 
                        for you!

                                 KATHERINE
                        I’m celebrating fifteen years with 
                        Raymond tomorrow. That’s twice as 
                        long as you and I were even 
                        married.
                                 BEN
                        We’re still married. And we have 
                        been for almost thirty years, I 
                        just missed most of it.
                             (anger rising)
                        What are you even talking about, 
                        Kat? We’ve known each other since 
                        we were kids! We have a son. 
                        Whatever you’re going to do with 
                        Raymond tomorrow, don’t. Please. We 
                        can be together again.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What would this even look like now, 
                        Ben? You’re twenty-five years 
                        younger than me in that ridiculous 
                        male model body.

                                 BEN
                        I can’t help the way I look. I’m 
                        still the same man I was. And may I 
                        say again, I came back from the 
                        dead for you!

                                 KATHERINE
                             (emotional)
                        I told you not to leave me.

           That hits Ben like a bullet.

                                 BEN
                        You... you know what you meant by 
                        that! You wanted me to have the 
                        procedure! I wanted to wait for--

                                 KATHERINE
                        My God, you’re barely even older 
                        than your son. And what about that 
                        girl... Abby?

                                 BEN
                        What about her?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Who is she? How long have you known 
                        her?

                                 BEN
                        A few... days. She’s just a friend 
                        trying to help me out.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What kind of person who’s only 
                        known you for a few days would do 
                        all this?
           Ben grabs her arm, giving her pause.

                                 BEN
                        Kat... don’t leave. I’m here again. 
                        This was always the plan.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (turning away)
                        It’s been twenty years. Plans 
                        change. People change. And I need 
                        time to think.

                                 BEN
                        You’ve had twenty years to think.

           She pulls her arm back, gathers her remaining things.

                                 KATHERINE
                        You should go join Abby so you 
                        don’t raise suspicions.
                             (then)
                        And maybe you can find out why she 
                        really came here with you.

           And with that, Katherine opens the door softly.

           EXT. POOLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Katherine looks both ways to make sure the coast is clear 
           before quickly heading for the main house.

           INT. POOLHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben sits alone, sulking in the afterglow of finally being 
           intimate with his wife again. Not wanting to believe it all 
           went so wrong. He grabs his swimsuit from the floor.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ben sneaks quietly into the house and through the dark room. 
           But he can’t help himself stopping to look at the urn, the 
           urn which he now knows holds his old body in it. He reaches 
           out for it--

                                 OWEN (O.S.)
                        What is with you and this urn, bro?

           Ben jumps, startled to see Owen behind him.
                                 BEN
                        No, nothing, I just...
                             (thinking)
                        Who do you think that is?

                                 OWEN
                        Who do I think that is? It’s my 
                        mom’s first husband.
                             (off Ben’s surprise)
                        Yeah, my parents tell me shit. 

                                 BEN
                        Of course, yeah.
                             (then)
                        So, are you going to college this 
                        year or...?

                                 OWEN
                        College is a scam to keep poor 
                        people in debt.

                                 BEN
                        You’re not poor though.

                                 OWEN
                        Still a scam.

                                 BEN
                        Don’t underestimate the power of 
                        education. It’s important to keep 
                        learning.

                                 OWEN
                        Thanks, Mr. Rogers. But I don’t 
                        need some phony piece of paper to 
                        prove I know things.

           Ben grins.

                                 BEN
                        You have another cigarette?

           Off Owen’s knowing smile.

           EXT. POOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Owen and Ben smoke cigarettes, watching the first light of 
           twilight appearing on the horizon. 

                                 BEN
                        Wow, I haven’t had a cigarette 
                        in... God knows how long.
                                 OWEN
                        When did you start smoking? You 
                        don’t look that much older than me.

                                 BEN
                        Just feels like a long time, I 
                        guess. 

           They smoke in silence for a beat, Ben growing sentimental.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        So, you get along with your 
                        parents?

                                 OWEN
                        Yeah, sure. Feels silly to disagree 
                        with the people who made you.

                                 BEN
                        And you’ve had a good life?

           Owen looks at Ben oddly.

                                 OWEN
                        What’s it to you? 
                             (accusatory)
                        How much you had to drink, man?

                                 BEN
                        Not that much. I just... your 
                        parents seem pretty alright--

                                 RAYMOND (O.S.)
                        BEN!

           Ben instinctively throws his cigarette in the pool--

                                 OWEN
                        Hey, c’mon.

           --and turns to see Raymond charging right at him, an INTENSE 
           look in his eye.

                                 BEN
                        Raymond, what’s going on--

           BAM! Raymond swings on Ben with a powerful sucker punch to 
           the eye, sending him straight to the ground.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           Owen’s eyes bulge upon seeing his father unleashing violence.
                                 OWEN
                        Dad, what the hell?!

                                 RAYMOND
                             (to Ben)
                        Get up! I want another piece of 
                        you.

           Ben throws his hand to his eye, in pain. Behind Raymond, 
           Katherine appears in the doorway.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Raymond, stop!

                                 BEN
                        Wh-- why did you hit me?

                                 RAYMOND
                        I saw you! Don’t deny it.

                                 OWEN
                        Dad, what are you doing?!

           Raymond shoves Ben as he struggles to his feet, about to hit 
           him again until Ben PUNCHES him in the stomach, pure reflex, 
           knocking the wind out of him.

                                 BEN
                             (no idea where that came 
                              from)
                        Oh, God. Raymond, I’m sorry... I 
                        didn’t mean to.

           Katherine rushes to Raymond’s side.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Raymond, are you okay?!
                             (hand on his back)
                        Let’s get you inside. Let’s talk 
                        about this.

           Raymond backs out of her embrace, looks to Ben.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Just get your friend and get the 
                        hell out of my house. The police 
                        are already on their way. I’m 
                        guessing I found that illegal 
                        remodel they’re after.

           And with that, Raymond paces away. Katherine sets after him. 
           They disappear into the house.
                                 KATHERINE (O.S.)
                        Raymond!

                                 OWEN
                        Dude, you’re a remodel?

                                 BEN
                             (ignoring him)
                        Have you seen Abby?

                                 OWEN
                             (matter-of-fact)
                        She left like an hour ago.

                        What? Left where?

                                 OWEN
                        I don’t know, man. I’m not in 
                        charge of people’s comings and 
                        goings.

                                 BEN
                        Where the hell would she go? She’s 
                        had way too much to drink!

           Ben pulls his phone out.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Call Abby.

           His phone dials, and they hear Abby’s phone ringing. They 
           look around trying to locate the noise -- the guest room 
           window.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           He rushes over, Owen following close behind.

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben and Owen enter the bedroom. Ben finds Abby’s phone under 
           a blanket, still loudly ringing. He jabs at it.

                                 BEN
                             (pushing buttons)
                        Shut. Up.

           The phone finally quiets, closing out of the call only to 
           display a message, “No Self-Driving Cars Available in Your 
           Area.” Ben anxiously exhales.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Dammit, where did you go?

                                 PHONE

                                 BEN
                        What? No.

           A HOLOGRAM pops out of Abby’s phone. Ben stifles a gasp, 
           because standing across from them is AI ETHAN, a perfect 
           replica of Ben’s body in AI form.

                                 AI ETHAN
                        I told you, Abby, I decided to move 
                        on from this life.

                                 BEN
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 OWEN
                        Dude, isn’t that a grieving app?

           Ben nods, still processing.

                                 AI ETHAN
                        You seemed very distraught during 
                        our last interaction. Do I need to 
                        alert the authorities?

                                 OWEN
                        So why is she grieving... you?

           Ben steps closer to AI Ethan, and in this moment comes to 
           realize why it is that Abby has stayed with him on this 
           journey--

           --he is in the body of her dead husband.

                                                              FLASH OF:

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - MORNING

           We see Ethan lying motionless in bed as we did in the 
           opening, only this time we pull wide to see a sleeping ABBY 
           lying beside him.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Abby wakes, reaching her arm over to Ethan’s side of the bed 
           but feeling nothing. She sits up, looking around the empty 
           apartment, no sign of him. 

           No note. No goodbye.

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 AI ETHAN
                        Only through confrontation can we 
                        get to healing and acceptance.

                                 AI ETHAN
                        You must accept that I am gone 
                        forever.

           Ben can’t take this.

                                 BEN
                        Turn off Stages.

           AI Ethan disappears. Owen looks unsettled.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        She... she lied to me. 

                                 OWEN
                        What is going on here?

                                 BEN
                        I can’t explain right now. We need 
                        to find Abby before she does 
                        something crazy.

           Owen looks beyond Ben, out the window.

                                 OWEN
                        I think I found her.

           Ben turns around and sees in the distance a lone hot air 
           balloon taking flight into the twilight sky.

                                 BEN
                        Wh- what should we do? She doesn’t 
                        know what she’s doing!

                                 OWEN
                        I don’t know! Why are you asking 
                        me?!

                                 BEN
                        Where’s your car?!

                                 OWEN
                        I don’t drive!
                                 BEN
                        What?! You’re eighteen!

                                 OWEN
                        No one my age drives!
                             (offering)
                        We can take my dad’s truck?

           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE'S FARM - TWILIGHT

           Ben and Owen race to an OLD F-150 in the driveway. Ben 
           struggles through nerves to get the key into the lock. 

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Ben hops in the car, unlocks the door for Owen. He flicks the 
           ignition, throws the car into reverse. It feels weird for him 
           to be manning his own vehicle again.

           Owen looks out the window to the hot air balloon, now on a 
           terrifying track straight for a power line.

                                 OWEN
                        Hurry up, man!
                             (worried)
                        Is she trying to get herself 
                        killed?!

           Ben swallows, throws the truck into drive, after the hot air 
           balloon.

                                 BEN
                        I’m going as fast as I can.

           Owen stares forward, incredulous.

                                 OWEN
                        Why would she do this?!

           EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The truck reaches the highway, kicking up dust as it barrels 
           after the hot air balloon in the distance--

           --AND now following them is the Sheriff, SIRENS BLARING. Red 
           and blue lights slicing through the rural darkness.

                                 POLICE
                             (via megaphone)
                        Pull over to the side of the road!
           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           White knuckles as Ben grips the wheel. A black eye already 
           forming on his face. He looks in the rear view mirror.

                                 BEN
                        Shit. I am so fucked!

           The hot air balloon continues its dangerous path. The flame 
           grows in intensity, but it looks like Abby’s trying to pilot 
           this thing away from her doom.

                                 OWEN
                        Maybe we should pull over, man.

           Ben pays no attention. The Sheriff edges closer, feet from 
           the back of the truck.

                                 BEN
                        Goddammit, Abby!

           The hot air balloon closer, the truck pounding forward, the 
           Sheriff inches away.

                                 OWEN
                             (realizing)
                        Wait, you’re in her ex’s body!

           Ben says nothing, Owen gets it.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s fucked up, man!

                                 BEN
                        I know!
                             (looking at balloon)
                        Oh God, please!

           Ben pushes the pedal as far as he can, going nearly a hundred 
           miles an hour now.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t know... okay?! I thought 
                        she was just trying to help me.

                                 OWEN
                        Help you with what?!

           Owen watches the balloon, the crash now seeming inevitable. 
           In the mirror, the Sheriff’s lights are blinding.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        Shit!
           He looks to Ben, seemingly having another revelation.

                                 OWEN (CONT’D)
                        You and that urn... are you-- my 
                        mom’s--

                                 BEN
                        I’m your fucking dad, okay?!

           BOOM! The hot air balloon COLLIDES with the power lines, 
           unleashing a shower of sparks and setting the balloon ablaze.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        No!

           The fire spreads rapidly up the balloon. It continues to fly, 
           careening rapidly toward the earth. A small lake in its path.

           Ben switches paths, taking the truck off-road. The Sheriff 
           follows closely. 

           Ben and Owen stare at the balloon as it comes closer, hopeful 
           that it will make it before crashing to the ground.

           The moment is loaded, neither can bring themselves to address 
           what Ben just said. A more urgent problem at hand.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Abby!

           The balloon is yards away from the lake. The fire spreads 
           quickly downward, now threatening to consume the carriage.

           Seemingly at the last moment, Abby’s silhouette JUMPS from 
           the carriage into the water. The fall nearly eighty feet.

           Ben SLAMS the truck to a stop at the lake’s edge. The Sheriff 
           does the same, swerving to avoid hitting the truck.

           EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

           Ben sprints to the lake, dives in. Owen follows.

                                 SHERIFF
                             (exiting his car)
                        Stop right there!

           Ben ignores him, swimming for the spot he last saw Abby. 

           Arms on fire. Almost there. 

           He arrives and DIVES BENEATH THE SURFACE.
           EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           The water becomes blacker and blacker the further Ben goes, 
           the shape of Abby sinking beneath him. 

           Deeper. Darker. 

           Total blackness. Stillness.

           Once again, colors begins to swirl until they take up the 
           entirety of the screen.

           As they come into focus, we finally see Abby in the clear. 
           Hair floating freely behind her. A vision.

           The moment of serenity is broken when Ben’s arms grab her, 
           pulling her toward the surface.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 7. Nothing Compares 2 U

           INT. JAIL CELL - MORNING

           Despondent, Ben watches the sunlight stream through the tiny 
           window of his cell. His eyes bruised. He looks like shit.

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Haskins?

           Ben perks up, confused.

           EXT. JAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Ben and Raymond exit the jail, walking to Raymond’s truck. 
           Neither saying anything for a while, until--

                                 BEN
                        They like you around here, huh?

                                 RAYMOND
                        You could say that.

                                 BEN
                        They’re really gonna look the other 
                        way on this?

                                 RAYMOND
                        You’re in the clear. You’re now 
                        legally allowed to be in the state 
                        of Illinois.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT'D)
                        But if you don’t go to the damn 
                        employment office when you get back 
                        to Milwaukee, you’re gonna be 
                        homeless real quick.

           Raymond opens the truck door as Ben nods.

           INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Country road. Raymond drives as Ben awkwardly squirms in the 
           passenger seat. There’s still tension between them.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Sorry about your eye.

           Ben shrugs.

                                 BEN
                        It’s okay. I get it. 
                             (sighs)
                        Sorry about your balloon.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Please, don’t worry about it. 
                        They’re not... that expensive.

           Awkward silence.

                                 BEN
                        How expensive?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Best you don’t know, I think.

           Raymond exhales, ready to get something off his chest.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        I overreacted last night. I’m sorry 
                        about that. I don’t usually show my 
                        emotion like I did. But... I mean, 
                        come on.

           Ben simply nods.

                                 RAYMOND (CONT’D)
                        I always knew this day would come, 
                        you know? Everything Katherine’s 
                        told me about you... I knew you 
                        weren’t just going to give up on 
                        her whenever you came back. That’s 
                        not the Ben Haskins I’ve heard 
                        about.

                        It may sound crazy, really crazy 
                        actually, but part of me is happy 
                        to meet you. Owen... he’s just such 
                        a wonderful kid. 
                             (laughs)
                        I mean, he’s got an attitude on 
                        him, don’t get me wrong. And that 
                        hair...
                             (back on track)
                        But I knew that whoever he came 
                        from... he had to be someone great.

           Ben doesn’t want to cry in front of Raymond, wiping a tear 
           away with his shirt sleeve.

                                 BEN
                        You’re not so bad yourself, 
                        Raymond. Thank you for taking care 
                        of them.

                                 RAYMOND
                        Look, Katherine’s decision is her 
                        decision. I know what I want, but 
                        I’m not gonna force her to be with 
                        me. I need to know if I’m her 
                        second choice. I’ve always 
                        wondered. Part of me always assumed 
                        that’s why she never wanted to make 
                        things official. That she was just 
                        waiting for you to come back. Why 
                        do you think I carved our street 
                        into that tree? 

           Ben can’t hide his surprise.

                                 BEN
                        You did that?

                                 RAYMOND
                        Katherine wasn’t too happy about it 
                        when I told her. Said I took her 
                        choice away. Way I look at it is I 
                        gave it back to her.

           Ben contemplates that as the truck stops.

                                 BEN
                        Where are we?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING

           Sunlight breaks through window blinds. Two eyes blink awake.
           On the hospital bed, Abby readjusts to the waking world. Her 
           arm in a sling, her head bandaged. But she’s alive.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        Oh, thank God!

           Ben stands, rushes to Abby’s side. She looks back at him, 
           tears forming in her eyes. Embarrassed and ashamed. 

                                 ABBY
                        I’m sorry.

           Understanding, Ben wipes away Abby’s tears.

                                 BEN
                        It’s okay.

           Abby notices Ben’s eye. For what it’s worth, it could be a 
           lot worse.

                                 ABBY
                        What happened?

                                 BEN
                        Raymond throws a mean right hook is 
                        what happened.
                             (sighs)
                        He found out.

           Abby nods. A look of fear creeps onto her face.

                                 ABBY
                        How much trouble am I in?

                                 BEN
                             (sighs)
                        None.

                                 ABBY
                             (confused)
                        What... how?

                                 BEN
                        Seems he’s pretty well-liked around 
                        these parts. Police figured it was 
                        better to let this one go.
                             (annoyed)
                        He’s... an alright guy.

           Abby exhales, relieved by that at least.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        The doctors want to keep you here a 
                        couple days though.

                             (more serious)
                        What were you trying to do, Abby?

                                 ABBY
                        I just... I had to get out of 
                        there.

                                 BEN
                        Is that really all?

           Abby turns away, not wanting to address that. Her eyes teary.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I know the truth, Abby.
                             (then)
                        So, you tracked me down, I guess? 
                        Found me at that bar? 

           She can’t look at Ben. He places his hand on hers.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m a real idiot for not guessing 
                        it sooner. Guess I was too busy 
                        doing the same thing to Kat. I’ve 
                        been pretty selfish lately. And 
                        childish. And...
                             (removing his hand)
                        Maybe it’s better for you if I go.

           As Ben turns, Abby grabs his arm.

                                 ABBY
                        He never left me a note.
                             (holding back tears)
                        He never even told me he was 
                        depressed.

           That gets to Ben.

                                 BEN
                        That... that must’ve been very 
                        difficult for you.

                                 ABBY
                        He was doing all these new things. 
                        Exercising. Trying religion. 
                        Therapy.
                             (breaking)
                        I just thought he wanted to be a 
                        better person.

           Ben watches Abby, his heart breaking for her.
                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        He wasn’t... he wasn’t a good 
                        husband. But... maybe that was 
                        because he was depressed. I 
                        should’ve seen the signs. As his 
                        wife, I should’ve known.
                             (teary)
                        Maybe you’re right. I was 
                        pretending to be in so many 
                        relationships I forgot about the 
                        most important one--

                                 BEN
                        Stop that. No one else can know how 
                        another person feels. That’s not 
                        your responsibility. It was not 
                        your fault, what he did.

                                 ABBY
                        Despite all of it... I still loved 
                        him. I do love him. But...

           Abby forces herself to work through her emotions.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        I think I... care about you, too. 
                        It’s confusing... 
                             (shaking head)
                        I don’t know where my feelings for 
                        him end and you begin. 

           Feeling suddenly self-conscious, Abby turns away.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        I shouldn’t be saying this to you. 
                        It’s not... 
                             (deep breath)
                        Am I crazy? Do you care about me?

           Ben looks into Abby’s eyes deeply. He measures his response.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know... I... 
                             (fighting emotion)
                        Yes, I do. But this isn’t...

           Abby tightens her grip on Ben’s arm.

                                 ABBY
                        Is it just the ghost of him? Some 
                        remaining piece of Ethan in there? 

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know, Abby.
           A tear streaks down Abby’s cheek.

                                 ABBY
                        We can’t... can we?

                                 BEN
                        We’d never know if it was real. And 
                        it would never be healthy for you.

                                 ABBY
                        I don’t want to lose him. I don’t 
                        want to lose you.

           Ben and Abby share a look of understanding, seeing right into 
           each other.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t want to lose you either. 
                             (heavy-hearted)
                        That’s why we can’t do this.

           Abby turns away from his gaze, looking out the window to the 
           Chatsworth countryside. 

                                 ABBY
                        Beautiful day, isn’t it?

           Ben nods. She’s right. 

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           The truck barrels down the highway to its next destination.

           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE'S FARM - FIELD - DAY

           Katherine is radiant watching the sunset against a beautiful 
           oak tree. Her and Raymond’s tree. Ben watches her from a 
           distance, summoning the ability to approach her.

           When he is a few feet away, Katherine senses him.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Is she going to be okay?

                                 BEN
                        Yes, thank you for asking.

           Summer breeze and crickets the only sounds for a moment.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (back toward Ben)
                        I love you, Ben.

                             (inhaling)
                        I don’t think I’ll ever love anyone 
                        like that again.
                             (through tears)
                        But my future is here.

                        I know. 
                             (hardest thing he’ll ever 
                              say)
                        And I understand.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Our life... the one we shared... it 
                        ended the day you left. I’m sorry 
                        that I made you do it.

                                 BEN
                        You didn’t make me. I was the one 
                        who went through with it. It was... 
                        what we had was perfect. I didn’t 
                        want to let it go. But...

           Ben places a hand on Katherine’s shoulder.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Are you happy here, Kat?

                                 KATHERINE
                        Yes.

                                 BEN
                        Then that’s enough for me.

           Katherine turns, falling into Ben. They hug, both in tears.

                                 KATHERINE
                        What will you do?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know.
                             (sighs)
                        I need to find a job, that’s for 
                        sure.

           Katherine laughs through her tears.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry about me, Kat. There’s 
                        a future for me out there. It’s 
                        just not the one I expected.
                                 KATHERINE
                        Abby... Do you... Is she part of 
                        that future?

                                 BEN
                        It’s one of those things that can’t 
                        be. Like you and me.

           Ben looks out to the sunset. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be okay. It’s a fresh start. 
                        Just know that, right now, I’m 
                        grateful to be here at all.
                             (heavy sigh)
                        But there’s one last thing I need 
                        you to do with me.

           ONSCREEN TEXT: 8. Real Love

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Abby, dressed in her regular clothes, sits on the edge of the 
           bed, completing paperwork. A light knock at the door startles 
           her and she looks up to see--

           --Katherine standing shyly in the doorway.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Wasn’t sure if you’d still be here.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m here.

           Beat.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Figured we should do that cliché 
                        thing where we get together and 
                        discuss this man of ours, huh?

           Abby cracks a small smile at that.

                                 ABBY
                        If we have to.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Look, Abby, it may seem like we 
                        should be at odds here, but the 
                        truth is I feel a kinship with you.

           Abby’s surprised to hear this.
                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I know exactly what you’re going 
                        through. Ben told me about... well, 
                        I just want you to know that it’s 
                        not any easier even if you know why 
                        they did it.

                                 ABBY
                        What was it like for you?

                                 KATHERINE
                        It was a dark time. I had a lot of 
                        people telling me how to feel, that 
                        I was lucky because I would see him 
                        again one day. They said it would 
                        get easier. I don’t know if that’s 
                        true or not. I know the pain never 
                        went away. But at some point, I got 
                        used to it. And I was able to move 
                        on.

                                 ABBY
                        But you did get to see Ben again. 
                        I’ll never see Ethan. Not really.

                                 KATHERINE
                        No, you won’t. And I know how hard 
                        this is to think about, but you 
                        will get used to that. You will 
                        come to accept that reality, and... 
                        I really want you to hear this, 
                        Abby--

           Katherine crosses the room to get closer to Abby.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        --you will be okay. I know it’s 
                        hard to hear, and God, I hated 
                        everyone who said it to me. But you 
                        should hear it. Because it’s true.

           Abby’s going to cry, but tries to hold it back nonetheless.

                                 ABBY
                        I just... we were a partnership. A 
                        broken one, yeah, but a partnership 
                        still. I feel so helpless and 
                        stupid and naive saying it, but I 
                        don’t know who I am now.
                             (sad laugh)
                        And what the hell am I supposed to 
                        do about Ben? I think I... oh God, 
                        I can’t even say it.

                                 KATHERINE
                        Abby... could you ever look at Ben 
                        and really, truly not see Ethan?
           Abby slowly brings herself to shake her head.

                                 KATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        There’s only one person you need to 
                        worry about now, and that’s you.

           Abby nods, knowing that’s the only real truth she’s going to 
           find today.

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

           Abby returns home to the same studio apartment where we last 
           saw Ethan. She takes a couple steps forward before stopping, 
           something catching her eye--

           --a NOTE sitting on the floor marked “Abby”. She’s emotional 
           as she picks it up. As she starts to read--

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        Dear Abby, I thought it might be 
                        nice for me to leave you a note 
                        letting you know where I’m going.

           Abby stifles a sob, again smiling through her sadness.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

           Ben walks down the street casually, enjoying the sunshine and 
           returning the smiles from people around him.

           He stops in front of the remodel clinic, looks at it sadly. 
           Is he going to go inside?

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry I can’t give you the 
                        answers you’re looking for. I’m 
                        sorry you’ll never know why he did 
                        it. I can’t imagine what that’s 
                        like. Sometimes we have to make our 
                        peace with not knowing.

           EXT. RAYMOND AND KATHERINE’S FARM - DAY

           Raymond and Katherine gaze at each other, deeply in love.

                                 KATHERINE
                             (whispers)
                        You’ve never been my second choice.

           Raymond looks like he just heard the six words he thought he 
           would never hear from Katherine.
           REVEAL they’re standing by their tree, finally making it 
           official.

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        But I can tell you without a doubt 
                        that I love you. And if what I feel 
                        inside is true, so did he.

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - SAME

           Abby continues reading, sitting on the bed now.

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        As for me, I’m still trying to 
                        figure out my place in this world.

           EXT. BEN AND KAT'S TREE - SAME

           Ben slowly unscrews the cap of his urn. Katherine approaches, 
           grabbing it with him. Together, they scatter the ashes of his 
           old life over the spot that once meant so much to them both.

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        And I think I’m getting there.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - SAME

           Back with Ben, looking up at the clinic.

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        There’s just a few things I need to 
                        take care of first.

           With a smile, he moves on, continuing down the street.

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - SAME

           Abby continues reading.

                                 BEN (V.O.)
                        I’ll miss you, Abby. Maybe I’ll see 
                        you again -- in the next life.

           She sets the note down, looking at her phone. She navigates 
           to Stages and opens it.

           AI Ethan appears, and they make eye contact. She sighs, ready 
           to face her grief head on.
           INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           Owen leans against a column, duffel bag on his shoulder, 
           guitar case at his side. 

                                 OWEN
                        Finally. I thought we were gonna 
                        miss the train.

           REVEAL Ben approaching. Also carrying a large travel bag. 

                                 BEN
                        Relax. We have the whole summer 
                        ‘til my job starts up.

                                 OWEN
                        School janitor. I dig it, man.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah... it’s something to do while 
                        I brush up on the events of the 
                        last two decades.

                                 OWEN
                        Hey... show some respect for the 
                        service industry. It’s not a bad 
                        gig, Dad.

           Owen laughs at the D-word, pulls out a cigarette, lights it.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe we don’t call me “dad” in 
                        public. It’s a little weird.

                                 OWEN
                        That’s why it’s funny. I believe it 
                        was you who once said “I’m your 
                        fucking dad, okay?”
                             (smiles)
                        Excellent way to deliver the news, 
                        by the way.

           Ben grabs Owen’s cigarette out of his hand.

                                 BEN
                        We’re way too far in the future for 
                        you to still be smoking. 
                             (takes a drag)
                        And what kind of a dad would I be 
                        if I let you smoke?

           Ben tosses the cigarette to the ground, stomps it out. Owen 
           can’t help but smile at him saying “dad”.

                                 OWEN
                        You said not to say that in public.
           Ben smiles back as a train pulls into the station, blowing 
           their hair into their faces. The train doors whoosh open.

                                 BEN
                        I guess it’s alright.
                             (changing)
                        You still mad at your parents?

                                 OWEN
                        Nah. How the hell were they 
                        supposed to tell me this crazy ass 
                        story anyway?
                             (then)
                        Where’s your axe? Mom tells me you 
                        play a mean guitar. Was hoping we 
                        could jam together.

                                 BEN
                        Oh... kinda left that in my last 
                        life, I guess. Haven’t taught 
                        myself how to play left-handed yet.

           Owen smirks at that.

                                 OWEN
                        I’m left-handed... I could teach 
                        you.

           Ben smiles back.

                                 BEN
                        I’d like that.

           Owen steps on the train. Ben follows, removes a pill bottle 
           from his bag. Takes out two serotonin pills, washes them down 
           with a gulp of water, committing to doing it right this time.

           For just a second, Ben’s original body appears, sitting next 
           to Owen... like he should’ve been able to. It’s too late for 
           that. But they still have now.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You ready?

           Owen smiles, nods as the train doors close.

           And with that, the train LAUNCHES into the sunrise. Into an 
           uncertain, unpredictable future. A future that’s going to 
           mercilessly throw all it has got right back in your face.

           A future that Ben is going to embrace.

                                                               THE END.
