           EXT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Outside an ornate suburban South London home, cars parked as
           far as the eye can see, PARTY GOERS coming and going. 

           INSERT TITLE: WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND. 1970. 

           INT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A nearly bare room. Bed in the corner. Small framed
           needlepoint of a ballerina hanging on the wall. 

           SHARON ARDEN (17) stands in an expensive party dress before
           a mirror propped on top of a bureau. She looks at herself,
           doesn't like what she sees - short, overweight, giant breasts,
           curly hair. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        You think you know my story...

           Sharon removes a gold Star of David necklace from her neck
           and replaces it with a cross. She then adds more jewels -
           bright and shiny to compensate for her lack of confidence.

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The Prince of Darkness and his oddball
                        family... 

           She presses down her curls, but they keep popping up.  

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But I can promise you one thing,
                        darling: you don't know shit.   

           Sharon grabs a boa, wraps it around her neck, and exits.

           INT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Sharon pours expensive champagne into a tray filled with
           flutes while her brother DAVID (19), thin and blonde, always
           wears a clownish smile, stuffs his face with pigs in a blanket
           and stares at a YOUNG COUPLE making out on the other side of
           the kitchen.   

                                 SHARON
                        Perhaps instead of staring you could
                        make yourself useful. 

           She hands David the tray of flutes. He downs a glass of
           bubbly, burps, then sets the tray aside on the counter. 

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks for that. 
           Sharon rolls her eyes, grabs the tray and heads out of the
           kitchen.

                                 SHARON
                        I hate you.

           LIVING ROOM

           Sharon enters a party packed with a blend of ARTISTS and
           ROCKERS and GRIM FACED MOBSTERS.

           CLASSICAL MUSIC BLARES from a record player set beside a
           YOUNG MAN dressed as a maestro "conducting" his orchestra to
           an audience of one - himself - reflected in a window at the
           front of the house.  

           A wall on the opposite side of the room silently projects
           James Cagney in "Public Enemy."

           Sharon revels in her role as host, distributing the champagne
           from guest to guest, some who respond with a quick 'ta,' a
           few with a big drunken hug and kiss, all with respect. 

           THE STUDY

           THE SMALL FACES sit at a piano leading a jam of their hit,
           "Get Yourself Together" to a group of awed, stoned PARTY
           GOERS.  

           Sharon enters. RONNIE LANE of the Small Faces greets her
           with a kiss and puff off his joint. 

           Sharon sways along a few beats before continuing through the
           room and out another door that leads to  

           A HALLWAY

           She steps into a hall and is now close to a stairwell. Makes
           sure to smile or kiss everyone she passes before heading
           upstairs. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT

           DON ARDEN (50s) holds court behind a massive mahogany desk.
           Immaculately dressed in a gray suit with silver hair, cigar
           rolling between his teeth, gold ring wound tight around his
           pinkie, Don is the boss and he knows it.  

           Don's got two HEAVIES straight out of central casting sitting
           on a couch to his side. 

           Across from Don sits music manager ROBERT STIGWOOD (30s),
           thin and pale with nervous eyes.

           Don sets his cigar in the ashtray and looks to his thugs,
           who stand. 
                                 DON
                        There's two ways this is gonna go.
                        One, you're gonna turn your arse
                        around, walk down those stairs,
                        interrupt the Faces from their good
                        time and explain that your services
                        aren't available now or ever after.
                        Or two, I'm going to throw you out
                        this window. Which way do you want
                        to have it? 

                                 ROBERT STIGWOOD
                        Don, come on. You're not... There's
                        two hundred people down-- 

           Don suddenly lunges forward, grabs Stigwood by the collar
           and slams his face onto the desk. He holds it down and gets
           real close. 

                                 DON
                        You're quite right, Bob. I'm not
                        gonna lay a finger on ya. But me
                        boys...  

           The heavies grab a squirming Stigwood, drag him over to the
           window and slide it open. 

                                 ROBERT STIGWOOD
                        Don. Don, stop. Don't do this! 

           The heavies lift Stigwood off his feet and hang him upside
           down out of the window. 

                                 ROBERT STIGWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Don, don't! Don! 

                                 DON
                        What's it going to be, Bob? Do you
                        want to steal my band from me or
                        not? 

           Sharon enters the office, nonplussed by the scene. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                            (to Sharon)
                        Oh, hello, luv. 

                                 SHARON
                        Sorry. Didn't know you were workin'.

           She turns to leave. 

                                 DON
                        Grab my cigar, would you? 

                                 SHARON
                        Sure, da.
           Sharon retrieves Don's cigar and brings it over to him.  

                                 DON
                            (re: Stigwood)
                        Now put it out on his eye. 

                                 SHARON
                        Oh, uh... Not sure I should really--

                                 DON
                        Don't stammer. Just do it. 

                                 SHARON
                        On his eye or in it? 

                                 DON
                        Do you think it makes a difference? 

           Sharon considers the cigar and the task at hand. She glances
           down at Stigwood, his eyes pleading for mercy. 

                                 ROBERT STIGWOOD
                        Sharon, please. You don't have to do
                        this. 

                                 SHARON
                        Sorry, Mr. Stigwood. 

           Sharon leans the cigar down to Stigwood's eye. 

                                 ROBERT STIGWOOD
                        Okay! Okay. The Faces are yours! The
                        Faces are yours. 

           Don smiles and taps his heavies, who pull Stigwood back inside
           the office. Stigwood's gone white. Looks as if he's pissed
           himself. Don pats him on the cheek.

                                 DON
                            (to Stigwood)
                        Now fuck off, ya bloodsucker. 

           Stigwood scrambles out of there. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                            (to Sharon)
                        Have a puff darlin'. 

                                 SHARON
                        Thanks, Da. 

           Don does a little jig. 
                                 DON
                            (singing to himself)
                        If I were a rich man, yabba deebie
                        deebie, deebie deebie deebie deebie
                        dum...

           Sharon puffs the cigar. Exhales a huge plume of smoke and
           smiles. 

           FREEZE ON SHARON AND HER FACE OF PURE JOY.  

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        This is where my story begins. 

           INT. MARQUEE CLUB - NIGHT

           Sharon follows Don through a club that barely qualifies as a
           hole in the wall. Long-haired, angry YOUNG MEN pack the place
           shoulder to shoulder, smoke hovering above like a dank rain
           cloud. 

           Don and Sharon settle by the side of the stage. Watch as
           three unshowered members of Black Sabbath stroll onstage and
           pick up their instruments. 

           TONY IOMMI mans the guitar, BILL WARD sits behind the drum
           kit. GEEZER BUTLER wields a bass. All in their early 20s,
           each member has long hair and a droopy mustache.  

           Everything about Sabbath's presence is dark and working class.
           Very Birmingham. 

           Tony breaks into the opening riffs of "War Pigs." The crowd
           immediately perks and surges forward. 

           Sharon looks to Don - both can feel the energy.

           As Tony's guitar cedes to Bill's steady high hat, the band's
           lead singer, JOHN "OZZY" OSBOURNE (21) shuffles onto the
           stage, head down. 

           Ozzy is thin, slight and clean shaven. He's got wavy brown
           shoulder-length hair parted in the middle. Wears a plaid
           pajama top beneath a vest and hasn't got on any shoes.  

           He nervously approaches the microphone, grips it with two
           hands. Never makes eye contact with anything but the floor. 

           But then Ozzy looks up, as if possessed, eyes locked on the
           audience.  

                                 OZZY
                            (singing)
                        Gen'rals gathered in their masses,
                        Just like witches at black masses /
                        Evil minds that plot destruction, 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Sorcerer of death's construction /
                        In the fields the bodies burning, As
                        the war machine keeps turning / Death
                        and hatred to mankind, Poisoning
                        their brainwashed minds / Oh Lord
                        yeah...

           The band breaks into a heavy jam. Crowd begins to thrash.  

           ON SHARON AND DON

                                 DON
                        What the hell is this? 

                                 SHARON
                            (with a wry smile)
                        Madness. 

           FREEZE ON THE SEA OF BANGING HEADS

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I'm nineteen years old and naive
                        enough to believe the world is
                        actually mine. One day I'm discovering
                        Black Sabbath, or so I thought until
                        a couple cunts who worked for my
                        father stole them from under our
                        noses...

           INT. TOP OF THE POPS - NIGHT

           THE ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA plays its cover of "Roll Over
           Beethoven" to a DANCING CROWD on Top of The Tops. 

           Sharon's there too, but she's backstage, nodding along. Now
           nineteen, she notices a GIRL (14) looking bored at the front
           of the crowd and quickly seeks out a STAGE MANAGER. 

           She says something to the stage manager, who whispers to
           SOMEONE ELSE, who makes her way into the crowd and pulls the
           dour girl out of the audience. 

           Problem solved, Sharon begins dancing. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        The next I'm on the road managing
                        the Electric Light Orchestra. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sharon pops a bottle of champagne. Bubbly flows, but the
           guys from ELO (JEFF LYNNE, ROY WOOD, BEV BEVAN) just sit
           there looking bored. 
                                 SHARON
                        Well, come on then. You just slayed
                        the Top Of The Pops. 

                                 JEFF LYNNE
                        We leave for Berlin in seven hours.  

                                 SHARON
                        The most successful rock and rollers
                        in England and this is what you do
                        with it?  

                                 JEFF LYNNE
                        I don't know about most successful. 

                                 ROY WOOD
                        Maybe like sixth or seventh. 

           Sharon guzzles half the champagne, burps, and hurls the bottle
           against the wall, SMASHING IT. 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you for fucking real? 

           ON THE GUYS AGHAST FACES 

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Having your manager party harder
                        than you is not a good look - for
                        you or the manager.

           INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

           A bunch of TWENTYSOMETHINGS enter the bar to find Sharon
           already drunk and ready for a party. Leading the pack is
           Sharon's skinny, shaggy-haired boyfriend, ADRIAN.

           Sharon greets Adrian with a big hug and kiss, then turns to
           the BARKEEP and plunks down an American Express. 

                                 SHARON
                        Drinks on The Electric Light
                        Orchestra. 

                                 FRIENDS
                        Woo! 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        But did I give a shit? I had money,
                        I had music, a drop dead gorgeous
                        boyfriend. 

           Sharon nestles back into Adrian.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Want to come to France with me? 
           Adrian responds by lifting Sharon into the air and giving
           her a twirl.

           INT. CARLTON HOTEL CASINO - CANNES - NIGHT

           Inside a high end restaurant in a luxury Cannes casino. Sharon
           and Adrian are both dressed to the nines as they dine amongst
           the beautiful people. 

           Adrian takes Sharon's hand and kisses it. Sharon coyly looks
           away. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        I thought I'd wanted to grow up and
                        study the ballet, but instead, I'd
                        become a princess.

           The check comes. Sharon pays in cash. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        A princess who had to foot the bill,
                        but a princess nevertheless.

           Bill paid, Sharon and Adrian exit the restaurant into a

           CORRIDOR ABOVE THE CASINO 

           They walk arm in arm. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Where to next? 

                                 SHARON
                        Dad's hosting some record execs in
                        the harbor.  

           WE HEAR SEVERAL SCREAMS AND COMMOTION down in the casino. A
           bunch of people rush to the railing to check it out, as do
           Sharon and Adrian. 

           DOWN BELOW we see Don, in a silk dinner jacket and lace-up
           shoes, along with SEVERAL HEAVIES brawling with Sabbath
           manager PATRICK MEEHAN JR. and his OWN SET OF GOONS. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ. Dad? 

           Don's got Patrick beneath him and wails away. 

           Sharon rushes to the stairs to join the fray. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Sharon... Sharon! 

           DOWN IN THE CASINO
           Sharon appears and immediately spots ONE OF MEEHAN'S
           BODYGUARDS lifting a glass coffee table over his head, about
           to bring it down on Don. She hurls herself into the man,
           sending him sprawling under the weight of the coffee table.  

           By now the fight's a full on melee and Sharon is right in
           the middle of it - swinging her fists, pulling hair, biting
           legs. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        These were the fuckers who'd stolen
                        Black Sabbath years back. There wasn't
                        a chance in hell Don Arden was gonna
                        let them do it without hearing how
                        he felt about it, which meant I wasn't
                        either. 

           INT. JET RECORDS OFFICES - DAY

           Don slides legal document after legal document for Sharon to
           sign. We quickly glimpse tax forms and property deeds and
           leases to buildings. 

           Sharon reads nothing. Signs everything. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        It was so much fun that I didn't
                        think twice about my father having
                        me sign every title or tax form drawn
                        in his name. To the world he was a
                        boss, to the tax man, he didn't even
                        exist. But I sure as shit did.   

           EXT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - DAY

           Sharon argues at the front door with one REPO MAN while his
           PARTNER lifts a Rolls-Royce onto a tow truck. 

           She pushes past the first repo man to confront the other.
           Begins smacking at him, but he's having none of it and smacks
           back.

           Soon the first repo man is dragging Sharon by the hair back
           towards the house while the other finishes hauling the car. 

           INT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - DAY

           Sharon collapses to the floor. We reveal that the house is
           nearly bare except for the random rug or candle stick. 

           Don peeks his head out from a side room. 

                                 DON
                        So you let them take the car then. 

           Sharon glares at her father and storms upstairs. 
                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        Unfortunately, having cars and houses
                        taken as quickly as they came wasn't
                        enough to wake me up. 

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Sharon vomits into the toilet bowl. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        But the wake up call did arrive. 

           INT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - DON AND HOPE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A very pale and haggard Sharon staggers into the room and
           stands before her mother HOPE (40s), a once bright woman
           who's moved past sadness to numb, sitting in bed in a
           nightgown, cigarette dangling from her mouth.  

                                 HOPE
                        You have to get rid of it. 

                                 SHARON
                        Get rid of what? 

           INT. HOUSE ON AVENUE ROAD - DAY

           A living room's been converted into a waiting room. The lights
           are dim. Nearly a dozen YOUNG TEENS AND WOMEN including Sharon
           sit, faces wracked with shame and terror.  

           INT. HOUSE ON AVENUE ROAD - BEDROOM - DAY

           Once a bedroom, now a makeshift operating room. 

           A NURSE stands over Sharon, lying in a bed, screaming and
           crying. 

           A MAN'S HANDS lean towards her with an anesthetic mask and
           THE ROOM GOES WHITE. 

           INT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sharon lies in bed, sweaty, a sanitary towel soaked with
           blood tucked between her legs. 

                                 SHARON
                        Mum... Mum?!

           INT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - SHARON'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sharon remains in bed, now finally asleep, her eyes a bit
           less swelled. 

           WE HEAR A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. 
                                 SHARON
                        Mum?

           The door cracks open. It's Don. 

                                 DON
                        It's me, actually. 

           Don enters. Sharon pulls the covers over herself. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        How you gettin' on? 

                                 SHARON
                        Still breathin' I guess. 

           Don sits at the end of the bed. Rubs Sharon's feet. She
           relaxes a bit, appreciating the contact.  

                                 DON
                        Adrian pay like he promised? 

                                 SHARON
                        I know he got the money from you.

                                 DON
                        Nah... I brought you something.  

           Don pulls a beautiful diamond necklace from his pocket and
           shows it to Sharon.  

                                 SHARON
                        Oh my goodness. Dad...

                                 DON
                        Sit up.

           Sharon sits up so that Don can help put the necklace on. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Gorgeous. 

                                 SHARON
                        Thank you.

                                 DON
                        You know I've been talking to Queen
                        about taking on their management,
                        yes? 

                                 SHARON
                        Mm. I love Freddie. 

                                 DON
                        Don't we all. He's got quite the
                        appetite that one. 
                                 SHARON
                        So I've heard. 

                                 DON
                        Seems he's taken a bit of a liking
                        to Adrian. 

                                 SHARON
                        Adrian as in... my Adrian? 

                                 DON
                        He's not your Adrian anymore, now is
                        he? 

           This takes Sharon aback, but she bites her tongue. 

                                 SHARON
                        I guess not.

                                 DON
                        I want you to ask Adrian if he'll
                        give Freddie some attention.

                                 SHARON
                        Some attention? What do you mean
                        attention?  

                                 DON
                        Don't be daft, Sha. You know what it
                        means. 

                                 SHARON
                        That you want my boyfriend to suck
                        off Freddie Mercury?

                                 DON
                            (threatening)
                        That's right. Have you got a problem
                        with it? 

           Sharon looks to the floor. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Tell him I'll pay a thousand quid
                        for helpin' out.

           Sharon sinks to the point that it almost appears as though
           her spirit is leaving her body. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Queen's a big band, Sha. We all have
                        to pitch in where we can, yes?
                            (off Sharon's lack of
                             response)
                        Sharon.
                                 SHARON
                        I understand. 

           FREEZE ON YOUNG SHARON just as she notices the embroidered
           picture of the dancing ballerina hanging on her wall...

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I understood all right. I understood
                        well and good that I needed to get
                        as far away from this motherfucker
                        as possible.    

           RESUME NORMAL SPEED. Don leans over and gives Sharon a kiss
           on the head. 

                                 DON
                        Glad you're feeling better. 

           Sharon cringes at her father's touch. 

           INT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - APRIL, 1978 - NIGHT

           Another Arden party. It's now 1978, so the styles have changed
           and cocaine flows like wine, but the characters are much the
           same.  

           A pudgy, depressed looking Sharon sits on a couch in the
           corner, champagne glass in hand. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        As any girl who's been slapped around
                        a time or two can tell you, knowing
                        you have to leave and actually leaving
                        are two very different things. 

           A WOMAN crosses and says 'hello.' Sharon manages to stand,
           put on a smile and give the woman a kiss, but the smile fades
           as soon as the woman passes. 

           Sharon sits again. Notices David entertaining a trio of THREE
           YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE EIGHTEEN AT BEST. 

           She looks past David, sees FREDDIE MERCURY laughing, his arm
           around Adrian, who seems way too comfortable.  

           Sharon rises, unable to take the sight of Freddie and Adrian. 

           Navigates the crowd to a bathroom. Tries the door, but it's
           locked. She sighs and waits. 

           Moments later a WOMAN comes to the bathroom and knocks. 

                                 WOMAN
                        I got the shit. 

           The door opens and the woman slips inside, locking the door
           behind her. 
           Sharon bangs on the door. 

                                 SHARON
                        This is my house, ya cunt! 

           The door doesn't open, so Sharon turns and heads out towards
           the stairs, but decides against going up there. 

           Instead she hurries to the backyard. 

           EXT. ARDEN WIMBLEDON HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Sharon sneaks behind a pool shed, where she squats and starts
           to piss. 

           Just out of her eye line TWO GUYS (30s) stroll by sharing a
           joint. 

                                 GUY #1
                        We could do what the Meehans are
                        doing and take the company public. 

                                 GUY #2
                        The Meehans have jack shit. They're
                        a shell of a shell. 

                                 GUY #1
                        They've got Sabbath. 

                                 GUY #2
                        Until Tony finds out they've stolen
                        every royalty they've ever made. 

           Sharon's eyes perk. 

                                 GUY #2 (CONT'D)
                        Patrick's a clown, man. That is not
                        a model we want to follow. 

           The guys notice Sharon and pause. She quickly yanks up her
           pants, but trips and falls. 

                                 SHARON
                        Go ahead and laugh. I dare you. 

           The guys avert their gaze as Sharon picks herself up and
           walks off, head held high. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sharon marches past Don's office, where Don sits at his big
           desk with a PAIR OF HEAVIES. 

                                 DON
                        Hey, Sha...
                                 SHARON
                            (without stopping)
                        Not now, Don. 

           INT. SHARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sharon talks on the phone as she packs a suitcase. 

                                 SHARON
                        Don't ask any questions, darling,
                        just find out where Black Sabbath is
                        playing right now and book me a
                        ticket. 

           She hangs up. A DRUNK COUPLE tries entering the room, but
           Sharon shoves them out and closes the door. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Fuck somewhere else. 

           The phone rings. Sharon grabs it. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Yeh?

           EXT. LAX - NIGHT

           A plane lands at LAX.  

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        This is really where my story begins. 

           INT. SHARON'S MERCEDES / EXT. I-405 - NIGHT

           Still in her clothes from the party in London, Sharon speeds
           down the 405 towards the 710/Long Beach.

           EXT. LONG BEACH HYATT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Sharon screeches into the parking lot and runs out of the
           car. 

           INT. LONG BEACH HYATT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Sharon knocks on the door until it opens, revealing Sabbath's
           Tony Iommi. 

                                 TONY
                        What the fuck? 

                                 SHARON
                        I hear you're looking for new
                        management. 

                                 TONY
                        Do I even know you? 
                                 SHARON
                        Don't be an asshole. 

           Sharon brushes past Tony into the room, leaving him no choice
           but to follow.  

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Lights are on. Lines of coke are splayed on a mirror. A half-
           naked WOMAN (20s) sits bored at the table. 

           Tony paces. Sharon stands before him. 

                                 TONY
                        It's three o'clock in the bloody
                        morning. 

                                 SHARON
                            (re: the girl and the
                             coke)
                        So. You're up. 

                                 TONY
                        Not for you. 

                                 SHARON
                        Patrick's been ripping you off for
                        years and you know it and you're
                        pissed but you don't know what to do
                        because everyone in this disgusting
                        business is like Patrick so what's
                        the fucking point. 

                                 TONY
                        You're a mind reader. Congratulations.
                        You've come to demonstrate this skill
                        in the dark of night because...   

                                 SHARON
                        Fire Patrick and let me take over. 

                                 TONY
                        Take over what? 

                                 SHARON
                        Your management. Obviously, I'm
                        talkin' about your management. 

                                 TONY
                            (laughs)
                        You? Take over managing Sabbath? Ha.
                        Yeah. No. 

                                 SHARON
                        Why? Because I'm a woman? 
                                 TONY
                        Yes.

                                 SHARON
                        Sexist. 

                                 TONY
                        Well, that and your age and the fact
                        that you're cut from the same cloth
                        as your old man, who still scares
                        the shit out of me.  

                                 SHARON
                        I had no idea you were such a
                        frightened little asshole. 

           Tony snorts a line.

                                 TONY
                        Well, I am. 

           Sharon grabs Tony's right hand (which is missing a pair of
           fingertips) and holds it up. 

                                 SHARON
                        When you lost the tips of your
                        fingers, did you try to keep playing
                        the same way or did you seek out
                        something new? 

                                 TONY
                            (pulls his hand free)
                        What's my fingers got to do with the
                        price of tea in China? 

                                 SHARON
                        Jesus, Tony. Everything. It's got
                        everything to do with it. You took a
                        chance and winded up inventing a new
                        way of playing the bloody guitar. 

                                 TONY
                            (shrugs)
                        Don't know about all that. I got
                        lucky.

                                 SHARON
                        Yes. You did. Because you had marbles.  

                                 TONY
                        Still do. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do you? I can't help but wonder...

           Tony senses his topless girl paying attention for the first
           time. 
                                 TONY
                        Jeff Lynne says you're wild. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do you want to live your life like
                        Jeff Fucking Lynne? 

                                 TONY
                        Fair point. Let me think about it. 

                                 SHARON
                        No. This is the moment.

           Sharon takes Tony by the hands. Looks Tony hard in the eyes.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        I will murder for you, Tony. 

           Tony breaks free and bends to snort another line. Takes it
           in. Rises. Then: 

                                 TONY
                        No.

                                 SHARON
                        What? 

                                 TOPLESS WOMAN
                        Aw. I was about to be so proud. 

                                 TONY
                        I mean 'yes'. I meant to say 'yes'.
                        Now will you leave?  

           Sharon rushes Tony and gives him a hug. 

                                 SHARON
                        Thank you, Tony. Thank you. 

                                 TONY
                        Just don't rip us off.    

                                 SHARON
                        Never. 

                                 TONY
                            (as Sharon goes)
                        And keep it between us till I've
                        spoken to Patrick.  

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sharon exit's Tony's room. Giddily runs down the hall. 

           She turns a corner and trips over a body lying prone across
           a doorway. 
           Takes a moment to gather herself and soon realizes she's
           tripped over a drunken Ozzy, who's half-conscious and moaning. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy? 

           Ozzy opens his eyes. Struggles to sit up. Sharon can't help
           but give him a hand. 

                                 OZZY
                        I... I know you. 

                                 SHARON
                        Yes, but no. 

           Sharon fishes a key out of Ozzy's pocket and helps him into
           his

           HOTEL ROOM

           Lays him down on his bed.  

                                 OZZY
                            (totally out of it)
                        We gonna shag now? 

                                 SHARON
                        I was never here. 

           Sharon starts to leave, but pauses and returns to Ozzy. She
           removes his shoes and nestles his head under a pillow. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        You never saw me. 

           Turns to leave again, but has another idea. Drags a trash
           can to the side of the bed and turns Ozzy sideways in case
           he has to throw up. 

           Now she heads out one last time.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        This never happened. 

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Sharon drives back towards LA, beaming, rocking out to Sabbath
           on the eight-track. Head banging. Zero fucks given to how
           she looks or who she's almost ramming with her car.    

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SHARON'S SUITE - NIGHT

           A still glowing Sharon enters to discover a bottle of
           champagne chilling beside a card labeled, "Sharon."     

           Sharon opens the card and reads: "Thanks for turning me
           sideways. - O. ps - This note was never sent."  
           Sharon blushes and pops the bubbly. Swigs straight from the
           bottle. 

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

           Sharon sleeps soundly, empty champagne bottle on the night
           stand beside her. 

           A KNOCKING AT THE DOOR stirs Sharon to life. She rises and
           grabs a robe on her way to the door. Answers.  

           Reveal Don, armed with a briefcase.  

                                 DON
                        Are you drunk? 

                                 SHARON
                        What? How did you... Did you follow
                        me? 

           Don lets himself in. 

                                 DON
                        Not every day the family gets a second
                        chance to snap up Black Sabbath. 

           He sits on the end of the bed and snaps open his briefcase. 

                                 SHARON
                        When you say the family...

           Don pulls out some paperwork. Hands it over to Sharon. 

                                 DON
                        You'll have them sign these. 

                                 SHARON
                            (flummoxed)
                        How'd you even...

                                 DON
                        You done good, Sha. Real good. 

           Don rises.

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                            (re: hotel room)
                        May as well find us somewhere more
                        permanent than this. I like LA. 

           Don gives Sharon a kiss on the top of the head. Starts to
           head out.
                                 SHARON
                        I won't steal their money. 

                                 DON
                        You leave the money bit to me.  

                                 SHARON
                        Don, I'm serious. I promised Tony
                        we'd do it different than the Meehans. 

                                 DON
                        And we will, Sha. We will. 

           Don exits. Sharon looks back to the paperwork, then hurls it
           at the front door. Papers flutter everywhere.    

                                 SHARON
                        Get out of my fucking life. 

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. RIVERFRONT COLISEUM - CINCINNATI, OHIO - NIGHT

           On a stage in Cincinnati, where Ozzy and the rest of Sabbath
           rock out to a rabid crowd. The band has come a long way from
           that first intro in the bar -  big stage, huge wall of sound,
           much more elaborate fashions. 

           They finish their closing song, bow, and run backstage. 

           BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM

           The band pours in to discover the biggest mirror you've ever
           seen welcoming them with fresh lines of coke. 

           The mirror is so big that all four guys are able to
           simultaneously snort from different parts it at the same
           time. 

           INT. BEL AIR HOUSE - NIGHT

           Inside a giant bedroom of a huge Bel Air home. Sharon stands
           before a mirror as she did at the start of the movie, primping
           and mustering her confidence, sipping champagne,
           overcompensating with new jewels.

           EXT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT

           Sabbath's tour bus passes under a highway sign labeled
           "Memphis."

           INT. TOUR BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Ozzy, Billy, Geezer, and Van Halen's DAVID LEE ROTH snort
           from a mound of coke with a TRIO OF GROUPIES. 
                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                            (re: Ozzy and his
                             groupie)
                        You two should get hitched. 

                                 OZZY
                        Thanks, but one wife's already too
                        many for me.

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        Ozzy, you're not fucking married. 

                                 OZZY
                        Got two beautiful babies back in the
                        mother land to prove it. 

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        Well aren't you just chock full of
                        surprises. 

           Ozzy snorts a line off his girl's tit... 

                                 OZZY
                        I've adopted my wife's son from
                        another bloke as well.

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                            (to a groupie)
                        Always good to hang with a guy who
                        makes you feel like you're never the
                        biggest fuck up in the room.
                            (snorts a line, then
                             to his groupie:)
                        My balls smell like key lime pie by
                        the way.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           A wired Sharon sits in first class amongst a handful of dozing
           passengers, reading through a pile of contracts, press
           materials and stage set proposals. 

           She rubs her eyes and tries to close them, but they pop right
           back open and the work continues.

           Sharon cracks the window shade. Forces herself to take a
           beat and stare at the sun.

           EXT. NASHVILLE AIRPORT / INT. LIMO - DAY

           Sharon exits the airport and climbs into a waiting limo. 

                                 SHARON
                        Straight to the venue, please. 

           The car pulls away. WE STAY WITH SHARON A BEAT, nervously
           cracking open and closing the window.
           She pulls a compact from her purse. Applies some lipstick.
           Catches her own eye in the mirror.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        You're the one.

           She closes the compact. 

           EXT. NASHVILLE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM / INT. LIMO - NIGHT

           Sharon's limo pulls up to the artist's entrance outside the
           auditorium. 

           INT. NASHVILLE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Sharon struts the back hallway towards the dressing rooms at
           the other end of the hall. The SOUND OF VAN HALEN BLARES IN
           THE B.G.

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        This was it. This was my moment. I'd
                        gone out and signed one of the biggest
                        rock acts on the planet. Maybe Don
                        Arden would get the credit, but this
                        was my victory. No woman had walked
                        in shoes like mine, ever. 

           Sharon reaches Sabbath's dressing room, takes a breath and
           enters. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        You bet your ass I was proud. 

           INT. NASHVILLE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           The members of Sabbath, minus Ozzy, pace backstage when Sharon
           enters. 

                                 SHARON
                        Hello, gentlemen.

                                 TONY
                        Where the fuck have you been?!

                                 SHARON
                        Who'd have thought traffic in
                        Nashville could be worse than L.A?
                        Van Halen sounds good. 

                                 TONY
                        Are you completely clueless to what
                        the fuck's been going on? 

                                 SHARON
                        I don't know. Is there something
                        specific you're referring to?   
                                 TONY
                        Specific like perhaps our bloody
                        lead singer's been on a three day
                        bender and now he's disappeared?! 

           A PROMOTER sticks his head in. 

                                 PROMOTER
                        You're on in twenty. 

           The promoter exits. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm sorry, Tony. Back up. Did you
                        just say--

                                 TONY
                        You heard what I said. The police've
                        combed the entire city of Nashville
                        twice, which you'd be on top of if
                        you weren't fucking late! 

                                 GEEZER
                        We're afraid he might be dead, man. 

                                 SHARON
                        Jesus, Geezer, he's not dead. 

                                 GEEZER
                        I mean he could be. 

                                 SHARON
                        He's not dead! 

                                 TONY
                        Whether he's dead or not, what are
                        we gonna do about the situation right
                        now? 

           Sharon thinks. She just got off a plane, she doesn't know. 

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Sharon! 

           Sharon races out. 

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Did she just leave? 

                                 GEEZER
                        I think she left.

                                 BILL
                        Women, right?
           INT. NASHVILLE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Sharon waits off stage as Van Halen finishes their set and
           takes a bow. David Lee Roth bounces into the wings and Sharon
           intercepts him. 

                                 SHARON
                        I need you. 

           She pulls David Lee along with her. 

           INT. NASHVILLE MUNICIPAL AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Sharon spills into the room with David Lee Roth, who's all
           smiles. 

           A bummed looking Tony, Bill and Geezer look up from beers
           and lines of coke.  

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        Why the glum faces, fellas? 

                                 SHARON
                        Go on and show 'em. 

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        Sure thing, baby doll. 
                            (singing "Iron Man")
                        Has he lost his mind / Can he see or
                        is he blind / Can he walk at all /
                        or if he moves, will he fall? 
                            (in full David Lee
                             Roth mode)
                        Oh yeah! All right! Ya-hoooooo!

           David Lee kicks at the air a few times. 

           Sabbath looks at Sharon as if this is the dumbest thing
           they've ever witnessed. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'll let them know we're canceling. 

           EXT. NASHVILLE HYATT HOTEL - NIGHT

           Sabbath's bus pulls up to a scene of cop cars, news vans,
           helicopter circling overhead.  

           Sharon steps down from the bus, taken aback by the chaos.

           Tony sidles up behind her. 

                                 TONY
                        Get this shit in order or you'll be
                        done before you've started. 
           INT. NASHVILLE HYATT HOTEL - NIGHT

           The lobby bustles with reporters, COPS, Sabbath crew, FANS
           holding a candlelight vigil, and a pair of FBI AGENTS standing
           with David Lee Roth. 

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        When you come to LA, you have to
                        bring the badge, man. The chicks
                        fear it, but they love it. You feel
                        me? Fear and love together are a
                        potent sexual cocktail...

           Sharon handles her own little war room over by the concierge
           desk, where at the moment she's on the phone. 

                                 SHARON
                            (into phone)
                        I've got another chopper on standby
                        just in case... That's good too, but
                        do we know if there even is an Amtrak
                        in Nashville? Well, you bloody well
                        find out!  

                                 OZZY (O.S.)
                        Don't tell me we're traveling by
                        train now.   

           Sharon turns to discover Ozzy standing behind her in a
           bathrobe. 

                                 SHARON
                        Jesus Christ. 

                                 OZZY
                        Sometimes I wish I was, you know?
                        The man had great hair.  

           Sharon wraps Ozzy in a hug. 

           Tony, Geezer, Bill and others, including David Lee Roth,
           notice Ozzy hugging Sharon and hurry over. 

                                 TONY
                        What the fucking fuck!?

                                 OZZY
                        You don't like my robe?

                                 TONY
                        You are such a selfish asshole. 

                                 OZZY
                        Selfish for taking a nap?
                                 TONY
                        Taking a nap? Fuck you, Ozzy! Fuck
                        you. 

           Tony tries to grab Ozzy. Sharon and the others attempt to
           hold him off. 

                                 SHARON
                        Tony. Tony. Settle down. 

                                 TONY
                        We checked your room a hundred times.  

           Ozzy pulls his key from his pocket. 

                                 OZZY
                            (re: key)
                        You can check it again if you'd
                        like... Though I'm not actually there
                        right now. I'm here. Obviously, I'm
                        here.  

           Tony snags the key. His jaw drops.  

                                 TONY
                        This key's from the Hyatt in
                        Cincinnati. 

                                 OZZY
                        Are we not in Cincinnati?  

                                 TONY
                        Nashville! We're in bloody Nashville!

                                 OZZY
                        Is that Nashville, Tennessee? 

           Tony tries going at Ozzy again. Again the others have to
           hold him back. 

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        Holy hell on a cracker, you been
                        here the whole goddamn time! 

                                 OZZY
                        What you think I'm trying to explain?
                        I went to my room, told the maid to
                        piss off, and went to sleep. 

                                 TONY
                        You're a joke, Ozzy. 

           Tony storms off. Bill follows.

                                 SHARON
                        Tony, come on. This is good news. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        We've found our lead singer. He's
                        rested and ready to move on...
                        Tony?... Tony!  

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Sharon and Ozzy board a plane and take a pair of first class
           seats. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do you want the window or...

                                 OZZY
                        The window's grand, yeah. 

           A FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches. 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Hi. Welcome. May I get you something
                        to drink? 

                        SHARON
                                                     OZZY
                Maybe not right now.
                                             Have you got any Cognac? 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        I think I may. 

           The flight attendant exits. 

                                 SHARON
                        Really, Ozzy? 

                                 OZZY
                        It's free in first class. 

           Sharon sighs. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        You sure you're okay with me staying
                        with you? 

                                 SHARON
                        Of course. Might be good while you
                        finish the record. 

                                 OZZY
                        It's a shame these guys are too stoned
                        to write a proper tune anymore. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're one to talk. 

           The flight attendant returns with the cognac. Hands it to
           Ozzy. 
                                 OZZY
                        Thank you. 

           Ozzy downs the drink again in a single gulp. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                            (to the flight
                             attendant)
                        You can bring the whole bottle if
                        you've got other things to do. 

                                 SHARON
                        Please don't. 

                                 OZZY
                        Just one more then. 

           The flight attendant smiles uncomfortably and heads back to
           her station.  

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Won't bother you if I bugger her in
                        the loo later, will it? 

                                 SHARON
                            (forced smile)
                        As long as you don't get her pregnant.  

                                 OZZY
                        It's not having babies that scares
                        me. Gettin' warts on me cock on the
                        other hand... 

                                 SHARON
                        Disgusting. 

           The flight attendant brings another drink. 

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Here we are. 

                                 OZZY
                            (with a smile)
                        Cheers. I'm Ozzy.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Fiona.

           The flight attendant walks away. Ozzy again downs his
           cocktail. 

                                 SHARON
                        What's got you like this, Ozzy?  

                                 OZZY
                        Like what? 
                                 SHARON
                        Like... this. Is it Thelma? 

                                 OZZY
                        Thelma? Who's Thelma?  

                                 SHARON
                        Your wife, you wanker. 

                                 OZZY
                        No, it's not Thelma. Thelma is grand.
                        Like a grand piano gettin' dropped
                        on me head.  

                                 SHARON
                        You feel guilty being away from her
                        and the babies? Is that it?

                                 OZZY
                        I dunno. Why you asking such
                        questions? 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm only trying to understand. 

           Ozzy looks out the window before turning back to Sharon.

                                 OZZY
                            (sincere)
                        It's a bit of everything, isn't it? 

           INT. MERCEDES / EXT. BEL AIR STREETS

           Sharon drives. Ozzy sits beside her. The car takes several
           twists up the hills before turning into the gate of Sharon's
           Bel Air house.

                                 OZZY
                            (re: house)
                        This all yours? 

                                 SHARON
                        Yes and no. 

           The gate parts and they roll through, cruising up the
           driveway. 

                                 OZZY
                        I bought a house in Birmingham for
                        my mum and dad after we started making
                        some dough. 

                                 SHARON
                        That must've felt nice. 
                                 OZZY
                        Found out when we fired Patrick that
                        he's the one who actually owned it.
                        He threw mum and dad out the next
                        day. 

                                 SHARON
                        My God. Ozzy. That's horrible. 

                                 OZZY
                        You're probably thinking I should've
                        known better. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm not thinking that at all. 

                                 OZZY
                        I've got you to make sure that doesn't
                        happen again though, so...

                                 SHARON
                        Nothing like that will ever happen
                        so long as I'm in your life. 

           INT. GUEST COTTAGE - DAY

           Ozzy finishes a shower. Towels off and enters the bedroom,
           where there's a hideous bust of a gorilla set on the
           nightstand.  

                                 OZZY
                            (noticing the bust)
                        What the hell...?

           He moves on to some clothes laid out on the bed and begins
           to dress. 

           INT. BEL AIR HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sharon cooks up some eggs and bacon. Brews a pot of tea.
           Moments later, Ozzy enters, looking clean and sober for the
           first time yet. 

                                 OZZY
                        Did you know there's a gorilla living
                        out there?  

                                 SHARON
                        Someone gave it to Don. Hideous,
                        isn't it? 

           Sharon fixes Ozzy a plate of food.

                                 OZZY
                        Mm. Where is the old man?
                                 SHARON
                        On his way back from New York I think.
                        There's rumors he wants to stop by
                        the studio. 

                                 OZZY
                        Wants to see the shit show first
                        hand, does he? 

                                 SHARON
                        Nonsense. We're putting all that
                        behind us. Sit. 

           Ozzy obliges. He sniffs the food and practically melts. Takes
           a bite - even better. Digs in and stuffs his face.    

                                 OZZY
                        Why are you bein' so nice to me? 

                                 SHARON
                        What do you mean? It's my job. 

                                 OZZY
                        I thought your job was to get me
                        cars and drugs and things like that.

                                 SHARON
                        Are eggs and bacon not fancy enough
                        for you?  

                                 OZZY
                        It's not that. It's just...
                        thoughtful. 

                                 SHARON
                        May I ask you something? 

                                 OZZY
                        More of the questions?

                                 SHARON
                        Yes. I'm nosy. Do you think you're
                        talented? 

                                 OZZY
                        I think I can carry a tune if that's
                        what you mean. But I'm certainly no
                        Frank Sinatra. 

                                 SHARON
                        May I tell you what I think? 

                                 OZZY
                        Is there ever a scenario where you
                        won't? 
                                 SHARON
                        I think the band's spent years leading
                        you to believe you're Ringo when all
                        along you've been John or Paul. 

                                 OZZY
                        Ringo's a great drummer.

                                 SHARON
                        He is. But is he what you think of
                        when you think of the Beatles?

                                 OZZY
                        Who in their right mind first thinks
                        of Ringo? 

                                 SHARON
                        People love Sabbath because of you,
                        Ozzy. Because of your voice and your
                        energy up on stage. Because of your
                        smile.   

                                 OZZY
                        My smile? 

                                 SHARON
                        Yes. Your smile. You connect with
                        the crowd and they connect with you.
                        Not Tony. Not Geezer. Certainly not
                        Bill. You. They connect with you.   

                                 OZZY
                        If you're trying to get into my pants,
                        it's working. 

                                 SHARON
                        The point I'm getting at is, I wish
                        you'd stop acting like you have
                        something to prove. You've proven
                        it. This band is one of the biggest
                        in the world, but they are nothing
                        without you. Nothing.  

                                 OZZY
                        I don't know. I can't even play the
                        guitar. 

                                 SHARON
                        You think your fans give a shit
                        whether or not you can strum a bloody
                        guitar?  

                                 OZZY
                        I have no idea. 

           Sharon takes Ozzy's hand. 
                                 SHARON
                        Whether you believe it or not, you
                        are loved. 

           An awkward beat passes between Sharon and Ozzy before:

                                 OZZY
                        Have you got any vodka?  

           Sharon pulls her hand away and heads out of the kitchen.

                                 SHARON
                        It's time you start taking yourself
                        seriously because until then, no one
                        else will.  

                                 OZZY
                        Where you going? 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm going to bed. And so should you. 

                                 OZZY
                        Together or...

                                 SHARON
                        No! And you've got a session tomorrow
                        so don't go searching for any fucking
                        vodka.

           Sharon exits. Ozzy takes a bite of his food and looks around
           a moment before crossing to the freezer, which he opens,
           discovering a bottle of vodka. 

                                 OZZY
                            (to himself)
                        It's not searching if you're looking
                        for ice cream and happen upon it.

           Ozzy reaches into the freezer and grabs the vodka. 

           INT. BEL AIR HOUSE - NIGHT

           Late at night. Sharon sleeps soundly. 

           EXT. BEL AIR HOUSE - NIGHT

           A tipsy Ozzy paces near the back gate, puffing a cigarette
           between vocal exercises.  

                                 OZZY
                            (singing)
                        Me me me me me... Me me me me me...

           Moments later a MAN appears at the gate with a backpack. 
                                 MAN AT GATE
                        Psst. Psst. Ozzy...

           Ozzy turns, notices the man at the gate and scurries over.
           The man reaches into his pack and hands Ozzy a large bag of
           coke. 

                                 OZZY
                        You're easily the best drug dealer
                        on the planet. 

                                 DRUG DEALER
                        I consider myself a drug concierge. 

                                 OZZY
                        Is that French for dealer? 

           Ozzy pockets his stash and heads back to the house. 

           EXT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           Just awakened, still in her robe, Sharon heads into the
           kitchen. 

           She starts some coffee. Grabs milk from the fridge. Gives it
           a whiff- it's spoiled. Tosses it in the trash can, but pauses
           upon noticing something else in the bin. 

           She reaches in, pulls out an empty vodka bottle. 

                                 SHARON
                        Shit. 

           EXT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           Sharon crosses the courtyard and enters the 

           GUESTHOUSE

           Pokes her head inside. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy? Ozzy, are you in the bathroom? 

           She enters. Sits on the edge of the bed beside the gorilla
           bust. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                            (re: gorilla bust)
                        Fucking eyesore.

           She then notices a tray beneath the bust that's got some
           coke remnants across it. Wipes her finger across it. Sags on
           the bed.  
                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It dawned on me then that I'd wagered
                        my entire future on a collection of
                        incorrigible drug addicts. 

           Sharon perks upon hearing THE PHONE RING from back in the
           main house. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps in retrospect that wasn't
                        the wisest move. 

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Tony, Bill and Geezer stands inside the sound booth, mouths
           agape, watching as Ozzy destroys everything he can get his
           hands on in the studio - guitars, drums, you name it, it's
           up for demolition. 

                                 TONY
                            (phone pressed to his
                             ear)
                        We've fired Ozzy. We need you to
                        come pick him up. 

           Tony hangs up. Ozzy hurls a chair his way, but the studio's
           glass blocks it. 

           INT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           A stunned Sharon hangs up and rushes to the sink to vomit.   

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Pale but composed, Sharon tip toes into the destroyed studio
           to discover Ozzy passed out in the corner, empty bottle of
           booze by his side. 

                                 SHARON
                        Oz. Ozzy.

           Sharon reaches under Ozzy and struggles to lift him to his
           feet. Ozzy mumbles. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        It's okay. I'm here. It's okay. 

           Sharon looks back to the band, still camped out in the control
           room, passing a joint back and forth. 

           She notices someone else looming behind them: Don. Don hits
           the studio microphone.

                                 DON
                            (re: Ozzy)
                        You need help dumpin' him in a river? 
                                 SHARON
                            (to Don re: Sabbath)
                        Please stay the fuck away from them.

                                 DON
                        They're mine as much as yours, luv.

                                 GEEZER
                            (mumbled and stoned)
                        Sounds like they're talking about us
                        as if we're chattel. 

                                 BILL
                        I'm not chattel. 
                            (beat)
                        Not even sure what chattel is. Is
                        that even a real word? 

                                 SHARON
                            (losing it)
                        Does someone want to give me a fucking
                        hand?!

           EXT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Tony and Geezer look on as Bill helps Sharon slide Ozzy into
           the back of her car. They get him in. Close the door. 

                                 TONY
                        We'll call you later about pickin' a
                        new singer. 

                                 SHARON
                        Really, Tony? You were schoolmates
                        for fucks sake. 

                                 TONY
                        He was a wazzock then too.

                                 GEEZER
                        Ronnie Dio's manager reached out to
                        your dad.

                                 SHARON
                        Do not listen to my goddamned dad. 

                                 TONY
                        So then do you want to reach out and
                        make the offer? 

                                 SHARON
                        Let me be clear about one thing.

           Sharon gets right into Tony's face. 
                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        No one's offering anybody anything.
                        Take a couple days to cool off, then
                        we'll sit down with Ozzy and work it
                        out. 

                                 TONY
                        There's nothing to work out, Sharon.
                        It's over. He's axed. 

                                 SHARON
                        He's the reason people's asses fill
                        your seats. 

                                 TONY
                        Is that so? 

                                 SHARON
                        Yeah. It bloody well is. 

                                 TONY
                        Then maybe you belong with him and
                        not us. 

           Sharon is stunned. 

                                 SHARON
                        What? 

                                 TONY
                        Now there's an idea that frightens
                        you. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're right, Tony. It does. Because
                        if you let him go... You just can't
                        let him go. 

                                 TONY
                        The man can't even play an instrument. 

                                 SHARON
                        His soul is his instrument. 

                                 TONY
                            (laughs)
                        What? His... soul? You expect me to
                        take you seriously with a comment
                        like that? 

                                 SHARON
                        Don't fire him and figure out you're
                        wrong the hard way, Tony. I'm begging
                        you.  

                                 TONY
                        Put a call into Dio.
                                 SHARON
                        Fuck Dio! 

           Sharon climbs into her car. She spots Don strolling out of
           the building.

           Sharon rolls down her window. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Don! Stay the fuck out of it. 

           Don puffs at his cigar and turns away from Sharon to huddle
           with the band.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Don! 

           INSIDE SHARON'S MERCEDES 

           Seeing the futility in trying to reach Don, Sharon drives
           off. 

                                 SHARON
                            (slamming the steering
                             wheel)
                        Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fucking
                        assholes. Ah! 
                            (looking back to Ozzy
                             in rearview)
                        And you? What the fuck is wrong with
                        you? 

           She stops her rant, realizing that Ozzy is quietly weeping. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Oh, it's okay, Ozzy. It's going to
                        be okay. 

           INT. LE PARC HOTEL - DAY

           Sharon holds a semiconscious Ozzy upright as she checks him
           into this boutique Hollywood hotel. 

           The RECEPTIONIST can't help but stare at Ozzy as she fills
           out her paperwork. 

                                 SHARON
                            (on the verge of
                             breaking)
                        You want to take a picture while
                        you're at it? Let's go! 

           INT. LE PARK HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Sharon leads Ozzy inside. The room is small and dark, with a
           little kitchenette and fridge. 
           Sharon lays Ozzy down on the bed. 

                                 OZZY
                        They think I'm a punch line.

                                 SHARON
                        They're assholes but not stupid.
                        They'll come around. 

           Sharon gives Ozzy a huge hug and heads for the door.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        I'll have this sorted in the next
                        few days. In the meantime, don't
                        wander off and lose your head. 

                                 OZZY
                        Are you leaving me? 

                                 SHARON
                        Never. 

           Sharon exits. 

           EXT. LE PARC HOTEL - DAY

           Sharon climbs back into her car. Starts it, but can't bring
           herself to drive. 

           INT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           Sharon enters into the kitchen, glum as can be. Her brother
           David sits at the table, shit eating grin on his face. 

                                 SHARON
                        Not here to save me, are you? 

                                 DAVID
                        You've fucked this one up beyond my
                        abilities. 

                                 SHARON
                        Least I'm out there instead of
                        skulking 'round as Don's errand boy. 

                                 DAVID
                        I'm not his errand boy. 

                                 DON (O.S.)
                        Where's that tea, son?

           Sharon glances back at David, who flips her off. Sharon turns
           and heads 

           UPSTAIRS
           To a guest room that's been converted into an office with a
           new giant desk. Don's there, cigar between his teeth.  

           Sharon enters. 

                                 SHARON
                        Before you start spoutin' off- 

                                 DON
                        I'm sending David in to take over. 

                                 SHARON
                        David? Don, no. This band is mine. I
                        don't need David.  

                                 DON
                        What else am I supposed to do, Sha?
                        Ya blew it.  

                                 SHARON
                        On my life, I will fix this. 

                                 DON
                        How? How you gonna fix it?

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy's got nothing else. Even if it
                        means sobering up and licking Tony's
                        boots, he'll do what he has to to
                        avoid gettin' fired. 

                                 DON
                        Ozzy is a drunk. Forget Ozzy. You
                        should've seen the havoc he was
                        wreakin' when I showed up. 

                                 SHARON
                        I understand that Ozzy can be a
                        little... off when he's drinking.
                        But as talented as the other guys
                        are, he's the reason people love
                        them. 

                                 DON
                        People love the songs. They could
                        give two shits about Ozzy. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're wrong. 

                                 DON
                        Is this the part where you try
                        convincing me his soul is a musical
                        instrument? 
                                 SHARON
                        Does it mean anything that I might
                        know what I'm doing when it comes to
                        what's right for this band? 

                                 DON
                        No. Find a new lead singer, get the
                        band back on the road and make sure
                        I keep getting my money. 

                                 SHARON
                        For the family, right? 

                                 DON
                        That's right. 

           STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Sharon passes David as he heads up carrying Don's tea. 

                                 DAVID
                        See you on the road.  

                                 SHARON
                        Eat a dick. 

           INT. NASSAU COLISEUM - NIGHT

           Sabbath show. Big crowd. Giant crosses still cover the stage.
           Tony, Bill and Geezer jam as they always have, though their
           faces are blank and drawn from using too much dope.

           Instead of Ozzy handling the vocals, however, please meet
           the illustrious RONNIE JAMES DIO (30s).

           Dio's got puffy thick black curly hair and a face that looks
           like it's fallen into one too many scalding radiators.

           He sings in a grating power metal voice devoid of melody
           while his fingers seem possessed with shooting devils horns
           at the crowd. 

           With David beside her, dancing like a boob, Sharon watches
           from the wings. Her face is blank, eyes empty. Tank on the
           cusp of empty.   

           FREEZE ON DIO AND SABBATH LOOKING ESPECIALLY CLOWNISH.

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        That smell drifting through the air?
                        That's not marijuana. It's the stench
                        of failure. Absolute abject failure. 

           RESUME NORMAL SPEED as Sharon, unable to take anymore, turns
           and walks away. 
           INT. NASSAU COLISEUM - NIGHT

           David, Tony, Bill and Geezer sit on couches snorting blow
           with Ronny Dio and his blonde wife WENDY (30s). 

           Sharon looks on from the other side of the room - definitely
           on the outside looking in. 

           The vibe has mellowed and become much darker and less fun -
           more a drug session than a party. 

           David snorts a line. Rises and crosses over to Sharon.  

                                 DAVID
                        Dio's wife really knows her cocaine.

                                 SHARON
                        At least she's good for something. 

                                 DAVID
                        Oh come on, she's nice. 

                                 SHARON
                        Did you notice the crowd sitting
                        through half the show? 

                                 DAVID
                        Solos stretched a little long. I'll
                        talk to 'em about it. 

                                 SHARON
                        For fucks sake, David. It wasn't the
                        solos. 

                                 DAVID
                        If you say his name one more time
                        I'm going to punch you in the tit. 

                                 SHARON
                        At this point you're just being
                        stubborn. 

                                 DAVID
                        Or is it you, Sha? Tony told me Ozzy
                        is dead to him. To my face. You got
                        some trick to get around that?

                                 SHARON
                        No. But I don't know how to save a
                        sinking ship, either. 

                                 DAVID
                        A sinking ship? The band's still
                        making money hand over fist.  
                                 SHARON
                        For how much longer? I should get
                        off while I can and tour with Ozzy. 

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, that'd be a great idea. 

                                 SHARON
                        Maybe it would. 

                                 DAVID
                        Which do you think would come first -
                        Ozzy ODing or Dad killing you for
                        choosing him over us? 

                                 SHARON
                        He wouldn't kill me. 

                                 DAVID
                        You're right. He'd get one of his
                        goons to do it for him instead. 

           Sharon looks at David with a sudden sense of awe.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                            (self-conscious)
                        What? Is there something in my hair?

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        There comes a moment when sometimes
                        even your hairbrained brother tells
                        you exactly what you need to hear in
                        the exact moment you need to hear
                        it. 

           Sharon starts for the door. 

                                 DAVID
                        Where are you going? 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        My father would kill me...

           Sharon exits.

                                 DAVID
                        Sharon! 

           EXT. LE PARC HOTEL - DAY

           A taxi drops an excited Sharon outside Le Parc. She steps
           out of the cab and rushes inside.  

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        I promise that this is the last time
                        I'm going to tell you the following:
                        this is where my story begins. 
           INT. LE PARC HOTEL - DAY

           Sharon rapidly knocks on Ozzy's hotel room door. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy? Ozzy are you in there?...
                        Ozzy... 

           INT. LE PARC HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

           Sharon barks at the desk clerk.

                                 SHARON
                        I paid for it, so it's mine. Now
                        give me a bloody key. 

           INT. LE PARC HOTEL - OUTSIDE OZZY'S ROOM - DAY

           Sharon slides the key into the lock and enters.

           INT. LE PARC HOTEL - OZZY'S ROOM - DAY

           Sharon tip toes into a dark room littered with beer cans,
           pizza boxes, cigarettes and trash. 

                                 SHARON
                        Oz? Ozzy?...

           Sharon walks to the other side of the bed to discover Ozzy
           lining up a snort of coke with the side of a matchbook,
           cigarette dangling for his mouth. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        What the fuck is this? 

                                 OZZY
                            (mumbles unintelligibly)

           Sharon marches over to Ozzy. 

                                 SHARON
                        This is disgusting. 

           She swats the coke away. Ozzy's too fucked up to go after
           it, instead feebly reaching before his hand falls back in
           his lap.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        How dare you!  

           More mumbling from Ozzy. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
                        you know that? You smell like piss.  

           Ozzy begins to cry. 
                                 OZZY
                        I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

                                 SHARON
                        All right, all right. No more tears. 

                                 OZZY
                            (in a stupor)
                        That's actually a good name for song. 

           Sharon approaches and helps Ozzy to his feet and leads him
           into the bathroom. She turns on the shower. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        I'm not sure I can get it up right
                        now. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're taking a bath, not fucking
                        me. Get in.

           Sharon shoves Ozzy into the shower. 

           EXT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           A cab pulls up to the house. Sharon and Ozzy climb out. Sharon
           notices Don's Rolls-Royce parked outside.  

                                 SHARON
                            (to driver)
                        Don't go anywhere. 

           Sharon moves to the back of the house. Ozzy follows. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Give me a boost. 

                                 OZZY
                        Are you serious? 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy! 

           Ozzy grumbles and tries lifting Sharon to a trestle connected
           to the second floor bedroom. Eventually she makes it through
           the window. 

           INT. BEL AIR HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

           Sharon flops into the room. Gathers herself and goes to the
           closet. Begins turning the combo on a safe. 

           EXT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           Ozzy paces, looking up at the window.
                                 OZZY
                            (calling up)
                        Sharon! What's happening? 

           Sharon's head pokes out. 

                                 SHARON
                            (loud whisper)
                        Shut up or he'll hear us. 

                                 OZZY
                        Who? What the fuck is going on? 

                                 SHARON
                            (loud whisper)
                        Be. Quiet.

           Sharon ducks back inside and a Louis Vitton bag flies out of
           the window, landing at Ozzy's feet. A stack or two of cash
           pops out of the bag.   

                                 OZZY
                        What the hell...

           Ozzy opens the bag, revealing tons of cash. Sharon reappears
           up at the window. 

                                 SHARON
                        Take that to the taxi. I'll be right
                        down. 

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sharon tip toes down the hall, past a closed door when she
           hears A WOMAN'S MOANS. 

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Yes, right there, Donny. Don't stop.
                        Don't stop.

           Sharon's face goes white. Instinctively, she opens the door
           and discovers Don, shirt on, pants around his ankles, fucking
           a YOUNG WOMAN from behind, bent over the bed.  

                                 SHARON
                        Does mom know about this? 

           Only now do Don and the woman realize Sharon is watching.
           Don pauses fucking the girl, but he doesn't pull out. 

                                 DON
                        Aren't you supposed to be in Buffalo?  

                                 SHARON
                        Cleveland, actually. 
                                 DON
                        Well, get out.

           Sharon can't move. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        Get out! 

           Don's roar puts Sharon into motion. She races DOWN THE STAIRS
           and OUTSIDE.

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        He always promised that every shitty
                        thing he did was for mum and us.
                        Everything. As if that made it okay. 

           EXT. BEL AIR HOUSE - COURTYARD - DAY

           Sharon stumbles into the courtyard, hands on knees, barely
           able to keep her breath as she disappears inside the
           guesthouse. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        And I bought it. Hook, line, and
                        sinker, because that's what I needed
                        to hear. 

           She reappears moments later lugging the gorilla bust we saw
           earlier to the middle of the courtyard.

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It's for the family, Sharon. For the
                        family.

           Sharon pulls down her pants, squats over the gorilla's head
           and takes a shit right on top of it. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Don!... Don!... Don, I've got a
                        gift for you... Don! Don! Don! Don!...

           Sharon finishes shitting, steps away from the bust and starts
           to the driveway when Don appears, blocking her path. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                            (re: gorilla)
                        Left a little present for you. 

           Don steps around Sharon to inspect the statue. Gets the gist
           pretty quick and marches after Sharon. 

                                 DON
                        Sharon, get back here! Sharon, now!  

           DRIVEWAY

           Sharon appears, heads towards a waiting Ozzy. 
                                 SHARON
                        Get in the car.

                                 OZZY
                        What the fuck is going on? 

           Sharon pushes Ozzy into the cab. Tosses the Louis Vitton bag
           behind him before climbing in herself. 

           Don chases after the car. 

                                 DON
                        Drive off now and you're best losing
                        the address to this house altogether,
                        understand? 

                                 SHARON
                            (to the driver,
                             breaking down)
                        Drive. Please drive.

                                 DON
                        I wish I'd never had you! 

           The cab pulls away. 

           INSIDE THE CAB

           Sharon begins to weep, slow at first, then in heaving
           waterfalls. 

           Ozzy sits there, not really sure what to do or how to help.
           He taps on Sharon's thigh. 

                                 OZZY
                        There there. There there. 

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

           A red-eyed Sharon counts out cash for a HOTEL CLERK. Ozzy
           stands by her side.  

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           On the bed, where Sharon weeps into Ozzy's arms. Eventually,
           she sniffles, fighting to get it back together. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

                                 OZZY
                        It's okay. 

           Ozzy looks around. He's done about as much nurturing as he
           can muster. 
                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Shall we have a drink or something? 

                                 SHARON
                            (sniffles)
                        We're supposed to be drying you out. 

                                 OZZY
                        Under the circumstances I'm not sure
                        now's the right time. 

           Sharon looks up at Ozzy. 

                                 SHARON
                            (sighs)
                        Fine. But no cocaine. 

                                 OZZY
                        I can agree to that. 

           Ozzy retrieves a small bottle of vodka from the fridge. Cracks
           it open and hands it to Sharon. Helps himself to a bottle of
           rum. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                            (raising his bottle)
                        To you. 

                                 SHARON
                        Oh, shut the fuck up. 

           Sharon and Ozzy 'clink' bottles. Each takes a sip. Ozzy
           smiles. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Don't be looking at me like that. 

                                 OZZY
                        Like what? 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm a blubbering mess. 

                                 OZZY
                            (sincere)
                        I think you're the most beautiful
                        person I've ever met. 

                                 SHARON
                            (snorts)
                        Tell me another one. 

                                 OZZY
                        I'm serious, Sharon. I think you're... 
           Ozzy leans in for a kiss. Sharon nearly succumbs, but holds
           him back. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're a married man with two young
                        babies back home. 

                                 OZZY
                        Home is like an entire continent and
                        ocean from here.  

                                 SHARON
                        Maybe.
                            (touches Ozzy's heart)
                        But what's right here? 

                                 OZZY
                        I've just told you, haven't I?

           Ozzy takes Sharon's hand and leans in. Sharon closes her
           eyes. 

                                 SHARON
                        Fuckin' hell.

           Their lips connect. 

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Empty bottles litter the floor. Clothes are strewn about. 

           SHIFT TO THE BED where Ozzy and Sharon lie arm in arm, both
           awake and at peace. 

                                 OZZY
                        I think you may have just saved my
                        life. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm countin' on the idea that you're
                        about to save mine.

           EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - DAY

           A line of heavy metal wannabes armed with guitars stretches
           down the entire block. Lost among them is a diminutive blonde
           we will soon properly meet -- RANDY RHOADS (25).

           INT. SOUND STUDIO - DAY

           Ozzy lies on a couch, looking moderately better, certainly
           cleaner, but he's half in the bag thanks to a bottle of
           Courvosier. 
           Sharon and an engineer run an audition, as ONE GUITARIST
           AFTER ANOTHER streams into the studio to ply their wares. 

           A guitarist finishes...

                                 SHARON
                        Okay, thank you.

           He leaves. ANOTHER enters. Begins to play. He sucks. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        That's great. Thank you. 

           He leaves. 

                                 OZZY
                        This is fuckin' pointless. 

                                 SHARON
                        In order to get to the diamond you've
                        got to sort out the rough. 

           Another GUITARIST struts in and sucks. 

           And ANOTHER. 

           And ANOTHER.

           And ANOTHER. 

           Next enter Randy Rhoads. We get a better look at him this
           time - slight, sweet, deep-voiced but soft spoken. He carries
           a Gibson Les Paul guitar and practice amp.   

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        What's your name, darling? 

                                 RANDY
                        Randy. I'm Randy. 

                                 SHARON
                        Okay, Randy.

           Randy plugs in and begins to tune his guitar. Next he plays
           a basic warmup exercise. Before he even breaks into song,
           Sharon turns to notice Ozzy standing beside her. 

                                 OZZY
                        You're hired. 

                                 SHARON
                        He hasn't even played anything.

                                 OZZY
                        Sure he has.   

           Ozzy approaches Randy. 
                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        That was beautiful. 

                                 RANDY
                        I can play an actual song. 

                                 OZZY
                        Save it for the road, mate. 

           Ozzy gives Randy a huge hug. Randy kind of stands there, not
           really sure how to react. He makes eye contact with Sharon. 

                                 SHARON
                            (to Randy)
                        Congratulations, I guess. 

                                 RANDY
                        Thanks. So... what happens now? 

           Sharon smiles. 

                                 SHARON
                        We make a record. 

           INT. LAX - DAY

           Sharon, dressed in fur and pearls, Ozzy outfitted in frilly
           leather, and Randy armed with a guitar case, walk side by
           side through the airport terminal, all on a mission. 

           INT. JOHN HENRY'S REHEARSAL SPACE - LONDON - DAY

           A smoke-filled London rehearsal studio. Ozzy drinks and smokes
           in one corner, a yellow legal pad with lyrics scribbled and
           scratched out in front of him. 

           Randy fiddles with his guitar in the opposite corner,
           alternating between classical scales and metal riffs, trying
           to find something.  

           Bass player RUDY SARZO (20s) and drummer TOMMY ALDRIDGE (30s)
           sit at their instruments between the two, sort of waiting
           for further instructions. 

           Sharon enters and stands there a beat. Crosses her arms, a
           bit perturbed. 

                                 SHARON
                        Quieter than I expected.

                                 OZZY
                        The process I guess. 

                                 SHARON
                        Or an excuse to drink.
                                 OZZY
                        Since when do I need an excuse?

                                 SHARON
                        The space isn't free, Ozzy. 

                                 OZZY
                            (over-reacting)
                        Then shut us the fuck down. Do you
                        even need to be here? 

                                 SHARON
                            (puffing her chest)
                        Yes. I do. 

           Randy plays a riff in the corner that catches Ozzy's ear. 

                                 OZZY
                        What's that? 
                            (off Randy not hearing
                             him)
                        Randy... Play that again. 

           Randy looks over.

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        That thing you just played. 

           Randy plays the riff again - it's the riff that will evolve
           into "Suicide Solution." 

           Sharon observes as Ozzy swigs from his bottle and approaches
           Randy.  

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        I might have something for that. Go
                        again. 

           Randy plays. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                            (singing along)
                        Wine is fine but whisky's quicker /
                        Suicide is slow with liquor / Take a
                        bottle drown your sorrows / Then it
                        floods away tomorrows...
                            (then)
                        What you think? 

                                 RANDY
                        Fuckin' poetic.  

                                 OZZY
                        Thanks.
                                 (MORE)
                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                            (to Sharon)
                        Keep sticking a thorn up my ass,
                        maybe we'll get something done after
                        all. 

                                 SHARON
                        Don't worry, I will. 

           Ozzy moves to Rudy and Tommy. 

                                 OZZY
                        Shall we try to give it a bass line? 

                                 RUDY
                        Let's do it. 

           The band begins to improvise and jam. We stay with Sharon as
           she watches proudly. 

                                 OZZY
                        Can you loop it again, Randy? Just
                        come around with the same riff. 

           Randy does as told. Rudy and Tommy fill in bass and drums.
           Ozzy "scats" new lyrics. 

           Soon the song is coming together. 

           Ozzy looks over to Sharon for approval. She smiles and nods
           his way.   

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Work on that a beat. I'm gonna take
                        a shit and think of some more words. 

           The band continues to jam. Ozzy approaches Sharon. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Join me. 

                                 SHARON
                        In the shitter to write lyrics? 

           INT. JOHN HENRY'S REHEARSAL SPACE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Ozzy's got Sharon thrown up against the toilet in the bathroom
           stall, the pair of them fucking away like crazy. 

           INT. JOHN HENRY'S REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

           Sharon and Ozzy return from the bathroom, disheveled enough
           to give away exactly what they've been doing. 

                                 OZZY
                        Any progress? 
                                 RUDY
                        Your wife called. 

                                 OZZY
                        You tell her I was taking a shit? 

                                 RUDY
                        I certainly didn't say you were off
                        fucking Sharon.  

           Sharon looks away, embarrassed. 

                                 RANDY
                        I think you guys make a cute pairing. 

                                 OZZY
                        You mean like wine and cheese? 

                                 RANDY
                        Something like that. 

                                 SHARON
                        Thank you, Randy. 
                            (with a coy look at
                             Ozzy)
                        Shall we get back to work? 

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JOHN HENRY'S REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

           The band's whipped "Suicide Solution" into a jolt of pure
           early metal. 

           Sharon looks on, proud of her creation. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        Maybe he couldn't play an instrument,
                        but Ozzy was always the talent. All
                        he ever needed was to be surrounded
                        by people who didn't treat him like
                        dirt all the time. People he could
                        trust, who'd let him be him. I now
                        understood that signing Sabbath was
                        never about Sabbath. It was and will
                        always be about Ozzy.

           Ozzy gyrates across the space, as happy and confident as
           he's been. 

           The band finishes. Ozzy pulls Randy in and gives him a hug.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Great. I'll book us a gig. 

                                 OZZY
                        We've only got but one song. 
                                 SHARON
                        So start writing another. 

           Sharon leaves. 

           EXT. BIRMINGHAM ODEON - NIGHT

           A line of YOUNG METALHEADS extends down the street and around
           the corner. 

           A NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER snaps photos of the young men, some of
           whom grimace and growl, others offering devils' horns. 

                                 METALHEAD
                        Ozzy! 

                                 OTHER METALHEADS TOGETHER
                        Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy!

           INSERT TITLE: TWO MONTHS LATER

           INT. BIRMINGHAM ODEON - NIGHT 

           Backstage dressing room. CROWD CONTINUES TO CHANT OZZY'S
           NAME IN THE B.G.

           Ozzy paces back and forth, body literally shaking, swigging
           from a bottle of booze. 

           Randy sits in a couch with a guitar, more nervous about Ozzy
           than the impending show. Tommy and Rudy hover as well.   

           Sharon stands across from Ozzy, trying to calm him. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy, relax. It's not any different
                        than a hundred times before. 

                                 OZZY
                        Except that it's just me. 

                                 RANDY
                        I'll be there. 

                                 OZZY
                            (manic)
                        But it's on me. It's on me. No one
                        wants to see me. They'll tear me to
                        shreds. 

           Ozzy scrambles to find a pill bottle, takes one out and chases
           it with a sip of his cognac. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy, stop. Stop it. The record's
                        already a hit over here. All you've
                        got to do is play the bloody songs--  
                                 OZZY
                        My songs aren't good enough. They're
                        not good. No sense of-- 

           Sharon grabs a chair and shatters it against the wall.
           Everyone straightens up, Ozzy included. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        What that chair ever do to you? 

                                 SHARON
                        Go out there and play your fuckin'
                        music! 

                                 OZZY
                            (chastened)
                        Why didn't you just say it like that
                        in the first place?  

           Ozzy pulls Sharon close. Kisses her hard on the lips. And we

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SIDE OF THE STAGE - MINUTES LATER

           Sharon watches as Ozzy flashes a peace sign and grabs the
           microphone. The CROWD ROARS.  

           Randy rips into the opening riffs of "Crazy Train" and we're
           off...

           SEVERAL DISSOLVES TAKE US THROUGH THE SHOW - Ozzy gaining
           more and more confidence, the audience eating it up, Sharon
           blowing Ozzy a kiss from the off stage wings....

           INT. BIRMINGHAM ODEON - NIGHT

           Ozzy wraps up. The crowd goes absolutely nuts. 

                                 OZZY
                        Thank you. Thank you. I love you. I
                        love you.

           He drops to his knees and kisses the stage, then rises and
           runs to retrieve an exiting Randy. He brings Randy back to
           the stage and presents him to the crowd.   

           The crowd CHEERS for Randy. Ozzy gives Randy a hug. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, Randy. I love you. 

                                 RANDY
                        I love you too, Ozzy.
           INT. BIRMINGHAM ODEON - NIGHT

           Ozzy, Sharon, Randy and the rest of the crew huddle together
           and bounce.

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        We did it. We fucking did it. No
                        Sabbath. No Don Arden. Just us. I'd
                        never been more proud.  

           Tears of joy spill down each of their cheeks as the crowd's
           chants of "Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy!" continue full throated out in
           the theater. 

           Ozzy and Sharon kiss - nothing salacious, but rather pure
           and intimate. 

           And then Ozzy's wife THELMA, a sweet if not frumpy woman,
           walks in carrying her THREE KIDS - an infant boy, three year-
           old girl, and nine-year old son. 

           Sharon steps back. 

                                 OZZY
                            (to Thelma re: kids)
                        Isn't it past their bedtime? 

                                 THELMA
                        We uh... We came to uh... 

           Ozzy looks to Sharon. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm actually on a train back to
                        London, so...  

           Sharon starts past. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Nice to see you, Thelma. 

                                 THELMA
                        Fuck off, whore. 

                                 OZZY
                        Thelma. No need to...

                                 THELMA
                        Don't you dare, John. Don't you dare. 

           Sharon heads out. 

                                 OZZY
                            (calling after Sharon)
                        See you in a few days then. 
           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

           Sharon rides the train alone. Just staring out the window, a
           bit broken and spent. A PAIR OF DRUNK FEMALE PUNKS make out
           in the seat across from her. 

           A STONE-FACED HEAVY sits beside Sharon, blocking out the
           punks. 

                                 HEAVY
                        Good show tonight. 

                                 SHARON
                        I beg your pardon.

                                 HEAVY
                        You'll be begging for a lot more if
                        you don't follow me off this train. 

                                 SHARON
                        Is that meant to intimidate me?  

           The heavy shrugs. 

                                 HEAVY
                        Take it however you want. 

           EXT. WIMBLEDON MANSION - DAY

           The heavy drives to the gates outside a different mansion
           than we've seen before. He opens the door for Sharon. Leads
           her to the gates and locks them behind her.  

           Sharon walks towards the front of the house, where her mother
           stands with folded arms, a Doberman and two Pyrenean mountain
           dogs by her feet.  

                                 SHARON
                        Are you the welcoming committee?

           Sharon bends to pet the Doberman. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Hello, Candy. 

                                 HOPE
                        Don't you touch them. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm sorry? 

                                 HOPE
                        They're not yours anymore. 

                                 SHARON
                        You really don't know what's been
                        happening, do you? 
           Hope walks in, back to Sharon.

                                 HOPE
                        He's waiting for you in the study.  

           INT. WIMBLEDON MANSION - NIGHT

           Sharon enters a darkly lit, ornate study, where Don sits on
           the end of a couch, dressed in a suit, cigar between his
           lips. 

                                 SHARON
                        Why aren't you in L.A. fucking your
                        mistress?  

                                 DON
                        I should be asking you the same
                        question. 

                                 SHARON
                        Skinny cunts with bad skin isn't
                        really my thing.  

                                 DON
                        Her skin's not that bad. Sit.

           Sharon sits on chair opposite the couch. Don sets his cigar
           aside.  

                                 SHARON
                        So now you're into kidnapping? 

                                 DON
                        Don't be dramatic. 
                            (leans forward)
                        Here's the deal, Sha. Whatever you
                        gross on tour with Ozzy is mine,
                        right? In exchange, I cover expenses
                        and allot you and Ozzy a weekly
                        allowance. 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you joking?  

                                 DON
                        Record royalties are mine too. I'm
                        hearing you've got another album
                        hitting Europe next week or two. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do you really believe I'm going to
                        agree to any of this? 

                                 DON
                        What gives you the idea it's even a
                        negotiation?
                                 SHARON
                        Don, you chose Dio and Sabbath. None
                        of what I'm building with Ozzy's got
                        anything to do with you. 

                                 DON
                        I expect Randy Rhoads' bit as well. 

                                 SHARON
                            (stands)
                        This conversation is over. 

                                 DON
                        If you don't agree to my terms, I'm
                        going to sue you for every penny
                        you'll ever earn. I will bleed you
                        and Ozzy so badly you'll wind up
                        busking for pennies on the side of
                        the road. Maybe then he'll have to
                        learn how to play guitar while you
                        pretend you're a ballerina. 

                                 SHARON
                        I can't help but wonder what I
                        might've done to deserve a father
                        like you.

                                 DON
                        You mean the kind of father that
                        raised someone - a woman no less -
                        who's just twenty-seven and equipped
                        to manage the careers of some of the
                        biggest music acts on the planet? 

                                 SHARON
                        And what else might I be equipped
                        for? Hooliganism? 

                                 DON
                        Amazing. You wouldn't know gratitude
                        if it bit you on your fat arse. 

                                 SHARON
                        Just keep your hands out of my
                        pockets. 

           Sharon exits. 

                                 DON
                            (shouting after her)
                        Your pockets are mine too. You
                        understand? I'm everywhere! 

           FOYER
           Sharon walks from the study back past the kitchen, where
           Hope sits alone in the kitchen, drinking a cup of tea,
           Doberman by her side. 

                                 HOPE
                        Sharon.

           Sharon pauses and returns to the kitchen doorway. 

                                 HOPE (CONT'D)
                        Deep down he loves you, you know. 

                                 SHARON
                        He's got a funny way of showing it. 

           She enters the kitchen, passing Hope on her way to a drawer.

                                 HOPE
                        What are you doing?

           Sharon ignores Hope until she discovers a set of keys. 

                                 SHARON
                        Reciprocating the love. 

           Sharon heads out. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Ta. 

           EXT. WIMBLEDON MANSION - NIGHT

           Sharon slams the gas of her father's Rolls-Royce and screeches
           backwards through the gate. Once on the street, she spins
           the car forward and lurches away. 

                                 SHARON
                            (screaming towards
                             the house)
                        Fuck you! 

           INT. ROLLS-ROYCE - NIGHT

           Sharon speeds along the road, fighting back tears. She SCREAMS
           INTO THE NIGHT, HER BODY SHAKING WITH RAGE.  

           At one point Sharon turns off the headlights and just drives
           through the countryside's black night. 

           Some headlights approach. Sharon swerves, barely avoiding
           the approaching car. 

           INT. ROLLS-ROYCE/EXT. BIRMINGHAM MANOR - NIGHT

           Now exhausted, Sharon makes a few more turns before stopping
           outside a beautiful country house in Birmingham.
           She opens the door, hops out and starts down the long
           driveway.

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        Where did I think I was going? 

           Sharon slows and stops.  

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Did I want to destroy his family the
                        way I'd destroyed mine?   

           Sharon's about to return to the car when the front door opens,
           revealing Thelma. 

                                 THELMA
                        Sharon?  

                                 SHARON
                        Oh. Hi, Thelma. 

                                 THELMA
                        I saw the head lamps and thought you
                        were John. 

                                 SHARON
                        I just wanted to make sure you all
                        got back from the show all right.

                                 THELMA
                        Just doin' your job then. He's at
                        the pub. 

                                 SHARON
                        Right, of course. Didn't mean to
                        disturb you. Good night.  

           Sharon turns to go. 

                                 THELMA
                        Sharon.
                            (opening the door
                             wide)
                        Come and have some tea. 

           Sharon smiles awkwardly. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do you think that's a good idea?  

                                 THELMA
                        I'm not gonna murder you if that's
                        what you're asking. 

           Thelma opens the door a bit wider. 
           INT. OZZY AND THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           In a kitchen far more quaint and tidy than we might expect.
           Sharon sits nervously across from Thelma, who pours them
           each a cup of tea. 

                                 SHARON
                        The house is lovely. 

                                 THELMA
                        Thank you. Could be yours soon. 

                                 SHARON
                        I beg you pardon. 

           Thelma sort of chuckles and rolls her eyes. 

                                 THELMA
                        Come on, Sharon, we both know where
                        this is headed.

                                 SHARON
                        I honestly--

                                 THELMA
                        One night a couple years back, John
                        was on break from tour, spending the
                        night at the pub getting pissed as
                        usual. I'd just put the babies down
                        when there's a knock at the door. I
                        answer and it's the town's vicar,
                        all smiles in his frock, telling me
                        he's just popping by for a visit. I
                        invite him in, offer him some cake
                        and tea. He eats and we laugh a bit
                        about why John named his band Black
                        Sabbath. It's all quite nice... Until
                        about thirty minutes later, he just...
                        falls forward, 
                            (claps)
                        clanks his head on the coffee table,
                        and drops unconscious at me feet. 

                                 SHARON
                        Oh dear.

                                 THELMA
                        Of course I start to panic,
                        frantically calling John at the pub.
                        "The vicar's dead. I've killed the
                        vicar." Babies are wailing upstairs.
                        John finally stumbles in an hour or
                        so later. He sees the vicar lying
                        dead on the floor. "What'd you do?!"
                        he shouts. "What'd you do?" I'm all
                        nervous and stammering. "Cake. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THELMA (CONT'D)
                        I gave him tea and cake." "What cake?"
                        he asks. I show him the tin. "Jesus
                        Christ, Thelma. You fed him enough
                        Afghan hash to kill a bleedin'
                        elephant! You've killed him. You've
                        definitely killed him."

                                 SHARON
                        Please tell me you're making this
                        up. 

                                 THELMA
                        Instead of going to the police, John
                        has me help him drag the vicar's
                        body to the car so that he can drive
                        him home. Mind you, John's pissed as
                        a fart and doesn't even have a drivers
                        license, but that's a whole other
                        story. He gets the vicar home, props
                        him up against his front door, and
                        he leaves.  

                                 SHARON
                        Was the vicar... was he dead? 

                                 THELMA
                        We thought he was but we didn't know.
                        John was staying up every night,
                        "Should I go to the police? Am I
                        goin' to hell?" On and on and on.
                        Then about a week later, John goes
                        to the pub and there's the vicar,
                        sitting at the bar drinking a
                        cranberry juice. Said he thought he
                        caught the flu because he was throwin'
                        up and hallucinatin' for three days
                        straight.    

                                 SHARON
                        Jesus. That is... Wow.  

                                 THELMA
                        This is what you're in for if you
                        keep up with John the way you are
                        now. 

                                 SHARON
                        Thelma, I really just want Ozzy to
                        succeed.

                                 THELMA
                        I gave you the gift of that story,
                        Sharon. In return I'd like it if you
                        didn't treat me like a bleedin' idiot.
           EXT. BIRMINGHAM HOUSE - NIGHT

           Thelma holds the door open for Sharon, who steps out of the
           house. 

                                 SHARON
                        Thanks again for the tea. 

           Thelma ducks back inside and abruptly closes the door.

           Sharon stands there, surprised by the night's sudden end.
           Maybe a little embarrassed. She rubs her arms from the brisk
           cold and heads back to her car. 

           She climbs into the Rolls and stares ahead at the house,
           mind churning. Slowly shifts the car into gear and rolls
           away. 

           INT. LONDON HOTEL - BAR - NIGHT

           It's late, so the bar is mostly empty. Just a BARTENDER
           cleaning up when Sharon approaches. 

                                 SHARON
                        A bottle of your best champagne,
                        please. 

           INT. LONDON HOTEL - SHARON'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Sharon pops her champagne and stares at the bubbly flowing
           over her hands. She takes a long pull, then fishes through
           her purse for a pill bottle.

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        The night was meant to be a triumph,
                        but between Ozzy and Thelma and my
                        piece of shit old man, it was all a
                        little too much. Not off yourself
                        too much. I wasn't that dramatic.
                        But I needed to sleep. I really needed
                        to sleep.  

           Sharon shakes a pair of pills into her hands and swallows
           them. Chases them with the champagne.   

           She puts the champagne down. Pulls off her shoes and slides
           up to the pillows. Lays on her back and puts her head down.
           Closes her eyes. 

           Within seconds Sharon's eyes pop back open. She sits up.
           Reaches for the pill bottle. Checks it. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But it's hard to sleep when you've
                        mistakenly taken the amphetamines
                        instead of the Quaaludes.     
           Sharon angrily tosses the pill bottle across the room. Moments
           later, she moves to retrieve it. 

           She bends to pick it up from the corner and notices a bit of
           wallpaper peeling from the wall. 

           Sharon stares at the peeled wallpaper. Cannot take her eyes
           off of it. 

           Eventually, she reaches for the exposed bit and begins to
           pull, peeling the rest of the wallpaper free. 

           INT. LONDON HOTEL - SHARON'S ROOM - DAWN

           Sharon sits at the edge of her bed, the entire room's
           wallpaper now sitting in tatters on the floor all around
           her, the sun beginning to rise outside the window. 

           Sharon tries sipping her champagne, but it's empty. 

                                 SHARON
                            (re: Champagne)
                        Gonna need some more of this. 

           INT. LONDON HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Sharon walks down the hall, but pauses upon passing a room
           where the light's on beneath the door and there's some GUITAR
           PLAYING HAPPENING INSIDE. 

           She moves close to the door and listens. 

                                 RANDY (O.S.)
                            (muffled)
                        ...And then the bridge and then we
                        shift keys right there. 

           WE HEAR SOME MORE PLAYING. Sharon can't help but knock on
           the door. 

           Moments later, Randy answers, wide awake, still dressed as
           he was the night before. 

                                 SHARON
                        Why aren't you sound asleep? 

                                 RANDY
                        We're working. 

                                 SHARON
                        Who's we? 

           Randy parts the door to let Sharon in. She enters 

           RANDY'S ROOM
           and discovers Ozzy sitting at a table, also dressed the same
           as when we last saw him. Yes, he's coked up as hell, but
           he's focused, got a pen in hand and napkins with lyrics
           scattered around him.   

                                 OZZY
                        You look like shit. 

                                 SHARON
                        Have you been here all night? 

                                 OZZY
                        Had to deal with Thelma for a bit,
                        but yeah. 

           Sharon's stunned, to say the least. Can't help but crack a
           proud smile. 

                                 SHARON
                        May I sit? 

           Ozzy shrugs and lights a smoke.

           Sharon sits on the bed and watches as Ozzy and Randy go back
           to work. 

                                 RANDY
                        Want to start with 'I hear the
                        questions?' 

                                 OZZY
                        Yeah, let's go from there. 

           Randy begins to strum "Tonight" on an unplugged electric
           guitar before Ozzy joins in with:

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                            (reading off the
                             napkins as he sings)
                        I hear the questions surface in my
                        mind / Of my mistakes that I have
                        made / Times and places I have left
                        behind / And am I ever gonna make
                        the grade? / Tonight, tonight / Is
                        it just a rhapsody / Or am I right?
                        / Is it all a mystery? I just can't
                        fight no more...

           Sharon watches Ozzy and falls in love before our eyes. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        One moment you accidentally take
                        speed in lieu of Quaaludes, the next
                        you know exactly what you're meant
                        to do with the rest of your bloody
                        life. 
           The song continues. Sharon wipes away a tear. And we

                                                               FADE OUT:

           TITLE OVER BLACK: FOUR MONTHS LATER

           FADE IN ON: 

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

           Sharon paces back and forth across the suite, posing in front
           of a mirror with one outfit after another. 

           Ozzy's here as well, kneeling on the floor before a pair of
           caged doves, bottle of Cointreau in hand. He wears a white
           checkered blazer, white t-shirt, and large cross dangling
           from his neck.  

                                 OZZY
                        For fucks sake this isn't a meeting
                        with the bloody Queen. 

                                 SHARON
                        The Queen doesn't control the American
                        rights to your record... 
                            (tosses a blouse,
                             grabs another)
                        But these motherfuckers certainly
                        do. 

                                 OZZY
                        All they've got to do is take one
                        look at the charts in England. 

                                 SHARON
                        You think they give two shits about
                        the charts in England? 
                            (shows Ozzy a top)
                        How's this? 

                                 OZZY
                        It's great. May we go? 

                                 SHARON
                        But does it make an impression? 

                                 OZZY
                        You're so consumed with makin' an
                        impression, why don't you just go
                        with your tits hanging out?

                                 SHARON
                        If I thought it'd do a bit of good I
                        would. 

                                 OZZY
                        Great. Tits out then. Let's go. 
           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREETS / INT. ROLLS-ROYCE - DAY

           A CHAUFFEUR driven Rolls-Royce cruises through the streets
           of Beverly Hills. 

           Sharon and Ozzy sit in back, caged doves sandwiched between
           them. Though she's covered in gorgeous jewelry, Sharon's
           selected a decidedly unexciting business suit. 

           Ozzy's a ball of nerves. He tries calming them with pulls
           off his Cointreau. 

                                 SHARON
                        Easy on the booze. 

                                 OZZY
                        I might if you hadn't got me so worked
                        up. 

                                 SHARON
                        It's fine. We'll be fine. 

                                 OZZY
                        According to you it's only the fate
                        of my entire career. 

                                 SHARON
                        Our career, Ozzy. Ours. 

                                 OZZY
                        Is that supposed to be comforting?
                        Jesus, you've got a way with words.  

                                 SHARON
                        It's not your whole career. Just the
                        American bit.  

                                 OZZY
                        The bit that's gonna start making us
                        some money. 

                                 SHARON
                        Enough to feed my bloodsucking father
                        and leave something leftover for us.  

                                 OZZY
                        Why can't we just tell him to fuck
                        off once and for all?

           Sharon responds with a glare instead of words. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Are you afraid of him? 
                                 SHARON
                        You want to get into this now, do
                        you? 

           Ozzy gets the message. He offers the bottle to Sharon, but
           she waves it off. Ozzy shrugs and helps himself. 

           The car moves along silently for a beat before: 

                                 OZZY
                            (re: doves)
                        I still don't understand why you
                        brought these little fuckers. They
                        smell. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do you think anyone's ever walked
                        into one of these meetings and
                        released a pair of doves as an
                        offering of peace? 

                                 OZZY
                        No. And you know why? Because no one
                        bloody cares. 

                                 SHARON
                        We're making a goddamn impression,
                        Ozzy! Release the doves, say "Rock
                        and Roll," offer a peace sign and
                        let me do the rest of the talkin,'
                        okay? Can you please just do that
                        for me?  

           Ozzy takes a moment to give Sharon's plan some sincere
           thought. Stares out the window a beat. Looks back to the
           doves. 

                                 OZZY
                        Don't you think I'd make a bigger
                        impression if I just bit their heads
                        off? 

                                 SHARON
                        Yes, Ozzy. That's a grand idea. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. CBS RECORDS BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Sharon and Ozzy enter a sterile board room filled with a
           DOZEN BLAND MALE AND FEMALE RECORD EXECUTIVES sitting around
           a conference table. 

           A LABEL PHOTOGRAPHER snaps photos to memorialize the occasion.  

           Sharon's all smiles and charm while Ozzy shuffles in behind
           her, eyes pinned to the floor. 
                                 SHARON
                            (exchanging
                             pleasantries)
                        Hi, darling... Hello... 

                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        Come in, please. 

                                 SHARON
                        So great to see you again. Thank you
                        so much for sitting down with us. 

                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        Hey, Ozzy. Welcome. We can't wait to
                        hear the record.  

                                 OZZY
                        You haven't heard it? 

                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        I have, of course. Just want to bring
                        the promotions team up to speed. 

                                 OZZY
                        They look fuckin' terrified. 

                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        Not at all. Not at all. 

           Sharon sits while Ozzy hovers behind her. 

                                 SHARON
                        As you know, Blizzard of Oz is doing
                        tremendous business in Europe and
                        we're eager to get it out here in
                        the U.S. 

                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        Ozzy, would you like to sit? 

                                 OZZY
                        Don't mind if I do.

           Ozzy sits on the lap of a FEMALE P.R. EXEC who looks
           particularly uncomfortable. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        What bug's gotten up your ass?   

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy...

           The P.R. exec looks the other way. 
                                 OZZY
                            (to Sharon)
                        This the part where we make an
                        impression?
                            (to the executives)
                        Rock and roll. 

           Ozzy shoves the first dove's head into his mouth. 

                                 SHARON
                        Oh my fucking God.

           Chomp. Spit. 

           Blood splatters as the dove lands in the PR Girl's lap.  

           For a moment, complete, stunned silence. Until...

                                 P.R. EXEC
                            (at the top of her
                             lungs)
                        Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!

                                 SHARON
                        I was joking, you nutter! 

           Flash. Flash. Flash. The photographer snaps away for posterity
           as utter chaos breaks out. Everyone backs away from Ozzy,
           blood now seeping down his chin. 

           A couple execs vomit. The lead exec grabs a phone. ALARMS
           BEGIN TO BLARE.  

                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        We need security. 

                                 OZZY
                            (to Sharon)
                        Is it something I said? 

                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        Get out! Get out! 

           The male exec starts chasing Ozzy around the room.

                                 OZZY
                        Peace and love, peace and love, peace
                        and love...

                                 SHARON
                            (chasing the exec)
                        Don't touch him! Don't you touch
                        him! 

           Ozzy evades capture, rolling over the conference table,
           crawling under it... 
                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Run, Ozzy! Run! Run! 

           EXT. CBS RECORDS PARKING LOT - DAY

           Security drags Ozzy out of the lobby with Sharon close behind. 

                                 SHARON
                        Let him go! Let him go!

           The guard tosses Ozzy to the ground. Ozzy gets to his knees
           and turns back to Sharon. 

                                 OZZY
                        Sorry, Shazzy. Are you mad? 

           Sharon helps Ozzy to his feet.

                                 SHARON
                        That poor fucking creature. We'll be
                        lucky if CBS doesn't pull the plug
                        on the whole record.  

                                 OZZY
                        I screwed up. I'm sorry. I was trying
                        to make an impression. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy, relax. 

           She grabs Ozzy by the collar and kisses him.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        You made such an impression that it
                        doesn't matter what they do. Soon as
                        this story gets out, we'll get more
                        publicity than some marketing team
                        could cobble up in a lifetime. You're
                        a genius. 

                                 OZZY
                        At least someone's finally
                        acknowledging it. 

                                 SHARON
                        Come on! 

           Sharon grabs Ozzy's hand takes off running. Together they
           SCREAM ACROSS THE PARKING LOT. 

           INT. STABLER ARENA - BETHLEHEM, PA - NIGHT

           Ozzy, now dressed in an elaborate white fringe top and black
           leather pants, commands the stage like never before. Randy's
           on fire. Tommy and Rudy are dialed in.  
           The stage production has also risen to another level - giant
           crosses and massive lights and tons of pyro.   

           Sharon stands back by the mixing board with the SOUND
           ENGINEER. She too is locked in, observing every detail. 

                                 SHARON
                        Where the fuck is the dwarf?! Get
                        the bloody dwarf out there!   

           The tech scrambles to placate Sharon's commands. A door in
           the middle of the set suddenly opens and a DWARF appears to
           hand Ozzy a beer and towel. 

           FREEZE ON THE BAND

                                 SHARON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Ozzy was rolling. The dove incident
                        was massive. The crowds were rabid.
                        Records were flyin' off the shelves
                        across two continents. It was
                        everything I'd ever worked for...

           EXT. I-95 - NIGHT

           A shittier than expected tour bus rolls down the highway.

           INT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT

           The band rides through the night. Phil Collins' IN THE AIR
           TONIGHT plays on the stereo. Randy sings every word. 

           As we make our way from the front of the bus to the back, we
           see that everyone is sweating. Like really sweating.  

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        And yet my father was still carving
                        out most of the profits. 

           We finally land on Ozzy snorting lines in back with Tommy,
           Sharon studying paperwork beside them.

           Ozzy's got his shirt off, is drenched in sweat. 

                                 OZZY
                        Feel like I'm fucking melting! 

           Sharon sighs and makes her way to the front of the bus,
           passing a WOMAN we haven't seen before. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                            (calling after Sharon)
                        You think the great Don Arden's
                        melting in the back of a bus right
                        now? Huh, Sharon?! 
           Sharon ignores Ozzy and stops a step behind the driver, ANDREW
           (45). Andrew is jittery, definitely on some kind of speed. 

                                 SHARON
                        Let me guess. 

                                 ANDREW
                        We can replace the bus altogether in
                        Durham or wait till we hit our depot
                        in Florida and repair her for nothin'
                        there. 

                                 SHARON
                        We'll sweat to death if we wait till
                        Florida. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Durham it is. 

           Sharon turns and starts back, but then pauses. Turns back to
           Andrew.  

                                 SHARON
                        We can't afford a whole new bus. 

                                 ANDREW
                        Florida it is. 

                                 SHARON
                        Right. Good. 

           Sharon turns away again. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        There a reason there's a strange
                        woman sitting behind you? 

                                 ANDREW
                        That's my wife. 

                                 ANDREW'S WIFE
                        Ex-wife.

                                 ANDREW
                        We're the midst of sorting things
                        out. I'm just giving her a ride back
                        down south. 

                                 SHARON
                        You sure that's appropriate? 

                                 ANDREW
                        That's up to you in the end, I guess. 

           Sharon looks back to the wife, who smiles. 
                                 SHARON
                        Get the air conditioner fixed and
                        she can ride the rest of the tour
                        for all I care. 

                                 ANDREW
                        I want her off as much as you, boss
                        lady. 

           Sharon returns back down the aisle. We stay on Andrew and
           his ex. She flips him off. He mouths the word "Cunt" to her,
           then swerves because he's not paying attention to the road. 

           EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON'S - NIGHT

           Two tour buses pull into a Howard Johnson's parking lot.
           Ozzy, Sharon and the band step off one bus while the CREW
           and several GROUPIES step off the other. 

                                 OZZY
                        Lovely accommodations as always,
                        Sha. 

           Ozzy heads inside. Sharon follows, chastised. 

           INT. HOWARD JOHNSON'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ozzy, the band and some GROUPIES party away. 

           Randy sits quietly in a corner and reads. Nursing a glass of
           champagne, Sharon sits beside Randy and divides two piles of
           cash into separate suede Louis Vitton bags. 

           Rudy sprinkles some coke on a groupie's ass for Ozzy to sniff.  

                                 RUDY
                        Hey, who's got a camera? 

                                 SHARON
                            (without looking up)
                        No bloody pictures. 

           One of the groupies pulls an instant camera from her purse. 

                                 RUDY
                        Beautiful. 

           Ozzy rips the line off the girl's breast as Rudy memorializes
           it with a photo. 

           Sharon instinctively hurls her glass in the girl's direction,
           shattering it against the wall behind her. 

           Everyone quickly silences and turns to Sharon. 

                                 SHARON
                        Sorry. It slipped. 
           Ozzy looks to Sharon. 

                                 OZZY
                        What the fuck was that, Sharon? 

                                 SHARON
                        I said I was sorry. 

                                 OZZY
                        You nearly took her head off. 

                                 SHARON
                        Why you defendin' her like she's
                        your girl? 

                                 OZZY
                        Maybe she is. 

                                 SHARON
                        Excuse me? 

           A KNOCK AT THE DOOR INTERRUPTS. Sharon shifts her attention
           to one of the cash bags, which she zips and carries across
           the room. 

           The change in focus breaks the tension a bit and allows the
           party to resume. 

           Ozzy watches closely as Sharon opens the door, hands the
           cash bag to a waiting heavy (the guy from the train), closes
           the door and turns back into the room. She senses Ozzy's
           glare. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Who's got a drink for me? 

           She moves in, grabs a bottle and swigs. 

                                 OZZY
                        Startin' to look like there's more
                        goin' out than comin' in. 

                                 SHARON
                        Soon as you've cracked a way out of
                        our predicament you let me know. 

                                 OZZY
                        Maybe it's exactly as you want it. 

                                 SHARON
                        Don't you dare.

           Sharon sits back in the corner. She can't help but bite her
           tongue as Ozzy holds hands with his groupie and whispers
           something into her ear, then leads her out of the room. Randy
           puts a hand on Sharon's shoulder. 
                                 RANDY
                        You okay? 

                                 SHARON
                        It's my job to ask you that question,
                        not the other way around.  

                                 RANDY
                        Maybe it's time to take a break. 

                                 SHARON
                        No breaks in this line, Randy. But
                        thank you. 

           She zips up her second bag of cash. Maternally cups Randy's
           cheek. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Get some sleep. You look tired.

           Sharon heads out, unaware of two of the groupies keenly
           watching her go.

           INT. HOWARD JOHNSON'S LOBBY - DAY

           A hungover Ozzy stands over a greasy, fatty tray of bacon on
           offer as part of a breakfast buffet. 

           Sharon enters, senses Ozzy's edginess and approaches with
           caution. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're supposed to eat it not stare
                        at it. 

                                 OZZY
                        Would you fuckin' eat it? 

                                 SHARON
                        As a Jew I'm not allowed. 

                                 OZZY
                        Since when are you a Jew? 

                                 SHARON
                        Since you offered me to eat that
                        bacon. 

           Ozzy slams down the bacon tongs. 

                                 OZZY
                        Have I not earned the right to eat
                        some real food? Is that too much to
                        ask now? 
                                 SHARON
                        No. You're right. I'll go and get
                        some cash and take you out properly.  

                                 OZZY
                        You mean you didn't give it all away
                        last night? 

           Sharon heads off. 

           INT. HOWARD JOHNSON'S - DAY

           Sharon heads down the hall to her room. She's about to try
           the door, but notices that it's already cracked open. 

           She warily steps inside and immediately notices her bag is
           missing. 

                                 SHARON
                        No. 
                            (futilely searching)
                        No, no, no, no, no, no. No! 

           Sharon tears the room apart. Yes, she's searching, but mostly
           she's in a rage. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Sharon approaches Ozzy, who slouches over a coffee and
           cigarette. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy... 

                                 OZZY
                            (perks)
                        We ready to go? 

                                 SHARON
                            (at a boiling point)
                        Someone... some motherfucker...

                                 OZZY
                        Spit it out, woman.

                                 SHARON
                            (manic)
                        Someone's stolen our money. I'm sorry.
                        I had it in the room and maybe I
                        left it open, maybe those bitches
                        last night were casing me, I don't
                        know. 

                                 OZZY
                        You've lost all our money? 
                                 SHARON
                        We need to go to the police now. We
                        can get it back. 

                                 OZZY
                        I don't want to get it back. I want
                        my fucking breakfast! 

                                 SHARON
                        Maybe if you didn't bring a bunch of
                        coke whore groupies everywhere you
                        went we wouldn't be in this spot.
                        Have you considered that?  

                                 OZZY
                        So this is my fault? Not yours for
                        carrying our life's saving in a
                        fucking sack? 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you coming to the police or not? 

                                 OZZY
                        No! 

           Ozzy crosses the buffet. Begins grabbing at bacon and eggs
           with his hands and stuffing his mouth. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        How's that, Sharon? You like that?
                        Really taking care of the talent,
                        are you? 

           Sharon turns and leaves. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Yeah. Walk away. You're good at that. 

           Randy enters in the middle of Ozzy's tantrum. 

                                 RANDY
                        Ozzy, what's up, man? Calm down. 

           Randy begins picking bacon up off the floor. 

                                 OZZY
                        Randy, stop.
                            (off Randy continuing
                             to clean)
                        Randy! 

           INT. BRENDAN BYRNE ARENA, EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ - NIGHT

           The biggest crowd we've seen yet CHANTS FOR OZZY. 

                                 CROWD
                        Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy! 
           Fans now hold fake bats and other animals in the air. Some
           toss them at the stage.  

           INT. BRENDAN BYRNE ARENA - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Randy, Rudy, and Tommy stand in the hallway just off stage,
           ready to go on, when Sharon starts past them. 

                                 RANDY
                        Is he coming? 

                                 SHARON
                        No one can find the bloody keys. 

           Sharon marches off to the dressing room and begins pounding
           on it. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Ozzy, there's gonna be a riot if you
                        don't open the fucking door! 

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ozzy paces, drunk and jittery. 

                                 OZZY
                        We'll make Don pay the damages, won't
                        we?  

           INTERCUT SHARON AND OZZY

                                 SHARON
                        What is that supposed to mean? 

                                 OZZY
                        You know damn well what it means. 

           Sharon shakes her head. Not sure what to do. She looks around,
           sees a golf cart. Goes to it and climbs in. 

           Hits the gas and drives the golf cart back towards the
           dressing room and plows into the door. 

                                 OZZY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        What the hell was that? 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm busting it down, you wanker. 

           She backs up and drives into the door again. SECURITY now
           comes her way as OTHERS begin to look on. 

                                 BUILDING SECURITY
                        Ma'am, what are you doing? You can't
                        do that. 
                                 SHARON
                        It's either this or your whole
                        building burns down. 

           SMASH. She hits the door again - denting it badly, but not
           opening it up.

           The security guard reaches to grab Sharon, who pulls away. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Let go of me, you animal!... Ah...
                        Ah! Ozzy! Ozzy he's fucking choking
                        me. 

           Now the door opens. Ozzy sees the security man assaulting
           Sharon and runs over, jumps on the security guy's back. The
           security guy spins. 

           Sharon lunges to protect Ozzy. Now the three of them are in
           it and a TRIO OF ROADIES enters the fray to separate Sharon
           and Ozzy. 

           Sharon and Ozzy slip away and flee back into the dressing
           room, slamming the door behind them. 

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ozzy locks the door behind he and Sharon. 

                                 SHARON
                        What the hell, Ozzy? 

                                 OZZY
                        Have you seen this bread? 

                                 SHARON
                        What? 

           Ozzy tosses a piece of bread at Sharon.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing? 

                                 OZZY
                        Have a look. There's mold. They've
                        given us moldy bread. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're having a meltdown over moldy
                        bread? 

           Ozzy mashes up the bread and throws it at Sharon as he says
           the following:
                                 OZZY
                        It's moldy because it's old because
                        you're cheaping out on the food and
                        everything else and I can't fucking
                        take anymore. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy, calm down. Just calm down. 

                                 OZZY
                        You're always on about filling me
                        with pride. Where the fuck is yours?
                        Huh, Sharon?! Does Don own that too? 

                                 SHARON
                        What do you want me to do, Ozzy?
                        Tell me. It's this or he sues us and
                        takes it all anyway. 

                                 OZZY
                        I don't know, but you need to fix
                        it. Make it right with the old man
                        or...

                                 SHARON
                        Or what?

                                 OZZY
                        Or you're fired. 

           Sharon steps to Ozzy. Puffs her chest. Angry now.  

                                 SHARON
                        Who do you think you are threatening
                        me like that? I fucking made you.  

                                 OZZY
                        And I made you! But you seem to forget
                        that because you're too busy whorin'
                        for daddy.  

           Sharon smacks Ozzy across the cheek.

                                 SHARON
                        How dare you.

           Ozzy rubs his face, more stunned than physically hurt. The
           devil in his eyes, he lunges towards Sharon. 

                                 OZZY
                        Bloody cunt. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy, don't.

           Ozzy grabs Sharon by the shoulders and shoves her as hard as
           he can into the wall. Sharon slumps, wheezing for breath.
                                 OZZY
                        Shit, Sharon. I didn't mean to--

           Sharon musters whatever strength she can and punches Ozzy
           hard in the crotch. He staggers and reacts by smacking her
           across the face. 

           Sharon and Ozzy fall into each other, hands swinging in anger.
           "GOODBYE TO ROMANCE" BEGINS TO PLAY OVER THE BRAWL, which we
           take in a bit before we 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BRENDAN BYRNE ARENA - NIGHT

           Ozzy sings "Goodbye to Romance" with Randy plucking beside
           him. The CROWD waves lighters and sways. 

           INT. DRESSING ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT

           "GOODBYE TO ROMANCE PLAYING OVER," Sharon stands in front of
           a bathroom mirror, her eye blackened and two front teeth
           chipped.

           She tries to cover up with a little make up, but it's
           pointless. Tosses the makeup into a bag, takes a breath to
           build back her confidence, but at the moment it's pretty
           well shot and she sags.  

           INT. ARENA HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sharon walks alone down the long cement corridor, sunglasses
           covering her eyes. She ducks her head whenever anyone passes. 

           EXT. ARENA - NIGHT

           Sharon steps onto the bus. Randy, Rudy, and Tommy are already
           here. 

           She passes Andrew, the driver, who's paler and more wired
           than normal.

                                 SHARON
                        Why do you look worse than me?  

                                 ANDREW
                        I'm tip top, boss.  

           Sharon continues down the aisle, towards Ozzy, sitting in
           the back of the bus, looking disheveled and spent from the
           show.

           Ozzy rises and moves towards Sharon. 

                                 OZZY
                        I'm so sorry.
           He gives Sharon an intense hug. Sharon briefly accepts it
           and sits. Ozzy sits across from her. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        If I ever touch you again, so help
                        me...

                                 SHARON
                        I know. 

                                 OZZY
                        You know I love you, yes? More than
                        anything. 

                                 SHARON
                        I do. But we can't go on like this. 

                                 OZZY
                        No, we can't. 

                                 SHARON
                        You need to get yourself cleaned up.

                                 OZZY
                        Good idea for the both of us. 

                                 SHARON
                        You'll never see me take a drink
                        again, I can promise you that. 

                                 OZZY
                        Drinking's my problem, not yours.  

                                 SHARON
                        So what's my problem then?

                                 OZZY
                        You and your old man are exactly the
                        same and you don't see it. 

                                 SHARON
                        Give me a break, Ozzy. Honestly. 

                                 OZZY
                        I'm not saying it to make you feel
                        bad, Shazzy. I'm just saying that
                        instead of recognizing who you really
                        are and changing, you spend all your
                        time trying to escape.     

                                 SHARON
                        Don't you dare moralize to me, Ozzy.
                        Not now. Not ever. 

           Sharon moves to sit at front of the bus. 
                                 OZZY
                        I need changes too, Sharon. You're
                        not in this alone. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

           The tour bus pulls into a gas station. 

           INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT

           Sharon glumly piles Twinkies and chips and other assorted
           shit on the counter. Pulls out a disorganized wad of cash
           from her purse to pay.   

           She looks up to the FEMALE CLERK and notices, hanging amongst
           a line of car air fresheners, one of a dancing ballerina.  

           Sharon stares at the air freshener until the clerk interrupts.

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                            (re: Sharon's bruises)
                        What happened to you, honey? 

                                 SHARON
                        I've left one madman only to fall in
                        love with another. 

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        Men are pigs. 

                                 SHARON
                        Yes. They are. 

           Sharon slaps her cash on the counter, grabs her shit, and
           walks out.  

           INT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT

           Sharon sits towards the front of the bus beside Randy, who's
           fiddling with his guitar. 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you ever not practicing? 

                                 RANDY
                        Ozzy's got his compulsions, I have
                        mine. 

                                 SHARON
                        He really loves you, you know. 

                                 RANDY
                        I love playing with him. 
                                 SHARON
                        Sorry the accommodations haven't
                        always been as posh as you might've
                        expected. 

                                 RANDY
                        I'm twenty-five and touring with the
                        best singer on the planet. I think
                        I'm covered. 

                                 SHARON
                        That's nice to hear, but even so,
                        the next tour won't look like this
                        one.  

                                 RANDY
                        Might be the end of the road for me,
                        to be honest. 

                                 SHARON
                            (sits up)
                        Are you trying to wind me up? Because
                        right now...

                                 RANDY
                        It's not you, Sharon. Or Ozzy. I
                        think I want to go back home. Keep
                        teaching music. Finish my degree.  

                                 SHARON
                        Are you even hearing yourself right
                        now? 

                                 RANDY
                        I know it sounds weird but my goal
                        was never to be a rock star. Even if
                        it was, how can I possibly top this?  

                                 SHARON
                        Randy, you're never leaving us. You're
                        part of our family now.

                                 RANDY
                        I mean, I'm probably leaving. 

                                 SHARON
                        You're not leaving. 

           The bus turns down the long dirt driveway of a well lit,
           massive white colonial house beset on both sides by a
           sprawling field.  

           The change in location breaks up the conversation.

                                 ANDREW
                        We're here. 
           Along the way down the driveway, the bus passes a parked
           1955 single engine Beechcraft Bonanza airplane. 

                                 ANDREW (CONT'D)
                            (as the bus passes
                             the plane)
                        Is that a Beechcraft Bonanza? 
                            (calling back)
                        Anyone want to go flying tonight? 

           No one responds. 

                                 ANDREW (CONT'D)
                        Oh, come on. I've got my flying
                        license. 

                                 ANDREW'S WIFE
                        I wish you'd fly off a cliff. 

                                 ANDREW
                            (to his ex)
                        I think we've reached your stop so
                        you can get the fuck off the bus.

           The bus parks and homeowner JERRY CALHOUN (70s) exits the
           house to greet it. 

                                 ANDREW'S WIFE
                            (mean, to Andrew)
                        Bus driver. 

           Andrew's wife jumps out of the bus. 

                                 ANDREW'S WIFE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Daddy. 

           She gives Jerry a big hug. 

                                 JERRY
                        Hey, Darlin'. Welcome y'all. Good to
                        see she ain't killed you yet, Andrew.  

                                 ANDREW
                        Not yet, Jerry. Tell me you got gas
                        in that Bonanza. 

           INT. TOUR BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Ozzy rises to follow the others out. Jerry greets each with
           a hearty handshake.

           Sharon reaches out to Ozzy as he passes. 

                                 SHARON
                        Stay with me. 
           Ozzy pulls away.

                                 OZZY
                        You need your space.

           Ozzy exits. Sharon watches him follow the others into the
           house.  

           Outside the bus Ozzy and Randy exchange a few words. Ozzy
           moves along, but Randy returns to the bus and steps on.

                                 RANDY
                        You sure you don't want to come in? 

                                 SHARON
                        Not just now. 

                                 RANDY
                        I could bring you some ice for your
                        eye.

                                 SHARON
                        I'm fine, Randy. Thank you.  

                                 RANDY
                        Okay. I may still come check on you.  

                                 SHARON
                            (smiles)
                        Maybe you are too sweet for this
                        life. 

           Randy grins and steps off the bus. 

           Moments later, Sharon rises and goes to the fridge, fishes
           out a bottle of champagne and cracks it open. 

           She looks at it a long while before taking it into the
           bathroom and pouring it down the toilet. 

           She returns to the bed and lies down on her back. Looks out
           the window at the moonlit Texas sky.

           Moments later, Sharon sits up. She crosses to Randy's bunk
           and begins searching through his things until she finds a
           box of cassette tapes. 

           Sharon leafs through Randy's music - Phil Collins, Frank
           Sinatra, The Beatles, Quiet Riot, as well as several classical
           composers, including Tchaikovsky.

           It's the Tchaikovsky she wants, so she plucks it and brings
           it to the cassette deck at the front of the bus and pops it
           in. 

           Sharon takes a few breaths as the music kicks in over the
           bus's speakers. 
           And then she begins to do some basic ballet steps. First a
           plie. Then port de bras. Then down the aisle for a small
           saute. 

           Sharon loses herself in the movement. Her face is calm. She
           seems free.

           EXT. HOUSE - LEESBURG, FL - DAWN

           Crack of dawn. The bus remains parked outside the house.
           It's quiet except for the SOUNDS OF A FEW MORNING BIRDS. 

           The silence breaks when we HEAR THE SOUND OF THE SINGLE ENGINE
           BONANZA APPROACHING FROM THE EASTERN SKY. 

           INT. TOUR BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Ozzy, Rudy and Tommy sleep soundly while Sharon stirs from
           the sound of the plane. 

           She groggily sits up and peeks out the window, where she
           notices Andrew's ex-wife stepping off the second bus with
           one of the roadies.   

           Then, off in the distance, she spots the Beechcraft Bonanza
           flying low, circling, then heading fast towards the bus. 

           Sharon's eyes go wide as the plane sinks lower and lower,
           seemingly bee-lining for Andrew's ex. 

           She shakes her head, not sure if this is a dream or real
           life. 

           And then...

           KABOOM! The bus rocks. Metal flies. Shit falls all over the
           place. 

           A split second later, WE HEAR ANOTHER CRASH and EXPLOSION. 

           Inside the bus, it's immediate chaos...

           Ozzy, Sharon, Rudy and Tommy get dumped from their bunks.

           Sharon smashes her head on the luggage rack.  

                                 OZZY
                        Sharon?!

           Ozzy peeks out the window and sees the colonial house bursting
           into flames.  

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        Sharon. Sharon come on! 

           Ozzy pulls Sharon to her feet. She manages a glimpse out the
           window and sees surging flames coming from the house. 
                                 SHARON
                        What's happened? What's going on? 

           WITH SHARON, her face in complete shock, as Ozzy drags her
           out of the bus.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                            (calling out)
                        Randy? 
                            (then to Ozzy)
                        Where's Randy? 

           EXT. TOUR BUS - DAWN

           Sharon and Ozzy stumble out of the bus, followed by Rudy and
           Tommy. 

           They look to the house, the Beechcraft Bonanza wedged into
           the side of it, engulfed in flames. 

           Andrew's ex-wife SCREAMS in terror at the sight across from
           her. 

                        ANDREW'S WIFE
                                                     SHARON
                                             Oh God. Oh my God...
                He tried to kill me!
                He was tryin' to kill
                me!

           Ozzy races back to the bus and reemerges with a fire
           extinguisher. He races towards the plane. 

                                 OZZY
                        Randy. Randy!

           Sharon, however, is frozen.

           Up ahead Ozzy begins spraying the extinguisher, but it's got
           nothing on a fire this size. 

                                 SHARON
                        No. No! 

           Sharon breaks free and rushes to Ozzy, who futilely empties
           the extinguisher.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                            (to Ozzy)
                        Tell me he's not in there. Tell me
                        that's not him.
                            (looking around)
                        Randy! Randy! 

           Ozzy tosses the fire extinguisher and turns to Sharon. They
           fall into each other's arms and weep hysterically. 
           INT. PROTESTANT CHURCH - DAY

           A weeping Sharon stands before a coffin, Ozzy hovering just
           behind her. A picture of Randy and Ozzy onstage with their
           arms around each other is perched on top of it.  

           Ozzy moves to comfort Sharon, rests a hand on her shoulder,
           but she slides away and his hand falls. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Along with everyone else from the church, Sharon and Ozzy
           watch helplessly as Randy's coffin is lowered into the ground. 

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        The story I'd heard was that Andrew
                        was begging everyone to go up in the
                        plane with him and Randy, who hated
                        to fly, just wanted him to shut the
                        fuck up... Twenty-five. He was twenty-
                        five. 

           Unable to take it, Sharon walks off. 

           Moments later, Ozzy follows. He joins Sharon by a tree looking
           out over hundreds of gravestones. 

                                 OZZY
                        You all right? 

                                 SHARON
                        If we’d just switched buses we'd
                        have never gone to Florida with that
                        stupid driver and there’d be no plane
                        for Randy to go flyin' in.

                                 OZZY
                        Shazzy don't. You can't start blaming
                        yourself.  

                                 SHARON
                        But I can. If we'd had the money I'd
                        have just gotten the new bus and
                        that'd have been that. But instead I
                        let the money go to fucking Don. 
                            (in disbelief)
                        I left it for Don.   

                                 OZZY
                        Nobody blames you. Randy least of
                        all.   

                                 SHARON
                            (re: Randy)
                        He didn't even like planes. 
           Ozzy pulls Sharon close. She cries into his chest a few beats
           before Sharon looks up at him. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Will you take me to the ballet? 

                                 OZZY
                        Not a bloody chance. 

           INT. ROYCE HALL - NIGHT

           Sharon sits beside a fidgety Ozzy for a performance of the
           ballet "Coppelia." 

           A lone BALLERINA dances the "Dawn" sequence across the stage,
           performing solo before her FELLOW DANCERS, who observe
           motionlessly from behind in a set of bleachers.  

           Sharon is alone in this moment - no Ozzy, no outside world,
           just her and this performance. 

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Sharon and Ozzy very quietly make love, but each can sense
           that their minds are elsewhere. There's no passion, no eye
           contact. Sharon even winces a couple times. 

                                 OZZY
                        Do you want me to stop? 

           Sharon nods. Ozzy climbs off. 

           INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Sharon, Ozzy and a pair of ENGINEERS sit in the booth as a
           fresh parade of GUITARISTS enter the studio to audition. 

           Sharon is lost in thought. Ozzy's drunk. 

           Out in the studio, a RANDY RHOADS WANNABE rips off some
           scales. Sharon shakes her head.  

                                 ENGINEER
                        Thanks. 

           The guitarist leaves. A new guitarist enters. Starts to play.
           He sucks too. 

           A PHONE RINGS in the studio. One of the engineers answers. 

                                 ENGINEER (CONT'D)
                        Hello? 

           He listens a beat. Hands the phone to Sharon. Sharon takes
           the phone. 
           INT. LIMO - DAY

           Post recording session. Sharon and Ozzy sit on opposite sides
           of the limo.

                                 SHARON
                        My mum isn't well. 

                                 OZZY
                        Is she dying? 

                                 SHARON
                        I don't know. But she wants to see
                        me.

                                 OZZY
                        And?

                                 SHARON
                        I think it's time for you to go home
                        too. 

                                 OZZY
                        What do you mean, home? Like to my
                        wife?

                                 SHARON
                        Yes, Ozzy. And your children.  

                                 OZZY
                        What about you and me? 

                                 SHARON
                        I don't know. 

           EXT. WIMBLEDON MANSION - DAY

           A limo drops Sharon off outside the gates of the Arden home. 

           INT. WIMBLEDON MANSION - DAY

           The place looks like shit. Rundown. Dark. Bare of everything
           but a few pieces of furniture. 

           UPSTAIRS

           Sharon walks down the hall. 

                                 SHARON
                        Mum? 

           She pokes her head into a bedroom, where her mom sits in bed
           watching television. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Mum? 
                                 HOPE
                        Hiya, Sha. 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you... are you feeling alright? 

                                 HOPE
                        Same as always. 

                                 SHARON
                        When you called you said...

                                 HOPE
                        Just said that to get you home. 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you joking? 

                                 HOPE
                        We need money and your father's
                        running low on options on where to
                        get some. 

                                 SHARON
                        So you lied about being sick to get
                        me home to ask for money? 

                                 HOPE
                        I felt the phone was too impersonal.

                                 SHARON
                        Setting aside how upsetting it is
                        that you'd do such a thing...

                                 HOPE
                        Would you rather I was ill? 

                                 SHARON
                        Of course not.

                                 HOPE
                        Your face says otherwise. 

                                 SHARON
                        Right... I don't have any money,
                        Mum. It's all gone to Don. 

                                 HOPE
                        Please, Sha. Even you aren't that
                        stupid. 

                                 SHARON
                            (not taking the bait)
                        If there's nothing else, I'm gonna
                        go now. 
                                 HOPE
                        Oh that's great, Sharon. You go.
                        Just go. Leave me to rot with your
                        thievin' father. 

                                 SHARON
                        There's no law stating that you've
                        got to stay. 

                                 HOPE
                        And abandon him like you? No. He's a
                        bastard but he's always put the family
                        first.  

                                 SHARON
                        Has he? 

                                 HOPE
                        Yeah. He has. Somehow that's a lesson
                        you've never learned.  

                                 SHARON
                        I'm sorry you see it that way. 

                                 HOPE
                        That's not how I see it. That's how
                        it is. 

           Sharon absorbs Hope's words, wilting a bit at first, but
           then gathering herself and standing up tall. 

                                 SHARON
                            (after a big exhale)
                        Goodbye, Mum. 

                                 HOPE
                        Goodbye? What d'you mean, goodbye? 

                                 SHARON
                        It means I love you, but I will never
                        step foot in this house again. 

           Sharon turns and heads out. 

                                 HOPE
                        At least feed the bloody dogs on
                        your way out. 

           Sharon leaves.

                                 HOPE (CONT'D)
                            (calling after Sharon)
                        Fine. Let them starve. Just like
                        you're doing to me. 
           INT. WIMBLEDON MANSION - KITCHEN - DAY

           Sharon heads out of the house, passing the Doberman she meant
           to pet earlier. She notes the dog's sad face and sighs. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do the rest of your lot look like
                        this?

           INT. KITCHEN PANTRY - MOMENTS LATER

           With the Doberman and two more dogs looking on, Sharon
           searches through the cluttered pantry until she comes up
           with a nearly empty bag of dog food. 

           She pours the bag over a bowl, but only a few kernels spill
           out.  

                                 SHARON
                        You've got to be shitting me. 

           INT. MARKET - DAY

           Sharon plunks a bag of dog food on the counter. A CLERK rings
           her up.

                                 ADRIAN (O.S.)
                        Sharon?

           Sharon turns to see her old boyfriend Adrian. 

                                 SHARON
                            (taken aback)
                        Adrian. Wow. Hi.  

           Adrian moves in for an awkward hug. 

                                 ADRIAN
                            (noticing the dog
                             food)
                        Have you moved back? 

                                 SHARON
                        Em. No. No. For my parents' dogs.
                        Seems they've stopped feedin' 'em.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Oh. Well, that's awful.

                                 SHARON
                        Yes, it certainly is. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Least they have you. 
                                 SHARON
                        Mm. The dogs do at least.

                                 ADRIAN
                        Lucky for the dogs. Sorry to hear
                        about Randy. 

                                 SHARON
                        Yes. Thank you. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Kind of surreal I imagine. 

                                 SHARON
                        Yeah. Hasn't really sunk in
                        completely. Not sure it ever will. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        I guess it probably won't. And Ozzy?
                        How's he handling everything? 

                                 SHARON
                        Not well. It's a shit show all around,
                        to be honest.  

                                 ADRIAN
                        I'm sure it is. 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you still in touch with Freddie? 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Ha. I see him every once in a blue
                        moon when he's in town. 
                            (off Sharon's look)
                        Not in that way. I've been with the
                        same woman going on three years
                        actually. We're gettin' married.  

                                 SHARON
                        Oh. Well that's great. I'm happy for
                        you. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Thanks. I dabble in promotions now.
                        If there's ever any way I can help
                        with anything, just let me know. I
                        miss you. 

                                 SHARON
                        If you've got two million pounds
                        laying around to buy my father out
                        of my life, I'd take that. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Yeah. I don't have that. 
                                 SHARON
                        Right. I'm going to purchase my dog
                        food now. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Yeah. Good. Good seeing you. 

                                 SHARON
                        And you, Adrian.  

           Another awkward beat before Adrian leaves. Sharon turns to
           pay for her food, but something clicks inside her head. 

           She abandons the food and runs out of the store. 

                                 CLERK
                            (calling after her)
                        You taking the food or not? 

           EXT. MARKET - DAY

           Sharon spots Adrian crossing the street and chases after
           him. 

                                 SHARON
                        Adrian. Adrian! 

           Adrian pauses. Sharon catches up.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        You said you're in touch with Freddie,
                        right? 

                                 ADRIAN
                        Not like in touch, but yeah, I guess. 

                                 SHARON
                        I think there is a way you can help. 

                                 ADRIAN
                        He's not gonna let you manage him. 

                                 SHARON
                        Don't be daft. It's a much bigger
                        favor than that. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BALCONY - NIGHT

           FREDDIE MERCURY paces along a balcony overlooking the Thames.
           He's got Sharon across from him, sitting, untouched glass of
           champagne beside her, trying to look relaxed, but tense as
           can be.  

                                 FREDDIE
                        What's it for? 
                                 SHARON
                        Buy out my father. Get our lives
                        back once and for all. Start over.  

                                 FREDDIE
                        I'm guessing he wants the publishing
                        too. 

                                 SHARON
                        What do you think? 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Two million quid's a pretty steep
                        price.

                                 SHARON
                        Price of freedom, I guess. 

           Freddie looks out at the water, considering. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        It's a big bet for a guy like Ozzy.

                                 SHARON
                        It's not a bet on Ozzy.

           Freddie turns back to Sharon. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        You haven't touched your champagne. 

                                 SHARON
                        Have to start abstaining if I'm gonna
                        spend the rest of my life baby sitting
                        a madman. 

           Freddie smiles. He likes that answer. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        I'm in for five hundred if you can
                        get the rest. 

           Sharon relaxes. 

                                 SHARON
                        Thank you, Freddie. 

                                 FREDDIE
                        Come here.

           Freddie gives Sharon a hug. They separate and lean on the
           balcony. 

                                 FREDDIE (CONT'D)
                        Your life is pretty fucked up. 
                                 SHARON
                        Yes, it is. 

           EXT. TOUR BOAT OFF THE COAST OF BARBADOS - DAY

           Snorkel and mask on his head, a shirtless Ozzy sits drunkenly
           on a boat while Thelma and the kids fish and toss chum into
           the water with the help of TWO MATES. 

                                 OZZY
                            (slurring)
                        Come on. You're blocking my view. 
                            (beat)
                        Yeah, you. The one in the red. 

           The mate in red moves to the side. 

                                 THELMA
                        Leave him alone, John. 

                                 OZZY
                        You corral any sharks yet? 

                                 MATE IN RED
                        There's definitely a couple circlin'. 

                                 OZZY
                        Better say hello then.

           Ozzy rises and stumbles towards the edge of the boat. 

                                 THELMA
                        Ozzy, don't. 

           Ozzy looks over the bow and quickly tumbles into the water. 

                                 MATE IN RED
                        Oh, fuck. 

           Ozzy flaps around. 

                                 YOUNG LOUIS
                            (crying)
                        Daddy. Daddy. 

                                 OZZY
                        I'm drownin'. I'm...

           The mates exchange a look. The second mate shakes his head
           and dives in to save Ozzy. 

           INT. CBS RECORDS - LOS ANGELES - DAY

           Sharon nervously walks down a hall into an office, where the
           lead exec from Ozzy's dove biting incident rises from behind
           his desk. 
                                 MALE RECORD EXECUTIVE #1
                        You have a lot of nerve walking in
                        here. 

                                 SHARON
                        By nerve you mean giving you a chance
                        to make another fuck load of money? 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Ozzy sleeps in a first class window seat while Thelma juggles
           her kids in front of him. 

           Young Louis begins to cry. Thelma glares back at Ozzy, who's
           completely useless. 

           INT. RAINBOW ROOM - NIGHT

           Sharon navigates her way through the Rainbow, receiving hellos
           and hugs along the way. Eventually she finds the members of
           Van Halen commanding a booth with a bunch of groupies. 

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        Well, if it isn't Miss Universe
                        herself. 

                                 SHARON
                        It's time to pay the fiddler, boys. 

           INT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BUNGALOW - DAY

           Sharon unpacks her stuff into a quaint, unassuming West
           Hollywood bungalow.  

           WE MOVE TO THE BED AND SEE two suitcases stacked with cash. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Sharon sits in coach. She's got a stack of papers before
           her, which she anxiously leafs through. 

           EXT. BIRMINGHAM HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sharon leans on the hood of her car outside Ozzy and Thelma's
           house, waiting. She checks her watch. Waits some more.
           Eventually, Ozzy appears, drunk and disheveled, eyes a bit
           mad, and approaches.  

                                 SHARON
                        It's about time. 

                                 OZZY
                        I'd have invited you in, but... 

           Sharon hands Ozzy an envelope.  
                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        What's this? 

                                 SHARON
                        It's our freedom.  

           Ozzy pulls out a stack of papers. 

                                 OZZY
                        Freedom to do what?  

                                 SHARON
                        Whatever we want without Don Arden's
                        slithering hand reaching into our
                        pockets ever again. 

           Ozzy inspects the papers. 

                                 OZZY
                        Is this real? 

                                 SHARON
                        Soon as he signs, which he will.
                        We're giving up a hell of a lot, but
                        we get to be on our own once and for
                        all. 

                                 OZZY
                        We've done it before, haven't we? 

                                 SHARON
                            (nods and smiles)
                        We have. 

                                 OZZY
                        If we get married I'll need to get a
                        divorce first. 

                                 SHARON
                        Is that something you want to do? 

                                 OZZY
                        I know Thelma does. 

           Ozzy looks back to the house. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        She can't stop me from seeing my
                        kids, can she? 

                                 SHARON
                        I don't think she'd want that for
                        you or them. 

                                 OZZY
                            (thinks, then:)
                        Give me a minute.
           Ozzy heads back towards the house. 

                                 SHARON
                        Was that really meant to be your
                        proposal? 

                                 OZZY
                        Depends on whether or not you said
                        yes. 

           Ozzy disappears inside. Sharon waits on the hood of the car. 

           Moments later, Ozzy appears lugging a giant taxidermied bear. 

                                 SHARON
                        What the hell is that? 

                                 OZZY
                        She said okay so long as I take this
                        with me. Can you pop the trunk?  

                                 SHARON
                        You are an absolute lunatic. 

                                 OZZY
                        And you're about to be Mrs. Lunatic.

           Ozzy drops to his knee. 

                                 OZZY (CONT'D)
                        As this bear and my soon to be ex-
                        wife watching through the curtain is
                        my witness, Sharon Arden, will you
                        marry me? 

           Sharon shakes her head before smiling. 

                                 SHARON
                        Yes.  

           Ozzy rises and gives Sharon a big hug and kiss. Together
           they wrestle with the bear, desperately trying to stuff it
           in the trunk. 

           EXT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           A limo pulls through the gates. 

           The DRIVER-CUM-BODYGUARD opens the door for Sharon and Ozzy. 

           They move to the trunk, which the driver opens, revealing
           Sharon's two suitcases filled with cash. 

           INT. BEL AIR HOUSE - DAY

           One of the cash suitcases plops down on the kitchen table. 
           REVEAL Sharon and Ozzy looking on as the driver hoists the
           second case onto the table as well.  

           Don stands on the opposite side of the table, cigar in hand
           as always. 

                                 DON
                        'The fuck is this?  

           Sharon unzips the suitcases, revealing stacks and stacks of
           cash. 

           Don is blown away, drawn to inspect the money. 

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                        You rob a bank or something? 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm not the thief in this family. 

           Sharon reaches into her purse and pulls out a large manila
           envelope. Slides it across to Don.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Sign these and this money is yours. 

                                 DON
                        How much is there? 

                                 SHARON
                        Enough to maintain the charade that
                        you're still someone of influence in
                        this world.  

           Don pulls the papers out of the envelope as well as the
           necklace he gave Sharon following her abortion years ago.  

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                            (re: necklace)
                        Been waiting a long time to give
                        that back. 

                                 DON
                        You don't want it you should just
                        sell it. 

                                 SHARON
                        Do you need a pen? 

                                 DON
                        You think I'm going to sign these
                        before readin' em? 

                                 SHARON
                        In order to get your mitts on this
                        money? Yeah, I do.  
           Don thumbs through the pages. Looks up to Sharon. She slides
           the pen his way, but he doesn't pick it up. 

           He notices the engagement ring on Sharon's finger. 

                                 DON
                        You two getting married? 

                                 SHARON
                        We are. 

                                 DON
                            (to Ozzy)
                        That her condition for keeping your
                        career afloat? 

                                 OZZY
                        Don't be a cunt, Don.

                                 DON
                        She's got the angles sharper than
                        even me. 

                                 SHARON
                        Are you signing or not? 

                                 DON
                        Do you remember that time I left you
                        and David in the forest? 

                                 SHARON
                        How could I forget? I was eight. 

                                 DON
                        Do you remember what happened out
                        there? 

                                 SHARON
                        Other then shitting my pants and
                        thinking I was gonna die before
                        finding our way out? 

                                 DON
                        Ah. You said it right there. You
                        found your way out. What else is a
                        father supposed to do beyond making
                        sure his children can always find
                        their way out?  

                                 SHARON
                        You going to sign the papers or not? 

                                 DON
                        You'll understand when you start
                        having children of your own. 
                                 SHARON
                        Sign the papers! 

                                 DON
                        Sure, I'll sign them... On one
                        condition and it's non-negotiable. 

           EXT. MAUI HILLTOP - DUSK

           On a hilltop overlooking the beach.

           A nondenominational MINISTER stands at a flower-draped altar
           with Ozzy dressed in a white suit and lavender shirt, a pair
           of fangs wedged between his teeth. 

           A small gathering of family and friends look on - Hope and
           OZZY'S MOTHER and SISTER, Rudy, Tommy, David Lee Roth and
           some of the crew.

           Sharon appears at the head of the aisle in a white dress
           that's too big for her, with Don there to escort her.  

           Sharon and Don walk down the aisle. 

                                 DON
                        You going to take the whole stage
                        set with you to Japan? 

                                 SHARON
                        You want to know that right now? 

                                 DON
                        You ask me you should strip it down. 

                                 SHARON
                        I'm not asking you. 

                                 DON
                        Japanese promoters love stabbin' you
                        in the back. Make sure they pay up
                        front. 

           They reach Ozzy and the minister. 

                                 SHARON
                        Would you please shut the fuck up? 
                            (to the minister)
                        Hello, Father. 

                                 MINISTER
                        Oh, I'm not a priest. 

           Don leans close to Sharon before letting her go.

                                 DON
                        Ya walked yourself out of the forest.
                        I'm proud of you. 
           Don sits. Sharon wells up as she Ozzy takes hands. 

                                 MINISTER
                            (to everyone)
                        When I sat down with Sharon and Ozzy
                        before the ceremony, I took a few
                        minutes to try and get to know them
                        a little. I asked why their love is
                        so strong and Sharon said something
                        that I believe explains it all. She
                        said...

           The minister looks to Sharon.

                                 SHARON
                        Oh, you want me to say it? 
                            (looking up at Ozzy)
                        I am Ozzy and Ozzy is me.  

                                 MINISTER
                        It reminded me of a saying we have
                        in Hawaiian: Eia au, eia 'oe, which
                        translates to, 'here I am. You are
                        here.'

           WE PULL AWAY FROM THE CEREMONY, BLINDING OURSELVES WITH THE
           SETTING SUN.

           PRELAP:

                                 SHARON (O.S.)
                        Here... And here.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

           Sharon and Don sit a table in the lobby, still dressed from
           the wedding. 

           They've got a stack of papers between them, which Don signs
           one after another. 

                                 SHARON
                        And here... Twice here. 

           Don hesitates. 

           EXT. MAUI HILLTOP - NIGHT

           At a small reception with Ozzy and the wedding guests, who
           mill about and eat. 

           Ozzy is drunk, grabbing fistfuls of cake and handing them
           out.

                                 OZZY
                        Have some cake, everyone. 
                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                            (stuffing his face)
                        This cake is loco, man!
                            (aside to Ozzy)
                        You don't mind if I take a run at
                        your sister, do you, Oz? 

                                 OZZY
                        Only if you want your teeth knocked
                        out. 

                                 DAVID LEE ROTH
                        That's not a "no." 

           David Lee winks at Ozzy's sister. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Don signs the last of the papers, which Sharon gathers. 

                                 SHARON
                        You got to walk me down the aisle.
                        Attend my wedding. Not bad for someone
                        without any negotiating power.  

                                 DON
                        In my heart I know you love me. 

           Sharon stashes the stack of papers into the envelope. She
           says nothing, but her smile gives Don some hope.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Sharon walks alone along the shore, wedding dress getting
           soaked at the bottom by the incoming tide. 

           EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

           Sharon walks a path back towards the hotel. She pauses when
           she spots Ozzy picking flowers from a garden area up ahead. 

                                 SHARON
                        Ozzy?

           Ozzy sees Sharon and takes off. Sharon runs to catch up.

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        What are you up to now? 

           Sharon hurries up the path and into the 

           HOTEL

           She climbs stairs, heads down the hall and reaches her room.
           Knocks on the door, but there's no answer. 
                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        Ozzy. Ozzy are you in there? 

           Sharon fishes a key from her purse and unlocks the door. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Sharon enters to a room covered in wildflowers - some in
           vases, some in glasses, some in liquor bottles. 

           She takes it all in and turns to the bed, where Ozzy sprinkles
           rose petals over the comforter. 

                                 SHARON
                        Is this what you've been up to?

                                 OZZY
                        I'm not finished yet, woman. Come
                        back in an hour.

                                 SHARON
                        Are you planning to steal every flower
                        on the property? 

                                 OZZY
                        I thought you'd find it romantic. 

           Sharon approaches. Takes Ozzy by the hands. 

                                 SHARON
                        More romantic than finding you passed
                        out on the floor. 

           She kisses Ozzy. 

                                 OZZY
                        Are we free? 

                                 SHARON
                        We haven't got a pot to piss in, but
                        yes. We're free. 

           They kiss again. 

                                 OZZY
                        How the fuck we gonna pay for this
                        room? 

                                 SHARON
                        I have no idea. 

                                 OZZY
                        We should probably get the hell out
                        of here then. 

                                 SHARON
                        You want to just steal off in the
                        night? 
                                 OZZY
                        Have you got a better idea? 

                                 SHARON
                        No.

           Ozzy scoops Sharon into his arms. 

                                 SHARON (CONT'D)
                        You're supposed to carry me into the
                        suite, not out, you nut. 

                                 OZZY
                        Since when do we do anything the way
                        it's supposed to be done?

           Ozzy snags a bottle of Hennessy off the bureau on the way
           out.

                                 SHARON (V.O.)
                        As you might have figured by now,
                        mine isn't a story of happy endings,
                        but rather one of new beginnings. So
                        here we go, one more time, to begin
                        again.  

           Ozzy turns a corner and he and Sharon are gone. 

           We stay in the room, bursting with flowers, but also littered
           with dirt and stems. 

           A beautiful mess. 

                                                            FADE TO BLACK
