                                 NOTE TO THE READER

          Hello. My name is Christy Hall. You may not know me, and that's 
          okay. Throughout the years, I've proudly been a playwright and 
          librettist living in New York City, and was just very recently 
          invited into the Hollywood conversation. Perhaps you've read my 
          screenplay Daddio. Perhaps not. It doesn't matter. What does 
          matter is that Daddio is about a young woman in the backseat of a 
          cab. Certainly, the cabdriver plays his part, but ultimately it is 
          her story. And I'm proud of that fact.

          The unfortunate truth is, before a remarkably passionate and 
          protective team surrounded the project, I heard a speech similar 
          to this: "Yes, but... I wonder if Daddio has enough in there for 
          men to resonate with. To make it more universal, you might want to 
          give a little something extra to the guys. Otherwise... you've 
          mostly just written a story for women. And that's a tough sell."

          Upon hearing this sentiment, I could not help but giggle to 
          myself, drawing up a political cartoon in my head. The "doodle" 
          depicted three scenarios. One, a boardroom of graying men on Wall 
          Street. Two, a day on set of The Hangover. Three, deep inside the 
          very brain of a "Harvey Weinstein type." (AKA, actual Harvey 
          Weinstein). All three panels, in my mind, shared the same cartoon 
          bubble, revealing these men's primary question of utmost concern: 
          "Are we respectfully carving enough space in our endeavor to 
          properly acknowledge and adhere to the wants and needs of the vast 
          majority of women? Because if not, we really need to restructure!"

          I call bullshit. Which is why, in our current political and social 
          landscape, under the proud, necessarily defiant banner of #MeToo 
          and #TimesUp, this screenplay was unapologetically written for 
          women. And no. In the six days this screenplay poured out of me, 
          (rewrites added a couple more, to be fair), I did not waste time 
          wondering and worrying if there's enough here to sustain a man's 
          attention. Men who identify themselves as feminists, the ones who 
          truly have our backs (and not for social, political, or financial 
          gain, mind you), will be evolved enough to go along for the ride 
          and ask thoughtful questions later. If you fall into this 
          category, I adore you. And thank you for choosing compassion.

          For the non-feminist males among us, I have very little to say, 
          for this film attempts to capture what it can actually feel like 
          to be a woman in the world, walking around, day-to-day, a 
          constant, highly versatile and volatile series of negotiations you 
          haven't even the capacity to fathom. Do not be fooled. Though this 
          tale lives in a heightened state of genre, the finer snapshots are 
          hardly exaggerations.

          My earliest memory of this behavior came from a "harmless" old-
          timer who ogled me with his eyes and insisted I sit on his lap, 
          for a very long time. I was eight years old. As I've grown, I've 
          been stalked, groped, robbed on a New York City street, and 
          aggressively chased in Spain by two men for what must have been 
                                                                     iii

          viciously sinister motives. Thankfully, my little sister and I 
          outsmarted them. I've actually been picked up at a bar (literally, 
          not figuratively) and paraded around by a complete stranger like a 
          rag doll, all because I had the courage to muster one very simple, 
          yet extremely powerful word... no.

          And these are just the highlights, because to be honest, like most 
          women, I can't even remember all the times I've been forced to 
          suffer the bad behavior of small men. I didn't even list the word 
          "catcalls" in the previous paragraph, because sadly that tune's 
          always on in the background - like some dated, scratchy throwback 
          stuck on repeat - it almost didn't feel worth mentioning. We grow 
          numb to it, don't we, ladies? How else could we possibly get 
          through the damn day? This is our pathetic inheritance. And we're 
          tired. We're tired, because when boiled down to our biological 
          basics, female equals vagina. And vagina, through a primitive 
          lens, means very little more than sex and procreation. Sex equals 
          pleasure. Procreation equals necessity.

          Fine. I get it. Truth be told, I actually quite enjoy science. But 
          I also very much enjoy poetry. And what gets lost in our biology, 
          when seen through the "rose colored glasses" of our centuries-old 
          patriarchy, is the greater, grander, sweeping, almost 
          Shakespearean awe and beauty of what it can mean to be a woman. I, 
          myself, I'm a female Homo Sapien, yes. But I'm also a loving 
          daughter, a devoted sister, a proud auntie, a fierce friend, a 
          passionate writer, a stubbornly hard worker... and a man's equal.

          Recently, a man tried to convince me that in order to be equals, 
          we must also be the same. And since men and women are so clearly 
          not the same, we are not equal. Bullshit. We are equal and we are 
          not the same. Yet, as women, our differences are marked with a 
          very high price tag. Because in our glorious uniqueness, we each 
          carry a collection of our own personal stories that tend to baffle 
          the more tenderhearted men around us. Yet, here we are. Still 
          standing. Because no matter what they think or say, we are strong.

          And that is why, this one's for you, ladies. Unapologetically, I 
          wrote every single word with you in mind. It is my love letter to 
          the fact that the moment you step out your door, the world engages 
          with you in ways that require you to be a fucking mountain. And 
          knowing that truth as intimately as I do, all I can say is, go. Go 
          and continue to be the mountain. Be wise, on high alert, 
          empathetic and angry in the face of injustice, holding tightly to 
          the hands of your sisters. And together, we just might be able to 
          form a collective granite range that makes its way across the 
          globe and back again, so mighty you can see it from fucking space. 

          United, we can and will turn the tide. I believe it. I know it. Do 
          not cease until it is so. 

          Fiercely and loyally yours, 

          Christy xo
           COLD OPEN, OVER BLACK:

           The STATIC SPIN of a tired turntable swells, giving way to 
           the bright, idealistic, finger-snappin’ sound of a forgotten 
           era, a “simpler” time, a “nostalgic” age, back when men were 
           men, and women were dames. 

           Happy as a clam, we hear the 1926 recording of Nick Lucas 
           singing the classic, "Looking at the World Thru Rose Colored 
           Glasses.”

                                 NICK LUCAS (V.O.)
                        “I'm lookin' at the world through 
                        rose-colored glasses. 
                        Everything is rosy now.”

           SUPER: "Men are afraid women will laugh at them.”

                                 NICK LUCAS (V.O.)
                        “Lookin' at the world and 
                        everything that passes,
                        Seems a rosy hue somehow...”

           “Women are afraid that men will kill them." Margaret Atwood

           The song continues, issuing from-

           INT. SKYLAR’S SPANISH-HARLEM STUDIO (HALLOWEEN 2019) - DAY

           -An old-school record player in the corner of a three-hundred-
           square-foot, New York City, studio apartment.

           Nestled on a braided rug, in baggy sweatpants, a “Nick Cave 
           and the Bad Seeds” t-shirt, ponytail and clear-framed, Warby 
           Parker glasses, SKYLAR, 27, superglues fuchsia sequins on the 
           white fabric of a pair of worn, high-top Converse.

           Her lean, yet strong and sturdy stature, her short 
           fingernails, minimal make-up and tousled, dark chestnut hair 
           all speak to the fact that this natural beauty would far more 
           readily drink beer with a homeless woman than take tea with 
           the queen. And that is precisely her magic.

           As the record continues its joyful spin, we catch a series of 
           static glimpses of this Millennial’s unapologetic sense of 
           self as demonstrated inside these four walls:

           -A vintage, “Wolf” brand dress-form stands in the corner, 
           sporting heart-shaped nipple pasties on each “titty,” a 1920s 
           style hat, a gold, VERAMEAT “Baby Teeth” necklace, white 
           nylon and gold-sparkle fairy wings, and a sticker near the 
           collar, proudly proclaiming, “I VOTED!”
           -Her antique vanity bursts with makeup, funky costume 
           jewelry, old tobacco pipes and a whiskey jug of pennies.

           -Leather books of the most celebrated classics lean against 
           one another on a Craigslist-purchased bookshelf, adorned with 
           retro knick-knacks - wax lips, random VHS tapes, small 
           plastic dinosaurs and a collection of flasks.

           Having bedazzled her shoes in sparkling fuchsia, Skylar grabs 
           her iPhone from the floor, attempting to FaceTime with a 
           contact in her “RECENTS” saved simply as “MOMMA.” 

           RING, RING, RING. 

           Skylar’s iPhone suddenly bursts with chaotic movement, the 
           recipient jostling her iPhone about. 

                                 RALPHIE (O.S. OF THE PHONE)
                        BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK!

                                 MOMMA (O.S. OF THE PHONE)
                             (thick, Texas accent)
                        Ralphie!!! 

                                 SKYLAR
                             (no accent)
                        Hey, Momma.

                                 MOMMA (O.S. OF THE PHONE)
                        Skylar?!

                                 RALPHIE (O.S. OF THE PHONE)
                        BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK!

           From the moment the call was answered, a small dog, RALPHIE, 
           has been incessantly YAPPING in the background. 

           It’s extremely annoying. 

           Take the headache you just got simply from reading about 
           Ralphie’s barking and times that by three. 

           Ralphie equals murderous thoughts.

                                 MOMMA (O.S. OF THE PHONE)
                        Ralphie, no!! No-bark, no!!

           Ralphie finally falls silent - thank God - but the image on 
           the phone still jostles, gifting us random glimpses of the 
           modest, Texas home of a retired, first-grade schoolteacher. 

           Yes. Most everything we see was purchased from Walmart.
                                 MOMMA (O.S. OF THE PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hey, sorry, I- I was takin’ a nap, 
                        I must look awful!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Oh, whatever, come on, I’m sure you 
                        look fine.

                                 MOMMA (O.S. OF THE PHONE)
                        I don’t even have a wig on!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Dude, I don’t care!

           Finally, ON THE SCREEN, we see the tender face of Skylar’s 
           MOMMA, late 50s, her head freshly shaved. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        But I look like an old lady!

                                 SKYLAR
                        That’s because you are an old lady.

           Momma pretends to cry. It’s cute. And dramatic. And playful.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Awwwwww, poor baby!

           These two are undeniably best friends. It’s obvious in their 
           banter, their comfortability, their quick wit. 

           Think of the following as a verbal ping-pong match that’s 
           been “at play” for two decades, ranging from dry sarcasm to 
           high-spirited theatrics, leaving very little room for a dull 
           moment. 

           Also, keep in mind, this is a safe haven, a secret treehouse, 
           where only these two women are allowed to play. 

           A place they can fully, delightfully, deliciously, one 
           hundred percent be themselves. 

           NO BOYS ALLOWED.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Poor baby is right!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Then grab a wig, you crazy woman, 
                        and stop pouting!

           ON THE PHONE, Momma shuffles into a closet, revealing a row 
           of cheap, styrofoam head-busts, all sporting different styles 
           of ill-made wigs in different colors.
                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Which one, do ya think?

           Simultaneously, Skylar has propped her phone on her bedside 
           table, pouring a bowl of cereal in her tiny kitchenette.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Oooooooo! Let’s go with the ginger!

           Momma shuffles from the closet and lays her phone face-up on 
           the bed. Curiously, Ralphie - revealed to be a black, teacup 
           Pomeranian - SNIFFS at the screen, his snout largely 
           amplified.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                             (as if talking to a baby)
                        Hi, Ralphie.

           Spooked, Ralphie scurries away and hops off the bed.

                                 MOMMA (O.S. OF THE PHONE)
                        I like this one, ‘cause... it’s not 
                        too itchy.

           Skylar inhales another spoonful of cereal. 

           MUNCH, MUNCH, MUNCH. 

           She glances to a gold framed, black-and-white photo on her 
           vanity. It depicts a gorgeous YOUNG BRUNETTE, 20-ish, with an 
           explosive grin, a large, Texas-style bouffant and a sweet 
           string of pearls. 

           This haunting image of what her mother used to look like, 
           causes Skylar’s soft grin to falter with grief.

           Momma grabs the phone, showing off her fire-engine-red wig. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        So...? What do ya think? Pretty 
                        spunky, huh?!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Hey, good lookin’! 
                             (mimicking cat-calls)
                        Wooot-Woooo! OW!

           Momma flips her camera around in order to model for Skylar in 
           the reflection of a long mirror, waving her hips from side-to-
           side, resembling a little girl in a brand new Easter dress.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        It is not light on spunk, I’ll give 
                        ya that!
           Truthfully? That wig is way too texturized for the modern 
           world. Looks more like the jagged, lacquered locks of a 
           1990s, Midwestern, soccer mom who just got her hair cut and 
           fucking loves it. But certainly no need to say all that.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Never, ever thought I’d look good 
                        with red hair, but... this one has 
                        grown on me.

           Again, Skylar’s eyes dart to that framed photo of her mother. 
           Back when she had her own hair. And it was thick. And dark. 
           And beautiful. And not made of polymer. And not from Walmart. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                             (a chuckle)
                        Well... it hasn’t grown on me, 
                        sadly, but... I do like it.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You look beautiful, Momma.

           Fighting back an air of melancholy, Skylar drinks down the 
           remainder of her milk, placing the bowl in the sink.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Samuel shaved my head again last 
                        night. There were too many weird 
                        patches, it didn’t look good. 

           Repositioning the phone, Skylar bellies up to her vanity and 
           exchanges her glasses for contacts.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You reeeeally should let Sammie and 
                        me shave our heads in solidarity.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        No! You both have such nice hair! 
                        It’d make me too sad! We don’t 
                        alllll have to be walkin’ reminders 
                        of death, Skylar! 

                                 SKYLAR
                        I’m gonna do it.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Don’t you dare, I’ll be so mad at 
                        you!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeeeeeah... but you’ll get over it.
           Momma laughs loudly, Skylar blending just a touch of 
           foundation in only a few places. Not like she needs it.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        So...? What’s the plan for tonight?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Just... bar hoppin’ in the West 
                        Village with some friends.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        What’cha gonna be?

                                 SKYLAR
                        I’ve decided to repurpose the tooth 
                        fairy. Mostly ‘cause I like the 
                        necklace. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Oh, Lord. The one with all the 
                        teeth? Where on God’s-green-earth 
                        did you find that thang?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Brooklyn.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Gives me the creeps.

           Skylar applies a touch of blush.

           Suddenly, a fat, odd-eyed CAT - one eye blue, one eye green - 
           jumps on the vanity with a JINGLE of its ostentatious, 
           rhinestoned collar displaying its name, “PUSSY.”

                                 SKYLAR
                        My idea is that... maybe the tooth 
                        fairy wises-up, you know? Like... 
                        why is she paying for teeth when 
                        those kids are asleep anyway? If 
                        teeth are worth so much money, why 
                        not just take ‘em and sell ‘em on 
                        the black market? Better yet, why 
                        not just bust their teeth straight 
                        outta their face and run a friggin’ 
                        tooth-ring, like a badass mob 
                        boss?! That’s why, this year, I’m 
                        not just the tooth fairy...

           Skylar slides on two heavy-duty, blinged-out, BRASS KNUCKLES, 
           holding up her fisticuffs for her mother to see. 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m the GANGSTA TOOTH FAIRY!
                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                             (another roll of laughter)
                        Skylar! My goodness! Where do you 
                        come up with this stuff?!

                                 SKYLAR
                             (with a shrug)
                        I don’t know... I’m a writer.

           Tossing the brass knuckles back into her open jewelry box, 
           Skylar dusts her entire countenance with a very fine, gold 
           glitter, causing her to radiate like a Greek goddess.  

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Oh! You mind if I post that link 
                        you sent? The one to your show?

           Pulling out her ponytail, Skylar sweeps her hair up, piling 
           it on her head in a messy, very sexy bun, pinning it in 
           place. 

           Yes. It is disturbing how quickly she’s able to get ready and 
           still look fantastic. Some women have this sort of magic, and 
           we should simply love them for it. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Sure. Thought you would’ve done 
                        that by now. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        You get mad at me when I don’t ask!

                                 SKYLAR
                        I only get mad when you post a 
                        photo of me deep-throating a burger 
                        on the Fourth of July, when I’m on 
                        my period, in a bikini, and looking 
                        like a friggin’ house, Mom, there’s 
                        a huuuuuuge difference.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                             (with the utmost dignity)
                        So now that I have your official 
                        permission, I am going to post that 
                        link you sent.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Lovely.

           Skylar rips off her sweatpants - revealing pink Hanky Panky 
           undies - and grabs a pair of white and gold-glitter tights 
           from her shabby-chic dresser. 
           Propped on the edge of her bed, Skylar faces the Herculean 
           task of sliding stubborn nylon up both legs. 

           Let’s be honest. This might take a minute.

           Momma has “carried” Skylar into her home office, her face now 
           illuminated by a huge desktop computer from 2003. 

           TAP-TAP-TAP. Momma signs onto what must be Facebook. No. She 
           hasn’t been following the whole “Facebook thing.” She has 
           cancer and sleeps a lot. Give her a break. TAP-TAP-TAP.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        And... you’re the... lyricist.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Librettist.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        That’s right, that’s what I meant. 

           TAP-TAP-TAP. Momma composes her post, her bright red wig 
           having fallen slightly too far to the left. Poor Momma. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        How do you spell that?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Fuck, Mom, I don’t know!

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        You’re the writer!

                                 SKYLAR
                        I’m a writer, sure, but I’m not a 
                        speller! Shit, if I lived back-in-
                        the-day, with typewriters and shit, 
                        I would not be a writer, are you 
                        kidding?! I’d waste all my time 
                        just lookin’ up how to spell shit!

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                             (with a laugh)
                        You’ve gotten such a potty-mouth 
                        since you moved to New York!

           On her feet again, Skylar does a little dance, smoothing out 
           the nylon now encasing her lower body in glitter.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Have I?
                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Seriously! You never used to talk 
                        like that, gives me a headache!

                                 SKYLAR
                             (teasing)
                        I honestly don’t know what the fuck 
                        you’re talking about. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                             (a grand laugh)
                        Oh, you’re so bad!

                                 SKYLAR
                        I don’t know what to tell ya, Mom. 
                        It’s the vernacular around here. 

           After covering her asscheeks (visible through the tights) 
           with fuchsia bloomers, Skylar steps into a frilly tutu, 
           pulling it up to her waist. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        What would you be instead? Back-in-
                        the-day? If not a writer?

                                 SKYLAR
                        I don’t know, like... a kitchen 
                        wench or something.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Not to be confused with a kitchen 
                        wrench.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Ha! Good one, Mom, that’s funny!

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        I have my moments.

           Skylar lifts off her t-shirt and takes to fastening a fitted, 
           fuchsia corset with built-in pushup bra around her torso, 
           leaving her cotton polka-dotted bra on, for now. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        So, are they payin’ ya? To do your 
                        show?

                                 SKYLAR
                        I am actually getting paid for this 
                        one, yes.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        A lotta money?
                                 SKYLAR
                        Mom. It’s theatre.

           The corset in place, Skylar unlatches her cotton bra and 
           lifts it off without showing one ounce of areola, like a 
           total public-changing-pro.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        But they are gonna put me up in a 
                        hotel, for like, three weeks for 
                        rehearsal. 

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Oh, how fun! You’re gonna get to go 
                        to rehearsals and everythang?

           She takes the gold, VERAMEAT “baby tooth” choker from her 
           dress-form and latches it around her neck.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah, I mean... we’ve never seen it 
                        on its feet, so... you know... 
                        there might be rewrites and stuff.

           Quickly, Skylar laces up her high-tops.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        And then...? After this 
                        production... does that mean it’ll 
                        play somewhere else, at some point?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Maybe. Maybe not. We’ll just have 
                        to wait and see.

           Her shoes on, Skylar grabs a small, gold-leather fanny-pack 
           (yes, a fanny-pack). Oh. And did I mention this fanny-pack 
           has the word “GANGSTA” bedazzled across it?

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        That’s hard.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah. Yeah... theatre’s hard.

           She fills her fanny-pack with: Wallet, gum, NYC Metro Card, 
           lipgloss, keys.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                             (after a beat, softly)
                        I don’t know, Momma... Most days... 
                        I really don’t know what the hell 
                        I’m doing anymore...
                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                             (softly back)
                        You know what you’re doin’.

           Grabbing the phone again, Skylar lays on the bed, holding the 
           screen just above her face. 

           Momma has made her way to a couch. 

           They share a SILENCE. 

           Then---

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        You just... keep writin’ the way 
                        you do. Straight from your guts. 
                        You do that... and I just know that 
                        one day... big things’ll happen.

           Skylar eyes gloss over a little. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        And... if they don’t?

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Then... I’ll be just as proud... 
                        proud my daughter was... brave 
                        enough... to try her very best... 
                        to do somethin’ wonderful. 

           A grateful chuckle escapes Skylar’s lips as she fights back 
           tears. She’s safe here, in this metaphorical treehouse with 
           her mother, safe to cry. Yet... if she allows even one tear, 
           it might well turn into a tidal wave. Best not to chance it.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Thanks, Momma.

                        Right! HA!

           We TRACK with Skylar as she brings the phone into the TINIEST 
           BATHROOM EVER, more of a “shower room” with a toilet. 

           CLICK goes the light.

                        And... what’s this musical about 
                        anyways? Case people ask.

           Toothpaste applied, and- 

           BRUSH, BRUSH, BRUSH.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You’d like it, it’s... it’s 
                        simple... four women. All friends. 
                        Two of ‘em are sisters.

                        My goal is to pass the Bechdel Test 
                        in every scene.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        What’s that?

           Skylar beelines to her bed, throws the phone down, and grabs 
           her fanny-pack, SNAPPING it around her waist.

                                 SKYLAR
                        It’s when you have two women, in a 
                        scene, talking to each other about 
                        anything other than a man.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Shouldn’t be too hard for ya. 

           From her vanity, Skylar dusts more gold glitter all over her 
           arms and chest, then snatches her brass knuckles from the 
           open jewelry box and slides them into place.

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I mean... you don’t really talk to 
                        me about that stuff, unless...

           The GOLD-SPARKLE FAIRY WINGS are lifted from her dress-form 
           and added to the ensemble. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Unless, I... just sat on a face?

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Details I really don’t need to 
                        know, Skylar!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Don’t you like it that I tell you 
                        everything?!
                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Honestly, honey, I could have lived 
                        my entire life, quite happily, 
                        havin’ no idea that my daughter 
                        ever... 

                                 SKYLAR
                        ...sat on a face?

           Momma throws her head back and laughs, Skylar lifting the 
           phone from the bed.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        So?! What do ya think?!

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        You sure look like a tooth fairy 
                        mob boss, that is for sure!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Why... thank you.

           She grabs her charging cord, but it won’t fit in her “fanny.” 
           Oh, well. She casually throws the cord on her comforter, 
           placing headphones into her ears, connecting them to the 
           bottom of her phone.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                             (into the headphones)
                        Hey, Momma, I’m putting you in my 
                        pocket, ready?

                                 MOMMA (ON PHONE)
                        Ready!

           Just barely able to slide her phone into the bursting fanny-
           pack, Skylar stops the Nick Lucas record that’s been playing 
           a few ditties this entire time. 

           And off goes the light. 

           Tracking with her into the-

           INT. SKYLAR'S SPANISH-HARLEM BROWNSTONE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -Narrow hallway, the heavy door SLAMS and the deadbolt LOCKS!

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                             (filtered through the 
                              headphones)
                        Honestly, honey... what does that 
                        even mean?
                                 SKYLAR
                        What does what mean?

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        You know... that thing we were just 
                        talkin’ about. How does it work? Or 
                        is it just a joke?

           INT. SKYLAR’S SPANISH-HARLEM BROWNSTONE, STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Skylar descends the winding wooden staircase of her fifth 
           floor walkup. The stairway is old, poorly lit, tight and 
           claustrophobic, each step CREAKING beneath her weight. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Awwwwww, Momma. Have you never sat 
                        on a face before?

           She passes an apartment with a WAILING INFANT.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Maybe. But you have to tell me what 
                        it means first. So I know for sure.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Well...? It’s when you crawl up 
                        someone’s torso...

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        And?

                                 SKYLAR
                        And then... 

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Yes?

                                 SKYLAR
                        You... sit on their face.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                             (laughing)
                        I still don’t really understand!

                                 SKYLAR
                        It’s literal, Mom, it’s not a 
                        metaphor!

           She passes an apartment with a blaring TELEVISION playing 
           some sports game. Baseball? Football? Don’t know, don’t care.
                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Please tell me you had a little fun 
                        in your life, or was it all just 
                        missionary?!

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        And what does that mean?

                                 SKYLAR
                        When the guy’s on top.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Is that a bad thing?!

                                 SKYLAR
                        No. We’ve just... been allowed to 
                        evolve since then.

           Don’t worry. Almost to the first floor.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Who has?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Women.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Oh, that’s a big pile of crap! I 
                        bet women have been sittin’ on 
                        faces for centuries, they just 
                        weren’t allowed to talk about it, 
                        or else they’d be labeled-

                                 SKYLAR
                        -a kitchen wrench?

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Right! A wrench! HA!

                                 SKYLAR
                             (with a thick, Texas 
                              accent)
                        This pipe’s backed up, Ma! Bring 
                        the wrench to relieve the pressure, 
                        he’s gonna blow!

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Oh, gosh! Was that a metaphor?

                                 SKYLAR
                        YES!!
                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        You seriously need to clean up your 
                        brain, young lady!

           With an outstretched arm, Skylar pushes open the door-

           Out she goes, launching onto-

           EXT. SKYLAR'S SPANISH-HARLEM BROWNSTONE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -An elevated stoop on 111th street, on the corner of 5th Ave. 

           Skylar is clearly desensitized to it, but we feel a bit 
           blasted by the kinetic hustle and bustle of this vibrant 
           neighborhood on a favored holiday.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Uh-oh. I think we just failed the 
                        Beckett Test.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Bechdel.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Still. We’re two women. Talkin’ 
                        about men.

           Skipping down the stairs of this standard, Harlem brownstone 
           in this brisk October evening-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeeeeeah, but... we’re objectifying 
                        them, so... maybe it doesn’t count.

           Skylar happens upon JERROLD, 80s, her African-American 
           neighbor, a “harmless” old-timer with hearing aids, slouched 
           in a folding chair at the base of the stairs near the private 
           entrance of his first floor apartment.

                                 JERROLD
                        There she is, in all her splendor!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Sorry, Momma, hang on.

           With a sweet, yet protective sort of grin- 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Jerrold.

                                 JERROLD
                        Lookin’ good there, Skylar. You 
                        goin’ trick or treatin’?
                                 SKYLAR
                        Nah, I’m a little too old for that, 
                        Jerrold.

                                 JERROLD
                             (with a laugh)
                        Look like a little baby to me!

           A huge grin fixed on his face, his eyes twinkling with 
           delight, either Jerrold is imagining fucking her in his mind, 
           or he’s just a nice old man. It’s so hard to tell.

                                 JERROLD (CONT’D)
                        You should come and have tea with 
                        me sometime.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeeeeeah... I don’t know about that 
                        one, Jerrold.

                                 JERROLD
                        I’ve been learnin’ all about this, 
                        this Chinese tea ceremony. Got the 
                        whole set-up. You’d love it. I can 
                        teach you. I’d love to teach you.

           Again. Hard to tell if this is weird, or if this is simply 
           just a lonely, elderly man in need of some friendly company. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Sounds cool and all, but... I 
                        juuuust think we should keep 
                        talking out here the way we do. 
                        This is kinda our thing, you know?

                                 JERROLD
                        Wait. Don’t fairies grant wishes?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Only when we want to, Jerrold. I’m 
                        not some damn genie. 

                                 JERROLD
                        You don’t want me to rub your lamp, 
                        is that it?!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Okay, gotta go.

           Yup. While possibly not a predator, let’s be honest, Jerrold 
           can be fucking weird sometimes. 

           Turning on her sparkle high-tops, Skylar heads east. 
           Behind her, laughing loudly, all in “good fun,” Jerrold claps 
           his hands, as if in applause. CLAP-CLAP-CLAP.

           EXT. 5TH AVE BETWEEN 111TH AND 110TH - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           Rounding the corner, Skylar heads down 5th Ave, slightly 
           going out of her way, but it’s much nicer to walk to the 2/3 
           along Central Park.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Sorry about that.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        It’s fine. I’m gonna have to go 
                        here soon anyways. Samuel’s 
                        bringin’ me some dinner.

           Passing a large, highly chaperoned, group of CHILDREN IN 
           COSTUMES, Skylar turns right, heading-

           EXT. 110TH, BETWEEN 5TH AVE AND LENOX - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -West, strolling along the north brick wall of Central Park.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        But... I do miss ya.

                                 SKYLAR
                        I miss you, too, Momma.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                             (after a beat)
                        Get my radiation tomorrow.

           Skylar’s pace lessens. 

           Such an emotional “sucker punch.” Ouch.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah... Three o’clock, right?

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Right. It’s quite an ordeal. 
                        They’re gonna build this, this 
                        metal cage thing ‘round my head for 
                        the treatment, did I tell you that? 

                                 SKYLAR
                             (after a beat)
                        Sammie told me.
                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        I’m a little nervous, to be honest. 
                             (after a beat)
                        Wish you could be here.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (too much to handle)
                        Yeah... me, too, but... I’m coming 
                        for Christmas and... it just... 

           Smoking on his fire escape above, a BALD CAUCASIAN GUY, 40s, 
           his doughy body pressed out from under his tight t-shirt like 
           mounds of raw sausage, yells from across the street.

                                 BALD CAUCASIAN GUY
                        Hey, pretty! Walk any faster, I’m 
                        gonna have to give you a speedin’ 
                        ticket!

           Picking up the pace again, Skylar doesn’t glance his way.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Listen. You have certainly held my 
                        hand through all my other 
                        treatments, so... I do suppose 
                        you’ve earned a little break.

                                 BALD CAUCASIAN GUY (O.S.)
                        HEY! Well, then!! FUCK YOU!!!

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Everything all right?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Fine.

           But everything is not fine, because Skylar just discovered-

           EXT. 2/3 MTA STATION, 110TH AND LENOX - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -An MTA sign against yellow, criss-cross CAUTION TAPE fencing 
           the entrance of her routine subway stop. 

           “STATION CLOSED UNTIL MONDAY AT 5 A.M.” 

           A true New Yorker, Skylar-

           EXT. 110TH, LENOX TO FREDERICK DOUGLASS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -Continues west along the park, not missing a beat, passing 
           ROAD WORKERS who slow in their task to take a good look.
                                 RALPHIE (V.O.)
                             (a direct reflection of 
                              the men)
                        BARK, BARK, BARK, BARK!

           Skylar simply rolls her shoulders back, walking taller as she 
           confidently crosses the street, the men suddenly ROARING WITH 
           LAUGHTER. 

           Maybe she’s just being paranoid. Or maybe they just said 
           something completely disgusting about her. 

           We will never know. 

           Meanwhile-

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Ralphie, no! No-bark, nooooo! 
                        Sweetie, Samuel’s here, I’m sorry!

                                 SKYLAR
                        It’s fine, Momma! Go eat! Love you!

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Love you, sweet girl! Bye-bye now!

           Hanging up, Skylar comes upon-

           EXT. B/C MTA STATION AT 110TH AND F.D. - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -The B/C entrance. 

           As she crosses 8 Ave/Frederick Douglass, toward the DOWNTOWN 
           side, she composes a few rapid texts to “ANDRA,” fully 
           engrossed in her phone, not really paying attention to where 
           she is walking.

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Hey, giiiiiirl! You gonna have a 
                        charger on you tonight? Couldn’t 
                        fit that shit in my outfit. 
                             (bikini emoji with a 
                              blushy face)

           Immediately, Andra replies.

                                 ANDRA (TEXT)
                        I was just about to text you!
                             (TEXT)
                        Yup! 
                             (TEXT)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDRA (TEXT) (CONT'D)
                        I’ll have a charger, umbrella, 
                        makeup, gum, sewing kit, tissues, 
                        tampons, deodorant and mouthwash. I 
                        do NOT fuck around!
                             (a woman holding up her 
                              hands in an X over her 
                              face)

           CLOSE ON Skylar’s smiling face as she chuckles.

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Damn! You always have that
                             (poop emoji)
                        with you?!

                                 ANDRA (TEXT)
                        Hell yeah! Stick with me, baby!
                             (smiley face with 
                              sunglasses)

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                             (three fire emojis and two 
                              red high heels)

           She looks up, not a care in the world when- 

           WHAM! 

           Skylar collides with a passing PEDESTRIAN, her cell phone 
           CLATTERING across the pavement.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Shit! Oh-my-God, I’m so sorry!

           Our pedestrian has quickly retrieved her fallen phone- 

           SKYLAR’S POV:

           -standing up to reveal, TIGHTY-WHITEY, a young man sporting 
           nothing but, yup, tighty-whities, running sneakers without 
           socks, a small canvas satchel crossed diagonally over his 
           bare chest, and a freaky little boy mask with exaggerated 
           crying eyes. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Tighty-Whitey holds out the phone, inviting Skylar to reach 
           out and take it. 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, uh...

           Yet... he oddly doesn't release his grip.
                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                             (not knowing what else to 
                              say)
                        Nice costume. I’ve actually done 
                        that whole-uh... that “No Pants 
                        Subway Ride” thing, it was fun.

           By the looks of his soft-skinned physique, best guess would 
           put this guy in his early 20s. He’s just a couple inches 
           taller than Skylar, but undeniably solid as a rock. One 
           hundred and sixty pounds of pure, unadulterated, chiseled, 
           yet lean muscle. 

           Skylar draws a breath to say more, but Tighty-Whitey stares 
           at her with his head tilted, as if an alien-student of human 
           behavior. 

           Finally, he releases his grip, causing Skylar to walk slowly 
           on by him, careful not to make any sudden movements. 

           Pulling out her metro card, she-

           INT. B/C MTA STATION AT 110TH AND F.D. - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -Hurries down the stairs. 

           BEEP! 

           Through the turnstile, Skyler enters the low-lit platform, 
           discovering a GROUP OF COLUMBIA “MAN-BOYS” giving each other 
           “titty twisters,” their feet dancing all over the yellow 
           strip along the platform’s edge, marked with a form of 
           tactile braille which is meant to read, “YOU ARE TOO FUCKING 
           CLOSE TO THE PIT!”

           But men rarely think about these things, particularly boys. 
           Because they aren’t constantly afraid of being harmed. 

           Haunted with thoughts that she could be pushed by some 
           asshole onto the tracks, Skylar looks down at her sparkling 
           sneakers. Yup. They are firmly planted on tile, the line of 
           yellow a full inch away from her toes.

           Following that familiar RUSH OF AIR, a train pulls into the 
           station with a SCHREEEEECH! 

           DING-DONG! 

           The doors open, Skylar dutifully allowing PASSENGERS to exit 
           the train first before entering the crowded car.
                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (pre-recorded message)
                        This is a downtown, local-C-train. 
                        The next stop is... 103rd street.

           Entering the car, the doors close right behind Skylar, just 
           missing her fairy wings. 

                                 FEMALE (V.O.)
                             (an actual human over the 
                              intercom)
                        Stand clear of the closing doors.

           BING-BONG! 

           The train pulls away from the station with a SCHREEEEEECH!

           INT. DOWNTOWN LOCAL-C-TRAIN - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           There are only two and a half seats available on this car. 

           Nope. Not sitting in the “half seat” next to the BROAD 
           SHOULDERED MAN, 20s, “man-spreading” across one and a half 
           seats, headphones in, watching VIOLENT PORN on his phone.

           Nope. Not sitting next to a WIRY MAN WITH A WILD BEARD, 50s, 
           in a t-shirt tucked into jeans, no belt, eyes fixed straight 
           ahead. Totally looks like an ax murderer. But, I dunno, who’s 
           to say?  

           The last seat available is---

           Between a LATINA DRESSED AS A SEXY PIRATE, 30s, and a 
           PREGNANT KOREAN WOMAN, 40s. SOLD!

           Skylar plops down in the open seat.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (pre-recorded message)
                        A crowded train is no excuse for 
                        sexual misconduct. If you feel as 
                        if you’ve been the victim of a 
                        crime, please report the incident 
                        to an MTA representative. 

           POUND-POUND, POUND-POUND! 

           A TANZANIAN MAN, 60s, down the way POUNDS on the African drum 
           between his legs. 

           The PULSING BEAT, deeply primal, evokes a feeling of heat and 
           sweat and... fear. As if being chased. And not only chased, 
           but... fleeing for your fucking life.
           Sitting across from Skylar - wearing black lipliner with 
           bright-red lipstick and giant hoop earrings - a Caucasian 
           TEENAGE MOM, 15, has a stroller cradling a LITTLE BOY, barely 
           2, dressed as a pumpkin. 

           Sucking on a juice box, crumbs of cracker glued around his 
           mouth, the boy curiously takes in Skylar’s gorgeous face.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Why, hello there, little guy.

           Immediately, the boy explodes with a GIGGLE and a grin.

                                 TEENAGE MOM
                        Yeah, he likes pretty girls. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Starts young, doesn’t it.

                                 TEENAGE MOM
                        You’re tellin’ me! My sister, she 
                        got a baby-girl, and it’s so damn 
                        different! This guy. He come out 
                        punchin’ and kickin’ and... he turn 
                        every-fuckin’-little-thang into-
                        ahhh, like a gun or a knife or some 
                        shit. Even his juice box. Other 
                        day, he damn well tryin’ to shoot 
                        me with his fuckin’ apple juice, 
                        all like - BANG! BANG! - and shit, 
                        shit is crazy. But my sister. She 
                        get to play “princess” and bake 
                        cookies and shit. Every night they 
                        make a damn wish on a mother 
                        fuckin’ star, that shit ain’t fair. 

           Skylar chuckles. This young mom certainly has a kinetic, 
           “unique-New-York” charm about her. 

           SCHREEEECH! The train pulls into the 103rd street stop. 

           DING-DONG! 

           The doors open, prompting the mom to hop up and exit with her 
           stroller. No. She doesn’t say goodbye. Because that’s not 
           what New Yorkers do.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (pre-recorded)
                        This is a downtown, local-C-train. 
                        The next stop is... 96th street. 

           Unlocking her phone, Skylar finds three texts waiting.
                                 MOMMA (PREVIOUS TEXTS)
                        So great chatting! 
                             (three purple hearts)
                        Have fun tonight!

                              dress)
                        Get home safe!
                             (praying hands)

                                 FEMALE (V.O.)
                             (a human over the 
                              intercom)
                        Stand clear.

           BING-BONG! 

           The doors close. 

           SCHREEEEEECH! 

           PUSH IN ON Skylar’s phone - “GET HOME SAFE!”

           (These words act as our one and only TITLE CARD as our COLD 
           OPEN left no room for CREDITS.) 

           Skylar composes the standard reply, “I will.” 

           She waits for the train to pull into the 96th street station, 
           gifting her one bar of cell reception. 

           DING-DONG! 

           The doors open.

           She hits SEND. 

           But... the message doesn’t go through, as indicated by the 
           BRIGHT RED WORDS, “Not Delivered.”

           Because... foreshadowing is fun.

                                                                CUT TO:

           POV THROUGH THE TWO PEEPHOLES OF A MASK, UNDERSCORED BY THE 
           POUNDING OF THE AFRICAN DRUM:

           In quick cuts - from 96th all the way to 14th - we witness 
           snapshots of highly diverse, beyond interesting NEW YORKERS 
           that get on and off this swaying subway car. 

           POUND-POUND, POUND-POUND!

           But the gaze of this individual is on Skylar the entire time.
           POUND-POUND, POUND-POUND! 

           The train slows to a stop at 14th. 

           SCHREEEEECH!

           DING-DONG! 

           The doors open. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Skylar stands-

           INT. A/C/E SUBWAY STATION, 14TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -Exiting the train into the 14th street subway stop. Quickly 
           up the stairs and through the turnstile, we follow Skylar out 
           onto-  

           EXT. 8TH AVE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -14th street. 

           We follow Skylar south on 8th Avenue, passing all sorts of 
           interesting CHARACTERS IN COSTUMES:

           -SOME GUY, 20s, is covered in a bunch of gray paint swatches. 
           (Fifty Shades of Gray.) 

           -A WOMAN, 30s, wearing normal clothing, has a sign around her 
           neck that reads, “Nudist on strike!”

           -A DUDE, 40s, dressed as a box of cereal with a knife through 
           it. (Serial killer.)   

           -A YOUNG WOMAN, 20s, dressed as “Belle” from Beauty and the 
           Beast, carrying a box of tacos... from Taco BELLE! (See what 
           she did there?) 

           We clip to Skylar’s delighted expression as she pulls out her 
           phone and hits RECORD. 

           Following her eye-line, we find a WOMAN, 50s, dancing down 
           the street with the dramatic, water-like whimsy of a 
           professional thespian. Hey, it’s New York City. She’s 
           probably on Broadway. The point is, this woman has pulled 
           together the most remarkable costume. 

           Above her, she holds a Japanese, clear-plastic, bubble 
           umbrella, artistically transformed into a jelly fish, her 
           flowing dress purposed to resemble its hanging tentacles. 
           As she dances, the woman has a smile fixed on her face, a 
           true artist, someone who lives in a dream-space filled with 
           color and light. It’s sheer poetry in motion.

           A fellow artist, Skylar finds herself quite moved by the awe 
           and wonder that can be found on the streets of New York City. 

           With a smirk, Skylar draws in a nice, deep breath and EXHALES 
           heavily, savoring a newfound... hope. 

           Until---

           A MAN in an expensive business suit, 30s, carrying a 
           briefcase, walks by her, aggressively grabbing her bloomer-
           covered ass under her tutu, and whispering violently-

                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        I’m gonna make you wet!

           [No. I did not go too far here. This has actually happened to 
           me. My friend had a similar experience where a stranger 
           declared, “I’m gonna cum in your ass!” But I digress.] 

           Weirdly continuing to walk on his “merry” way, the man in the 
           suit doesn’t even glance back at her, leaving Skylar utterly 
           dumbfounded.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (loudly, to herself)
                        Wow... Okay.

           Continuing down 8th Ave, we further witness the true, 
           pressurized frenzy of what Halloween night can feel like on 
           the wild, unpredictable island of Manhattan, a carnival on 
           crack. 

           For those who are really paying attention, and not everyone 
           should notice it, but Tighty-Whitey should barely be 
           noticeable in the background on one or two occasions. 

           POV FROM A SLIGHT DISTANCE:

           An OMINOUS PRESENCE is stalking our fairy from a block back.

           The pace of this individual quickens.

           Crossing the street, moving in for the kill.

           Coming upon Skylar, this person grabs her from behind.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                             (startled)
                        FUCK!
           BACK TO SCENE:

           Laughing and hopping around, ANDRA, 30, sports a super dope, 
           homemade, leather, “vampire hunter” outfit - two wooden 
           stakes harnessed at each hip, a large cross and a string of 
           fake garlic around her neck.

                                 ANDRA
                        Got ya!

                                 SKYLAR
                             (pronounced, “ANNE-dra”)
                        Oh-my-God, Andra! Not cool!

           Playfully poking at her ribs-

                                 ANDRA
                        Look at you, you little slut! 
                        Aren’t you cold?!

                                 SKYLAR
                        I’m fucking freezing!

                                 ANDRA
                        Well, let’s get your ass inside so 
                        you can suck alllllll the dicks!

           The ladies flash their I.D.s at a LARGE BOUNCER, 40s, then 
           plunge into-

           INT. WEST VILLAGE, FIRST DIVE BAR - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -The heart of a very small, yet extremely lively bar-

           Christmas lights and very random, very kitschy knick-knacks 
           hanging from the ceiling and walls. 

           We follow Skylar and Andra as they push through a group of- 

           GORGEOUSLY ANDROGYNOUS MEN DRESSED AS VICTORIA’S SECRET 
           ANGELS. 

           Crossing the crowded room, they land at a busy bar - FOUR 
           BARTENDERS and TWO BAR-BACKS working their asses off.

           The MUSIC blaring, Skylar shouts-

                                 SKYLAR
                        What do you want? Red?!

                                 ANDRA
                        Prosecco!
                                 SKYLAR
                        I’ll get the first round!

           They press closer to the bar, but won’t be able to order for 
           a minute. It’s crazy in here.

                                 ANDRA
                        Greg and those guys should be here 
                        already!

           Skylar finds a gap at the bar, wedging herself in the empty 
           spot, the FEMALE BARTENDER, dressed as a unicorn, pointing at 
           her.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Prosecco! And a gin and tonic!

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                        What kinda gin?!

                                 SKYLAR
                        You got Greenhook?

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER
                        Yup!

           Skylar hands over her credit card. 

                                 FEMALE BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        Open or closed?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Open for now!

                                 ANDRA
                             (shouting across the bar)
                        Greg! Greg!! Over here!

           Reveal-

           Beer in hand, GREG, late 20s, dressed as a vampire, pushes 
           his way to the bar.

                                 ANDRA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit! Should’ah picked 
                        somethin’ else, man, you gonna die!

           Pulling a wooden spike from the leather harness around her 
           hips, Andra pretends to “stake” Greg who fakes a dramatic 
           death. 

           Grabbing their drinks from the bar-
                                 SKYLAR
                        Where is everybody?!

                                 GREG
                        Over there! In the corner!

           As the three make their way to their GROUP OF FRIENDS-

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Question. You ladies wanna roll 
                        tonight? I got some good shit!

                                 SKYLAR
                             (with a shrug)
                        Maybe!

           Greg continuing to lead them-

                                 ANDRA
                             (private “girl talk”)
                        What’s your hesitation?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Last time... we rolled for like... 
                        fourteen hours.

                                 ANDRA
                        I know, riiiiiight?

                                 SKYLAR
                        I just- I mean- I don’t wanna do it 
                        if we’re not sticking together, you 
                        know, what’s the plan?

                                 ANDRA
                        Oh, I’m not looking to hook-up with 
                        anyone or anything. What about you?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Honestly? I’m so over it right now. 
                        Can we just roll our faces off and 
                        Uber it up later?

                                 ANDRA
                        Totally!

           Coming upon their FRIENDS, Greg slips everyone their own 
           clear pill with white power inside. Molly.

                                 GREG
                        And one for you. And one for you.

           Greg lifts his beer, the others following suit.
                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        See you on the other side, party 
                        people!

           Skylar and Andra CLINK their glasses and wash down the Molly 
           with booze...

           UP ON - “Apeshit,” by Beyoncé and Jay-Z... 

           A dizzying delight of drinking, dancing, and debauchery. 

           A) INT. WEST VILLAGE, FIRST DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Greg dancing his ass off, dropping to the floor, the group 
           surrounding him in a circle, egging him on.

           B) INT. WEST VILLAGE, BAR TWO - NIGHT

           Andra spanking one of her friends dressed as a DONKEY, Skylar 
           twerking all over him.

           C) INT. WEST VILLAGE, BAR THREE - NIGHT

           INSTA story of Skylar taking video of the crew doing a Jager 
           Bomb. 

           D) INT. WEST VILLAGE, BAR FOUR - NIGHT

           The whole gang is hilariously cuddled on a very small couch, 
           touching each other’s faces, rubbing each other’s arms and 
           giving each other shoulder massages, all thanks to “Molly.”

           E) INT. WEST VILLAGE, BAR FIVE - NIGHT

           We see a series of silly SNAPCHAT filters of Skylar and 
           Andra, applying a “Dog Face,” “Flower Crown,” etc, upon their 
           likeness, laughing their asses off.

           F) INT. WEST VILLAGE, BAR SIX - NIGHT

           Skylar finds herself enamored with the display of blinking 
           lights all about this place, in all the colors, not quite 
           realizing that her crew has gotten smaller and smaller, each 
           waving goodbye and filtering out to some other, unknown 
           adventure. 

           The last to head out is Greg, leaving Skylar and Andra in-
           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR, UPSTAIRS - 2 A.M.

           -A little hole in the wall near Jane Street.

           EXPLODING BACK TO REAL TIME: 

           Pulling her gaze from the “dancing” of her surroundings-

                                 SKYLAR
                        You still rollin’?

                                 ANDRA
                        Yup. How you doin’?

                                 SKYLAR
                             (nodding)
                        I feel... happy and... cold.

                                 ANDRA
                             (a laugh)
                        Yeah, you’re not wearing much!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Also... I gotta pee!

           Skylar heads toward the most obvious place for a bathroom.

                                 ANDRA
                             (calling after her)
                        Hey! You want another G-and-T?!

           Skylar answers by throwing up both hands and swirling the air 
           with her two index fingers as if a fucking rock star.

                                 ANDRA (CONT’D)
                        BAM!

           THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. The music swells as we track with--

           Skylar--

           Through the ever thinning “crowd.” 

           On her way, she asks a super-hot, super-gay BARTENDER DRESSED 
           AS THE DEVIL-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Bathroom?!

                                 DEVIL BARTENDER
                        To the left, baby-boo, down the 
                        stairs!
           Pressing further still, Skylar finds a set of metal stairs 
           leading down a dark “deep throat,” straight into the “belly 
           of the beast.” 

           Tracking her, the-

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR, DOWNSTAIRS - 2 A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -THUMP, THUMP, THUMP of the music falls slightly muted from 
           above, Skylar walking down a long, New York style “railroad” 
           hallway that seems to go on forever. 

           Finally, she comes upon one unisex bathroom. 

           Typical New York. 

           She tries the knob. JIGGLE-JIGGLE. But it’s occupied.

           THUMP, THUMP, THUMP. The music is even quieter back here, 
           evoking a sense of isolation in this dark, redbrick-tunnel.

           In need of a distraction, she unzips her GANGSTA “fanny” and 
           pulls forth her phone, happy to discover a text from “MOMMA.”

                                 MOMMA (PREVIOUS TEXT)

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Will do!
                             (three double-high-fives)

           After hitting send, three gray dots immediately appear, 
           indicating her mom’s rapid reply. 

           Skylar’s eyes dart to the top of her phone. 

           2:18am. 

           Battery life: 8% 

           Fuck. 

           Looks like she’s been too busy living real life to worry 
           about battery life. 

           Frustrated, she tries the knob again - JIGGLE-JIGGLE! 

           But someone’s most definitely in there. 

           Her face screams, “Hurry up, I need to pee! If that wasn’t 
           the case, I wouldn’t be standing in this fucking creepy 
           hallway! Obviously.”

                        Oh, hi! You’re still awake?! 

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        I’m still OUT! What are you doing 
                        awake?

                        I’m a night owl. You know me.

                        I am! Currently rolling with Andra!

                        You meet a face you want to sit on 
                        yet? HA!
                             (monkey covering its ears)
                        I still can’t visualize that.

                        dare you! No, I
                             (three doggy faces)
                        dare you!

                        Yeah, right! I’ll get arrested!

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        LOL! What country do you think we 
                        live in?!

           Gray dots dance with a promised reply, but-

           FINALLY-

           The door swings open.

           Skylar’s gaze rising to meet, yup, you guessed it--

           Tighty-Whitey. 
           “What the fuck?!” 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Oh.

           His left hand still holds the knob of the bathroom door, his 
           fingers carrying the smudge of RED on them, most likely from 
           a marker, but still, the image is unsettling.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Finished?

           Without a word, Tighty-Whitey steps to the side, allowing her 
           “safe passage.” 

           Fearlessly, she moves right by him, and-

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR, BATHROOM - 2 A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -SLAM! 

           Locking the door immediately, Skylar finds herself in a tiny 
           bathroom with raw-wood paneling, smothered in harmless 
           graffiti, displaying a wide spectrum of intelligence and 
           humor. 

           Unfortunately, Skylar also turns to find the toilet 
           completely filled with... shit.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Oh, fuck! Unbelievable.

           With her foot, she presses the toilet handle. FLUUUUUSH! 

           Desperate to pee, she quickly pulls down her bloomers, 
           glitter tights, Hanky Panky panties and hovers over the 
           toilet. 

           PPSSSSSSSS! We hear a strong stream of urine hitting the 
           porcelain, Skylar watching from between her legs, careful her 
           aim is on point, not wanting to piss on her shoes.

           PPSSSSSSSS! As she waits for her very full bladder to empty- 

           Skylar notices fresh RED MARKER written across the sea of 
           bathroom graffiti, proclaiming two words: “THE DISRUPTERS”

           TINKLE, TINKLE, TINKLE... SILENCE. 

           Pulling up her undies, glitter tights and bloomers, Skylar 
           washes her hands-
           Catching a glimpse of herself in the old, beveled mirror, her 
           reflection compromised in a very strange way. 

           CLIP! Unlocking the door, Skyler enters-

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR, DOWNSTAIRS - 2 A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -The hallway where she... comes face-to-mask with Tighty-
           Whitey again.

           “Seriously! What the actual fuck?!”

                                 SKYLAR
                             (with a gasp)
                        Fuck! Dude! Really?!  

           Livid, Skylar marches down the hallway, Tighty-Whitey 
           following, ever so slowly. 

           “Feeling” him behind her, she stops. 

           He stops. 

           She takes a step. 

           He does the same. 

           Turning, Skylar squares off with him, summoning her 
           metaphorical “mountain” from deep within.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        You got a problem, buddy?

           THUMP, THUMP, THUMP goes the MUTED MUSIC. 

           No reply.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Look. I know it’s Halloween and 
                        all, but... I don’t scare easy, 
                        so... go find someone else to fuck 
                        with, got it?!

           Again. No reply. 

           No movement. 

           Nothing. 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Fucking! Asshole!
           Marching up the stairs defiantly, Skylar hits her sneakers 
           against the metal steps, making her point abundantly clear. 

           POUND, POUND, POUND!

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR, UPSTAIRS - 2 A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           Emerging from downstairs, Skylar’s face relaxes now that 
           she’s among the protection of other humans, albeit strangers. 

           The place is pretty empty at this point. The bar closes at 3 
           A.M., after all.

           Her eyes scan for a familiar face.

                                 ANDRA (O.S.)
                        Skylar!

           Andra waves at Skylar from the bar, having found them two 
           seats. Regarding the gin and tonic waiting for her-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Is that mine?

                                 ANDRA
                        Yeah, don’t worry, I’ve kept an eye 
                        on it. Roofie-free-guarantee.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Thanks, babe.

           The two CLINK their glasses together, Andra having switched 
           to red wine. After a sip-

                                 ANDRA
                        Skylar! This is Peter!

           REVEAL - PETER, 30s, a delicious looking man, dressed as a 
           Chippendale dancer. Skylar’s eyes widen. Damn.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Uh... hi! Nice to meet you!

           Peter reaches out, offering a kind handshake.

                                 PETER
                             (thick, German accent)
                        Hallo! So nice to meet with you!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah, me too! Where are you from?!
                                 PETER
                        I, uh... I come from Germany, 
                        but... I am so sorry, I... I did 
                        not complete my learning for 
                        English. I do, uh... I do 
                        automobiles. 

                                 ANDRA
                        He fixes cars! In Frankfurt!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Right! Cool!

                                 PETER
                        But they are nice cars. Good ones.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Luxury?

                                 PETER
                        That’s it, exactly! I, uh... I come 
                        here to-uh... to know the city. 
                        It’s cool. It’s good.

           Leaning in, Andra whispers-

                                 ANDRA
                        So... it’s getting late and... I 
                        sorta... Would you hate me if... I 
                        took him home. Do you mind?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Oh-my-God, not at all!

                                 ANDRA
                        I know we said no hook-ups, but-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Andra! Honestly! If you don’t fuck 
                        the shit out of that man, I’m going 
                        to be very disappointed in you!

                                 ANDRA
                        He’s sweet, riiiiight?

                                 SKYLAR
                        He’s so sweet. And fucking 
                        gorgeous.

                                 ANDRA
                        I know... I kind of want him all-up-
                        in-my-mouth.

           Pulling Andra in, Skylar hugs her neck. In her ear-
                                 SKYLAR
                        You have condoms?

                                 ANDRA
                        I do.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Have fun.

           Hopping off the stool, Andra wraps her arms around Peter’s 
           upsettingly perfect torso.

                                 ANDRA
                        Hey. You wanna go home with me?

           Peter’s eyes widen with surprise.

                                 PETER
                        Uh... sorry, my English, I... are 
                        you telling me to...

                                 ANDRA
                        I wanna have sex with you. 

           Shyly, Peter practically giggles, almost blushing.

                                 ANDRA (CONT’D)
                             (a playful grin)
                        Does that translate, or...?

                                 PETER
                        Yes. Yes, of course. I want to. 
                        Thank you.

                                 ANDRA
                        All-righty-then. 
                             (to Skylar)
                        Love you!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Love you!
                             (to Peter)
                        Nice meeting you!

           Confidently, Andra grabs Peter’s hand, leading him from the 
           bar, technically ditching Skylar, but... oh, well... plans 
           change. 

           Welcome to New York Fucking City.

           MASK PEEPHOLE POV:

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE, EXHALE. 
           We watch as Andra leaves Skylar’s side. 

           Alone, Skylar takes a sip of her cocktail, then pulls her 
           phone from her “fanny.”

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 MOMMA (PREVIOUS TEXT)
                        Honestly? I don’t know what country 
                        we live in anymore.

           Skylar composes and sends-

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        You still awake?

           Pretty immediately-

                                 MOMMA (TEXT)
                        Oh, hi! You doing okay?

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Andra met a hottie. Took him home.

                        She’s a lucky son of a bitch.

           Battery life: 6%. 

           “Shit! This is officially really bad.”

           Skylar turns to see if Andra’s left yet. She has.

                                 MOMMA (TEXT)
                        Forget looks. You need to meet a 
                        man that’s SWEET like your brother.

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Mom. That’s gross.
                             (TEXT)
                        Also. We’re failing that test 
                        again.

                                 MOMMA (TEXT)
                        Right! HA! 

           Skylar takes a look around the bar, struck by the fact that 
           the one person who matters most to her is halfway across the 
           country, communicating through a pocket-sized computer.

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Mom?

                                 MOMMA (TEXT)
                        Yes, sweetie?
           CLOSE ON PHONE SCREEN as Skylar types, “I don’t know what 
           I’ll do when I can’t talk to you everyday.” 

           Without sending, she adds, “Please don’t die. Please?” 

           But... she deletes this and simply writes, “I love you.” 

           She sends.

                        I love you.

                        I love you, Skylar. You’ve always 
                        given me so much joy.

                        I love it when you say that. You

           We clock the BARTENDERS starting to button up for the 
           evening, the “Devil” collecting the plethora of tips 
           scattered along the length of the liquor soaked, oakwood bar. 

           For the first time, Skylar notices that not only is he 
           dressed as the devil, but he has a puppet that looks like a 
           “Donald Trump type” attached to the front of his black 
           leather pants, as if sucking the dick of the devil.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Hey! I hate to be “that person,” 
                        but... you mind charging my phone?

                                 DEVIL BARTENDER
                        Sorry, honey. We don’t do that 
                        anymore. It’s too much of a 
                        liability. Phone’s get stolen and 
                        shit.

                                 SKYLAR
                        I’m seriously about to die and it’s 
                        my Uber ride home.

                                 DEVIL BARTENDER
                        Buck-up-baby, trains run all night.

           Turning, he “pools” fistfuls of cash into a tip-collector.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (softly, genuinely)
                        I know, but... my stop’s honest-to-
                        God under construction. Otherwise, 
                        I’m walking, like, three avenue 
                        blocks with my ass hanging out.

                                 DEVIL BARTENDER
                             (softening)
                        Your neighborhood busy at night? 
                        With people around?

                                 SKYLAR
                             (shaking her head)
                        Like a friggin’ ghost town.

                                 DEVIL BARTENDER
                        Yeah... that’s the problem. Only 
                        time I ever feel unsafe in this 
                        city is... when no one’s around.

           MASK PEEPHOLE POV:

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE. 
           From across the bar, the “Devil” takes Skylar’s phone to 
           charge it.

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 DEVIL BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                        But you gotta keep it quiet, or 
                        I’ll get my asscheeks handed to me.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Promise. Thank you. Oh, thank you, 
                        thank you.

                                 DEVIL BARTENDER
                        No worries, honey.

           The bartender cups his hand on the side of her face. 
           Mirroring his action, Skylar does the same.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (”Molly” talking)
                        Hi. I’m Skylar.

                                 TRISTEN
                             (a chuckle)
                        Hi. I’m Tristen.

           And this is when two humans, somewhere in the West Village, 
           in the middle of a small bar, on Halloween, smile at one 
           another with their eyes. 

           (It’s amazing, isn’t it, how safe a woman can feel in the 
           hands of a good man?) 

                                 TRISTEN (CONT’D)
                        You have a... a really good soul, 
                        Skylar. 
                             (after a beat)
                        I should know. I’m the mother 
                        fuckin’ devil!

           Laughing together, Tristen leans in, kissing Skylar on each 
           cheek - which she happily accepts - and then continues 
           buttoning up his barely busy bar. 

           Sitting back, Skylar grabs her cocktail, just able to take 
           one sip before discovering---

           A CAVEMAN DOUCHE, early-30s, nestling up next to her at the 
           bar. 

           The first part of this nickname is derived from the fact that 
           this man is actually dressed as a caveman.
           But of the unimaginative, historically inaccurate variety, 
           the bad version of Fred Flintstone. 

           The second part of this nickname - his “Douche” surname - was 
           chosen simply because this man reeks of bro.  

           The smugness of his smile, the pride in his jaw, the dim 
           light in his eyes, the puff of his chest, his full head of 
           thick hair, his 6’4” frame, his arms like tree trunks, the 
           way he holds his beer bottle so “casually” at the neck - all 
           speak to the fact that this person actually believes he’s a 
           god of the highest order, deserving of worship.

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                             (thick, Southern accent)
                        You know he’s gay, right?

           Skylar’s metaphorical “drawbridge” that had just been lowered 
           for Tristen, immediately pulls up again, “archers” lining the 
           tall, stone walls of her heart, readying their bows. Robed in 
           splendor, the Queen of Skylar’s “soul-castle” fearlessly 
           steps forward and calls out into the night, with the 
           authority of Hera herself, “Who fuckin’ goes there?!”

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE (CONT’D)
                        Just thought I’d let ya know. In 
                        case you got your hopes up.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (in a high-pitched voice)
                        He’s gay? Oh-my-God, I’m so upset, 
                        I need to call my mom and cancel 
                        the weddiiiing.

           She takes a drink, silently praying that he’ll take his 
           privileged, straight-white-male, AXE-body-spray wearing, 
           leopard-printed self and fuck right off. 

           But Caveman simply glances over his shoulder at his hovering 
           DOUCHE-BRO-WINGMAN, early 30s, dressed as “THING TWO” from 
           Dr. Seuss.

           In the long mirror behind the bar, Skylar QUICKLY catches a 
           glimpse of Tighty-Whitey’s reflection in the background.

           She turns to get a better look, but suddenly, he’s gone. 

           Her eyes narrow, on high alert, but-

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Too bad you’re brunette. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Why’s that?
                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                             (with a “casual” shrug)
                        I like redheads.

           Finally, she tilts her head toward him.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You ever notice how women rarely, 
                        if ever, reduce men to a fucking 
                        hair color?

           To his buddy, “Thing Two,” who remains hovering-

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Oooooooooo! We got ourselves a 
                        feisty one over here!

           “Thing Two” laughs, whacking Caveman Douche on the arm, these 
           two a tragic, modern, American version of Gaston and LeFou. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Think about it. I could go from 
                        blonde to red to blue and back 
                        again in a day. It’s not magic. 
                        It’s peroxide. And food coloring.

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                             (delighted)
                        Damn. You’re a full blown man-
                        eater, aren’t ya?

                                 SKYLAR
                        No. I just call bullshit on the 
                        whole... hair thing.
                             (observing his face)
                        Curious. How many women have you 
                        been able to convince... to dye 
                        their hair red to please you? 

           Caveman rolls his eyes, not taking her seriously in the 
           least.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Dude. It’s shitty. Really shitty to 
                        reduce a woman to something so 
                        fucking inconsequential.

           Caveman checks in with “Thing Two” again, confused by this 
           mashing of words that make absolutely no sense.

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Okaaaay. 
                             (with a laugh, to Skylar)
                        I still like redheads though. 
                                 SKYLAR
                        You know what? Forget it. I don’t 
                        need to explain it to you.

           Suddenly, “sincerely”-

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        No. Try me. I’m a smart guy. 
                        Explain it me.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (after a sip)
                        It’s about control. Whether you 
                        know it or not. This obsession with 
                        our hair, the color of it, the 
                        length of it. It’s such an obvious 
                        holdover... this customization of 
                        women... this little game little 
                        boys play to feel like men. But 
                        real men don’t play those games. 
                        They don’t play “Rock, Paper, 
                        Scissors” with blondes and 
                        brunettes and redheads. Short hair, 
                        long hair, shaved head - shouldn’t 
                        matter.

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Yeah, but... there’s gotta be 
                        attraction, right? I mean... you 
                        can’t discount individual 
                        preference altogether.

                                 SKYLAR
                        I understand preference and 
                        attraction, fine. But, typically... 
                        women don’t engage in the same way. 

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        And how do you engage?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Has any woman ever made you feel 
                        like your hair had the power to 
                        alter your worth in some way?

           He only grins. A failed attempt at “modesty”-

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        I mean... I got good genes, so... 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Well, there you go. Men don’t 
                        suffer the-hair-thing unless 
                        they’re fucking losing it.

                        And even then, most women still 
                        don’t give a shit. You’re the ones 
                        who make a thing of it.

                        A woman is far greater than the sum 
                        of the strands of protein sprouting 
                        from her goddamn head.

           Having earned a drink, Skylar takes a long sip of gin. 

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Listen... we got off on the wrong 
                        foot here. At heart... I’m really a 
                        nice guy. Seriously. You can ask 
                        anyone, anyone I know. I’m a 
                        gentleman. Honestly. Gimme a break. 

                                 SKYLAR
                             (doubtfully, plainly)
                        Yeeeeah... nooooo. I know what a 
                        gentleman looks like... and I don’t 
                        believe you’re one of them. 

           “Thoughtfully,” he turns, leaning his back against the bar, 
           conjuring a strange, fabricated “humanity.” Skylar studies 
           his face. It’s filled with a dramatized sort of “conviction.” 
           And Skylar knows theatre all too well. 

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Come on... Smile.  

           Skylar drops her face. “Dude. Seriously?”

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE (CONT’D)
                        I bet you gotta gorgeous smile. 
                        Don’t keep it all to yourself. 
                             (after no comply)
                        My favorite Aunt. Aunt Janiece. She 
                        lives down the street from me, in 
                        Tennessee. She’s a feminist, too. 
                        Real strong, real smart lady. But 
                        still, she used to tell me that... 
                        no matter how strong women get... 
                        it’s always gonna be a pretty gal’s 
                        job to light up the room.
                             (a small beat)
                        Bet you could light up this whole 
                        damn bar with just one grin.
           After another sip of gin-

                                 SKYLAR
                        My mom... she spent her whole life 
                        lighting up rooms... smiling for 
                        men. Putting a spring in their 
                        step. Making them feel better about 
                        themselves. More able to face the 
                        fucking day.
                             (a beat)
                        And now... she’s old, and dying... 
                        at home, alone, in a King-sized 
                        bed. Her hair is gone. Her breasts 
                        are gone. But she’s still got that 
                        smile, boy. A smile that could set 
                        this whole fucking city on fire... 
                        But none of those men... not one of 
                        them... could give a shit. And the 
                        only one who ever did give a shit? 
                        Is dead.

           As if he barely heard her, the Caveman continues to smirk, 
           “playfully” nudging her arm, as if they’re about to kiss for 
           the first time on Prom night, Sophomore year.

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Smiiiile. Just once. For me. And I 
                        promise, I’ll leave you alone.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You want me to bark and roll over, 
                        too? Beg for a treat? 

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Damn. You got a boyfriend or 
                        somethin’?

                                 SKYLAR
                        No. I’m just not interested.

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                             (to his friend)
                        She’s got a boyfriend or somethin’, 
                        I don’t know.

                                 SKYLAR
                        So... the only way you’ll hear a no 
                        from me, is if I’m another man’s 
                        property?

           The Southern “gentleman” suddenly disappearing-

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Shit! You’re a fuckin’ bitch!
                                 SKYLAR
                        That’s right, you got me, I’m a 
                        bitch, I’m Queen of the bitches.

           In the mirror, Skylar catches sight of Tighty-Whitey pulling 
           his phone from the satchel slung across his chest. Meanwhile-

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        It’s Halloween! In New York City! 
                        We’re supposed to be havin’ fun! 
                        Why’d you dress like that if you’re 
                        not out to have fun?!

                                 SKYLAR
                        It doesn’t matter how I’m dressed, 
                        asshole! I could be naked right now 
                        and still tell you no!

           QUICK GLIMPSE of Tighty-Whitey pressing in closer. But Skylar 
           can barely make sense of it with Caveman Douche in her ear-

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        I’m a good guy, I’m tellin’ you!

                                 SKYLAR
                        No, you’re not! You’ve just been 
                        told that for so long, you actually 
                        believe it, but it’s not true!

                      CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                                                     SKYLAR (CONT'D)
                 (to his buddy)
           Can you believe this, this is 
           actually happening. It’s 
           kinda funny. Wish I had 
           popcorn.
                                              You are not kind! 
                                              You are not charming! 
                                              You’re not even all that 
                                              interesting!

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        I like redheads, you crazy bitch!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Great! Then go find a ginger that 
                        can half-way tolerate your ass and - 
                        Leave me! The fuck! Alone!

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                             (”light bulb” moment)
                        You’re a lesbian, aren’t you?

                                 SKYLAR
                        So what if I was?! Why would that 
                        fucking matter?!
                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                             (with a laugh)
                        It’d explain a lot, trust me!

           With that, the Queen inside Skylar’s metaphorical soul-castle 
           commands the archers to launch a wall of deadly arrows at 
           this Neanderthal. 

           “DIE, MOTHER FUCKER!”

                                 SKYLAR
                        Why can you not hear the word NO?! 
                        It’s fucking fascinating! You think 
                        you’re so goddamn special that I - 
                        ONE, have to be a lesbian or, TWO, 
                        a man-hating feminist, or, THREE, 
                        have a boyfriend - in order to not 
                        regret the fact that I failed to 
                        throw some Red-Dye-Number-Two in my 
                        fucking hair before I arrived in 
                        order to fight for your fleeting 
                        attention! You can call me whatever 
                        the fuck you want, project whatever 
                        you need to in order to make 
                        yourself feel better, but Time is 
                        Up, mother fucker! You can’t just 
                        club me over the head and drag me 
                        back to your man-cave by my brown 
                        hair and have your way with me! 
                        Those days are fucking over! I know 
                        it’s hard for you ass-wipes to 
                        grasp, I get why you cling so 
                        closely to the comfort of denial, 
                        because, sure, biologically 
                        speaking, yes, for centuries you’ve 
                        had the upper hand! You’re bigger 
                        than I am! You’re stronger! 
                        Congratu-fuckin’-lations! But we 
                        live in a time that my biology 
                        doesn’t matter anymore, because NOW 
                        my fucking words matter! They carry 
                        legal goddamn weight, asshole! And 
                        right now, in this moment, my word 
                        for you is - NO!!!

           The few PATRONS left have been watching this drama unfold. 
           Keep in mind, however, these New Yorkers have seen some crazy 
           shit go down before, so, no one has their jaw dropped, per 
           se. But they are enjoying this bit of intrigue. 

           Oddly... Caveman Douche remains calm, staring at Skylar with 
           a smirk on his face, until---

           At whip-speed, he grabs Skylar throwing her over his shoulder-
           Parading her around, like some prize he’s won at the country 
           fair.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE FUCK?!!! LET ME GO!!! 

           Her limbs flailing about, Skylar fights against this large 
           man as if being accosted. 

           And that is precisely what is happening. 

           CLOSE ON HER FACE, red from the exertion of her screaming, 
           every fiber of her being willing it to STOP! 

           It’s agonizing. 

           Nauseating. 

           Humiliating. 

           For a grown, adult woman to be rendered so helpless.

           It’s meant to be a violent reminder that, no matter what 
           Skylar says, she’s still “only” a woman. 

           WIDE ON - this establishment has morphed from mild curiosity 
           to the age-old, bloodlust of a ROARING coliseum. 

           [Also, I shit you not, this has actually happened to me.]

           SKYLAR’S POV: 

           As if spinning on a manic turntable, Skylar suffers a barrage 
           of MEN and WOMEN alike, screaming and cheering, all too 
           pleased that the “buzz-kill” has finally been silenced, the 
           holiday festivities back on track.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Put me down, you fucking 
                        asshole!!!! Let me go, goddamnit!!!

           SPIN, SPIN, SPIN. 

           We catch three glimpses of Tighty-Whitey in the “front row” 
           with his phone held up. “Is he RECORDING VIDEO of this?!” 

           Finally, her feet hit the ground again... 

           BACK TO SCENE: 

           Wasting no time, Skylar hits Caveman’s tree trunk arms again 
           and again, but even with her brass knuckles, all he can do is 
           laugh, as if they’re having a pillow fight.
                      SKYLAR (CONT’D)
           Do not touch me! Don’t you 
           touch anyone without their 
           fucking permission! No! Fuck 
           you! Fuck you!
                                                     CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                                              Get your fuckin’ panties out 
                                              of a wad! I was just tryin’ 
                                              to make you smile! Lighten 
                                              up, you crazy bitch!

           With that, she takes her leave of him with one last-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Asshole!

           Tracking with her, we move backward, Skylar marching through-

           EXT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR - 2 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -The door, exploding from the bar in all hell-fury.

           Over one full block, we see up close and very personal Skylar 
           successfully fighting back salty tears like a champ.

           The streets are far quieter than they were before.

           Suddenly, Skylar stops, having realized something terrible. 
           Her face drops, crestfallen. She peers over her right 
           shoulder, then back toward us again.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck!

           Whipping around, Skylar marches back to the bar. 

           We track with Skylar again, this time from behind, the street 
           lamps above saturating her sparkling fairy wings in a pale 
           yellow glow.

           Bravely, she bursts-

           INT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR, UPSTAIRS - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

           -Into the bar, right by Caveman and “Thing Two.”

                                 CAVEMAN DOUCHE
                        Ooooooo! Back for more, baby-girl?!

           Without looking, she flips him a strong MIDDLE FINGER.

           Walking the full length of the bar, as far away from Caveman 
           as possible- 
           Skylar squares off with a MALE BARTENDER, 20s, dressed as 
           “ELEVEN” from Stranger Things - the shaved head version with 
           cardigan, 1980s cotton dress, and a drop of fake blood 
           painted from his right nostril down to his upper lip.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Hi! Sorry, uh... I’m looking for 
                        Tristen?

                                 ELEVEN
                        Nah, he took off already. 

           “Eleven” throws down a cardboard, beer-soaked coaster, 
           advertising some low-shelf Tequila.

                        What are ya drinkin’?

                                 SKYLAR
                        No, I-uh... he was charging my 
                        phone for me.

                                 ELEVEN
                        We don’t do that anymore.

                                 SKYLAR
                        I know, but- 
                             (on the “down-low”)
                        He did me a solid, please don’t get 
                        him in trouble.

           “Eleven” grazes the shoulder of a very hard working bar-back, 
           ALEJANDRO, 40s, bringing a fresh rack of glasses to the bar.

           NOTE: All dialogue in BOLD is in SPANISH.

                                 ELEVEN
                        Alejandro! Was Tristen charging a 
                        phone for someone? Do you know?

                                 ALEJANDRO
                        Shit! Yes! He gave it to me, but- I 
                        forgot, it was so fucking crazy 
                        tonight!

           Alejandro pulls Skylar’s phone from his back pocket. 

                                 ALEJANDRO (CONT’D)
                             (in English, to Skylar)
                        I’m so sorry, mi amor!

                                 ELEVEN
                        No, fuck her! This shit is not our 
                        problem!
           “Eleven” holds up the phone to Skylar.

                                 ELEVEN (CONT’D)
                        This yours?

           But this Texan responds in Spanish, making clear to “Eleven” 
           that she heard every word. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah, it’s mine.

                                 ELEVEN
                        Oh. Sorry. I didn’t know.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (with a sigh)
                        It’s fine, you’re right. It’s not 
                        your problem.

           Taking the phone, Skylar finds - 

           Battery life: 2%

           10 missed calls.

           14 INSTA messages.

           13 iMessages.

                        for last call. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Nah... I’m good.

           Getting high really isn’t the best idea sometimes, because- 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I need to close out! Fuck.

                                 ELEVEN

                                 SKYLAR
                        London. 

           Signing the bill, Skylar shoves her card in her “fanny,” and 
           hurries out of the bar. 

           Back on the-
           EXT. WEST VILLAGE DIVE BAR - 2 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -Street, Skylar immediately opens UBER, but with so many 
           people out tonight, the APP searches and searches, but cannot 
           find her a ride. It is Halloween, after all.

           Chilled against the cold, Skylar clicks back to her HOME 
           SCREEN to check her missed iMessages, all from Andra. 

           The frantic string of texts looks something like this:

                                 ANDRA (PREVIOUS TEXTS)

                        I’m so sorry I left you! I’m such a 
                        dick!!! 

           Dumbfounded, Skylar finds a DM from Andra in her INSTA, a 
           FORWARDED VIDEO from “The Disrupters” INSTAGRAM STORY. 

           CLICKING on it, to her surprise, Skylar finds a VIDEO OF 
           HERSELF from no more than fifteen minutes ago.

                                 SKYLAR (ON PHONE)
                        “-but Time is Up, mother fucker! 
                        You can’t just club me over the 
                        head and drag me back to your-”
           There she is, displayed before the entire virtual world to 
           see, screaming at Caveman as if she had been the unnecessary 
           aggressor, his hands held up in defense. 

                                 SKYLAR (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        “-man-cave by my brown hair and 
                        have your way with me! Those days 
                        are fucking over!”

           As the VIDEO continues, Skylar reads the caption below it: 

           “Look at this bitch mouthing off to a perfectly nice guy who 
           simply said HELLO! Is this what America has come to?!”

                                 SKYLAR (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        “I know it’s hard for you ass-wipes 
                        to grasp, I get why you cling so 
                        closely to the comfort of denial-”

           “Who wants to pay some serious (Bitcoin symbol) to watch us 
           RAPE the whore?! #FuckYouMeToo #TimesUpBitch #TheDisrupters”

                                 SKYLAR (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        “-because, sure, biologically 
                        speaking, yes, for centuries-”

           Skylar CLICKS to the profile page, boasting over 87,000 
           followers, the handle: “The_DISRUPT3RS_37”

           Her video has also just been posted there. 

           Among the slew of immediate “Troll” comments: 

           -“Love this! Just transferred you some coin!” 

           -”You guys are the beeeeeeest! They keep deleting you, but 
           you keep on cumming back!”

           -”This shit is hilarious”

           -”#Disrupters4everrrr Pown the bitch”

           -”ROFL shes fucking spazzing out!”

           -”LOL Id totally hit it but shes not hot”

                                 SKYLAR (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        “-you’ve had the upper hand! You’re 
                        bigger than I am! You’re stronger! 
                        Congratu---” 

           CUT TO BLACK.

           Her phone has died... 
           BACK ON SKYLAR in disbelief. 

           She finally looks up, scanning the street for signs of Tighty-
           Whitey. 

           Nothing. 

           No one is around.

           Rushing to the street, Skylar tries to wave down - one, two, 
           three, four - passing yellow cabs, but they’re all full. In 
           this “witching hour,” chances of actually hailing a taxi are 
           slim to none.

           Throwing her phone in her fanny-pack, Skylar heads north on-

           EXT. 8TH AVE - 2 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -8th Ave at a clipped pace toward the A/C/E at 14th, passing 
           endless, graffiti-laden, metal-garage-style doors protecting 
           empty storefronts.

           Everything is eerily quiet, until---

           HURRRRLLLLL!!

           Skylar NARROWLY SIDESTEPS the projectile VOMIT from a DUDE, 
           30s, dressed as Barbara Bush.

           HURRRRLLLLL!! 

           After one last push of vomit, the guy passes out, his back 
           against a darkened storefront. What a keeper.

           Pressing onward, Skylar gains another block, so grateful to 
           see a bodega open late.

           INT. WEST VILLAGE BODEGA - 2 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           DING! 

           Skylar enters the claustrophobic shop, offering little more 
           than beer, soda, cigarettes, lottery scratch-offs and odd 
           toiletries covered in dust. 

           Approaching the one MAN behind the counter, 40s, hovered over 
           his phone, watching something with headphones, Skylar opens 
           her mouth, but hesitates.

           Maybe she’s simply being paranoid, but the vibe in here 
           doesn’t feel safe at all. Could he be watching that video of 
           her right now? 
           Bravely, she shakes away her fears.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Hi, uh... is there a phone I can 
                        borrow, or...? Do you mind if... if 
                        I borrow yours for a minute?

           Glancing up, the man’s eyes trace the length of her beautiful 
           female form. He pulls one of the “buds” from his left ear. 

                                 MAN
                        And... what do I get?

           DING!

           EXT. 8TH AVE - 2 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           Out on 8th Ave again, Skyler runs toward the only other place 
           open nearby, a SPEAK EASY tucked away on west 13th street, 
           CLUB MUSIC THUMPING against the gum stained sidewalk. 

           Skylar steps inside-

           INT. WEST VILLAGE SPEAK EASY - 2 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -but the only other souls in here are extremely SHADY 
           CHARACTERS. All drunk. Or high. Or both. 

           In a booth, a WOMAN is saddled on top of a MAN, grinding, her 
           skirt covering the fact that these two could quite possibly 
           be having sex, publicly, right now.

           A NAUGHTY NURSE, 50s, exits the bathroom, rubbing her nose, 
           having just done a line of cocaine, one of her white, knee 
           stained, thigh-highs falling to her left ankle. 

           A GROUP OF GUYS in the corner - dressed as various monsters - 
           hover over a cell phone, laughing to themselves.

                                 MONSTER ONE
                        Fucking hilarious! Can you believe 
                        this shit?!

           Again. Maybe she’s just being paranoid, but they could easily 
           be watching her VIDEO. 

           Turning, she CLOCKS ACROSS THE ROOM a GUY in tighty-whities 
           and almost freaks out, but it’s only a man in his 50s, 
           dressed to resemble that famous scene from “BIRDMAN.”

           MASK PEEPHOLE POV: 
           From across the room, we watch Skylar talk to the MALE 
           BARTENDER, but the guy shakes his head, explaining something 
           to her.

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE...

           Suddenly, after some MUFFLED yelling, a massive bar fight 
           ensues.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Skylar barely gets out of harm’s way as TWO MEN begin 
           punching and ripping at each other over a voluptuous woman, 
           20s, dressed as a NAUGHTY NUN, screaming and crying.

                        NAUGHTY NUN
           Stop, stop it! I didn’t fuck 
           him, I fucking swear, oh-my-
           God, stop!
                                                     MAN #1 / MAN #2
                                              Fuck you, mother fucker! Come 
                                              on! / I’ll fucking kill you, 
                                              asshole!

           The place has been thrown into utter chaos, THREE BOUNCERS 
           attempting to separate the men as they continue to scream 
           PROFANITIES - spit flying from their mouths - as violent as 
           any wild primates can possibly get... during mating season.

           Dodging the madness, Skylar presses through this terrifying 
           display of untethered human behavior, and-  

           EXT. 8TH AVE - 2 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -Out onto the street again.

           Spotting police lights up ahead near the 14th street A/C/E/L 
           subway station, Skylar rushes north to the cruiser, where two 
           male cops, 40s - OFFICER ROMANO and OFFICER DUNN - have 
           arrested a car full of men dressed as CIRCUS CLOWNS. 

           But this sight is not comical in the slightest, for these 
           clowns are truly what nightmares are made of, dirty with 
           grime, their eyes bloodshot and wild with unspeakable 
           mischief. 

           One even grins at her, his yellowed teeth having been 
           blackened... for some unknown, grotesque reason. 

           To OFFICER ROMANO, shoving the last clown into the backseat-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Excuse me, officer, I... sorry to 
                        bother you, but-

           SLAMMING the door and rounding to the driver’s side-
                                 OFFICER ROMANO 
                             (thick, New York accent)
                        Yeah, we’re pretty busy right now, 
                        as you can see.

                                 SKYLAR
                        I just... I’ve been threatened 
                        and... I don’t know what to do. 

                                 OFFICER DUNN
                        How were you threatened?

           On the other side of the cruiser, Officer Dunn leans over the 
           hood, smoking a cigarette, exhausted and so over his job.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Someone just... posted something 
                        online that’s... it’s disturbing. 

                                 OFFICER DUNN
                        Someone you know?

                                 SKYLAR
                        No, but... 

           She glances over her shoulder. 

           No sign of Tighty-Whitey.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        If it’s the person I think it is... 
                        he’s been following me all night, 
                        and... he’s wearing a mask.

                                 OFFICER DUNN
                        Sweetie. Most everyone out here’s 
                        wearin’ a mask. 

           MASK PEEPHOLE POV:

           From only a block away...

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE.

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 OFFICER ROMANO
                        Sorry... I’m not followin’. Has 
                        this person harmed you in any way, 
                        in the real world? Or did this all 
                        take place online?
                                 SKYLAR
                        He hasn’t hurt me physically, no, 
                        but... he intends to. That’s what 
                        he posted. Online. 

           The cops’ faces drop. They don’t have time for this. 

           Bravely, Skylar continues-

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s a lot to ask, but... I 
                        would really appreciate a ride 
                        home. To be safe.

                                 OFFICER ROMANO
                        Look...

           Drawing closer to Skylar-

                                 OFFICER ROMANO (CONT’D)
                        This town’s a total shit-show on 
                        Halloween. You know it, I know it. 
                        I don’t even know why nice girls 
                        like you even go out anymore. Next 
                        time, just... stay home, you know? 
                        Stay home.
                             (suddenly whispering)
                        You would not believe what these 
                        clowns were up to tonight. I 
                        mean... the things I’ve seen... 
                        it’d turn your hair white.
                             (even quieter)
                        We just got a call about some baby 
                        sacrifice out in Queens. Honest-to-
                        God. That’s where we’re headin’ 
                        after this. How fucked up is that, 
                        huh? God... this city.

           Skylar drops her head, a little embarrassed. This cop has 
           successfully made her feel like a foolish little girl for 
           what now feels like a very small complaint compared to that.

                                 OFFICER ROMANO (CONT’D)
                             (louder)
                        Best I can tell ya is to fill out a 
                        report, but... sadly... I cannot 
                        secure a ride home for you. Hell, 
                        if we offered that to everyone who 
                        got spooked in this city... Shoot. 
                        Can you imagine? I’d never stop.

           Skylar nods. 

           It’s weird. 
           Either this cop is simply being nice to her or wildly 
           inappropriate, it’s hard to tell with the amount of authority 
           he holds over her in this particular moment.

                                 SKYLAR
                        No, I know, I get it, I’ll just... 
                        take the train.

           He points north, up 8th Ave.

                                 OFFICER ROMANO
                        Nearest precinct is... only a few 
                        blocks away. Up 8th and... turn 
                        right on 20th. 

           Nodding her head again, Skylar feels a little better with a 
           clear game plan in place.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah. Okay.

                                 OFFICER ROMANO
                        Go to the station, fill out a 
                        report. Give ‘em a statement. Then 
                        you get yourself on home. We’ll 
                        take care of the rest.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Thank you.

           The cop looks her up and down, his eyes suddenly hungry with 
           longing.

                                 OFFICER ROMANO
                        So, what are ya... a fairy or 
                        somethin’?

                                 SKYLAR
                        Oh, uh... I’m sort of... I’m a 
                        fairy every year, but... every 
                        time, I change it up. It’s stupid.

                                 OFFICER ROMANO
                        Nah, it’s cute. Whatever it is, you 
                        look adorable.

           With a closed-mouthed grin, she nods as if to feign, “Thank 
           you.” But really, in her heart, it’s a solid, “Fuck you.”

                                 OFFICER ROMANO (CONT’D)
                        Happy Halloween.

           With that, the cops hop in their car full of clowns and drive 
           away.
           Turning in a circle, Skylar ultimately decides to walk to the 
           police station just six blocks north.

           Block one.

           Block two.

           Tensions high, Skylar’s eyes dart about as she walks alone on 
           this empty New York City Avenue. 

           It’s way too quiet out here.

           As mentioned... New York City is truly terrifying when no one 
           else is around.

           Surprising that even happens, I know. 

           But what they don’t tell you is... “the city that never 
           sleeps” most definitely has to sleep sometimes.

           Two vehicles pass, but that’s about it.

           Block three.

           Folding her arms over her chest, Skylar shakes with cold, 
           paranoia and fear. 

           From this angle, we see a blurred image of a MAN just over 
           her shoulder. 

           Yet... slowing to a stop... when Skylar turns, this person 
           disappears from sight.

           Block four.

           Up ahead, Skylar catches a glimpse of a MAN inside the 
           backseat of a parked car, alone. 

           It’s beyond suspicious. 

           “What is he waiting for? There, in the dark?”

           Pulling her keys from her “fanny,” Skylar laces them between 
           her brass knuckles, ready to shred this guy to pieces if he 
           tries to leap from the car and attack her.

           Passing carefully, on high alert, Skylar just catches sight 
           of the hair of a WOMAN bobbing up and down, giving this guy a 
           blow job in the back seat.

           In ecstasy, the man throws his head back, his hands grabbing 
           at the woman’s hair, completely unaware that Skylar even 
           exists. 
           Block five.

           Block six.

           As Skylar turns right on 20th street-

           MASK PEEPHOLE POV:

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE. 

           Peering around the corner, onto 20th street, we see Skylar 
           steal into the POLICE STATION. 

           INT. NYPD, 20TH STREET, WAITING AREA - 3 SOMETHING A.M.

           In a waiting area, sitting next to MALE TWINS, 20s, dressed 
           as penises, Skylar borrows a little “juice” from one of their 
           chargers, finally able to access her phone.

           Battery life: 7%

                                 MALE TWIN ONE
                             (almost “blackout drunk”)
                        Hey. We’re dicks.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (plainly)
                        Yeah. I know.

           With that, this “penis” passes out, leaning against his 
           brother.

           Returning to her phone-

                                 ANDRA (PREVIOUS TEXT)
                        Still stuck! Some drunk driver 
                        flipped over his car! It’s all 
                        backed up! Where are you?! TEXT ME! 
                        I’m losing my mind not hearing from 
                        you!

           Skylar composes and sends-

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Hey! Sorry! Phone died. At the 
                        police station now.

                                 ANDRA (TEXT)
                        Thank Christ! 
                             (TEXT)
                        That video’s fucking freaky! Have 
                        you seen all the comments?!
                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        Yeah. Some. But they’re hard to 
                        look at.

                                 ANDRA (TEXT)
                        What are you going to do?

           Skylar lingers, not knowing what to say. 

           Finally-

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                        I told the police everything I 
                        know. Hopefully, they can do 
                        something.

                                 ANDRA (TEXT)
                        Keep me posted. If I ever get off 
                        this fucking bridge, I’m coming to 
                        find your ass!

                                 SKYLAR (TEXT)
                             (Fingers crossed)
                        I’m asleep by then! This night 
                        needs to end.

                                 ANDRA (TEXT)
                        Seriously!!
                             (face with x’s for eyes)

           Clicking back to “The Disrupters” INSTA page, Skylar finds a 
           NEW VIDEO POST.

           She CLICKS on it to discover a RECORDING of her talking to 
           the cops, from only a block away. 

           The video’s caption reads, “Anyone know her name? Info? DM me 
           or post in comments!”

           She scrolls down through the numerous comments beneath. 

           The “conversation” has grown overwhelmingly long, the 
           “Trolls” loving having a front row seat to Skylar being 
           stalked.  

           And there, at the very bottom, one user named “@COWTIPPER42” 
           has posted something beyond disturbing only five seconds ago.

                                 @COWTIPPER42 (PREVIOUS POST)
                        I know this girl! She went to my 
                        high school! She’s always been a 
                        whore! Fucked the whole damn 
                        baseball team!
           Beside herself, Skylar shakes her head from side to side.

           Then, a few more FRESH POSTS pop up right before her eyes, 
           this “@COWTIPPER42” person online, right now, in real time.

                                 @COWTIPPER42 (POST) (CONT’D)
                        Her name is Skylar London. 
                             (POST)
                        Here’s her home address in Texas!

                        HAVE AT HER BOYS!

           Again, the wind is knocked out of Skylar, sheer panic 
           building, but still, she doesn’t hesitate to immediately call 
           “MOMMA.”

           RING, RING, RING.

           No answer.

           She tries again, her knee bobbing up and down, tears building 
           in her eyes, but she fights them back.

           RING, RING, RING.

           No answer.

           “FUCK!”

           She calls “SAMUEL.” 

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                             (groggily, mild Texas 
                              accent)
                        Skylar? You all right?

                                 SKYLAR
                             (urgently)
                        Hey, I need you to go get Mom and 
                        bring her back to your house, okay?

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                        What, what’s goin’ on?

           Glancing up, Skylar’s eyes flutter with hope as OFFICER 
           SHEEHAN, 30s, waves from his small office. 
                                 SKYLAR
                        I’m at the police station, so I 
                        need to go, okay? I’m gonna DM you 
                        something, and tell you more later, 
                        but right now I need you to go get 
                        Mom, and make sure she’s okay, 
                        okay?! 

           Standing, Skylar pulls the charger from her phone, returning 
           it to the “penises,” thanking them with her eyes.

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                        Skylar, you’re seriously scarin’ 
                        the shit out of me! 

           Heading to the office, doing her best not to just fall apart-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Sammie, I’m all right! I’m fine! 
                        Just-! Go get Mom! Okay?! Please? 
                        Right now! Right the fuck now! And 
                        call the police just in case! I 
                        promise I’ll call you back!

           Hanging up on her brother, Skylar quickly DMs “The 
           Disrupters” INSTA story to SAMUEL, just as she-

           INT. NYPD, 20TH STREET, SMALL OFFICE - 3:46 A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -Enters a small office filled with paperwork, the room dimly 
           lit, a few “to-go” coffee cups absentmindedly scattered 
           about. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Sorry about that, they-uh...

           Shaking, Skylar takes a seat.

                        They, uh... they just posted... at 
                        the bottom of the video, someone 
                        just posted my real name.

           The report in hand, Officer Sheehan rounds his desk and plops 
           down in his leather office chair.

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN
                        Ms. London... the Instagram you 
                        gave me is from a group we’re 
                        already aware of... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN (CONT'D)
                        We’ve deactivated their accounts 
                        numerous times, and have law 
                        enforcement agencies - well above 
                        my pay grade - looking into this.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Okay...

           Skylar’s brow furrows, the officer leaning in to explain 
           further, with a gentle, highly appropriate authority.

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN
                        Give us a few days to look into 
                        it... try and get a sense if 
                        there’s any specific reason they’re 
                        targeting you... any real credible 
                        threat to you and your life. But... 
                        typically these cyber cases don’t 
                        go anywhere. Most of the time, 
                        these guys get bored and move on to 
                        someone else. And chasing them... 
                        can actually make it worse.

                                 SKYLAR
                        But... is there any way I can get 
                        them to take down the video? 
                        Like... can I get a lawyer, or...? 

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN
                        Honestly? I wouldn’t bother. I 
                        wouldn’t spend the money. These 
                        users are anonymous, and... hard to 
                        track down. They know what they’re 
                        doing, they’ve done it before.

           Baffled, Skylar sits in silence, her shoulders slumped. 

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN (CONT’D)
                        Anything else you’d like to add to 
                        your statement before I file?

                                 SKYLAR
                        It just... it feels like... 

           Skylar’s eyes fall on a pile of paperwork on the far right 
           corner of the officer’s desk, the top file folder marked with 
           the faded ring of a coffee cup stain. 

           Something about it - this pile of papers meant to fight for 
           justice, all at the mercy of something as simple as caffeine - 
           renders a feeling of hopelessness within Skylar.
                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        It sounds like you can’t really do 
                        anything, until... 

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN
                        Go on.

                                 SKYLAR
                        ...something happens... something 
                        really bad.

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN
                        A lot of these guys... they don’t 
                        typically take it to the streets. 
                        They want money, mostly. An 
                        illusion of... power.

                                 SKYLAR
                        But... he’s been following me.

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN
                        You’ve seen someone in a mask, in 
                        various locations. But you’re not 
                        certain this person even uploaded 
                        the video, isn’t that correct?

                                 SKYLAR
                        I mean, I’m pretty sure he did, 
                        but...

           She falls silent, deflated.

           Finally-

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Whether it’s that guy or not... 
                        what if... what if someone does 
                        come after me? Or my family? In 
                        real life. What happens then?

           Kindly, Officer Sheehan hands Skylar his card.

                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN
                        We’ll be there to help. I can 
                        promise you that.

           Skylar nods. 

           Unassured. 

           Disappointed.
                                 OFFICER SHEEHAN (CONT’D)
                        Now... I am sorry, Miss, but... I 
                        do need to keep plugging along. Got 
                        a full waiting room out there.

           EXT. NYPD, 20TH STREET - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           Standing outside, Skylar waits for an UBER amongst cop cars 
           and a few OFFICERS loitering around. There’s nowhere safer 
           than right here, right now, at the foot of a police precinct. 

           CLOSE ON - nine minutes. Nine fucking minutes. That’s how 
           long it will take for her UBER ride to get here. 

           Ooop. Nope.

           The “wait time” just changed from nine minutes to twenty 
           eight, the one car assigned to her all the way out in 
           Brooklyn.

           Fed up, Skylar walks to the corner of 20th and 8th, the cops 
           just over her shoulder, trying to wave down one, two, three 
           cabs, but they’re all full. 

           One cab suddenly turns the corner from 19th, blinking its 
           lights and heading her way, as taxis typically do when they 
           are empty.

           INT./EXT. YELLOW CAB - 4 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS) 

           SLAM! - Skylar has hopped into the backseat.

                                 SKYLAR
                        111th and 5th, please. 

                                 CABBIE (O.S.)
                        Yup.

           The medallion takes off, driven by a gentle looking CABBIE in 
           his 50s. 

           With a sigh, Skylar relaxes in the back, the black leather 
           absorbing the full weight of her exhausted body. 

           She’s on her way home. 

           In one piece.

           It almost feels like a miracle.

           Maybe it is.
           She dials “SAMUEL.”

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                        Hey, sis.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Hey, Sammie. 

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                        You all right? 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah, I’m okay.

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                        Those videos are crazy. How’d all 
                        this happen anyways?

                                 SKYLAR
                        It’s a long story...
                             (a beat)
                        I’m so sorry for yellin’ at ya.

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                        It’s fine. I’m sure I’ve yelled at 
                        you plenty of times.

                                 SKYLAR
                        You guys all right?

                                 SAMUEL (V.O.)
                        Hold on a sec.

           Having passed the phone off, Samuel gifts his sister the most 
           glorious sound-

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Skylar?

           With a whimper, Skylar finally, fully bursts into tears.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Hey, Momma.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        You okay, sweetie?!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah, I’m okay, I’m in a cab.

           Tears stream down her cheeks.

           Just like that little emoji. But in real life.
                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        I’m on my way home.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Oh, thank God, thank God. Our local 
                        police dropped by. They’re gonna 
                        keep an eye on us.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah... I think you should stay 
                        with Sammie for a little while... 
                        until we figure this out.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        What’d the police say on your end?

           More tears-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Not much.
                             (after a long, tearful 
                              beat)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        No... Don’t you be sorry. No 
                        sorries from you, all right? 
                        They’re the ones that’s fucked up.

           A chuckle through tears-

                                 SKYLAR
                        I have never... not ever... heard 
                        you drop an F-bomb.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Well, I’d say it’s pretty fuckin’ 
                        appropriate, am I right?!

           Laughing and crying even harder-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah, that’s right!

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        How much longer, ‘til you get home?

           Skylar glances outside the window, just as they pass 33rd 
           street, still heading north on 8th.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Uh... I don’t know... twenty 
                        minutes maybe. There’s isn’t much 
                        traffic. 
                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Well, I am gonna just sit right 
                        here and talk to ya, ‘til you’re 
                        safe in your own bed. 

           Glancing at her phone - Battery life: 3%

                                 SKYLAR
                        I actually don’t have enough 
                        battery for that, Momma.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Can you charge it in the cab? 
                        Mostly I wanna “walk ya” to your 
                        door, you know? 
                             (chuckle)
                        I wanna hear that deadbolt, loud 
                        and clear!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Yeah! Me, too!
                             (to the cabbie)
                        Hey, you got a charger up there?

                                 CABBIE
                        Yup!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Mind if I use it?

                                 CABBIE
                        It won’t plug in back there.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Momma, I’m gonna charge this thing, 
                        but I’ll call you when we pull up 
                        to my place, okay?

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Yeah, and ask the driver to wait 
                        for ya, too, ‘til ya get inside. 
                        Pay him extra to wait. No more 
                        fuckin’ around.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (another laugh through 
                              tears)
                        You and these F-bombs!!

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        I know! And they feel really 
                        fuckin’ good, too!

           Skylar laughs, wiping away her tears.
                                 SKYLAR
                        I love you.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Love you, too, sweetie. You give me 
                        a call now, soon as ya can. Samuel 
                        and I are right here, and we’re not 
                        goin’, not anywhere, until you call 
                        us back. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        ‘Kay. Talk soon.

                                 MOMMA (V.O.)
                        Talk soon, baby.

           Skylar hangs up her phone.

                                 SKYLAR
                             (to the cabbie)
                        You mind charging it up there? Just 
                        for a few minutes?

           Reaching his hand over his shoulder as he drives-

                                 CABBIE
                        Happy to help.

           Skylar watches as the cabbie dutifully plugs in her phone, 
           placing it on the front passenger seat. 

                                 SKYLAR
                        Thank you.

           He nods. But says nothing more.

           Skylar soaks into the seat again.

           There’s no music playing in this cab. 

           Which is nice.

           Even in motion, there’s a stillness in here. 

           A quiet.

           For a moment of sheer bliss, Skylar leans her head against 
           the window and closes her tired eyes.

           Silence.

           Stillness.

           Then---
           Skylar feels the cab turn left.

           Her eyes pop open to see the taxi going west on 41st street.

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Wait...
                             (a beat)
                        Can we not take the highway? Let’s 
                        just keep going up 8th, huh? Turn 
                        right on 110th. 

           Without even one glance in the rearview, the cabbie continues 
           west, saying nothing. 

           Suddenly, Skylar realizes that something is fucking wrong.

           She knocks on the glass between them - KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        Hey! 

           Then... Skylar eyes BULGE as the cabbie pulls into a-

           INT. MULTILEVEL PARKING GARAGE - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           -Shady, multilevel parking garage, winding up the ramp. 

           POUNDING on the glass even harder, Skylar screams herself 
           hoarse-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Turn this shit around, mother 
                        fucker, and take me hooooooome!

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK!

           Then... Skylar draws a breath, in horror, as the headlights 
           come upon SEVEN MEN, 20-ish-

           In the distance, dressed casually in jeans and t-shirts, but 
           all wearing that same freaky little boy mask.

           Yup. Their ring leader, Tighty-Whitey, is there, raising his 
           phone at the approaching cab, hitting RECORD.  

           TIGHTY-WHITEY’S POV THROUGH THE PEEPHOLES:

           His breath has quickened now, in anticipation. 

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE, EXHALE!

           We watch the cab coming closer, Skylar POUNDING on the plexi-
           glass, her SCREAMING muffled inside the medallion.
           INSIDE THE CAB:

           Skylar’s survival instinct immediately kicks in- 

           Fight or flight.

           She FLINGS OPEN the passenger side door...

           And, after only a moment’s hesitation, leaps from the moving 
           car - leaving her phone charging in the front seat.

           Ducking and rolling to her feet as best as she is able - 
           scraping her nylon-knees BLOODY in the process - Skylar races 
           to the nearest set of stairs. 

           The men pursue, all too delighted by the chase!

           The metal door of the stairwell is propped open by a heavy, 
           wooden doorstopper. 

           Grabbing the stopper, Skylar-

           INT. MULTILEVEL PARKING GARAGE, STAIRWELL - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           -Enters the stairwell, SLAMS the door, and wedges the hunk of 
           wood into the handle, cleverly barring the door.

           INT. MULTILEVEL PARKING GARAGE - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           The pack - led by Tighty-Whitey - immediately race toward the 
           neighboring stairwell.

           INT. MULTILEVEL PARKING GARAGE, STAIRWELL - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           With the help of the railing, Skylar leaps down the steps, 
           six stairs at a time, circling and circling, EXCITED SCREAMS 
           from the men echoing through the concrete stairwell chamber.

           Skylar doesn’t slow down, until she plows right into ANOTHER 
           YOUNG MAN IN THE SAME MASK, making his way up the stairs 
           alone, “cutting her off at the pass,” the two tumbling down a 
           half flight of stairs. 

           Quickly on her feet again, Skylar begins racing back up the 
           steps, the NOISE from the neighboring stairwell disorienting 
           in its echo, giving no indication of how close or far away 
           the other young men might be.

           STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP! 

           This single, very agile young man is gaining on her.
           She passes a metal door, trying it, but it’s locked. 

           STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP! 

           He reaches for her ankle, just grazing the rubber heel of her 
           high-top.  

           STOMP, STOMP, STOMP, STOMP! 

           She passes right by the same door she just wedged shut, 
           continuing up and up and up, until she throws her body weight 
           against a metal handlebar, exploding onto-

           EXT. MULTILEVEL PARKING GARAGE, ROOFTOP - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           -The rooftop.

           POUND, POUND, POUND! Her sneakers smack against this elevated 
           slab of concrete as she runs as fast as she can toward what 
           looks to be the top rung of a fire escape, but-

           This lone young man tackles her from behind, the two rolling 
           a full yard from sheer momentum.

           Thankfully, Skylar lands on top, unleashing a few BRASS 
           KNUCKLED BLOWS.

           BAM!

           In a fit of fury, Skylar unmasks him to unveil... he’s just a 
           pimple-faced teenager, no older than 16. 

           His face is completely shattered from her brass knuckles, 
           spitting up bits broken teeth and a ridiculous amount of 
           blood. 

           His real likeness exposed, forced to gaze up at Skylar, human 
           to human, this young man falters with... shame.

           With one look, their eyes locked, these two experience an 
           instant, genuine, undeniable and unshakable pulse of shared 
           humanity between them, their faces screaming, “How the fuck 
           did we get here?”

           Stunned, Skylar jumps off of him, QUICKLY LOCATING the nearby 
           fire escape.

           Just as she climbs on, Skylar watches as below- 
           EXT. MULTILEVEL PARKING GARAGE, STREET - SIMULTANEOUSLY

           -The rest of the young men explode from an exit door, street 
           level, Tighty-Whitey in the lead, no idea that all he has to 
           do is... look up. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN STREET, FIRE ESCAPE AND ROOFTOP:

           With one nod, Tighty-Whitey commands the others to fan out, 
           in all directions, to go and find their prey.

           Holding her breath, Skylar observes the group strategically 
           disperse into the New York City streets.

           Back on the roof, his mask still off, our young man pulls his 
           phone from his small backpack and goes to a GROUP TEXT THREAD 
           that’s been shared by “The Disrupters” all evening.

           The last message, clearly from the cabbie-

                                 RANDOM NYC NUMBER (PREVIOUS TEXT)
                        Got her in my cab. On my way. You 
                        better have all my cash.

           He composes a text and sends.

           BUZZ, BUZZ. Tighty-Whitey has just gotten the text.

           Skylar watches from above as Tighty-Whitey pulls his phone 
           from his satchel.

           TIGHTY-WHITEY’S POV:

           Lifting his cell, we see the text from a contact saved as 
           “SHORTY.”

                                 SHORTY (TEXT)
                        Got her on the roof.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Without looking up, Tighty-Whitey doubles back, disappearing 
           out of sight. 

           As Skylar could not see what was on his phone, she simply 
           waits until he is gone, then begins to quietly descend the 
           fire escape, slowly but surely, attempting not to make a 
           sound.

           EXT. MULTILEVEL PARKING GARAGE, ROOFTOP - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           The roof door KICKS open - BOOM! - Tighty-Whitey stepping out 
           onto the elevated slab of concrete. 
           Scanning the rooftop, his eyes cloud with rage with no sign 
           of Skylar.

           The only other soul here is Shorty, sitting on the roof, 
           still unmasked, bleeding profusely.

           Tighty-Whitey walks up to him, crouches down, and stares at 
           this kid for a long pause.

           He holds up his phone, showing Shorty his own text, right in 
           front of his face-

           “Got her on the roof.”

           In an explosion of unbridled fury, Tighty-Whitey grabs this 
           kid by his hair, sweeping his arm at the empty roof as if to 
           say, “You do NOT have her on the mother fucking roof! You 
           fucking LIED to me!”

           It seems that Shorty wasn’t “ratting” Skylar out at all, but 
           attempting to protect her by granting her more time.

           Tighty-Whitey pulls the kid’s head back harder.

                                 SHORTY
                        I had to do it... It’s just... 
                        fucked up. How is this not fucked 
                        up?

           Without pause, Tighty-Whitey rears back and... SMACKS this 
           kid’s skull against the concrete rooftop, his frame folded 
           forward, grossly contorted, broken and bleeding.

           Tighty-Whitey stands, moving to the edge of the roof, 
           scanning the streets below, just in time to see Skylar 
           running east.

           EXT. A/C/E STATION, 42ND AND 8TH - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           Hurrying down the entrance-

           INT. A/C/E SUBWAY STATION - 4 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -into the subway station, Skylar runs to the MTA window for 
           help, but no one is there. 

           Fuck. 

           No one is ever there this time of morning.

           Best keep moving.
           She swipes her card - BEEP! - and presses her hips against 
           the turnstile, jogging down the stairs to the UPTOWN 
           platform.

           The platform is completely empty, save for one HOMELESS 
           WOMAN, 60s, shuffling along without shoes on, schizophrenic 
           and MUTTERING to herself.

           Cleverly, Skylar ducks behind a large staircase, not wanting 
           the woman to see her. 

           And lucky she did.

           Because just as she hides, a pair of tennis shoes and bare 
           legs descend the stairs on the other end of the platform, a 
           distance away. 

           Tighty-Whitey.

           Peering out from behind the stairs, Skylar finds his bare 
           back to her as he walks in the opposite direction.

           Hiding behind the stairs again, Skylar doesn’t move, afraid 
           to even breathe.  

           Then---

           That wonderful STIR of air and RUSH of SOUND fills the 
           station-

           On the other side of the tracks, one of the masked Disrupters 
           looks for Skylar on the DOWNTOWN side.

           Turning her head, Skylar spots him, yet has no time to react 
           before he catches a glimpse of her, WHISTLING at his leader 
           from across the tracks.

           His back to us, we see Tighty-Whitey stop. 

           CLOSE ON his peepholes right in front of our face, his eyes 
           narrowing as he turns.

           TIGHTY-WHITEY’S POV:

           Through his peepholes, we see his buddy across the tracks 
           point at the stairs-

           Then---

           Skylar lurches from behind the stairs, running in the 
           opposite direction, down the length of the platform.
           Following her - INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE, EXHALE - Tighty-
           Whitey grows even more excited, moving slowly, stealthily, 
           with the confidence and caution it takes to cage a wild, 
           terrified animal. 

           The approaching train grows louder and louder until it 
           SCHREEEEEEEEECHES to a halt. 

           The doors open.

           DING-DONG!

           A few cars away, we see Skylar jump-

           INT. NORTHBOUND A-TRAIN - 4 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -Onto the empty A-Train.

           Tighty-Whitey steps onto the subway as well, three cars down, 
           still pursuing her.

                                 FEMALE (V.O.)
                             (a human over the 
                              intercom)
                        This A-Train’s running local one 
                        more stop. 50th’s next.

           The doors slide shut. 

           BING-BONG!

           SCHREEEEEEEEECH! 

           The A-train takes off again, snaking down a dark tunnel that 
           twists and turns beneath the concrete jungle.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Without stopping, Skylar has continued running in the 
           opposite direction of Tighty-Whitey, quickly crossing the 
           length of a train car. 

           She SLIDES the conjoining door open, the WIND of the tunnel 
           fanning her wings and hair as she illegally and dangerously 
           moves from one car to the next. 

           Tighty-Whitey, following slowly behind, is doing the exact 
           same thing.

           Again, Skylar runs the length of the next car to the 
           conjoining door.

           SLIDE of the door! 
           RUSH OF WIND! 

           SLAM!

           She runs the length of another car, all totally empty.

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (random pre-recorded 
                              message)
                        If you notice an elderly or 
                        pregnant person on the train, offer 
                        them your seat. You’ll be standing 
                        up for what’s right. Courtesy is 
                        contagious, and it starts with you.

           SLIDE of the door! 

           RUSH OF WIND! 

           SLAM!

           Every now and again, she glances over her shoulder, 
           eventually losing sight of Tighty-Whitey. 

           The A-Train SCHREEEEEEECHES to a halt at 50th street.

           The doors open.

           DING-DONG!

                                 FEMALE (V.O.)
                             (a human over the 
                              intercom)
                        This train will now resume EXPRESS 
                        service. Next stop is... 59th 
                        street. Stand clear.

           Skylar peers out the open doors, down the length of the 
           train. 

           Nothing. 

           -She takes one step from the train onto the subway platform. 

           -Immediately, Tighty-Whitey steps from two cars down, aware 
           of her every move. 

           -Terrified to be alone on the platform with him, she hops 
           back onto the train. 

           -He does the same.

           BING-BONG!
           The doors slide shut.

           SCHREEEEEEEEECH! 

           The A-train takes off again, down the dark tunnel. 

           Quickly studying the framed SUBWAY MAP fixed on the side of 
           the train, Skylar’s eyes follow the path of the A-Train 
           seeing that it goes express from 59th all the way to 125th.

           Her eyes brighten with an idea. 

           She turns to see that Tighty-Whitey is walking the length of 
           the adjacent car toward her.

           Taking in a deep breath, Skylar bravely takes a seat, keeping 
           her eyes fixed straight ahead.

           SLIDE of the door! 

           RUSH OF WIND! 

           SLAM!

           Silence.

           Tighty-Whitey has entered the car.

           He pauses for a moment, not moving a muscle, greatly 
           intrigued by this surprising turn of events.

           Then---

           He lifts his foot, planting it. 

           Then the other.

           TIGHTY-WHITEY’S POV:

           As he walks the length of the car, his eyes on Skylar, we 
           hear that his breath has calmed again.

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE, EXHALE.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Sitting perfectly still, Skylar doesn’t move as we watch 
           Tighty-Whitey’s blurred frame come into focus as he finally 
           reaches her.

           Oddly, Tighty-Whitey takes a seat directly across from her.

           The two meet eyes for the very first time. 
           -SKYLAR’S POV ON TIGHTY-WHITEY.

           -TIGHTY-WHITEY’S PEEPHOLE POV ON SKYLAR.

           -CLOSE UP on his hands calmly rested on his bare knees, red 
           marker stain still on his left fingers.

           -CLOSE UP on her hands calmly rested on her knees, brass 
           knuckles crowned upon her fingers.

           -EXTREME CLOSE UP OF SKYLAR’S FACE.

           -EXTREME CLOSE UP OF TIGHTY-WHITEY’S MASK.

           It’s like a fucked up staring match. 

           The kind of game we all played as children, where the person 
           who blinks loses. 

           Sadly, in this case, if Skylar blinks first, she gets fucking 
           raped. 

           Which is why Skylar is determined not to mother fucking 
           blink.

           Then, as if on cue-

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (pre-recorded message)
                        A crowded train is no excuse for 
                        sexual misconduct. If you feel as 
                        if you’ve been the victim of a 
                        crime, please report the incident 
                        to an MTA representative.

           SCHREEEEEEEECH!

           The train pulls into 59th street. 

           DING-DONG! 

           The doors - just to the left of Skylar - open.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (resuming the typical pre-
                              recorded messages)
                        This is an uptown A-Express-Train. 
                        The next stop is... 125th street.

           Skylar holds perfectly steady, though her heart is racing.

           BING-BONG!
           And just as the doors begin to close, we watch IN SLOW MOTION 
           as Skylar grabs the vertical handlebar next to her, loops 
           around like a badass and launches onto the platform, just 
           before the doors slide right in front of Tighty-Whitey’s 
           “face.”

           INT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE STATION - 4 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           Tighty-Whitey presses his mask against the window of the 
           train door. 

           And for the first time, Skylar is able to really see THE BLUE 
           OF HIS EYES, ICE-COLD in their violent stare.

           But...

           She gazes back. 

           Like pure granite. 

           Fearless and unshakable.

           A fucking mountain. 

           Then---

           The train pulls away from the station, bringing Tighty-Whitey 
           with it. 

           Skylar watches with relief as the train snakes into the dark 
           hole and disappears. 

           Suddenly, a new SCHRRREEEECH! fills the station.

           Behind her, on the other side of the platform, a C-train 
           pulls up, hitting all local stops. 

           DING-DONG! 

           The doors open, Skylar hurrying into-

           INT. UPTOWN LOCAL-C-TRAIN - 4 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS) 

           -One of the empty cars.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (pre-recorded)
                        This is an uptown Local-C-Train. 
                        The next stop is... 72nd street.

           BING-BONG! 
           The doors close.

           As Skylar makes her way north, she studies another framed 
           SUBWAY MAP fixed to the wall, her face clouded.

           Her eye-line goes to the A stop at 125th, then drops to 
           110th.

           That’s the station she first ran into Tighty-Whitey. 

           And he might be clever enough to deduce that’s where she’s 
           heading.

           He could be... waiting.

           Her eye-line drops from 110th to 103rd, gifting her another 
           idea.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. B/C SUBWAY STOP AT 103RD STREET - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           The C-train pulls into 103rd. 

           Skylar exits the train, runs up the stairs and out onto-

           EXT. B/C SUBWAY STOP AT 103RD STREET - 4 SOMETHING A.M.

           -8th Ave/Frederick Douglass. 

           Sprinting north, along the west stonewall lining Central 
           Park, Skylar finds a good place to hop over into-

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - 4 SOMETHING A.M. (CONTINUOUS)

           -The dark, just vaguely lamp-lit protection of grass and 
           trees. 

           Moving stealthily in and out of shadow like a friggin’ ninja, 
           Skylar makes her way toward the north wall. 

           Her body against the stone, Skylar peers over the ledge at 
           the 110th street stop to discover... nothing. 

           No sign of Tighty-Whitey, whatsoever.

           Pressing her back against the stone again, Skylar prepares 
           for the last sprint toward home.

           We hear her barely - INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE. 
           There’s a pregnant pause of silence. 

           And it’s maddening.

           Then, instinctively, the hair on Skylar’s arms lift with 
           warning. 

           Something is wrong. 

           Someone is... watching her. 

           She can feel it. 

           Lifting her chin, Skylar finds--

           A dark silhouette, haloed against a nearby streetlamp--

           Looming just over her, literally standing on the wall--

           Calm, patient, still, he’s recording her with his phone in 
           his right hand--

           Then waves at her with his red-marker-stained left.

           The PULSING AFRICAN DRUM FROM EARLIER begins POUNDING as--

           Skylar takes off, SPRINTING as fast as she can, east, toward 
           home.

           TIGHTY-WHITEY’S IPHONE POV: 

           Suddenly, we experience the ACTUAL VIDEO Tighty-Whitey is 
           capturing with his jostled phone as he runs-- 

           Showcasing the disturbing image of Skylar being chased, her 
           little fairy wings flapping as she races, as if willing her 
           to fly.

           But she cannot fly. 

           Because, sadly, she’s not a fairy at all. 

           She’s a human. 

           Frail and finite.

           We watch as Tighty-Whitey gains on her and... he must have 
           tackled her because all we see now is pure chaos. 

           Then grass. 

           But we can hear Skylar SCREAMING and KICKING and PUNCHING, 
           causing Tighty-Whitey to-
           SLAM! SLAM!! SLAM!!!

           We just barely catch sight of Skylar falling to the ground on 
           her stomach, completely knocked off her axis. 

           He must have smacked her really good across the face a few 
           times by the way she’s barely able to lift her head.

           The phone image lifts as Tighty-Whitey picks it up from the 
           grass.

           In the background, we can hear Skylar WEEPING uncontrollably.

           A horrifying sound.

                                 SKYLAR
                        Please... Please... Don’t hurt 
                        me...

           The recording flips around, the video image filling with the 
           mask of Tighty-Whitey. 

           He props the phone up against a tree, centering it on Skylar 
           who has just barely gotten on all fours, disoriented, shaking 
           and SOBBING. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           We are now in front of Skylar, on all fours, her face 
           bloodied from a busted lip, her right eye already swelling 
           shut.

           Behind her, Tighty-Whitey slowly approaches.

           Step, step, step. 

                                 SKYLAR (CONT’D)
                        My mom... She’s sick... Please... 
                        Let me go...

           But just as Tighty-Whitey gets close enough, Skylar drops the 
           fake sobbing act and swings her upper body around, launching 
           a powerful, brass-knuckled fist straight to his balls.

           As he falls to his knees, Skylar makes a break for it, 
           running east again- 

           But she can’t run very fast anymore, with a busted lip, 
           swollen eye and what must be a twisted ankle. 

           With one glance behind, it seems Tighty-Whitey is done 
           messing around with the “cat and mouse” game he’s enjoyed all 
           evening- 
           He’s now CHASING her, as fast as his bruised balls will 
           allow, cupping them with his left hand, recording her again 
           with his right.

           Coming upon the Meer, the murky pond eerily rippling in the 
           darkness, Skylar hides behind a small brick building housing 
           locked bathrooms.

           In an instant, she rips off her fairy wings, throws them to 
           the ground, and takes to tearing at the white and gold-
           glittered nylon stretched around thick metal wiring.

           TIGHTY-WHITEY’S POV:

           Through his peepholes, Tighty-Whitey stumbles to the brick 
           bathrooms and rounds the corner where Skylar is meant to be. 

           But she isn’t there.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Suddenly, a thick string of metal wiring is around his throat 
           as Skylar chokes him from behind. 

           Ripping and clawing at his neck, the young man falls back, 
           throwing them both to the ground. 

           Skylar holds on as hard as she can, uttering a PRIMORDIAL 
           SCREEEEEEAM, her knuckles turning white, veins bulging from 
           her forehead.

           But Tighty-Whitey is bigger than she is. 

           Stronger. 

           Purely biologically speaking, of course. 

           And. 

           Suddenly. 

           She loses her grip. 

           Pulling the metal from his neck, he claws at Skylar, trying 
           to gain control again. 

           Kicking at his face, she wiggles away, scrambling to her 
           feet. 

           Running to the north wall, Skylar-
           EXT. 110TH STREET, NEAR 5TH AVE - 5 SOMETHING A.M.

           -Leaps over the stone and onto the sidewalk, falling on top 
           of a sleeping HOMELESS MAN, 50s.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        What the fuck?!!

           Suffering against her twisted ankle, Skylar is barely able to 
           get to her feet, just in time to see Tighty-Whitey charging 
           her direction, toward the wall.

           Turning on her heels, Skylar runs east to 5th Ave.

           INHALE, EXHALE, INHALE! 

           Skylar turns left on-

           EXT. 5TH AVE BETWEEN 111TH AND 110TH - 5 SOMETHING A.M.

           -5th Ave. 

           Racing to 111th, she turns left again. 

           EXT. SKYLAR'S SPANISH-HARLEM BROWNSTONE - 5 SOMETHING A.M.

           Her brownstone in sight, she cleverly UNCLIPS her fanny-pack 
           as she runs up her steps, purposely spilling the contents of 
           the bag all over the elevated stoop.

           Grabbing her keys from the ground, she tries to find the 
           correct one, but Tighty-Whitey has just made it to the bottom 
           of the steps.

           In a frenzy, we watch Tighty-Whitey run up the steps.

           CLOSE ON Skylar thrusting a key into the lock, but-

           It’s too late. 

           He grabs her from behind, wrapping his arms around her and 
           lifting her high into the air, dragging her back down the 
           steps.

           Skylar SCREAMS bloody murder, but it’s New York City. No one 
           comes running when someone is screaming. That’s why they 
           teach women to yell FIRE! if they’re being assaulted. 

           But no one has ever told Skylar that excellent tip. I mean, 
           she and Andra always talk about signing up for self-defense 
           classes, but... you know.
           Carrying her to street-level, Tighty-Whitey literally throws 
           her body against the side of the brown-painted, cement 
           stairs, knocking the wind out of her. 

           He then grabs her by the hair and tosses her under the dark 
           of the stairs, her SCREAMS causing just one light across the 
           street to spring on.

           We see SOME ELDERLY LADY, 90s, glancing out her window, 
           trembling with fear. 

           “I didn’t want to get involved. He might come after me next,” 
           she’ll tell her girlfriends over breakfast.

           After a beat, she disappears from the curtain, her light 
           turning off again. 

           Barely able to breathe, Skylar remains on the ground. 

           Tighty-Whitey takes out his phone and PRESSES RECORD.

           IPHONE POV:

           Trembling with fear, Skylar begins to cry. This time though, 
           she’s not pretending.

           SKYLAR’S POV:

           Holding his phone with his right hand, Tighty-Whitey suddenly 
           shoves his left hand into his underwear, lightly stroking 
           himself. 

           Either he has trouble getting hard, or her fear is that much 
           of a turn on. Either way, it’s fucked up.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Looking away from him, Skylar prepares for the inevitable-

           When suddenly, she receives a facial of hot, red blood, 
           pouring down all over her countenance.

           PAN UP to reveal---

           A sharp wooden spike protruding through Tighty-Whitey’s body, 
           straight through his lungs.

           The stake then rips out again, spraying a larger fountain of 
           blood all over Skylar’s body. 

           Tighty-Whitey falls to his knees, to reveal--- 

           Andra, holding up one of her “vampire hunter” stakes, now 
           covered in blood.
           MASK PEEPHOLE POV:

           We see Tighty-Whitey lifts his fingers, his red marker stains 
           now saturated with real blood.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           This time... it’s Skylar’s face that falls completely void of 
           all empathy as she makes her way to her feet. 

           She steps closer to Tighty-Whitey, her attacker, his lungs 
           filling with blood, unable to breathe.

           Staring down at him, Skylar kicks him to the ground, then 
           kicks him again, rolling him over onto his back. 

           ECU OF TIGHTY-WHITEY’S BLUE EYES, BEGGING FOR MERCY.

           ECU OF SKYLAR’S EYES THAT OFFER NONE.

           His hand slowly reaches for his phone, one last desperate 
           attempt at survival, but...

           CRAAAAACK.

           With one bedazzled sneaker, Skylar steps on his fingers, 
           Tighty-Whitey deeply pained internally, but eerily not making 
           a fucking sound.

           Lifting Tighty-Whitey’s UNLOCKED phone, Skylar RECORDS this 
           young man’s final social media upload, his last INSTA story, 
           for all “The Disrupters” to see.

           IPHONE POV:

           Blood GURGLES and spits from Tighty-Whitey’s mouth, spewing 
           from the “breathing holes” of his mask and down his neck.

           He does not cry.

           He does not groan.

           He only bleeds out, his body quaking... until every fiber of 
           his being falls limp, surrendering to death. 

           Skylar releases the RECORD button.

           The VIDEO ENDS. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Skylar lowers the phone, still holding it limply in her hand. 
           In the silence that follows, Andra reverently stands next to 
           Skylar, both women hovering over this pile of limp flesh, 
           blood and gore.

           The two linger, utterly bewildered, as if something deep 
           inside both of them has also died in this very moment.

           Finally---

                                 SKYLAR
                             (not looking at her, 
                              softly)
                        Thank you. 

                                 ANDRA
                             (not looking at her 
                              either, softly back)
                        Of course.

           Tilting her head to Skylar-

                                 ANDRA (CONT’D)
                             (a light hearted joke)
                        You know... in the future... you 
                        reeeeally gotta find better guys to 
                        bring home.

           And then, out of nowhere---

           Jerrold suddenly lurches from his front door with a SCREAM, 
           wielding a long umbrella as a weapon, causing the two women 
           to jump.

                                 JERROLD
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHH! Get the fuck off my 
                        stoop, mother fuckers!

                                 SKYLAR
                        Jerrold, no-no-no, it’s just me! 
                        It’s Skylar!!

           Lowering his umbrella, confused-

                                 JERROLD
                        Skylar?! You all right?! 

           Through his open door, Jerrold reaches into his apartment and 
           POPS on the stoop light, shocked by the dead body that awaits 
           him.

                                 JERROLD (CONT’D)
                        Shiiiiiit.

           Jerrold pokes at Tighty-Whitey with his umbrella.
                                 JERROLD (CONT’D)
                             (a baffled beat)
                        I thought I heard screamin’, but... 
                        didn’t have my hearin’ aides in. 
                        Wasn’t sure if... if I was just 
                        dreamin’, or...

           Shaking his head, Jerrold looks deeply unsettled.

                                 JERROLD (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry I wasn’t there to... 
                        save you girls.

           Touched by this sentiment, no matter how archaic, Skylar 
           kindly wraps her arms around Jerrold’s neck and holds him 
           closely, gifting this elderly man from another generation 
           some well needed comfort.

                                 SKYLAR
                        It’s all right, Jerrold. We took 
                        care of it.

           But Jerrold doesn’t wrap his arms around her waist the way 
           you think a “creepy” old man might. In fact... it looks as if 
           Skylar had Jerrold all wrong.

           He isn’t creepy at all. 

           More like a loving grandfather.

                                 JERROLD
                             (at a loss)
                        Still... it’s my job to... to 
                        protect you.

           The three linger, suspended in this moment. 

           In silence. 

           As if time itself has stopped. 

           And maybe it has.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MEDICS tend to Skylar from her stairs as others load the BODY 
           OF TIGHTY-WHITEY into the ambulance. 

           We never see his face.

           POLICE OFFICERS take statements from Skylar, Andra, Jerrold 
           and a few NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS, as we-

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
           INT. SKYLAR'S SPANISH-HARLEM STUDIO - MORNING (CONTINUOUS)

           WHACK!

           The deadbolt is pulled back.

           CREEEAAAAAK!

           The door opens revealing Skylar, silhouetted by the sconces 
           in the hallway just behind her.

           She steps inside.

           CLICK! goes the light.

           She shuts the door.

           WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!

           Skylar employs all three locks on her door, an act she has 
           never done before.

           Turning again, she stands stoically, looking around her own 
           apartment as if she has no idea who even lives here.

           Shuffling to her bed, she stares at her charging cord still 
           resting on the comforter, the one little item that would have 
           greatly changed the course of her entire evening. 

           Strange.

           Skylar shuffles to her full length mirror, taking herself in.

           Her wingless, fuchsia fairy costume has been reduced to a 
           sweaty, dirt-encrusted, disheveled, bloodied mess. 

           Gangsta Tooth Fairy, indeed.

           Her fluffy, odd-eyed cat approaches with a JINGLE of its 
           “PUSSY” collar, rubbing against her torn tights and grass 
           stained high-tops now missing half their sequins.

           In a daze, she then shuffles to her record player and turns 
           it on, setting the needle to the first song.

           The STATIC SPIN of the tired turntable swells.

           Giving way to the bright, idealistic sound of a forgotten 
           era.

           A “simpler” time.

           Back when men were men and women were dames.
           Happy as a clam, we hear Nick Lucas once again sing the 
           classic "Looking at the World Thru Rose Colored Glasses."

                                 NICK LUCAS (V.O.)
                        “I'm looking at the world through 
                        rose colored glasses,
                        Everything is rosy now...”

           A younger version of Skylar would in this very moment simply 
           burst into tears. 

           But that was before. 

           A time that has now passed. 

           Which is why Skylar does not cry in this moment.

           She barely even blinks.

           For the woman who now stands before us is done “wishin’ on 
           fuckin’ stars and shit.” 

           Because she now understands, more than ever before, that her 
           innocent, quiet longings... are nothing more... than fairy 
           tales.

           Turning her head to that framed, black-and-white photo of her 
           mother, Skylar’s glazed come to an important realization.

           Determined, she grabs “Pussy,” tenderly tossing her into a 
           small crate.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JFK AIRPORT, TICKET COUNTER - MORNING

           CLOSE ON bedazzled converse high-tops walking across the tile 
           flooring... 

           PAN UP along torn, dirty, frayed tights.

           Up further to see the cat crate containing “Pussy.”

           Now, even higher, we come upon Skylar marching toward a 
           ticket counter, still in her disheveled fairy outfit, with 
           spatters of blood, dirt and grime, her “GANGSTA” fanny pack 
           having lost a jewel or two.

           But she doesn’t slow down, nor does she feel the need to 
           apologize or explain. 

           Uncomfortable, a TICKET WOMAN, 40s, straightens her jacket 
           and forces a chipper smile. 
                                 TICKET WOMAN
                        Good morning, uh... where are 
                        you... off to today?

                                 SKYLAR
                        I need to be in Austin... as soon 
                        as possible. By three o’clock at 
                        the latest. 

           The woman takes to her computer.

                                 TICKET WOMAN
                        Okay. And, uh... is this, uh... 
                        would you like a one way ticket, 
                        or... roundtrip?

           Skylar draws a breath to say, “One way, please.”

           But... stops.

           Her black eye sealed shut, her lip busted, Skylar allows her 
           imagination to bring her down the multiple pathways of every 
           possible outcome of her future. 

           And in the “choose your own adventure” of her own life... we 
           watch Skylar gather her resolve to decide, instead-

                                 SKYLAR
                        Roundtrip, please. 

           And there it is. 

           The mountain rising up again, stronger than ever before. 

           A woman who simply refuses to bend to the howls of men. 

           Like granite. 

           Unshakable.

           Unstoppable.

                                                             BLACK OUT.
