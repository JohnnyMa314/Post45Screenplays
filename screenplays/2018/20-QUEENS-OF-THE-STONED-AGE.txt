           Over black, we hear A SEDUCTIVE, CONFIDENT VOICE:

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Tell me what you see.

           As David Bowie’s iconic song FAME kicks in, we CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY 

           The one and only. Establishing shots of the greatest hits - 
           Skyscrapers, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge...

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        You see a city of wealth and 
                        possibility...

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

           We track a stunning REDHEAD (20S), dressed in the latest fall 
           fashion, walking down the street. Men GAWKING as she passes.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And the girl who has it all.

           EXT. PARK AVENUE ARMORY - DAY

           Chic MEN and WOMEN glide past velvet ropes. Paparazzi pepper 
           the street. This glamorous mayhem is NEW YORK FASHION WEEK. 
           Our Redhead enters a side door labelled TALENT.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        You see an industry of glamour...

           INT. PARK AVENUE ARMORY - MARC JACOBS RUNWAY SHOW - DAY 

           RUNWAY MODELS are spit out like bullets. Our Redhead sliding 
           down the catwalk, selling the hell out of what she’s wearing. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And the gorgeous creatures who 
                        inhabit it. 

           EXT. LE BAIN - ROOFTOP NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           An exclusive after party, our Redhead is having the time of 
           her life. We FREEZE on her tooth-paste commercial worthy 
           smile as she cheers with a full glass of Dom Pérignon.
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Fame, wealth, beauty. Everything 
                        you could ever want, right?
                             (beat)
                        Let me tell you what I see. I see a 
                        fucking scam.

           UNFREEZE as Redhead covertly shoves APPETIZERS into her bag. 

           EXT. LE BAIN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

           Down on the street, when everyone else is catching a cab or 
           hopping in their town cars, our girl heads for the subway.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        I see a girl who, if she’s lucky, 
                        might pay off the debt her agency 
                        has racked up on her. 

           INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

           Our Redhead eats stolen appetizers out of her purse. Her bank 
           account balance pulled up on her phone - only 75 bucks. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        I see a system designed to keep her 
                        poor and make everybody else rich.

           INT. REDHEAD’S RUNDOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It’s cramped, noisy, shitty. Home to THREE OTHER WOMEN. The 
           Redhead draws a shower curtain that sections off her “room.” 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        The designers, the agents, and the 
                        photographers - they get paid.

           INT. SPRING STUDIOS - TOM FORD RUNWAY SHOW - STAGE - DAY

           This day, our Redhead walks in a Tom Ford show.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But when this girl walks the 
                        runway, unless she’s Kate Moss or 
                        Gigi Hadid, she’s walking for free.

           INT. TOM FORD RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           All the glamour gone. Girls yanked out of their clothes, 
           treated like cattle, shoved into place.
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        So I said to hell with their 
                        system. And I started my own. 

           EXT. SPRING STUDIOS - DAY

           Show over, we follow the Redhead as she crosses the street.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        See, when this girl walks across 
                        the street to work for me, she’s 
                        going to make a shit-ton of cash. 
                        And she’ll make it on her terms.

           EXT/INT. HIGH END APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           We follow the Redhead into an upscale apartment where YOUNG 
           WOMEN pack JOINTS and EDIBLES into BOXES. It’s a sleek and 
           feminine operation, like a SUGARFINA FLOOR ROOM but for weed. 

           The finished boxes are labeled with HIGH QUEEN stickers then 
           packed into TITANIUM CAMERA CASES. Our Redhead grabs one, as 
           others return with theirs FILLED WITH CASH, handing them over 
           to their BOSS and the source of our Voice Over: 

           HONEY - An all American beauty with sparkling blue eyes, a 
           stylish blunt blonde bob and sleek wardrobe to match. Honey 
           reminds us of a modern twist on Michelle Pfeiffer in 
           Scarface. Cool, calculated, and fierce. She’s nobody’s baby.

                                 HONEY  (V.O.)
                        You can call me Honey. And no, 
                        that’s not my real name. 

           She takes a hit out of her BONG. Exhales a cool long hit. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        I’ve made millions running an 
                        illegal cash business without the 
                        cops or the Feds catching on, and 
                        I’d like to keep it that way. 

           Honey puts her bong down, overseeing the product, counting 
           money, handing out the girls their cut. This is her show. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Yeah, the times they are a 
                        changin’. Legalization, medical 
                        marijuana, blah blah blah. But here 
                        in New York, you sell a single 
                        ounce, you’re looking at 4 years in 
                        jail. 16 ounces? 16 years.
           Honey supervises girls working on GIFT BASKETS filled with 
           CANNABIS GOODIES: VAPE PENS, THC FACE MASKS, ROLLING PAPERS. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        So yes, it’s dangerous. But me and 
                        everyone here, we got tired of 
                        being overworked and underpaid. We 
                        got tired of following their rules. 
                        So we made our own. 

           Honey is interrupted when one of the girls whispers into 
           Honey’s ear. Hands her a cell phone.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Rules I designed to keep us safe. 
                        And they did.... 

           Honey listens to the call, heads out to the FIRE ESCAPE and 
           down to the street. Looks around for someone who isn’t there. 
           In quick succession A BURLAP BAG IS PULLED OVER HONEY’S HEAD. 
           She’s BOUND and THROWN INTO A TRUNK. Everything goes BLACK. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        ...’Til someone broke one of them. 
                        Then? Then everything went to shit. 

           Karen O screams ‘OFF WITH YOUR HEAD’ as we blast the A-Trak 
           remix of HEADS WILL ROLL, kicking off our title sequence:

                                 QUEENS OF THE STONED AGE

                                                                CUT TO:

           TIGHT ON HONEY’S BLUE EYES as they open. A FLASH OF LIGHT 
           cuts across her face, her pupils retract in pain.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        This is no good... cut her.

           Just as we think Honey is about to meet a disastrous end, we 
           WHIP PAN to a CASTING ASSISTANT pulling the plug on a GIANT 
           FAN. A PHOTOGRAPHER adjusts the lights out of Honey’s eyes.

           CHYRON IN: Two Years Earlier

           Honey very much alive, stands in front of a CASTING DIRECTOR, 
           her LONG BLONDE HAIR draping over her shoulders. 

                                 CASTING ASSISTANT
                        Thanks for coming in Honey. You’re 
                        not quite the look we’re going for. 

           Honey feigns a smile as she grabs her portfolio and leaves.
           INT. CASTING OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           As Honey exits, we see the hallway is lined with BEAUTIFUL 
           GIRLS ALL WITH LONG BLONDE HAIR and BLUE EYES. Typical.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Like so many of us, I was working 
                        hard, paying my dues, and getting 
                        completely fucked over.

           INT. BRIDE MAGAZINE EDITORIAL OFFICES - DAY 

           Honey stands in a studio filled with TEENAGE GIRLS in WEDDING 
           GOWNS. They’re re-arranged for an observing FASHION EDITOR. 

                                 FASHION EDITOR
                        Honey - how old are you? 

                                 HONEY 
                        Twenty-four.

                                 FASHION EDITOR
                        Thank you, you can go now.

           As Honey leaves the Fashion Editor barks to her staff.

                                 FASHION EDITOR (CONT’D)
                        This is a bridal issue not a 
                        funeral, people! Younger, please!

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        It turned out I was an old maid by 
                        twenty-four. Even when I booked a 
                        job, it wasn’t a cake walk either.

           INT. DESIGNER STUDIOS - DAY

           Honey struts in a fabulous dress for a fitting in front of a 
           DESIGNER and his ASSISTANTS. They talk openly about her body.

                                 DESIGNER
                        Lower the hem, her knees are too 
                        fat. And tape down her chest, 
                        cleavage is so pâssé.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But what I’d endure for a paycheck 
                        at this point was pretty much 
                        anything. I was in serious debt.

           Hands poke and prod Honey, undressing her like a doll. 
           EXT. ALPHABET CITY HIGH RISES - SUNSET 

           A Jenga tower maze of low-rent housing. Honey walks through 
           the open courtyard dragging a garment bag. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Back home, my options were working 
                        fast food, retail... maybe 
                        stripping on amateur night. Not 
                        exactly what little girls dream of.

           Other models pass by, all carrying their own garment bags.

                                 HONEY
                        So when modelling came my way, I’d 
                        jumped straight in-

           INT. ALPHABET CITY HIGH RISES - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Honey skims her mail - OVER DUE BILLS. Finally, a check from 
           her agency! Honey rips it open, but her smile curdles.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        -Praying the fall didn’t kill me.

                                 HONEY
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

           After all the deductions, her paycheck is only 500 bucks. 
           Elevator out of order, Honey heads for the stairs.

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Honey walks up endless-flights of stairs to her apartment. At 
           the top of the stairs we hear neighbors arguing, loud music.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Now I found myself trapped in what 
                        economists call a sunk cost 
                        fallacy. I’d put so much in, I was 
                        convinced I couldn’t walk away. 

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Honey enters a modest one bedroom apartment, decorated with 
           the enthusiasm of a freshman dorm room - eclectic and cheap.  
           Two sets of bunk beds sprawled across the living room, with 
           clothing racks, and shoes scattered in-between. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Luckily for me, I wasn’t alone.
                                 KATRINA (O.S.)
                        Honey, this FedEx box came for you-

           We turn to see Honey’s saving grace - her friends: MOR, (19) 
           a kick-ass Israeli model, and KATRINA, (19) a sultry Russian 
           model, are busy setting the table. She nods at a nearby box.

                                 HONEY
                        Thanks Katrina.

           Honey grabs the FedEx box and heads for the kitchen, 
           automatically assuming her role as Den Mother - picking up 
           scattered Diet Coke cans and bras off the floor on the way. 

           IN THE KITCHEN - Honey’s BFF MICKEY(24), an INDIAN girl with 
           long hair channeling Patti Smith’s androgynous punk swagger 
           and intellect. She cooks while blasting Vampire Weekend.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Damn Mickey, this looks amazing!
                             (they hug)
                        Thought we were going to have 
                        dinner next door at your place?

                                 MICKEY
                        My shitty roommates are hogging the 
                        place, watching Final Four. The 
                        place reeks of farts and PBR.

           Enough said. Honey cuts open the Box revealing GLORIOUS WEED.  

                                 HONEY
                        Well, look what I have for a little 
                        after dinner mint. Fresh from Cali.

                                 MICKEY
                        I can’t believe you have the guts 
                        to get that mailed straight to you.

           Honey smiles mischievously, snapping the box back.  

                                 HONEY
                        You can mail anything if you pack 
                        it with feminine hygiene products. 
                        Keeps drivers from opening it. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Beauty and brains, who knew?

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The girls gather around the table. Mickey dishes out the food-
           Honey walks out with Vodka and chilled glasses.
                                 HONEY
                        Rose and thorn time bitches! 

           Honey pours everyone a drink to start off the game.

                                 KATRINA
                        I’ll go first. Thorn - My ex back 
                        home started dating my now ex-BFF. 

                                 HONEY
                        A smart woman once said, fuck that 
                        shit, and lived happily ever after.

                                 KATRINA
                        I guess the Rose is that I know for 
                        sure he’s a total scumbag. 

           Cheers to that! They all take shots together. Mor’s turn.

                                 MOR
                        Thorn - I’m not done with this 
                        shitty water diet for the upcoming 
                        Marc Jacob’s show. Rose - I am 
                        almost done with this shitty water 
                        diet. Vodka doesn’t count, right?

           Mor takes a shot. Mickey’s turn. She looks conflicted.

                                 HONEY
                        Mickey? Come on.

                                 MICKEY
                        Thorn - Life sucks. Rose - At least 
                        it’s consistent about that.

                                 KATRINA
                        Too depressing... And I’m Russian.

           Mickey takes a shot of her drink. Honey doesn’t press her. 

                                 HONEY
                        Thorn - We’re all broke. Rose - 
                        We’re not doing it alone. To quote 
                        the great Carrie Bradshaw, Seasons 
                        come and go...

                                 KATRINA
                        Men come and go!

           They all laugh - hell yeah.

                                 HONEY
                        But friendship never goes out of 
                        style. Cheers-
           They all down their drinks. But Mickey looks pained.

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           The room is bare, except for an old bookcase shelved with 
           heady titles like BLINK, FREAKONOMICS, and THE ART OF WAR.  
           We glimpse Honey and Mickey on the FIRE ESCAPE just outside. 

                                 MICKEY (PRE-LAP)
                        Damn girl. That’s a work of art

           EXT. MODEL APARTMENT BEDROOM - FIRE-ESCAPE - CONTINUOUS 

           Mickey watches Honey roll a joint with an artist’s mastery. 

                                 HONEY
                        Should taste hints of clementine 
                        and white pepper.

           Honey lights up the joint delicately, passes it to Mickey.

                                 MICKEY
                        You’re such a stoner.

                                 HONEY
                        Weed can do more than just get you 
                        high. If anything, it sharpens my 
                        senses. Focuses me. Allows me to 
                        see through all the bullshit.

                                 MICKEY
                        Tell me then, Weed Psychic - Am I 
                        gonna be a bottle service girl 
                        forever, or do I ever get to be the 
                        music journalist of my dreams? 

                                 HONEY
                        Okay spill - what happened?

                                 MICKEY
                        I got into the Rolling Stone 
                        internship program today. 

                                 HONEY
                        Holy shit, Micks - that’s amazing!

                                 MICKEY
                        Except it’s unpaid. Had to turn it 
                        down - no way to do it and keep my 
                        bottle service gig at the Key Club. 
                        Wouldn’t be enough hours for rent 
                        with the concerts I’d have to see.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                             (she sighs deeply)
                        Feels like the Universe is trying 
                        tell me it’s never going to happen. 

                                 HONEY
                        Don’t say that. You’re Patti Smith 
                        meets Walt Whitman. The world needs 
                        your incredible writing! 

           Mickey brightens. Honey always knows exactly what to say.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Besides, at least you know what you 
                        want to do. I’m so burnt out on 
                        modeling but I’m so deep in debt. 
                        Feels like I’m stuck in quicksand.

                                 MICKEY
                        You know if you’re strapped for 
                        cash, I can always get you a shift 
                        at the club, right? It’s pretty 
                        good money actually, if you can 
                        stomach the soul sucking parts.

                                 HONEY
                        What job isn’t? Ugh - I’m just so 
                        tired of waiting on someone else’s 
                        permission to matter. Be nice to 
                        have a job where I feel in control 
                        of my life.  

                                 MICKEY
                        What you reckon we do about it?

           Honey thinks, then- 

                                 HONEY
                        Rob a bank? 

           That makes them laugh. Broke and drained, they share the 
           joint, staring out at the city. The best part of their day. 

                                 JOAN (PRE-LAP)
                        Honey, we’ve got a serious problem.  

           INT. FORD MODELS - OFFICE - DAY

           JOAN, late sixties trying to look forty, sits behind her desk 
           at the modeling agency, feigning concern for Honey. 

                                 JOAN
                        Your booking rate is down, and 
                        you’re three months behind on rent.
                                 HONEY
                        I know Joan. But I feel like I’ve 
                        gotten really close on the last 
                        couple of go-sees. I’ll book a job. 

                                 JOAN
                        You know, I like to say I never 
                        drop people. The marketplace does 
                        that for me. And in your case...

           She gestures to Honey’s file.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        I believe the marketplace has 
                        spoken. Unless you can get me that 
                        back rent, I need you out of the 
                        apartment by month’s end. 

                                 HONEY
                        Wait, you’re evicting me? Where am 
                        I am supposed to go? 

                                 JOAN
                        Sounds like a YP, not a MP.

           Joan buzzes for her Assistant. Honey zeroes in on Joan.

                                 HONEY
                        Is this because I wouldn’t sleep 
                        with that Vogue photographer?

                                 JOAN
                        Women who want to make it in this 
                        town know who needs to be done.
                             (off Honey’s look)
                        Yeah, yeah, #Metoo - whatever. Some 
                        things don’t change, kid. We can 
                        pretend they do, but they don’t.

           Honey stares at Joan with disgust. Her whole world imploding. 

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

           Honey sits at the table, numb and morose. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Now that modeling was over, girls 
                        like me were expected to settle 
                        down, marry a rich guy. Fuck that. 
                        I want to be the rich guy.

           She pushes her chair back hard, with purpose.
           INT. MICKEY’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Next door, Mickey struggles to write, as her FRATTY ROOMMATES 
           watch SPORTS. Honey appearing on the fire escape outside.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        I was broke, but I wouldn’t be 
                        broken.

           BANG BANG! Mickey comes over to the window. Sees Honey’s face 
           and immediately knows something’s wrong. Opens the window--

                                 HONEY
                        So tell me about the club. How much 
                        soul sucking are we talking about? 

           EXT. KEY CLUB - NIGHT

           Honey rolls up to the club with Mickey. They pass a line of 
           bougie clientèle all vying to get inside.

           Honey watches as guys are patted down by BOUNCERS before 
           entering the club, while women are waved right through. Not 
           even a bag search. Honey notes that. 

           INT. KEY CLUB - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

           The place is packed with FINANCE BROS and TRUST FUND KIDS -- 
           spending massive money on BOTTLE SERVICE. JASMINE (20s) - 
           African-American, killer street smarts and looks to match, 
           makes her way through the crowd toward Mickey.

                                 MICKEY
                        Jasmine, Hey! Here’s my friend I 
                        was telling you about-

           Jasmine has no time for small talk. She cuts her off-

                                 JASMINE
                             (to Honey)
                        You get one night to impress me or 
                        you’re out. No bullshit. You’re a 
                        server, not a guest.
                             (pulls down Honey’s top)
                        And always be selling. 

           Jasmine tosses them aprons and walks off. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Well, that went really great! 

           Honey gives her a look - seriously?
           INT. KEY CLUB - BAR / VIP BOOTHS - NIGHT

           Honey shadows Mickey at her tables. As Mickey and Honey go 
           back to the bar to load up her tray again, Jasmine swoops in. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Mickey - let Honey take this one.

           Honey heads to a table where IAN, pretentious asshole in a 
           pricey distressed t-shirt, texts. Mickey side eyes Jasmine.

                                 JASMINE (CONT’D)
                             (off Mickey’s look)
                        What? Sink or swim, right? 

           At the table, Honey struggles to figure out who ordered what. 

                                 HONEY
                        Sorry, was this your drink?

                                 IAN
                        Seriously? Are you that fucking 
                        blonde? A monkey could do your job.

           Honey studies Ian. Adjusts. Now she’s a stone cold bitch. 

                                 HONEY
                        I just thought you’d have gone with 
                        a bottle of Defiant Single Malt 
                        over this basic bitch shit. 
                             (off their faces)
                        It’s a local distillery, basically 
                        all Sufjan Stevens drinks. But I 
                        guess you’re tourists, right?

           Ian is pained. No one mistakes him for a tourist. 

                                 IAN
                        They must have messed up our order - 
                        Gimme two bottles of Defiant. Now!

           Smirk on her face, Honey heads back, puts in the order -- 
           clocking the surprise on Jasmine’s face. 

                                 JASMINE
                        How’d you know Sufjan Stevens 
                        drinks Defiant?

                                 HONEY
                        I didn’t. It was just the most 
                        expensive thing on the menu. 

           Mickey is pleased, looks to Jasmine. Told you.

           Honey comes in, exhausted but happy. Sees Mor has dozed off 
           there, watching Say Yes To The Dress. She grabs a blanket, 
           drapes it over Mor and sits down nearby, counting her cash. 
           For once, not worried if she’ll have enough money to eat.

                                 HONEY (V.O.) PRE-LAP
                        The club was capitalism at it’s 
                        finest. Beautiful women paid shit 
                        wages to serve overpriced booze.

           INT. KEY CLUB - NIGHT

           A SUPER-CUT of Honey evolving into a super saleswoman: Honey 
           morphing her personality from one table to the next. We pop 
           into Honey working her magic on TEXAN OIL EXECS:

                                 HONEY
                             (Texan accent)
                        Round of gold-flaked shots, fellas? 
                        As my daddy always says: We’re here 
                        for a good time, not a long time! 

           The table caves. SOLD! Honey swipes the card CHA-CHING! 
           Pockets a big tip. Curtsies. Her face drops as she turns.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        You didn't have to be Karl Marx to 
                        see we got a raw deal. The reason 
                        guys paid so much was because we 
                        were the ones selling them. All 
                        that money exchanged so they could 
                        try to grab my ass. 

           We see Jasmine moving through with her mama bear swagger.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But our floor captain Jasmine kept 
                        the club on lockdown. She knew 
                        everyone and everyone knew her. 

           A DRUNK GUY harasses Honey, GRABBING HER ASS. In an instant, 
           Jasmine is there -- HOISTING HIM UP BY HIS COLLAR.

                                 JASMINE
                        Apologize. Now.

                                 DRUNK GUY
                        I’m so, so, so sorry.... 

                                 JASMINE
                        Now get the fuck out of here.
           Without another word, he walks out of the club, humiliated.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But with all her confidence she was 
                        just as stuck as the rest of us.

           Quick cuts of JASMINE’S HOME LIFE at her Dad’s Apartment in 
           Brooklyn: Jasmine cooking, paying bills, helping her BROTHER 
           with homework, taking care of her DAD whose in a back brace. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        She’d put her art career on hold 
                        when her Dad injured his back. 
                        Since his worker’s comp wasn’t 
                        enough to take care of her little 
                        brother, she got right to work. 

           GARAGE SALE: her expensive art supplies for sale at a steal.

           INT. KEY CLUB - NIGHT

           Another night, another round of drinks and assholes. By this 
           point, it’s become routine for our girls. They’re burnt out. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        We were all trapped. Living 
                        paycheck to paycheck, enduring 
                        bullshit to inch our way out of 
                        debt. There had to be a better way. 

           EXT. THE KEY CLUB - BACK ALLEY- NIGHT

           Exhausted, Honey takes a moment to herself, smoking one of 
           her beautiful joints on break when a YUPPIE COUPLE approaches-

                                 YUPPIE GUY
                             (re: the joint)
                        You think, um, I could buy one?

                                 HONEY
                        Oh. Sorry - I only have a couple  
                        on me and I’m saving them for my 
                        friends. Try down by the park man.

           He nervously looks back at his HOT DATE, growing impatient. 

                                 YUPPIE GUY
                        Look, I told her I could score us 
                        something. How’s 50 bucks for two? 

                                 HONEY
                        Hundred and you got a deal. 
                                 YUPPIE GUY
                        Done.

           The Yuppie shells out the cash without a second thought, as 
           Honey slips him two joints. Then...  A lightbulb moment.  

                                 HONEY
                        Hey... next week, I’ll have more on 
                        me. I’ll hook you up. 

           The Yuppie Guy smiles, empowered by his first drug deal.

                                 YUPPIE GUY
                        Dope. 

           Honey holds the crisp hundred in her hand. Smiles.

                                 MICKEY (PRE-LAP)
                        You want to sell weed at the club?

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - DAY

           Honey and Mickey smoke out of a sleek clay pipe. Our girls 
           are modern. Think Goop, not Cheech and Chong. Remember that.  

           Honey types on her laptop, searching intensely.

                                 HONEY
                        Hell yes. This city is dry as fuck. 
                        New York’s living in the stone age 
                        while the rest of world is hurtling 
                        towards the stoned age. 
                             (she takes a hit)
                        But if we bring the watering hole 
                        to the animals-

                                 MICKEY
                        We skim them alive. I love it. So 
                        what, we pool our money, order more 
                        from your source in Cali?

                                 HONEY
                        If I order more than a box a month, 
                        we’ll get tipped off to the cops or 
                        ripped off by Fed Ex drivers. Nah, 
                        we’re gonna need a local dealer.

                                 MICKEY
                        So how do we find one? It’s not 
                        like those guys advertise. 

           Honey flips around her laptop -  we see she’s cross-
           referenced NYPD CRIME MAPS with YELP - on a mission.
                                 HONEY
                        No, but they mark their territory.

           Honey stops on a YELP PAGE for a dive bar: THE WOLF’S DEN. 
           The reviews all stating: “DRUG DEALER HANG-OUT. BEWARE!” 

           EXT. BROOKLYN STREET / WOLF’S DEN - NIGHT 

           Desolate, run-down area. The only thing open is THE WOLF’s 
           DEN - a dive bar that reeks of whiskey, urine, and blood. 

           INT. WOLF’S DEN - NIGHT 

           Inside the crowd is just as rough. PAULIE, an Ali G knock-
           off, holds court in the back. Honey clocks him selling DIME 
           BAGS. She takes out a SPLIFF, lights it up. 

                                 HONEY
                        Follow my lead.

           Honey seductively locks eyes with Paulie. The smell of WEED 
           and TOBACCO rolls over him. He likes what he sees and smells.

                                 PAULIE
                        Well dayumn, what are you fine 
                        ladies doing in a place like this?

           She blows smoke in his face. Paulie loving every minute. 

                                 HONEY
                        We like a little trouble with our 
                        whiskey. Think you can help us out?

           Paulie licks his lips, looking Honey up and down. 

                                 PAULIE
                        I have whatever your heart desires. 
                        Cocaine, Molly, Weed- 

                                 HONEY
                        Forget all that hard stuff. We’re 
                        strictly organic. We’ll take a 
                        quarter pound of weed.

           Paulie and his guys laugh.

                                 PAULIE
                        A quarter pound? This ain’t 
                        McDonald’s. Why don’t you start 
                        with something like a dime bag. You 
                        even know what a dime bag is? 
                                 HONEY
                        Yeah. And I know what I asked for. 

           Paulie studies her. Not buying it. 

                                 PAULIE
                        Sorry, I only deal with real 
                        hustlers. Not princesses who saw 
                        one too many episodes of Breaking 
                        Bad. This game is serious, yo. 

           Paulie shifts, revealing a gun tucked into his waistband. 
           Mickey blanches. As Paulie turns to go...

                                 HONEY
                        Oh, I know all about games. Clearly 
                        you’re a big fan of Dress Up. 

           Paulie turns - what did you say?

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Your Supreme jacket, the label is 
                        supposed to be outside right 
                        sleeve, your pants are made with a 
                        cheap polyester and your Yeezys, 
                        woof. That toe stitching is busted.   
                        Knock-offs -- all of them. 

           Paulie’s friends Ooooooohhhh. Them’s fighting words. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        You may act the part of bad-ass 
                        drug dealer, but you got played by 
                        a sixteen-year-old mall clerk.

           Paulie’s crew laughs. Honey takes a long drag of her spliff.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Me, I know how to dress the part 
                        You look at me and see a good girl, 
                        because that’s what I want you to 
                        see. That’s my hustle. 

           Honey moves closer, enunciating her point. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t see a girl who grew up in 
                        the foster system. Who roomed with 
                        car thieves, meth heads, and 
                        gangbangers. Who came to this city 
                        with less than twenty bucks. 
                        Because I don’t want you to.
           Paulie is listening. So is Mickey. This is news to her too. 
           Honey slides over an envelope of CASH.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s a grand for a quarter pound, 
                        which we both know is generous 
                        since the going rate on the street 
                        is sixty bucks an eighth. 
                             (a beat)
                        But I’ll take my money elsewhere if 
                        you aren’t up to the challenge.

           Paulie studies Honey - then smiles. Extends his hand.

                                 PAULIE
                        I’m Paulie. And you girls are?

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           RIPPPP! Honey cuts open a package revealing A BEAUTIFUL 
           QUARTER POUND OF WEED. Mickey helps Honey divide the weed.

           There’s a weird tension in the air. Mickey address the 
           elephant in the room delicately.  

                                 MICKEY
                        Was what you told Paulie true? Or-

           Honey’s a bit embarrassed, but open to talk. 

                                 HONEY
                        Yeah... My mom had me super young. 
                        I was in group homes starting 
                        around the age of five. Moved here 
                        when I was eighteen to model - you 
                        know the rest.

                                 MICKEY
                        That’s rough Honey, I’m sorry-

                                 HONEY
                        Don’t be... It taught me that when 
                        you find people you love, keep them 
                        close to you. 

           She gestures to the product in front of them.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s why I want to do this. I 
                        won’t let this City break us apart. 

           Mickey smiles. This is why she loves Honey. 
                                 MICKEY
                        Hell yeah. Let’s do it. 

           Mickey motions to all their product.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        You think Jasmine is gonna mind?

                                 JASMINE (PRE-LAP)
                        No way in hell are you selling weed-

           INT. KEY CLUB - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

           Jasmine stares, pissed, as Honey and Mickey plead their case.

                                 JASMINE
                        If you two get caught, I lose my 
                        job, and that cannot happen.

                                 HONEY
                        Jas, all you have to do is send 
                        people our way. For every referral, 
                        I kick you back 20%. 

           Jasmine thinks about it. She does need the money...

                                 JASMINE
                        Let’s say I’m intrigued. What are 
                        we even charging these suckers?

           Honey hands her the spread. Jasmine studies it, then-

                                 JASMINE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, I’m in. But no hard shit. I 
                        don’t need dizzy bitches ODing here 

           Honey and Mickey exchange smiles. They’re open for business. 

                                 JASMINE (CONT’D)
                        Gotta say, I never figured you two 
                        for weed dealers. 

                                 HONEY
                        See, that’s why it’s perfect...

           INT. MODEL APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Honey and Mickey load up their purses. Honey does last looks-

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Rule Number One for selling weed - 
                        Don’t look like you sell weed.
           - switches it out Mickey’s leather jacket for a chic blazer. 

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           The train stops and our girls step onto the platform. As they 
           do, two NYPD cops clock them, and head DIRECTLY towards them. 

           But the cops pass them by, focused on A SKETCHY KID with a 
           weed leaf sewn into his thrift-store jacket. Our girls speed 
           away as the cops interrogate him, searching his backpack.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Dress professionally and in 
                        character. If you play the part of 
                        the everyday city girl...

           EXT. KEY CLUB - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Honey and Mickey stroll up, as bouncers scrutinize every 
           customer - but unhook the velvet rope for them, all smiles.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        ...No one will suspect a thing.

           INT. KEY CLUB - VIP TABLE - NIGHT

           Jasmine talks to BIG SPENDERS. Deal done, Jasmine takes THE 
           MONEY and waves over Honey, who then discreetly slides her 
           packaged joints under the table while serving drinks. FREEZE:

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Some of you may be judging me, but 
                        despite what McGruff the Crime Dog 
                        said, smoking pot won’t kill you. 
                        Shit, drinking does more harm, yet 
                        cracking a Budweiser is as American 
                        as apple pie.

           UNFREEZE: Rihanna’s POUR IT UP builds as we see the system in 
           action - PRODUCT MOVING FASTER THAN OUR GIRLS CAN KEEP UP. 

           INT. WOLF’S DEN - DAY

           Honey, Mickey and Jas show up to buy MORE WEED from Paulie.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        It was your classic Captive Market. 
                        - Rich lazy clientele willing to 
                        pay a premium for easy access.
           INT. KEY CLUB - NIGHT

           We see a BABY-FACED TECH ENTREPRENEUR, DEREK. After a quick 
           convo, Jasmine flags Honey over. He smiles wide, excited.

                                 DEREK
                        Greetings and salutations! I’m 
                        Derek, but you can call me Big D...

           Honey works hard to suppress her smirk.

                                 HONEY
                        Nice working with you, Derek.

           Derek flashes the goods to his friends. They’re psyched!

                                 HONEY (V.O.) (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        With Jasmine’s help, word spread 
                        fast. We became the coolest party 
                        favor in town, a status symbol.

           We see THE CASH ROLLING in and as it does:

                                 HONEY (V.O.) PRE-LAP (CONT’D)
                        It’s true what they say - New York 
                        is more fun when you’re rich. 

           - Honey pays back Joan, BUYING OUT HER MODELING CONTRACT. 
           Treats her MODEL ROOMMATES to a SPA DAY to celebrate!

           - Jasmine buys a NEW BACKPACK for her BROTHER, a NEW CHAIR 
           for her DAD, and ART SUPPLIES for herself.

           - Mickey has taken the Rolling Stone internship. We see her 
           pitching stories, interviewing musicians. 

           - Finally, WE END OUR MONTAGE ON: Honey & Mickey moving into 
           a NEW APARTMENT together! Jasmine, Mor, Katrina show up with 
           house warming gifts, Chinese take out, and of course vodka.

           EXT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - NIGHT

           One of the most expensive co-ops on the Upper West Side, if 
           not the entire city. Paulie and his hoochie date, STELLA, 
           exit a taxi in front of the ominous building. 

                                 STELLA
                        Paulie I thought the party was in 
                        Dumbo? Why are we uptown?

                                 PAULIE
                        Gotta drop something off first. 
           INT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           They step off the elevator into a luxury penthouse. Bored 
           WOMEN and their FINANCE BOYFRIENDS lounging on sofas. MUSIC 
           BLASTS from an unseen source. Paulie heading further back.

           INT. PENTHOUSE - DEN - NIGHT

           Paulie and Stella enter a smoky man cave. A glass display 
           case of macho movie memorabilia lines the back wall. The 
           wireless speakers blasting Tame Impala’s LET IT HAPPEN.

           The owner of this adult playpen is RICH WAKEFIELD. A handsome 
           trust fund fuck-up. He fancies himself the smartest person in 
           every room and carries himself like the diplomat’s son that 
           he is. (And not to mention the swagger that comes with 
           diplomatic immunity). 

                                 RICH
                        See, a Matrix future just isn’t 
                        believable - so you’ve harvested 
                        humans for batteries. Now what? 
                        What do they want? To merely exist? 

           Rich’s theories go unappreciated by his THUGS, but Rich 
           doesn’t seem to care -- too busy doing another line. He then 
           hefts a MEDIEVAL SWORD, waving it around to the music, eyes 
           closed. Paulie has to scream to get his attention. 

                                 PAULIE
                        Rich...RICH!

           Rich finally open his eyes, notices Paulie:

                                 RICH
                        Alexa - turn it down.
                             (a beat)
                        ALEXA - TURN IT THE FUCK DOWN! 

           The music finally quiets. Rich waves the sword at Paulie.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Check it out, Paulie - It’s Conan 
                        the Barbarian’s sword. An Atlantean 
                        Bastard. Real steel...

           Paulie takes out a THICK ENVELOPE and hands it to Rich. 

                                 PAULIE
                        Ah, cool... Wanted to drop off what 
                        I owe you for last week’s delivery.
           Rich points his sword at Paulie’s chest, dead serious. His 
           mania is unsettling, like he’s on a different wavelength.

                                 RICH
                        Late again Paulie. Not good.

                                 PAULIE
                        Woah, I can explain man-

           Rich lowers the sword, smiles, tosses the envelope to a Thug.

                                 RICH
                        It’s cool brother. You’re just in 
                        time for new product testing. 

           Rich gestures to the coke. Paulie does a line, then Stella. 
           Rich resumes his rant -- as if he’d never been interrupted. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Only Battlestar Galactica really 
                        posits what robots want. Not an 
                        energy source or “to rule the 
                        world.” No, these Robots find God. 
                        And thus, they seek the answer to 
                        the question we all must ask -

           The Thug nods to Rich. Leaves Paulie’s cut on the table. 
           Paulie relaxes. He reaches for his cut of the take when-

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        -What is our PURPOSE?! 

           BAM! RICH SLAMS HIS SWORD INTO PAULIE’S HAND. PINNING IT TO 
           THE TABLE. STELLA SCREAMS. Paulie is frozen, in shock.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Do you know your purpose, Paulie? 
                        Cause it doesn’t seem like you 
                        fucking do. See when you pay me 
                        late, it tells me you don’t respect-
                             (to Stella)
                        SHUT UP!

           RICH’S THUG pulls out a 9MM GLOCK WITH A SILENCER AND POP! - 
           LETS OFF A WARNING SHOT into the wall next to her head.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        WATCH THE COLLECTIBLES!

           One of Rich’s Finance friends, TEDDY, stumbles in...

                                 TEDDY
                        Hey Richie boy - HOLY FUCK, DUDE! 
                        Your Dad is going to freak!!!!
           The Thug instinctively swings the gun at Teddy. Stella 
           whimpering as quietly as she can, choking back her fear.

                                 RICH
                        No, he’s not, Teddy, because he’s 
                        in Ghana on an ambassadorial relief 
                        mission, and unless you want your 
                        Dad to find out about the dead 
                        hookers in Rio - you’ll close the 
                        door behind you and let me get back 
                        to my FUCKING business. 

           Teddy backs out. Rich cracks a smile.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Funny - it’s a silencer on so many 
                        levels. 

           The Thug now places the gun at Paulie’s head-

                                 PAULIE
                        Please. I won’t be late ever again. 

                                 RICH
                        You know me Paulie, I’m not this 
                        guy, but I can’t have my top dude 
                        slackin’ off. Sets a bad example.

                                 PAULIE
                        WAIT - I got these new clients - 
                        chicks, really hot. They deal at 
                        this club downtown and they’re 
                        bringing in mad money for me. 

                                 RICH
                        Lady dealers. Interesting... 

           Paulie notes Rich’s interest, senses a lifeline.

                                 PAULIE
                        Could introduce you, have them pass 
                        the profits off directly to you. 

           Rich considers this. Intrigued. Then...

                                 RICH
                        Paulie - this is the kind of out of 
                        the box thinking I need more of!

           Rich pulls his sword from Paulie’s hand. All smiles again. 

                                 PAULIE
                        Thanks Rich. I won’t let you down.
           Rich nods, waves at the Thug to escort Paulie and Stella out. 

                                 RICH
                        Alexa - resume Tame Impala.

           Rich wipes down his sword. "Let it happen, let it happen...”

           INT. HONEY & MICKEY’S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

           Tight on HANDCUFFS as traffickers are perp walked, their WEED 
           seized by the DEA. PULL OUT to reveal we’re watching TV.

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine lounge on the couch, taking notes 
           on a CNN special on the drug war. Honey’s coffee table 
           stacked with books on famous drug empires and their leaders. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Who’d have thought a damn power 
                        bill would tip the cops off to your 
                        indoor grow site? Crazy!

           Honey holds onto her joint, twirling it - thinking.

                                 HONEY
                        Seems like for a grow site in the 
                        city to actually work, you’d need 
                        to find a way to get electricity 
                        without anybody noticing. 

                                 MICKEY
                        What, like with a windmill?

                                 HONEY
                        Something more practical. Like how 
                        people boosted cable TV back in the 
                        day. Could tap into a subway grid - 
                        siphon the power undetected. 

           Jasmine laughs. Can’t believe what she’s hearing.

                                 JASMINE
                        Siphoning power? You going to 
                        attach jumper cables to the tracks?  

           Mickey and Jasmine laugh at this, to Honey’s annoyance. The 
           girls’ phones vibrate all at once. A group text.

                                 HONEY
                        Paulie wants us to meet at a new 
                        location tonight. Somewhere uptown?
                                 MICKEY
                        I am personally shocked that guy 
                        has ever been above 14th street.

                                 HONEY
                        Whatever. We gotta re-up anyway. 

           EXT. EQUINOX GYM - NIGHT

           A Taxi pulls to a stop outside... an EQUINOX GYM? Honey, 
           Jasmine and Mickey exchanging looks as they get out. A THUG 
           dressed in stylish sports gear approaches, opening the door.

                                 THUG
                        This way ladies. Paulie and Mr. 
                        Wakefield are waiting for you.

           A LOUD whirring coming from the roof. The girls look up. WTF?

           EXT. EQUINOX ROOF - RACE TRACK - NIGHT

           Rich races his crew in go-carts reenacting a live-action 
           version of SUPER MARIO KART. Rich reps MARIO, others dressed 
           up as BOWSER, LUIGI, and TOAD. Poor Paulie is dressed as 
           YOSHI the dinosaur, waving a flag, his hand freshly bandaged.

                                 MICKEY
                        Shit, is that Paulie?  

                                 JASMINE
                        That is one sad-ass T Rex.

           Rich is in the lead when another driver accidentally passes 
           him. Rich, pissed, slams his car into the driver’s bumper, 
           causing the car to skid off the track. 

           Rich crosses the finish line victorious. Drives over to Honey 
           and the girls, skidding to a splashy stop. Mr. Fast and 
           Furious. He’s trying hard to impress them, especially Honey.

                                 RICH
                        Ah, the girls Paulie was raving 
                        about. Let me guess, you’re Honey?

                                 HONEY
                        I am. 

           Honey extends her hand... Rich kisses it. She feigns a smile. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        These are my partners Mickey and 
                        Jasmine... And you are?
           Rich smiles like a shark -- all teeth and arrogance.

                                 RICH
                        I’m Paulie’s boss, Richard. But my 
                        friends call me Rich. And I can see 
                        we’re all going to be very good 
                        friends, so please... call me Rich.

           Rich SNAPS his fingers and Paulie rushes over with a bottle 
           of SAKE. Rich pours them a drink, mansplaining as he goes. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        I learned to appreciate good sake 
                        during my gap year in Japan. In the 
                        Shinto religion, sake is literally 
                        the liquor of the gods. They drink 
                        it for a bountiful and blessed 
                        harvest. So here’s to a bountiful 
                        future for us. KANPAI!

           CLINK! Rich keeps staring at Honey, hungry, curious. He grabs 
           an apple from a lavish fruit spread. Bites.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Too bad you weren’t here earlier. 
                        You’d make a good Princess Peach. 

                                 HONEY
                        I’m not a girl in need of saving.

           Honey grabs the apple out of Rich’s hand and takes a bite. 
           Rich laughs. He likes this girl’s style. 

                                 RICH
                        Going forward, I wanted to make 
                        sure you dealt directly with me. 
                        You know, get the VIP treatment... 
                        and the VIP product.

           Rich walks over to an APPLE CRATE - and opens one up - POUNDS 
           OF WRAPPED MARIJUANA neatly packed inside. Top level strains.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Best in the Eastern Seaboard. 5 G 
                        an elbow. Cash only of course.

           Honey goes to cut it open, Rich stops her.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Not here darling. 

                                 HONEY
                        I’ll have to take your word for it.
                                 RICH
                        Honey, the only thing I got in this 
                        world is my balls and my word, and 
                        I don't break 'em for nobody. 

           Honey confers with her girls. They WHISPER to each other.

                                 HONEY
                        I mean, the numbers are good...

                                 JASMINE
                        So what? This guy seems nuts! He’s 
                        dressed as Mario for Christ-sakes! 

                                 HONEY
                        He’s a drug dealer -- they’re ALL a 
                        little crazy.

                                 MICKEY
                        Maybe we shouldn’t rush this?

                                 HONEY
                        Look, I know exactly how to handle 
                        him. Trust me. This is good for us. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Hope you’re right.

           Honey turns back to Rich.

                                 HONEY
                        We’ll pay the Five G.

                                 JASMINE
                        But with a scaling discount for 
                        future bulk orders. 

                                 HONEY
                        Do we have a deal, Tony Montana?

           Rich throws his arm up joyously.

                                 RICH
                        You caught me! Wouldn’t have pegged 
                        you for a Scarface fan. These guys 
                        don’t appreciate the classics. 

                                 HONEY
                        What can I say, I’m a woman of 
                        varied interests.  

                                 RICH
                        I love it. We’re in business. 
           Rich grabs her and gives her a BEAR HUG -- startling her. All 
           child-like enthusiasm and scary intensity.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        I look forward to a long and 
                        beautiful partnership.

           Rich stares at Honey as she leaves. His new obsession.

           INT. HONEY & MICKEY’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Crack! The girls crowbar open a CRATE OF WEED. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.) 
                        With Rich supplying larger 
                        quantities, we were finally able to 
                        move weight on a real level.

           VROOOM - The girls vacuum seal, pack, and rolls joints. 
           Jasmine flashes HAND DRAWN LABELS for their new strains.

                                 JASMINE
                        Figure we needed something to tell 
                        the new strains apart. You like it?

           Mickey and Honey are impressed. The girl can draw.

                                 HONEY
                        This is amazing. Great thinking!

           EXT. KEY CLUB - NIGHT

           The girls round the corner, to find: 

                                 JASMINE
                        What the-

           A crowd of FBI AGENTS bustling in and out of the club. Crates 
           of documents being carried away, the club OWNER in handcuffs 
           nearby, arguing with an FBI agent. The girls stare, in shock.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But it turned out we weren’t the 
                        only ones with a side hustle.

                                 JASMINE (PRE-LAP)
                        FUUUCCCCKKKKK!

           INT. HONEY AND MICKEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The girls are in shock. Their massive supply around them. 
                                 JASMINE
                        That motherfucker paid us shit 
                        wages. Why didn’t he at least pay 
                        his damn taxes? And who was getting 
                        all my damn FICA money then?

           Honey packs a huge bowl. Lights up. Her phone RINGS.

                                 MICKEY
                        Sure you wanna smoke right now? 

                                 HONEY
                        It recharges me, like Popeye eating 
                        his spinach. 

           Honey’s phone rings again. She silences it. 

                                 MICKEY
                        We’re totally screwed. We don’t 
                        even have shitty day jobs now!

                                 HONEY
                        Mickey, don’t look at this 
                        situation as what we’ve lost, but 
                        what we have to gain. If we just-

           Honey’s phone VIBRATES across the table. She grabs it.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        WHAT??!!

           On the line is club regular, tech-nerd “BIG-D” DEREK.

                                 DEREK (O.S.)
                             (on phone)
                        Uh, Honey? Oh, uh, it’s Big-D. 

                                 HONEY
                        Oh hey Derek, look this isn’t-

                                 DEREK (O.S.)
                        I went to the club, but-

                                 HONEY
                        Yeah it’s shut down. We know. 

                                 DEREK
                        See, I’m having a party tonight. I 
                        was wondering if you knew anywhere 
                        else I could go for weed?

           Honey takes a hit off her bong. Something clicking. Scans the 
           room: Amazon boxes. Chinese delivery, Seamless flyers. 
                                 HONEY
                        Forget somebody else, we’ll come to 
                        you. Just be a bit of a surcharge-
                             (a pause, then)
                        Double? 

           We PRE-LAP a KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK as we CUT TO:

           INT. LUXURY CONDOS - DEREK’S PLACE - NIGHT

           Derek opening the door to find Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine 
           outside his door. His luxury pad packed with people.

                                 JASMINE
                        Damn, did you invent the Internet?

                                 DEREK
                        Ha, no. I just patented this neat 
                        algorithm that forecasts if- 

                                 PETEY (O.S.)
                        Yo Big D, your dealers are bangin’! 

           PETEY, a drunk SILICON-TECH NERD, wanders over, as the girls 
           start laying out the goods. Staring in amazement.

                                 PETEY (CONT’D)
                        Even sicker spread! Noice.

           The girls run through each option like the weed sommeliers 
           they are. Finally, they can show off their knowledge rather 
           than having to hide and shout over the music of a club.

                                 HONEY
                        You’ve got your Sativa, your 
                        Indica, and your hybrids. 

                                 JASMINE
                        For cozy nights in, I recommend an 
                        Indica like Grand Daddy Purps.

                                 MICKEY
                        And for a party, a sativa like Maui 
                        Waui will really ramp you up.

           The risque Tupperware party starts attracting the other 
           guests. Honey opens a bag. Lets the aroma wash over Derek.

                                 HONEY
                        My personal favorite. A hybrid of 
                        Blueberry indica with sativa Haze. 

           Petey is floored by their knowledge. Everyone is impressed.
                                 DEREK
                        I’ll take it.

                                 HONEY
                        Great. How much you want? 

                                 DEREK
                        All of it.

           Derek flashes a HUGE STACK OF CASH. Jasmine and Mickey stare.

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        Double, like we discussed.

           Honey accepts the stack happily. This actually worked! Guests 
           descend on the new party favors, excited.

                                 DEREK (CONT’D)
                        You fair maidens are the queens of 
                        the party. 

           Honey, smirks - an idea forming. A brand, in fact:

                                 HONEY
                        Better - we’re the High Queens. 
                        Tell your friends.

           INT. HONEY & MICKEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mickey, Honey and Jasmine stare at the cash they just made.

                                 MICKEY
                        Did we just make as much in one 
                        sale as we did all last week? 

                                 HONEY
                        Ladies, I think we’re in the 
                        delivery business now.

           Wired, ideas flowing, filled with passion. Honey’s on one. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Think about it - we can bring our 
                        expertise and good vibes direct to 
                        consumer. And make twice the money. 
                             (shows her phone)
                        Since the club closed, I’ve been 
                        getting hit up by regulars nonstop.  

           Honey tosses her phone - More regulars asking where they are.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        No more shitty day jobs.
                                 MICKEY
                        We could set our own hours...

                                 JASMINE
                        Pay off debts...

                                 HONEY
                        We play our cards right - we could 
                        become the Seamless for Cannabis!
                             (takes a drag)
                        I mean, don’t you think it’s time 
                        for all of us to stop being bossed 
                        around and start being the boss?!

           Honey extends her pinky.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        What do you say? Equal partners?

           Jasmine takes a hit, is silent, then -

                                 JASMINE
                        I think this is the most out there 
                        nonsense I’ve heard from you yet... 
                        BUT I LOVE IT! I’m in.

                                 MICKEY
                        Let’s smoke this town.

           Jasmine extends her pinky, followed by Mickey. The girls all 
           linked up. Their B.F.F Ritual. 

                                 HONEY 
                        High Queens is open for business! 

           Queen’s ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST tracks our next MONTAGE:

           EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine walk down the street together, 
           carrying chic purses. They split up like fighter jets.

           KNOCK KNOCK! Mickey, in a PANT-SUIT, is greeted by a A FEMALE 
           POWER BROKER, juggling two phones. Mickey picks out the most 
           relaxing strain, as her male assistant pays the tab.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Overnight, We became the Fairy-
                        Godmothers every overworked, 
                        anxious New Yorker needed.

           KNOCK KNOCK! Jasmine, donning an artsy Soho look, is greeted 
           by an AVANT-GARDE PAINTER with A LIZARD on her shoulder. 
           Jasmine enters in awe of her giant paintings. Jasmine rolls 
           out her stash - The woman lets the Lizard “pick”. 

           KNOCK KNOCK! Honey, wearing hipster grunge and fake glasses, 
           is greeted by Ian, the asshole hipster from before. Again, 
           she’s a stone-cold bitch. Ian buys it all. As Honey exits, 
           she takes off her fake hipster glasses, smiling. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Along with dressing the part, we 
                        soon found that we needed to 
                        establish a few other rules....

           Jasmine deals with a SLEEP DEPRIVED COUPLE with juggling 
           NEWBORN TWINS, totally scattered. The DAD goes for his wallet-

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Rule Number Two? Well, you think 
                        it’d be obvious but... 

           -and hands Jasmine a CHECK. Her face drops.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        CASH ONLY! No checks, no IOUs. 
                        Credit? Forget it.

           Jasmine walks the Dad to an ATM. Get paid in cash. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And that went for us too. 

           At RICH’S PENTHOUSE - The girls drop off BAGS OF CASH. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        The thought of owing Rich a favor-

           Rich springs up from his chair, close to Honey’s face. She 
           jerks back as he -- gently PLUCKS a fallen eyelash.

                                 RICH
                        Make a wish beautiful.

           Honey forces a smile, blows. Rich throws his arm around her.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        -made me sick. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.) 
                        That’s why Rule Number Three was 
                        Business and pleasure do not mix.

           DING! Mickey steps into a chic loft, where she’s greeted by 
           SAI, a handsome Indian Musician. A guitar strapped around his 
           toned bare chest. Mickey’s heart skips a beat.
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Absolutely no dating of the 
                        customers. 

           He pours Mickey a glass of wine, asks her to stay and smoke. 
           Mickey sadly declines. Fanning herself as she leaves. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        We sold weed, not sex.
                        And anyone who crossed the line-

           Jasmine is propositioned by a TATTED CHEF. SLAP! As she 
           leaves we see the Chef is NAKED behind his apron.

           Honey is propositioned by a SWINGER COUPLE in kimonos. They 
           give her a look, reach for her hand. She pulls hers back.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        -was 86’ed off the client list. 

           In both cases, their numbers get DELETED. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
                        Finally, Rule Number Four was 
                        simple: Trust your gut. 

           Honey rounds a corner, notices TWO TOUGH LOOKING DUDES 
           smoking cigarettes on a stoop. She texts her client MARIE-

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        A woman’s intuition is a powerful 
                        thing. So If it feels wrong...

           -but sees THE GUY’S PHONE buzz instead. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        ...then it is wrong. Leave.

           Honey dips into a bodega and out the back -- out of there.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And at the rate our business was 
                        growing, we could be picky.

           INT. HONEY & MICKEY’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine juggle DUFFLE BAGS OF CASH, trying 
           to shove it into a closet. It’s filled to the brim. Honey 
           goes to the kitchen, checks a cabinet - product falls out on 
           top of her -- she turns to the girls.

                                 HONEY
                        We’re gonna need a bigger boat.
           EXT./INT. UNDISCLOSED FOUR-STORY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           A landlord takes down his “FOR LEASE” sign as Honey pays the 
           deposit in cash. Jasmine glances around, then double-takes...

                                 JASMINE
                        Uh, you see what’s across the 
                        street from us?

                                 HONEY
                        Yeah, it’s perfect. Free security. 

           As the girls go inside, we REVERSE to see: a POLICE PRECINCT. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS DISPATCH #1 - DAY

           The girls move in to their official headquarters. Start 
           unpacking, making the place feel like home. HONEY Looks at 
           their low inventory, dials up Rich...

                                 HONEY (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
                        In any business, from shoes to make-
                        up, the fun is in the retailing, 
                        the darkness is in the sourcing. 

           INT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - PENTHOUSE 

           DING! Honey exits the private elevator. She’s escorted by one 
           of Rich’s Thugs to a back room where...

                                 HONEY (V.O.) 
                        Really, selling drugs is not too 
                        different from running a fast-food 
                        chain. You have your cooks, 
                        salesman, accountants, & security.

           ...we see an assembly line of Thugs packaging HARD DRUGS. 
           Others counting money, other THUGS clearly muscle.

           Rich walks out and greets Honey, slides his hand down her 
           back as he leads her to her supplies. Honey’s skin crawls.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Then you have your shitty Regional 
                        Managers - like Rich - who oversee 
                        franchise owners like me for the 
                        top guys - the Board of Directors.

           Rich counts Honey’s cash, while staring at her creepily. 
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But, like most upper level 
                        management, you’d never hear from 
                        them as long as business was good. 

           A Thug walks over holding a cell phone, whispers in his ear.

                                 RICH
                        I gotta take this. We’re good here.

           Rich takes his business call in another room. Honey peers 
           around the corner to listen -- He closes the door. Damn.

           INT. HIGH QUEENS DISPATCH #1 - HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Honey and Jasmine, exhausted, drag themselves into the 
           apartment. Dump their bags down -- empty. Put the cash on the 
           overflowing table. Mickey already snoring on the couch. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And business was VERY good. Every 
                        customer led to another customer. 
                        And another. And another.

           Honey lights up a joint - when the PHONE starts ringing. Yet 
           another customer. All three at once (even “asleep” Mickey):

                                 ALL GIRLS
                        NOT ME!

           The girls laugh. 

                                 MICKEY
                        This is getting out of control. 

                                 JASMINE
                        The whole point of this was so we 
                        could have more free time, not 
                        less. I haven’t painted in weeks.

           Mickey stretches, awake. 

                                 MICKEY
                        And I’m never gonna make my Rolling 
                        Stone deadline at this rate.

                                 JASMINE
                        Maybe we cap the customer list?

           Honey shakes her head.

                                 HONEY
                        We don’t shrink. We grow. 
           Jasmine and Mickey exchange looks. Really? 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        We hire more girls. More girls, 
                        means more runs, more profits, and 
                        less runs for us to do -- and we 
                        each shift into upper management!  

                                 MICKEY
                        I like the sound of that. Jas?

                                 JASMINE
                        Okay... But who would we hire?

           EXT. FASHION ROW - SOHO - FALL - DAY

           TIGHT ON HONEY’S FACE walking down fashion row, shades on- 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        We hired old friends... 

           -We pull out to see two of Honey’s old roommates flanking 
           her: the Russian Model KATRINA and the Israeli Model MOR. 

           INT. SOUL CYCLE CLASS - SPINNING ROOM - DAY

           Honey and Katrina are at their bikes as petit sweet-faced 
           instructor, YUKI, walks in. The lights dim and class starts.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And new ones...

           Suddenly the sweet Yuki shifts into BEAST MODE:

                                 YUKI
                        WHERE ARE MY RIDE OR DIE BITCHES! 
                        PUSH IT LADIES!

           Honey’s face lights up. Holy shit. This girl’s a bad-ass!

           EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

           Now a High Queen, Yuki RIDES HER BIKE with skill through busy 
           NY streets -- making deliveries faster than ever before. 

           EXT. MACDOUGAL ST - NIGHT

           BECCA, a voluptuous comedian barking on the corner- 
                                 HONEY (V.O.) (PRE-LAP)
                        Girls who knew how to make a sale. 

           She’s wrangling tourists like a pro, selling them quick and 
           fast. Soon she’s got a line of people out the door for the 
           place. Mickey, who’s been watching nearby, heads over...

           INT. COMEDY CELLAR - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Where Becca kibitzes with Hannibal Burress, Ali Wong, and 
           John Mulaney while they buy product from her. 

           EXT. FARMERS MARKET - COOKIE STAND - DAY

           SARA (20s), AN IRANIAN BAKER GODDESS with a rebellious 
           streak, wears a chic hijab as she sets up her stand here.  
           Sara ignores the dirty looks from older farmers here. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Artists who’d been blocked from 
                        their path. 

           Sara is unfairly asked to pack up shop by an older MARKET 
           SUPERVISOR over a “missing” permit. Jasmine clocks this. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE #1 - DAY

           Sara is hard at work, more mad scientist than baker. She’s 
           crushing weed into baking flour, liquefying buds into oils to 
           make: CANDIES, COOKIES, SUCKERS, you name it.

           INT. COMPUTER REPAIR SHOP - DAY

           MONTANA (20s)- Lisbeth Salander constrained in a GEEK SQUAD-
           esque uniform. As she works on a computer, her CREEPY BOSS 
           leans over to sniff her hair. Montana shifting as far away as 
           she can, as Honey walks in. Noticing this...

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Techies who brought us into the 
                        21st Century.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE #1 - DAY

           Montana removes sim cards from phones and sets up untraceable 
           burner accounts to receive orders on. The space looking more 
           like a Tech-Start Up than a drug den. As Montana decks the 
           place out in top of the line gear, our girls admire the tech. 
                                 JASMINE
                        Elon Musk ain’t got shit on us!

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And a financial whiz who kept Uncle 
                        Sam off our back.

           INT. MISS LILY’S CARIBBEAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine sit enjoying jah-garitas while 
           interviewing ANNIE (mid 20s) wide-eyed, prim, and proper. 

                                 ANNIE
                        I’ve set up a whole range of 
                        companies: LLCs, C-Corps, S-Corps. 
                        But what you’re talking about...
                             (she looks around)
                        ...is criminal.

                                 MICKEY
                        Technically? Yes. 

           Honey reaches across the table, a calming hand.

                                 HONEY
                        We’re just innovators ahead of the 
                        curve. Ask yourself, do you want to 
                        work for yet another LLC? Or do you 
                        want to get in on the ground floor 
                        of THC Incorporated? 

           Annie, surprising herself, smiles. Hell yes... as we CUT TO:

           INT. SAFE HOUSE #1 - DAY

           Where Annie restructures the company financially. An ONLINE 
           CLOTHING STORE (”Bee Hive Vintage”) being set up as their 
           front biz -- Mor and Katrina modeling clothes on the website.

           Across the room, all the new Queens have gathered for 
           orientation. Honey steps out in front, addressing her hires:

                                 HONEY 
                        Eyes forward ladies...

           Montana hands out Burner Phones to each Queen.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Montana is handing each of you a 
                        new burner phone to communicate 
                        with Mickey and Jas in dispatch.
                                 JASMINE
                        You should never text explicitly 
                        about weed or the customers. Use 
                        the code names on the board.

           Jasmine points to the board. The Queens jot all this down.

                                 MICKEY
                        Every five runs, bring the money 
                        straight back here, where Annie 
                        will deal out your cut - 15%.

           The girls light up. That’s a lot of extra cash.

                                 HONEY
                        Now, what we do is still illegal in 
                        New York. And it’s not just cops we 
                        have to worry about it. It’s anyone 
                        else who wants what we have...

           Honey flips over a whiteboard - THE HIGH QUEEN RULES. All the 
           new Queens take notes. 1)Dress the Part, 2)Cash Only, 
           3)Business and Pleasure Do Not Mix, and 4)Trust Your Gut.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        But I promise, if you master these 
                        four simple rules, you’ll not only 
                        be safe, but you’ll make a ton of 
                        cash an have a lot of fun doing it.

           As the Queens CHEER this, we head into a SUPERCUT of SALES:

           - KNOCK KNOCK! BALLET DANCERS. KNOCK KNOCK! FABULOUS DRAG 
           QUEENS. KNOCK KNOCK! ORTHODOX JEWS... each door taking us 
           into a new exciting world. CASH PILING IN -

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        With the new sales force in place, 
                        everyone finally had more time for 
                        what they really loved... 

           We see each girl getting her cut and the benefits of the job:  

           - Jasmine pays off the last of her dad’s Medical bills. 
           Spends more time with her family, and actually paints. 

           - Becca practices her stand-up on the girls. They love it.

           - Sara gives the girls cooking lessons. 

           - Yuki goes to an audition and nails it. Gets a CALL BACK.

           - Mor and Katrina do unboxing videos on their Instagram - new 
           purses, clothes, make-up. Their followers skyrocket.
           - Mickey interviews St. Vincent backstage at the Bowery 
           Ballroom. Done, she goes to leave and runs into Sai, the hot 
           musician from before. They start chatting.

           - Honey takes all the girls out to dinner at Momofuku Ko. She 
           watches them bond with a matriarch’s pride - taking shots and 
           celebrating each other. A family. Her family.

                                 HONEY (PRE-LAP)
                        ... growing closer together. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS DISPATCH - WINTER TIME - DAY

           Christmas decorations now up. A well-decorated tree in the 
           corner topped with a giant Weed leaf. Christmas theme edibles  
           coming fresh out of the kitchen for all to try. Bonding.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And for just that moment, I felt 
                        invincible. Like I was the Steve 
                        Jobs of weed. I didn’t invent it, 
                        but I’d perfected it.

           Across the room, Honey watches her well oiled machine run. 

                                 MARK CUBAN (PRE-LAP)
                        It's not about money or connections-

           INT. HONEY & MICKEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mark Cuban is schooling a wantrepreneur on SHARK TANK. Honey 
           on her laptop, scanning NYC real-estate. But not lofts -- try 
           entire buildings. Prices in the tens of millions. Remember 
           this. It will be important later.

                                 MARK CUBAN (ON TV)
                        It's about the willingness to 
                        outwork and outlearn everyone. To 
                        continue to evolve. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Mark was right. If we wanted to be 
                        the best, we had to keep evolving. 
                        And we were about to.

           Honey gets a TEXT from Mickey and reacts - Whoa! Gets up...

           EXT. ELECTRIC LADY STUDIOS - NIGHT

           Dressed in her most chic outfit, Honey heads through the 
           doors of the historic recording studio.
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Thanks to the High Queens, Mickey 
                        had been able to intern at Rolling 
                        Stone, where she’d gone from 
                        interviewing the biggest names in 
                        the music biz...

           INT. ELECTRIC LADY STUDIOS - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Honey steps into a room to find a musicians rolling in gear, 
           PAs buzzing around. DAMIEN, a hip assistant spots her. Walks 
           her back towards the MAIN STUDIO where-

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        ...to hanging out with them.

           Mickey and a MASSIVE ENTOURAGE are chilling. Mickey stands 
           and hugs Honey. Introduces her to everyone.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Still, I wasn’t expecting Mickey to 
                        introduce me to... him. 

           Stepping out of the booth - MR. X. Chill, handsome, iconic. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        I didn’t tell you my name, so I’m 
                        sure not gonna tell you his. But 
                        think of the star you had on your 
                        childhood wall, the legend who sold 
                        out Madison Square Garden for a 
                        week, the icon who sat front row at 
                        a Presidential Inauguration. Yeah, 
                        he’s even cooler than that guy.

           Even Honey -- yes, Honey -- can’t help but be starstruck.

                                 MICKEY
                        Honey, let me introduce you to-

                                 HONEY
                        I know who you are - big fan. 

                                 MR. X
                        Funny, ’cause I’m a fan of yours. 
                        Best product on the East Coast. 

           Holy shit. That’s like getting a shout out from G-O-D. 

                                 MR. X (CONT’D)
                        What do you think about you and 
                        your girls providing greens at my 
                        Christmas party in the Hamptons?
           Honey lights up. This is HUGE. A-List clientele. 

                                 HONEY
                        The Jingle Bash?

                                 MR. X
                        Word. Be about thousand people, 
                        give or take. It’s on the 20th, so 
                        that’s what, four days from now?

                                 DAMIEN
                        Three days actually.

           Honey does the mental math. Knows she doesn’t have enough 
           product for this, but she also can’t turn this down. 

                                 HONEY
                        For sure. We can totally do that. 

           Mickey tries not to blanche. How can they pull that off???

                                 MR. X
                        I’ll have Damien text you the info 
                        and my money man will be in touch.

           He extends his hand - Honey just levelled up. 

                                 RICH (PRE-LAP)
                        That’s more than triple what you 
                        normally get from me.

           EXT. CHELSEA PIERS - OUTDOOR DRIVING RANGE - DAY

           Rich practices his swing, Paulie reduced to caddying for him. 
           Honey waits patiently in a golfing outfit. 

                                 HONEY
                        Business is going well, thought I’d 
                        save you a trip, buy more up front. 

            Rich tees up his shot.

                                 RICH
                        I see.

           TWHACK! Paulie rushes over with a ball for Honey. Steps back.

                                 HONEY
                        Don’t get me wrong, I love our 
                        hangouts. But I don’t want to take 
                        up all your time - I know how 
                        important you are, Rich.
           It’s Honey’s turn. She lines up, swings back and -

                                 RICH
                        As important as the Jingle Bash?

           - MISSES. Honey is caught off guard. He knows.

                                 HONEY
                        Like I said, business is good.

                                 RICH
                        But your swing needs work. Here -

           Rich lines up Honey at the tee, positions her, his hands 
           moving down her arms and waist... Paulie looks away.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        I can get you the weed of course. 
                        But I’m wondering if I should. 

                                 HONEY
                        ...Oh? 

                                 RICH
                        Do you know what happens when two 
                        stars collide, Honey? The bigger 
                        star engulfs the smaller star, 
                        creating an explosion of matter and 
                        gas that results in a black hole. 

           Rich leans in, his lips pressed up against Honey’s ear.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Which destroys everything around 
                        it. Until there’s nothing left.

           He pulls her back, she swings -- CONTACT!

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        You’re my star pupil, Honey. But 
                        I’m still the Sun. You revolve 
                        around me. Don’t forget that. 

           Honey’s smile stays in place, but her eyes betray her...

           INT. SAFE HOUSE#1 - DAY

           The girls unload Rich’s shipment of weed from APPLE CRATES. 

                                 JASMINE
                        How was Rich? Did he give you any 
                        trouble about the amount?
           Honey, still unnerved, manages to put on a brave face. 

                                 HONEY
                        Nope. I played him like a fiddle. 

           But Honey’s hand shakes as she lights up a joint. Rich has 
           started to unnerve her. He’s unpredictable and she knows it. 

                                 HONEY (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Ladies, we’re going to give Mr. X’s 
                        guests something they won’t expect--

           INT. SAFE HOUSE #1 - LATER

           In front of all the High Queens, Honey sets the tone.

                                 HONEY
                        Us. The High Queens. A curated, 
                        sleek and beautiful cannabis 
                        lifestyle. This our multi-million 
                        dollar business now. And we’re 
                        gonna make sure they know it.

           The girls cheer - FUCK YEAH; LET’S DO THIS; AWESOME! Get to 
           work sorting the variety of weed strains, weighing out, 
           rolling joints. Sara cooks as the girls assemble Sugarfina-
           like gift boxes filled with beautiful edibles. Jasmine hands 
           out LABELS with CHIC DESIGNS reflecting the party’s music 
           theme: Stevie’s Wonders, Purple Haze, etc.

           Becca surveys their huge inventory of joints and dime bags. 

                                 BECCA
                        This is massive. How are we going 
                        to transport all this to the party?

                                 HONEY
                        With these.

           Honey rolls out TITANIUM CAMERA CASES. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Professional grade camera cases. 
                        They’re insulated so it’ll double-
                        mask the smell. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Okay, that’s pretty dope.

           The finished product is packed into lead-lined film pouches, 
           impenetrable by X-Ray, then loaded into their cases. CLICK!
           INT. BECCA’S VAN (DRIVING) - DAY

           The girls are dressed and ready for the big day. Honey sits 
           up front in the van, anxious. Forces a smile for everyone.

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE GATED COMMUNITY - DAY

           The girls roll up to a surprise POLICE CHECKPOINT. Cars are 
           being waved through when a FAT COP asks them to stop. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Shit--

                                 HONEY
                        Cool, calm, collected. We got this.

           The Fat Cop walks up, barely glancing at them. Gestures-

                                 FAT COP
                        Random security check, ma’am. I’m 
                        going to need all of you to step 
                        out of the vehicle, please. 

           Honey looks like she might throw up. The Fat Cop and his BALD 
           PARTNER circle the van with mirrors.

                                 BALD COP
                        Open the back doors please.

           Honey opens the back of the van - revealing their locked 
           titanium camera cases. Fat Cop picks one up. 

                                 FAT COP
                        What’s the deal with all this?

                                 HONEY
                        We’re a photography service.

           The cops look at the girls. Yeah right.

                                 BALD COP
                        Pretty intense locks for cameras.

           Annie is going to faint. Mickey holds her up. But Honey knows 
           they can’t open anything locked without a warrant.

                                 HONEY
                        We’re protective of our gear. At 
                        big events, things tend to go 
                        missing. 35mm cameras aren’t cheap.

           Fat Cop passes the case to his partner.
                                 FAT COP
                        You wouldn’t mind if we popped this 
                        in our X-Ray machine, right?

           What can Honey do but nod? The cops put it through the 
           MACHINE, stare at the screen, then at the girls. Oh. Fuck.

                                 BALD COP
                        Miss. You said these cases were for 
                        35mm cameras, correct?

           Honey can only nod. Shit. Are they setting her up?

                                 BALD COP (CONT’D)
                        See... My nephew just got a vintage 
                        35mm. Was thinking of get him one 
                        of these cases. They worth it?

           Honey exhales. Jesus Christ.

                                 HONEY
                        Best investment I ever made.

           He hands her back the case. All smiles.

                                 BALD COP
                        You’re free to go. 

           Honey can’t get out of there fast enough... 

           EXT. MR. X’S MANSION - JINGLE BASH - DAY

           A-List Celebrities from Bruno Mars and Steph Curry to J. Law 
           and Cardi B, pose for pictures. The “it” party to be at.

           INT. MR. X’S MANSION - GRAND BALLROOM - DAY

           Honey surveys the room, finding the perfect spot. 

                                 HONEY
                        Ladies... Time to put Santa’s 
                        Workshop to shame.

           The girls set up their ELABORATE STATION  -- think a gifting 
           suite on steroids -- their products styled to fit the party. 

           CHRISSY TIEGEN and JOHN LEGEND wander past.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Chrissy, can I interest you in a 
                        free THC spa treatment? We’ve even 
                        got cute face masks on the go.
                                 CHRISSY
                        Are you saying what I think you’re 
                        saying?

                                 HONEY
                        Oh yeah. We even have high grade 
                        cooking oils for you to play with. 
                        Totally free. What do you say?

                                 CHRISSY
                        John, hold my purse.  

           Chrissy’s having a blast. Her interest draws the attention of 
           other guests. And just like that, their presence goes VIRAL. 

           - Sara demonstrates cooking essentials, edibles, and treats. 
           Mickey talks about the medicinal effects with others. 

           - Becca and Yuki teach guests how to roll the perfect blunt. 
           Katrina and Mor rub in massage oils on sexy NFL stars. 

           - Suddenly Honey spots TWO IMPORTANT FACES in the crowd: 

                                 HONEY
                        Oh my god, that’s Alexander Wang 
                        and Virgil Abloh of OFF WHITE.

           Jasmine turns and looks, blanches at who they’re with.

                                 JASMINE
                        And with gallery owner Margaret Lee-

           The famous designers and gallery owner approach--

                                 ALEXANDER WANG
                        Dope gift bags. Feel like I should 
                        steal a page from Mr. X’s book.

                                 MARGARET LEE
                        Great packaging. Who designed it?

                                 HONEY
                        Jas here. She’s an amazing artist. 
                        It’s our company, all female run.

                                 MARGARET LEE
                        Come by Canal 47. Your work could 
                        fit nicely in my next showcase. 

           Honey hands them their gift bags. The designers nod. The 
           girls squeal as Mr. X rolls over on a tricked out trike. 
                                 MR. X
                        Girls you’re the hit of the party. 
                        Have some fun. You’ve earned it.

           NEEDLE DROP: Calvin Harris’s THIS IS WHAT YOU CAME FOR - sung 
           by the patron saint of our film, Rihanna.

           Our girls descend in SLOW-MO into the crowd, moving amongst 
           the beautiful and influential with confidence. Because this 
           time they’re not there as the help, but as valued guests. 

           - The girls move to the dance floor. Honey stands on the 
           sidelines till Mickey pulls her in. Finally, Honey relaxes.

           - The party winding down, VIPs exit with High Queen gift 
           bags. They’re all anyone is talking about...

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        The High Queens had officially 
                        arrived and we were here to stay. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS’ NEW DISPATCH CENTER - DAY

           Time has passed - Honey’s hair now cut into a sleek bob from 
           the opening. 

           This NEW APARTMENT is nicer than the one before. Montana 
           works dispatch, Annie goes over the books as Jasmine oversees 
           the packaging. Phones ringing off the hook. Orders piling up.  

           As Cardi B’s I LIKE IT plays, Honey updates their GROWING 
           CLIENT LIST on her laptop. High Queens flying in and out of 
           the apartment like fighter pilots, descending for a strike. 

           We see GREEN SMOKE TRAILS weaving through a MAP OF THE CITY.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Our A-List Clientele boomed. 

           We see a Flash of A-List clients from Lena Dunham to Halsey.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        New girls joined our forces.

           Honey manages NEW GIRLS - tweaking their clothes and hair. 

           INT. CANAL 47 - DAY/NIGHT

           Jasmine’s work now hanging in the busy gallery, owner 
           Margaret Lee proudly displaying it to potential buyers.
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And Goals were being met.

           All the High Queens are there, including Jasmine’s family, 
           and Mickey’s date Sai, toasting to Jasmine’s success.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But as we headed into our future, 
                        we were still stuck dealing with 
                        the devils of our past.

           We PRE-LAP Lee Greenwood’s GOD BLESS THE USA as we CUT TO:

           INT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - PENTHOUSE - 4TH OF JULY - DAY 

           Where Honey, Jasmine, Mickey exit Rich’s private elevator. 
           Rich greets them with open arms -- his place elaborately 
           decorated for the 4th of July. Rich himself wearing a 
           “Presidential” grillmaster BBQ apron. 

                                 RICH
                        Happy Fourth, Ladies! Make yourself 
                        comfortable. We’ve got Budweiser 
                        and MGD in the cooler. 

                                 HONEY
                        Maybe we should settle up first-

           Mickey swings around her duffle bag. A Thug checks it.

                                 RICH
                        All biz! You know, foreplay is just 
                        as important as the main event.

                                 THUG
                        They’re good. Over target.

                                 RICH
                        Excellent! The boys gave me shit 
                        working with lady dealers, but look 
                        at you, you’re on fire! Speaking of-

           Thugs pass through with CRATES OF FIREWORKS.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to have the best show 
                        in the city. I made sure of it.

           The girls exchange looks. This is going to be a long night.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Honey, can you help me with the 
                        grill for a sec? 
           With that, Rich steers Honey out onto the balcony-

           EXT. 15 CENTRAL PARK WEST - PENTHOUSE - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Rich has a giant spread of expensive meats laid out by his 
           more impressive grill. Throws a marbled slab onto the grill.

                                 RICH
                        Every noob talks up Kobe Beef, but 
                        Omi Beef is where it’s really at. 
                        If it’s not from Shiga Prefecture, 
                        I don’t even fucking bother.

           Honey nods. Not understanding or caring to.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        You know Honey, you and I have a 
                        lot in common.

                                 HONEY
                        Oh? Really?

                                 RICH
                        I could have had my pick of jobs on 
                        Wall Street or in DC. But I knew
                        I’d always be living in my father’s 
                        shadow. I needed to make my fortune 
                        my way. Be my own man

           Rich flips the meats. Their pinky flesh smoldering.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Just like you, I was 
                        underestimated. Because of my Dad 
                        and my Ivy League background, no 
                        one took me seriously. It’s like 
                        they say, we have to work twice as 
                        hard just to be successful.

                                 HONEY
                        ...Oh. Absolutely.

                                 RICH
                        You’ve got a nice thing going with 
                        your little weed delivery service. 
                        But the real action is in selling 
                        the harder stuff - heroin, coke, 
                        fentanyl. Incredible margins.

           Honey isn’t quite sure where this is going. 

                                 HONEY
                        Uh-huh.
                                 RICH
                        I mean how much longer do you think 
                        your service is gonna last once the 
                        laws change? I mean, even Dominoes 
                        sells more than just pizza! 

                                 HONEY
                        I think the steaks are done.

           Rich slides the steaks off the grill onto a plate, but still 
           fixated on making his point. 

                                 RICH
                        With your client list and my 
                        inventory, we could make a killing.

           Rich grabs her hands, interlocking his fingers slowly. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Together, we’d be unstoppable. King 
                        and Queen of this town-

           Before Honey can react - he KISSES HER. From the other room, 
           Jasmine clocks it. What the fuck was that? Honey is stunned.

                                 HONEY
                        Uh, can I think about it?

                                 RICH
                        Of course! I’d never want to you to 
                        rush into this. But this is the 
                        right move, Honeybee. Search your 
                        feelings - you know it to be true.  

           Rich pulls back, smiles, walks in with the tray of steaks.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Who’s down for the greatest goddamn 
                        steak you’ve ever had?!

           Jasmine pulls Honey aside as she walks back in.

                                 JASMINE
                        Did Rich just kiss you?

                                 HONEY
                        It’s fine... He has a crush. We can 
                        use it to our advantage. Trust me.

                                 JASMINE
                        As long as you’re in control.

           Honey downs her beer, watches Rich. She’s got this, right? 
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        As usual, Biggie said it perfectly: 
                        Mo Money, Mo Problems. And Rich 
                        wasn’t the only problem we had.

           INT. HIGH QUEENS DISPATCH - DAY

           Annie is towered over by mountains of cash, wearing a Bank 
           Teller’s GREEN EYESHADE. She’s trying to deal with it all, 
           but it’s clearly overwhelming her. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        We were making so much we were 
                        running out of ways to launder it. 
                        Our front biz could only take on so 
                        much without attracting attention.

           Honey’s on her laptop, scanning real-estate again. Annie 
           gives Honey a look -- what the hell are we gonna do? 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Thankfully, life provided a way.

           Suddenly Mickey BURSTS into the safe-house --  SCREAMING!!!

                                 HONEY
                        What happened? 

           Mickey tries to catch her breath. Jasmine is worried now too.

                                 JASMINE
                        Mickey, are you okay?

           That’s when Mickey extends her left hand -- where a SPARKLY 
           ENGAGEMENT RING now sits. Then all HELL breaks loose...

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        See, it was time for a High Queens 
                        bachelorette party. 

           EXT. JFK - PRIVATE JET RUNWAY - DAY

           The Queens descend on a PRIVATE JET for Mickey’s Bachelorette 
           weekend! Mickey toting a SASH and WEDDING VEIL. The ALL MALE 
           HOT FLIGHT CREW escort them on board as BOYS by Lizzo plays.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        And where better than Monaco? The 
                        world capital of money laundering.

           AERIAL SHOTS OF MONTE CARLO - Porsches, Bentleys and Rolls-
           Royces parked on every block. Yachts docked at every port. 
           Paradise. Finally, We ZOOM IN on the HOTEL DE PARIS: 

           INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - MONTE CARLO - ROYAL SUITE - DAY

           The girls are ushered into a GRAND SUITE -  high gilded 
           ceilings, marble colonnades, crystal chandeliers hanging over 
           fairy-tale beds. A place fit for Royalty, and now our Queens.

           INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO FLOOR - VARIOUS GAMES

           Our girls hit the casino floor decked out like James Bond 
           villains - FUR COATS, LONG EVENING DRESSES, DRIPPING IN 
           DIAMONDS. They exchange stacks of cash for HIGH ROLLER CHIPS. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Laundering money in Monaco is 
                        simple. You exchange your "dirty" 
                        money for chips at a casino. Then 
                        when you cash out those chips -- 
                        voila "clean" money. The IRS sees 
                        it as winnings. And so did we. 

           They play roulette in the famous Salle Médecin, craps on the 
           Gaming Terraces, blackjack under the stained glass ceiling. 
           They take their “winnings” back to the teller and get a 
           receipt -- pass it off to Annie. Done and done.

           EXT. MONTE CARLO BEACH CLUB - DAY 

           The girls descend upon the pool like Greek Goddesses, turning 
           heads as they make their way to a private cabana. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        What was surprisingly hard was 
                        spending our own money.

           At the Cabana, waiters bring over BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE.

                                 WAITER
                        Mademoiselle, compliments of Prince 
                        Philippos and friends.

           The girls turn, lower their sunglasses. Well, hello. 

           EXT. YACHT - SUNSET

           The girls party with the hot royalty, dancing the night away. 
           It’s decadent, it’s wild, it’s a fucking blast. Becca makes 
           out with the Hot Prince of Greece. 
           EXT. YACHT - SUNRISE

           All the girls are passed out around the deck. Honey and 
           Jasmine, the last two awake, watch the sun rise.

                                 HONEY
                        Think Mickey had a good time?

           The two look over at Mickey, passed out in a bathing suit and 
           fur coat clutching a bottle of Dom Perignon. They laugh.

                                 JASMINE
                        I can’t believe we’re here. 

           Jasmine lays down on Honey’s lap. Honey strokes Jasmine’s 
           hair, deep in thought. Jasmine clocks this. 

                                 JASMINE (CONT’D)
                        Earth to Honey! You can chill for 
                        once! We’re all good.

                                 HONEY
                        I know... It’s just hard for me to 
                        relax. Especially because of-

                                 JASMINE
                        -Rich. I know. I don’t envy you 
                        having to deal with him every week. 

                                 HONEY
                        What if we didn’t have to? What if 
                        we had our own grow site? That way 
                        we wouldn’t be reliant on Rich or 
                        anybody. We’d have the product and 
                        the delivery system. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Vertical integration - yeah, I get 
                        it. Sounds ideal. But so does me 
                        waking up next to Michael B Jordan. 
                             (yawning)
                        Tragically, I don’t see either one 
                        happening anytime soon. 

                                 HONEY
                        Wouldn’t be that hard. Just have to 
                        find a building out in Brooklyn. 
                        Nothing fancy. Maybe an old 
                        warehouse out in Park Slope or even 
                        the meat packing district. We could 
                        finally put our roots down... Jas?

           Honey looks down. Jasmine’s asleep. She looks out towards the 
           skyline. Feels like the sun’s rising just for her. 
           INT. JFK TERMINAL - DAY

           Honey walks through the terminal with the girls. Flipping 
           through NYC real-estate listings via an app on her phone. BIG 
           POSTERS announcing FASHION WEEK hanging everywhere.

                                 MICKEY
                        Fashion Week’s almost here? Damn, 
                        time flies. 

           Honey closes her app. Frustrated. She can’t afford anything.

                                 HONEY
                        Ugh, I’ve blocked it all out.

                                 MOR
                        It’s not all bad. I still love 
                        those Fashion Week after-parties. 
                             (to Katrina)
                        Remember smoking out Prince Harry 
                        when he was in his bad boy phase?

           Katrina nods. That was fun. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Wow, it really gets that crazy? 

                                 KATRINA
                        Hell yeah. It makes Coachella look 
                        like a Bar Mitzvah.

           Honey clocks another FASHION WEEK AD - her brain whirring... 

           INT. HONEY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Honey lights up her sleek pipe, brain buzzing, supercharged. 
           Sits in front of her laptop -- real estate listings open in 
           one window and a spreadsheet in the next. Running numbers -- 
           tweaking, adjusting, changing, then recalculating everything. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS’ DISPATCH CENTER - DAY

           All the girls are gathered, Honey has news to share. 

                                 HONEY
                        Queens, I’m so proud of what we’ve 
                        accomplished together. We roll deep 
                        - we’re up to a thousand customers! 
                        We always deliver the best product 
                        possible - and we deliver on time!

           The girls cheer -- HELL YES! 
                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        That’s why it’s time to talk about 
                        the future. 

           This is the first Mickey and Jasmine are hearing this. 
           Jasmine arches an eyebrow - what now? 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Building our own grow site right 
                        here in the city. No more middle 
                        men. Just premium cannabis that we 
                        grow and own. 

           The girls love the idea, but Mickey and Jas are skeptical. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Sounds good, but we don’t have the 
                        money to buy New York real estate.

                                 JASMINE 
                        We may be rich, but we ain’t 
                        wealthy. You’re talking Pablo 
                        Escobar money.

                                 HONEY
                        What if I told you there was a 
                        party ten times as big as Mr. X’s 
                        and we could just walk right in?

                                 JASMINE
                        I’d say you sound high.

                                 BECCA
                        Er - who here isn’t?

           The girls laugh. It’s true, but not the point.

                                 HONEY
                        Ladies, I’m talking about New York 
                        Fashion Week.

           Honey rolls out an annotated MAP OF NYC and a corresponding 
           schedule for Fashion Week

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        There are 80 shows over 7 days, 
                        each with it own after party. Each 
                        one a gold mine of new customers. 

           She picks up their signature camera cases.
                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        With these in hand, we can be a 
                        mobile gifting suite and hit every 
                        single party one after the other. 

           Honey has her materials spread out on the table, leaning over 
           like a general with a master plan. The Queens are enraptured.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        If we pull this off, we’ll make 
                        more money in a week than we do all 
                        year. And we’ll have positioned 
                        ourselves as the top weed brand in 
                        the east coast, shit maybe the 
                        whole country.
                             (a beat)
                        So what do you say? 

           All the girls cheer. Mickey and Jasmine are more anxious.  
           They pull Honey aside. 

                                 MICKEY
                        I don’t mean to rain on your parade 
                        Honey, but this is...

                                 JASMINE
                        A lot. Where is this coming from?

                                 HONEY
                        Look, I know this is gonna take a 
                        lot of work and a hefty cash 
                        investment for the inventory, but 
                        we can pull this off!

           Mickey was afraid she was going to say that.

                                 MICKEY
                        And I believe in you, Honey. But 
                        what you’re talking about is on a 
                        whole other level. I’ve got my 
                        writing career and a wedding to 
                        plan. Jasmine’s art is blowing up-

                                 JASMINE
                        Why can’t we keep things how they 
                        are? We don’t need the extra risk.

           Honey lays all her cards on the table.

                                 HONEY
                        All my life, I never felt like I 
                        fit in. Like I belonged anywhere. 
                        Not at the homes, not as a model. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HONEY (CONT'D)
                        But now, I’ve finally found it with 
                        you two, with everyone here. And I 
                        don’t want to ever lose it.

           Honey tears up -- Mickey and Jasmines doing the same.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        This is our chance to have a home. 
                        Somewhere no one can take away from 
                        us. Somewhere we don’t have to 
                        worry about Rich or anybody else. 
                        Somewhere we can build our future.

           Honey wipes away her tears. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        We’re equal partners. If you guys 
                        don’t want to do this, we won’t. 

           Mickey and Jasmine look at each other - can we do this?

                                 JASMINE
                        If this is what you really want to 
                        do, then let’s do it. 

                                 MICKEY
                        We trust you. 

           Honey hugs her best friends. They’re in it to win it. 

                                 RICH (PRE-LAP)
                        Question is... What do you get the 
                        woman who has everything?

           INT. CHRISTIE’S AUCTION HOUSE - DAY

           A CHRISTIE’S AGENT gives Rich, Paulie and the crew a tour. 

                                 CHRISTIE’S AGENT
                        We just got in a beautiful Rothko-

           The Agent delicately displays the painting. Rich isn’t sold. 

                                 RICH
                        Pass. See one Rothko, you seen ‘em 
                        all. Honey deserves something 
                        unique, like her. 

           The Agent nods and guides Rich further into the premises.

                                 CHRISTIE’S AGENT
                        Then perhaps our Private Sales 
                        collection might be of interest.
           They head through a bland door, labeled PERSONNEL ONLY.

           Here, we see an array of BLACK MARKET ITEMS - stolen 
           artifacts, purloined jewelry, exotic animals. We hear GROWLS 
           nearby - the Agent guiding them to a RARE WHITE TIGER. 

           Now this, Rich is excited about. 

                                 RICH
                        Hello pussycat.

                                 CHRISTIE’S AGENT
                        Only 50 of them left in the world.

           One of Rich’s thugs, NICKY, can’t resist making a joke.

                                 NICKY 
                        Honey’s pussy better be gold-plated 
                        for all the dough you’re dropping. 

           Rich laughs, throws his arm around Nicky, hilarious! THEN 
           RICH GRABS Nicky’s head and SHOVES it against the cage bars. 
           The Tiger ROARS, so close its spittle coats Nicky’s FACE.

                                 RICH
                        What kind of way is that to talk 
                        about a lady? Very. Fucking. Rude.

           Nicky wriggles, desperate to get away, afraid for his life. 
           The Christie’s Agent is frozen --horrified.

                                 NICKY
                        No, I just thought -

           The Tiger GROWLS, getting closer, ready to pounce -

                                 RICH
                        Well, I don’t pay you to think or 
                        to speak. So don’t.

           Rich releases Nicky right as the Tiger makes a SWIPE FOR HIS 
           FACE. Piss running down his legs, as he crawls backward. Rich 
           LAUGHS UNCONTROLLABLY at this. Paulie is horrified. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Siegfried and Roy over here pissed 
                        his pants! Come on - walk it off.

           His crew awkwardly laugh along, fearful of Rich’s reproach. 
           Rich moves on, prowling the room. A luxurious bracelet with a 
           BLUE DIAMOND in the center catching his eye.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me about this...
           INT. MICKEY & SAI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine go over wedding seat arrangements. 
           Jasmine shows of her latest designs for the tables.

                                 JASMINE
                        And these would be the place cards.

                                 MICKEY
                        I love it. Sai what do you think? 

           Sai walks over, likes what he sees. Kisses Mickey.

                                 SAI
                        Very cool. Now only if we could 
                        figure out where to put my cousins.  

           Mickey sighs. So hard. The girls study the seating chart, the 
           moment only broken by Honey’s cell phone going off. It’s Rich

                                 HONEY
                             (on the phone)
                        Hey Rich -- is everything okay?

           Jasmine and Mickey exchange looks. Uh oh. What now? 

           INT. LE COUCOU - NIGHT

           Rich sits alone in this hip French restaurant. A Quartet 
           serenades the empty restaurant like an awkward one-on-one 
           date on The Bachelor. Honey walks in dressed casually.

                                 RICH
                        Honey! Glad you could make it.

           Rich kisses Honey on the cheek. Pulls out her chair. Honey 
           looks around at the empty place. What the fuck is going on?

                                 HONEY
                        Yeah, you said it was urgent. 
                        Something about a supply problem? 

                                 RICH
                        First you must try these oysters.
                        They’re fantastique. 

           Honey takes an oyster reluctantly. Downs it quickly.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        You don’t like it?

                                 HONEY
                        Not a seafood girl.
           Rich angrily waves the nervous WAITER over.

                                 RICH
                        Takes these away. Bring out the 
                        beef cheek and foie gras terrine. 

                                 HONEY
                        Sorry I’m confused. Is everything 
                        okay or--?

                                 RICH
                        Yes yes. Sorry, I didn’t mean to 
                        scare you. I was just excited.

                                 HONEY
                        Excited about what?

                                 RICH
                        Us.

           Shit. Honey reels. How do I get out of this? Rich leans in.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        You remember what we spoke about on 
                        the Fourth of July, right? 

           Honey weighs her words carefully. Her entire Fashion Week 
           plan depends on Rich sourcing her the weed. 

                                 HONEY
                        Of course, how could I forget. I’ve 
                        been thinking about it a lot and-

                                 RICH
                        Me too! So I got you something...

           Rich reaches for Honey’s hand, holds it delicately. He places 
           the BLUE DIAMOND BRACELET on Honey’s wrist.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Honeybee, there’s no denying what 
                        we have is special. We’re just so 
                        in sync. The two of us make a great 
                        team. In every possible way. You’re 
                        the Moon to my Earth. The Ying to 
                        my Yang. The Robin to my Batman. 

           Honey slowly pulls it back, trying to get out of this 
           situation as elegantly as possible. Unclasps the band.
                                 HONEY
                        Rich... You’re really great. Truly. 
                        But I think it’s best if we keep 
                        our relationship the way it is... 
                        strictly professional.

                                 RICH
                        ...oh?

           He’s humiliated. Rich never gets rejected. 

                                 HONEY
                        Believe me when I say I really 
                        value our business relationship. 
                        It’s very important to me. I just 
                        wouldn’t want anything to ruin it. 

           Honey hands him back the bracelet. Trying to sell this. 

                                 RICH
                        I hear you and I respect you.

                                 HONEY
                        Okay cool. I’m sorry-

                                 RICH
                        Don’t apologize. We all make our 
                        choices. And you’ve made yours.

           Honey isn’t sure how to read him.

                                 HONEY
                        Fantastic. So... We’re still good 
                        for the delivery tomorrow?

                                 RICH
                        Of course. You have my word.

                                 HONEY
                        And you never break it. I 
                        appreciate that.

           A weak smile from Rich. Suddenly Honey’s phone RINGS. Saved 
           by the damn bell indeed.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, I have to take this... Food 
                        was amazing.

           Honey picks up the call and is out the door in a flash. Alone 
           Rich sips on his wine, bites into his beef cheek then SNAPS-
                                 RICH
                             (to the Quartet)
                        KNOCK IT OFF ALREADY!

           EXT. LE COUCOU - NIGHT

           Honey hustles away as fast as humanly possible.

                                 HONEY
                             (into phone)
                        Hey Kelly. No way. They accepted 
                        the offer? That’s amazing! 10 AM 
                        tomorrow? Yes, I’ll be there. 

           INT. SOTHEBY’S REAL ESTATE OFFICES - DAY

           Honey sits with her broker KELLY signing various papers. 

                                 KELLY
                        Congrats, you’re a property owner!

           Kelly tosses Honey the keys. No going back now. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS DISPATCH - NIGHT

           Honey stares at the piles of cash. The reserves are low after 
           her big payment to Rich for the Fashion Week order and now 
           the down payment on the grow-site. It’s gonna be tight. 

           Honey looks at the calendar hanging on the wall -- we see the 
           timeline of events clearly: This weekend is Mickey’s Wedding, 
           with Fashion Week Two weeks out. She does the math, exhales.

                                 HONEY
                        This will work.

           Honey opens a duffle bag and tosses in the rest of the money.

           INT. BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC - INDIAN WEDDING - DAY

           It’s Mickey’s Wedding Day! Mickey walks down the aisle in a 
           traditional Indian dress. Honey and Jasmine standing proudly 
           as bridesmaids. Annie, Mor, Kat, Derek, and Petey watching.

           LATER, ON THE DANCE FLOOR - The girls dance, Honey gives out 
           GREEN JOINTS as party favors to the GUESTS. Everyone smoking, 
           dancing, partying not a care in the world. That is until -
                                 JASMINE
                             (re: the joint)
                        Is there hash-oil in this? I’m 
                        starting to feel dizzy...

                                 HONEY
                        No... 

           Honey takes a hit to see what she’s talking about. Huh. 
           There’s something off about it. Jasmine slumps down, the room 
           spinning around her. A RASH BREAKING OUT on her face.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Woah, Jas, your face - 

           ANNIE SCREAMS from across the dance floor. DEREK falls to 
           floor having a seizure! Annie freaking out beside him. 

                                 ANNIE
                        DEREK! 

           MICKEY stumbles over to them. Her words slurred, off-balance.

                                 MICKEY
                        S-something’s wwwrong with the weed-

           Mickey falls, CRASHING INTO HER WEDDING CAKE. GUESTS are 
           COLLAPSING and THROWING UP everywhere. Total pandemonium. 

           Honey’s heart pounding as she calls MONTANA back at DISPATCH. 
           Wavering as she tries to stay upright, her vision blurring.

                                 HONEY
                        Montana - stop delivering. Rich 
                        laced the weed. The weed is-

           And then she PASSES OUT, the phone slumping out of her hand.

           INT. HIGH QUEENS’ DISPATCH CENTER - DAY

           The girls look like they’ve been beaten in the face with a 
           hammer and dragged over hot coals. Miserable. 

                                 MOR
                        That’s the last one. Fully 
                        recalled.

           Mor slumps down next to an exhausted Honey. The room filled 
           with apple crates of tainted weed. All totally worthless now. 

                                 HONEY
                        How much did we have to refund?
                                 ANNIE
                        Over one-hundred and fifty K. And 
                        that’s not including the cases of 
                        product that aren’t safe to sell.

           Honey is going to be sick all over again. 

                                 MICKEY
                        That fucking vindictive bastard! He 
                        ruined my wedding for what? Because 
                        you wouldn’t go out with him?!

                                 HONEY
                        Or the fact that I wouldn’t let him 
                        flog heroin and coke to our clients-

                                 MONTANA
                        Well, whatever his wacko reasoning, 
                        he just wiped out our entire 
                        inventory. There’s no way we can 
                        pull off Fashion Week now.

           The girls look similarly downcast. It’s all fallen to pieces. 

                                 JASMINE
                        But that could kill our entire 
                        business, we have people depending 
                        on us, orders to fill! I can’t even-

           The Queens are really panicking. Honey refuses to give up.

                                 HONEY
                        There’s gotta be a way to salvage 
                        this. If we could figure out his 
                        supplier, go to them. Because that 
                        shithead sure isn’t growing it.

                                 ANNIE
                        Okay, but how would we find them? 
                        Where would we even start?

           Mickey, pissed, gives one of Rich’s Apple Crate’s a good 
           KICK. CRUNCH! And another! ARGH! The fury of a bride whose 
           wedding was ruined. Jasmine goes over, pulls her off. 

                                 JASMINE
                        I know, I know. The apple boxes had 
                        it coming.

                                 MICKEY
                        What a pretentious dick. Like that 
                        wanker has ever been to an orchard 
                        in his whole fucking life.
           That’s a good point. Honey leans down, looks at the crate

                                 HONEY
                        That’s true. Apple orchards aren’t 
                        exactly his style. So why would 
                        Rich use these crates? Unless 
                        that’s how he gets it from the 
                        supplier and he was too lazy to 
                        swap them out...

           Huh. A theory forming, Honey goes over to Montana, who’s 
           already at her laptop, searching away.

                                 MONTANA
                        So, it’s not a major chain, which 
                        makes it way easier to track. Let 
                        me see what I can find.... Bingo! 

           Montana pulls up a website for a wholesome looking farm - 
           DELL GREEN ORCHARDS. Honey comes over to the computer.

                                 HONEY
                        Upstate New York, huh?

                                 ANNIE
                        Aw, they have a petting zoo!

                                 JASMINE
                        I mean, what are the odds this farm 
                        is connected to Rich’s supplier? 

                                 HONEY
                        Low. But we gotta start somewhere.

           We move close on the DELL GREEN ORCHARDS LOGO as we CUT TO:

           EXT. DELL GREEN ORCHARDS - DAY

           Iconic red tractors and wooden barns. The kind of place 
           that’s perfect for an Instagram #Fall. Honey, Mickey, and 
           Jasmine walk amongst families on an APPLE PICKING TOUR. 

                                 HONEY (V.O)
                        A recent DEA report stated there 
                        are three major signs to look for 
                        if you suspect someone is growing 
                        cannabis. First is the smell.

           Honey sniffs the air. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        A cannabis crop takes about three 
                        months to produce. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HONEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        During the final four weeks, the 
                        plants give off an extremely 
                        pungent odor. 

           Tour Guide notices Honey. 

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Smells good right? Folks, what 
                        you’re smelling is our cider 
                        factory hard at work. It’s just one 
                        of the many products the Green 
                        family makes here on the property.

           Honey smiles, impressed. The perfect way to mask a smell. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Second sign is light. Internal 
                        farming requires a lot of it: 2,000 
                        watts running 12 hours a day. That 
                        means blacked out windows to hide 
                        the light show inside.

           The girls split up, looking for signs of cannabis. Honey 
           spots a LARGE BARN on the edge of the property. BLACKED OUT 
           WINDOWS. She gets closer for a better look.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Final sign - security.

           Honey clocks CCTV cameras mounted on the barn...

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Growers live in a paranoid world.

           ...and the ARMED GUARDS by the front door. Weird for a little 
           apple farm. A HAND grabs Honey. It’s the Tour Guide.

                                 TOUR GUIDE 
                        We’re heading back now. Come on. 

           INT. DELL GREEN ORCHARDS - GIFT SHOP - DAY

           All the apple cider and apple related products one could 
           desire. In line for the CASHIER with her basket of APPLES, 
           Honey studies the tour guide brochure and the photo of the 
           OWNER of the orchard, DELL GREEN. Looks to the CASHIER.

                                 HONEY
                        The owner - Dell Green - does he 
                        come around much?

           The Cashier laughs. 
                                 CASHIER
                        I’d say so. Lives here on the farm.

           She gestures to a modest two story WHITE FARM HOUSE NEARBY.

                                 CASHIER (CONT’D)
                        Probably out on the patio by now. 
                        Likes to watch the sunset.

           Honey smiles. Perfect. Turns to Mickey and Jasmine.

                                 HONEY
                        Meet you girls back at the car.

           EXT. DELL’S WHITE FARM HOUSE - SUNSET

           On the wrap-around porch we find farmer DELL GREEN (60s) - 
           gruff beard, lines of wisdom and grit, sipping on cider, 
           watching over his farm. Honey walks over to him. 

                                 HONEY
                        Excuse me, are you Dell Green?

           Dell nods, all smiles.

                                 DELL
                        Got a Northern Spy.

                                 HONEY
                        I’m sorry?

                                 DELL
                        The apples. They’re Northern Spies. 
                        Tart with subtle honey undertones 
                        when picked at the right time.
                             (a beat)
                        May I?

           Dell takes an apple out of Honey’s basket and slices off a 
           piece with his vintage Marble’s Ideal fixed blade knife. 
           Hands the sliced piece back to Honey. She bites.

                                 HONEY
                        It’s delicious.

                                 DELL
                        Glad you think so. Been growing on 
                        my family’s farm since the 1860s. 

                                 HONEY
                        And how long have you been growing 
                        cannabis?
                                 DELL
                        Cannabis? Like marijuana??

           Dell laughs. Finds this notion hilarious. 

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        Woodstock’s about an hour north, if 
                        you fancy that sorta thing. 

           But Honey isn’t deterred. Game recognizes game. 

                                 HONEY
                        Y’know I worked on an apple farm in 
                        Minnesota not too different from 
                        this. I was in high-school trying 
                        to make extra cash. Ended up 
                        learning a lot about apples.

                                 DELL
                        Color me impressed.

                                 HONEY
                        Yields from the dwarf trees you 
                        have planted here are about 400 
                        bushels per acre. So, going by your 
                        acreage, that’d produce, what, 
                        sixteen thousand pounds of fruit? 

                                 DELL
                        Sounds about right. 

                                 HONEY
                        Of course not all of that product 
                        will be saleable. I’ll be generous 
                        and figure about 60% packout. Then 
                        sell for about a dollar per pound. 
                        Slim pickings for you.

           Dell leans back in his chair. His grin fading.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        By now you’ve realized that most of 
                        your money is made on the site 
                        itself - tours, cider, a gift-shop. 
                        But I don’t think that Patek 
                        Philipe watch was paid for with 
                        apple sauce and hayride tours.

           Dell’s friendly expression drops. His eyes growing cold. 
           Rolling the hilt of his knife as he considers Honey.
                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        That barn on the eastern corner 
                        with the giant vents and Fort Knox 
                        security? Suggests you’re growing 
                        some serious bud. Now you can 
                        pretend it’s a sorting plant -

           Honey tosses him one of her stylishly packaged joints. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Or can we talk about doing some 
                        real business with each other.

           We zoom in on an AirPod Honey’s got in her right ear--

           BACK IN BECCA’S VAN in the parking lot, we see Montana has 
           pulled up FACTS ABOUT APPLES, THE FARM, DELL - feeding Honey 
           the intel she needs to impress Dell. Mickey and Jasmine wait.

                          MICKEY
                                                         JASMINE
           What’s going on now? 
                                              Maybe he’s not the guy?

                                 MONTANA
                        Shhhh, I can’t hear her! 

           BACK ON THE PORCH, Dell stands up from his rocking chair, and 
           heads to the front door. Honey thinks she’s lost him when -

                                 DELL
                        Well, are you coming inside or not?

           We see Honey follow, discreetly removing her AirPods. 

           INT. DELL’S WHITE FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           A GLEN CAMPBELL RECORD plays as Dell sips bourbon (Blanton’s 
           Single Barrel, of course) and examines Honey’s packaging. 

                                 DELL
                        A weed delivery service. You 
                        millennials think of everything. I 
                        remember when the only thing you 
                        could get delivered was a pizza. 

           Honey takes out one of her joints. 

                                 HONEY
                        May I?

           Dell nods. Honey tries to light her joint up, but her lighter 
           won’t spark. Dell takes out an elegant SILVER LIGHTER. 
                                 DELL
                        Here, use mine.

           Honey takes the lighter. Lights up her joint. 

                                 HONEY
                        Thanks. This is beautiful.

           She studies it and hands it back. Dell holds it fondly.

                                 DELL
                        My wife gave it to me for our 25th 
                        wedding anniversary. You kind of 
                        remind me of her. Tons of moxie, 
                        great business instincts too. 
                        Helped save the orchard with our 
                        side business. Planted the first 
                        cannabis crop together.

           Dell gestures to a nearby photo of the two of them back in 
           the 60s. Dell with shoulder-length hair, his wife beaming.

                                 HONEY
                        Woah, very Michelle Phillips.

                                 DELL
                        She was gorgeous. Lost her last 
                        spring. 

                                 HONEY
                        I’m sorry to hear that.

                                 DELL
                        I got a good 34 years with her. 
                        That’s more than most. You got 
                        someone special in your life Honey?

           Honey shakes her head. 

                                 HONEY
                        Just focused on my business right 
                        now. Trying to get my business all 
                        prepped for legalization.

           Dell laughs. Shakes his head. 

                                 DELL
                        If you really knew our business you 
                        wouldn’t be so eager for 
                        legalization. 

                                 HONEY
                        Well, it’s the future-
                                 DELL
                        Don’t lecture me on the future. I 
                        can name over a hundred strains of 
                        weed, what grows best when. Why? 
                        Cause I make it my business to know 
                        my shit better than anyone else. 

           Dell takes a long sip of his bourbon. Pained by all this.

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        Now every banker who did a bong hit 
                        thinks they can cash in. Turn it 
                        into a shitshow is more like it. 
                        Legalization is going to destroy 
                        our business, just you watch. Your 
                        generation is leading us all to the 
                        goddamned slaughterhouse. 

           Honey takes a hit of her joint. She’s cool, calm, collected.

                                 HONEY
                        Growing up, I knew I had to work 
                        twice as hard for half of what 
                        everyone else got. Now I can’t help 
                        when I was born, but I know I’ve 
                        built a better mousetrap. And I 
                        built it from the ground up with my 
                        blood, sweat, and tears. Just like 
                        you and your wife. And I love it.

           Dell listens. Sips his bourbon. Unreadable.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Everything I’ve done has led to me 
                        sitting here after all. And that 
                        has to count for something.

           Dell studies Honey. Invisible calculations being made. 

                                 DELL
                        How much do you want?

                                 HONEY
                        A hundred thousand.

                                 DELL
                        Five hundred thousand. Anythin’ 
                        less don’t get me up in the 
                        morning, sugar.

           Honey knows she doesn’t have that kind of cash right now.  
           She has to get creative or she could lose him.
                                 HONEY
                        I can do 100k as a down payment, 
                        but the rest on credit. 
                             (off his look)
                        And yes I can move it. I’m the

                        Week’s hottest after parties. 
                        That’s just next week, so in two 
                        weeks time, you’ll have your money 
                        with interest. I’ll even provide my 
                        own transportation and boxes.

           Dell puffs on his cigar one last time, then puts it out. 

                                 DELL
                        I don’t normally do deals on credit 
                        with new buyers, but I like you 
                        Honey. So I’m gonna take a flyer. 
                        100K down, provide your own boxes 
                        and transport, and we have a deal.

           Honey knows doing a deal on credit is risky, but she’s 
           willing to gamble on herself. 

                                 HONEY
                        Done.

           Dell shows her out. 

                                 DELL
                        One more thing Honey - next time 
                        invite your friends in. Seems silly 
                        for Mickey and Jasmine to stay out 
                        in the van when I have enough 
                        refreshments in here for everyone.

           Honey goes very still. 

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        But do tell Montana to stay off my 
                        network. My privacy is of the 
                        utmost importance. Next time I 
                        might not be so charmed.

           Honey nods. Dell may be old, but he ain’t slow.

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        You take care now. Talk real soon.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           We see BECCA backing up a BIG MOVING TRUCK with ease. WHOOSH! 
           The the back door opens and we see MUSEUM QUALITY PACKAGING. 
                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        I kept making these deals with the 
                        devil. But I told myself that I was 
                        the real devil. That I’d be the one 
                        outsmarting them. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS’ DISPATCH CENTER - NIGHT

           The girls get ready for FASHION WEEK - packing, cooking, 
           designing. The girls work hard, but have fun at it. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Of course, that’s how the devil 
                        sucks you in. He doesn’t really 
                        have to do much.

           Finally one late night finds most of the girls asleep around 
           the room. Exhausted, Honey covers Sara with a blanket. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        You outsmart yourself for him.

           Honey finds Annie still awake crunching numbers. 

                                 HONEY
                        Annie, go to sleep already. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Sorry, it’s just - Did you say 
                        we’re getting another load in?

                                 HONEY
                        Yeah so we can still deliver to our 
                        regular customers and keep up with 
                        Fashion Week demands. 

           Annie takes off her glasses, rubs her eyes.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, okay, It’s just the math isn’t 
                        adding up. This is already way more 
                        than 100k worth of weed.

                                 HONEY
                        Of course. We’ll have 500k worth in 
                        inventory. Gonna need it all.

                                 ANNIE
                        But... after the losses on Rich’s 
                        inventory, we don’t have that kinda 
                        cash laying around right now. 

           Honey looks around, makes sure no one else is awake.
                                 HONEY
                        We don’t. We got it on credit. 

           Annie is horrified. As if Moses had broken a commandment.

                                 ANNIE
                        What?! You always said NEVER to 
                        sell or buy anything on credit!!!

                                 HONEY
                        Look, we’re so close to the finish 
                        line. It’s okay to bend the rules. 

                                 ANNIE
                        And what happens if we don’t move 
                        it all? This isn’t some bank -- 
                        these are... serious people. 

                                 HONEY
                        We’re gonna move it all. Don’t 
                        worry. Just do me a favor and keep 
                        it to yourself, okay? I don’t want 
                        anything messing with their heads 
                        tomorrow. Gotta bring our A-Game. 

           Annie is deeply conflicted, but she trusts Honey. She nods. 
           Giving Annie’s shoulder a squeeze, Honey lies down, trying to 
           get some sleep. But it’s pointless -- she’s wide awake. For 
           all the confidence she evinces, she’s terrified.

           We PRE-LAP the ROAR of SHOUTING PAPARAZZI as we CUT TO:

           EXT. RKO HAMILTON THEATER - ALEXANDER WANG RUNWAY SHOW - DAY

           Where A-list guests like Lady Gaga, The Weeknd, Solange and 
           Rihanna pose outside. The vibe is stoner-chic.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Everything was in place for Day One 
                        of Fashion Week.

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine carry their cases with ease, 
           flashing their VIP invitations proudly. 

           INT. RKO HAMILTON THEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Backstage, the girls take in all the fabulous mayhem. 

                                 HONEY
                        Let’s hit the bathrooms before they 
                        get packed. You two go first, I’ll 
                        watch the merch. 
           Mickey and Jasmine go off, Honey storing their cases behind 
           the catering station - as Honey’s former agent Joan arrives.

                                 JOAN
                        Honey -- so glad to see you found 
                        your calling. Catering suits you! 
                        Top my champers up, would you? 

                                 HONEY
                        ...I’m not a caterer, Joan.

                                 JOAN
                        Then why are you here? Because 
                        you’re certainly not in the show. 

           Joan’s eyes wander. Already over this conversation.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Anyhow, do excuse me - I see 
                        Alexander heading my way...

           Indeed Alexander Wang is approaching.

                                 JOAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Alexander! Darling-

           But he ignores Joan, bypassing her for Honey. Whom he kisses 
           on both cheeks -- like the dear friend she is. 

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Honey, thank god! Just seeing you 
                        backstage takes the edge off.

                                 HONEY
                        Alexander... You’re too sweet.

                                 ALEXANDER
                        Remember that at the after-party! 
                        Those gummies? My faves. Friend 
                        prices, right? See you there! 

           Joan’s beyond aghast as Alexander walks off. 

                                 HONEY
                        Oh Joan. You’re still here? 

                                 JOAN
                        Well, I-

           Honey plucks a champagne flute off a tray being passed by.
                                 HONEY
                        I’d say I’ll see you at the after-
                        party - but I’m throwing it and 
                        you’re not invited. What was that 
                        you told me? Oh yes...
                             (takes a sip)
                        I believe the market has spoken. 

           Honey brushes past a speechless Joan, as she links up with a 
           returning Jasmine and Mickey.

                                 MICKEY
                        Who was that?

                                 HONEY
                        Nobody important. 

           Off Honey’s victory smirk...

           INT. RKO HAMILTON THEATER - ALEXANDER WANG RUNWAY SHOW - DAY

           Models strut down the runway to PRINCESS NOKAI’S TOMBOY as 
           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine sit front row, total “IT” Girls.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        We were on top. 

           AT THE AFTER-PARTY - It’s like a Neon Goth Rave in the old 
           theater. Sara and Mor woman the GIFTING TABLE - impressing 
           the shit out of the most jaded celebs. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Our gifting suites were a wild 
                        success. Whispers spread about the 
                        smart girls with the amazing weed. 

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine pose for photos as Alexander 
           personally introduces them to A-listers.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        It seemed like my gamble paid off. 
                        But not everyone was so pleased... 

           Honey grabs a champagne bottle from behind the bar -- popping 
           it as we PRE-LAP a LOUD THWACK!!! CUTTING TO:

           INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - DAY

           Where Rich plays racquetball with his finance friend Teddy. 
           Rich misses, throws down his racquet in frustration. 
           Distracted, upset. No one has ever said no to him before.
                                 TEDDY
                        My dude, seriously? You need to get 
                        over her. There are way hotter 
                        chicks out there.

           Rich serves again, the two going back and forth.

                                 RICH
                        She wasn’t just some THOT like your 
                        skanks. We had something special- 

                                 TEDDY
                        Must not have been that special 
                        since she’s getting her weed from 
                        somewhere else now. 

                                 RICH
                        What?!

                                 TEDDY
                        Yeah. Word on the street is the 
                        High Queens are still selling.

           Rich hits the ball HARD and it smacks Teddy in the face.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck man! 

                                 RICH
                        Going behind my back. She’d be 
                        nothing without me. I MADE HER!

           Rich grabs his phone and sends a text message. Throws his 
           phone down back in his bag. Motions for the ball. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        That bitch will be begging for my 
                        forgiveness when I’m done with her. 

           Rich grabs the racquet, and throws the ball up - SMASH!

           INT. HIGH QUEENS DISPATCH - DAY

           On the calendar, we see the girls are halfway through the 
           week. Honey goes over the remaining schedule.  

                                 JASMINE
                        We’ve got girls stationed at Vera 
                        Wang and Celine shows for tonight.

                                 ANNIE
                        Second shipment arrived. Becca’s 
                        secured the truck in the garage.
                                 HONEY
                        Excellent! We’ll unload it tonight 
                        after the last show. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Works for me! 

                                 JASMINE
                        Me too. I won’t be back until 
                        around 9 -- my little brother’s 
                        getting his yellow belt. Promised 
                        I’d take him to Shake Shack after. 

           Honey gives her a pleading look... 

                                 JASMINE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, yeah. I’ll bring you back a 
                        black & white shake. 

           Honey high-fives her. Best friends forever.

           INT. NYC SHOTOKAN KARATE DOJO - NIGHT

           Jasmine sits on a bench at the back of the Dojo, alongside 
           other families. Her younger brother ANDY wobbling, kicking a 
           balsa wood board, held by an older student. The board snaps. 

           SOMEONE sits down next to her on the bench. Leans over:

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        A yellow belt at 12. That’s 
                        impressive. Good for Andy.

           Jasmine turns at the familiar voice -- indeed it’s Rich. He 
           doesn’t acknowledge her gaze, just stares straight ahead. 

                                 JASMINE
                        The fuck do you want, Rich?

                                 RICH
                        Do you know what a late-stage 
                        addict will do for fentanyl? 
                        Anything, Jas. And I mean anything. 
                        Asked a guy to cut off his own ear 
                        once, just to see if he’d do it. 
                        And guess what? 

           Rich subtly pulls a prescription pill bottle from his jacket 
           pocket, rattles it like a diamondback.
                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Point is I’ve got my own private 
                        army of zombies staggering around 
                        out there, do anything I tell them. 
                        Like say if I were to tell them, 
                        kill this kid for me and I’ll give 
                        you sixty pills, they wouldn’t 
                        hesitate, not for a second. They’d 
                        be climbing over each other to get 
                        to him. With the Opioid crisis, 
                        shit - your little brother’s just 
                        another statistic. 

           Rich gets up. That stupid, scary smile on his face.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        But he doesn’t have to be. Think 
                        about it. Talk it over with Honey. 

           Andy runs over with his yellow belt, elated. Jasmine too 
           shocked to even notice. Rich reaching down on his way out to 
           give Andy’s hair an avuncular tousle.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Mickey’s on the phone with Sai as she walks.

                                 MICKEY
                        Just finishing up a run, babe. 
                        Yeah, but we’re short-handed this 
                        week. Call you after. Love you too.

           She hangs up, reaching her destination.

           EXT./INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           She BUZZES to be let in, when a TAKE OUT DELIVERY GUY steps 
           up behind her. Looks her over. Mickey tries to ignore him.  
           As she’s BUZZED IN, the Take-Out Guy pushes in after her. 
           That’s when ANOTHER TOUGH GUY steps off the elevator.

                                 TOUGH GUY 
                        You’re the delivery girl right?

           That’s weird. Mickey’s heart is racing now, her guard way up. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Wrong person.

           She tries to turn to leave but the Take-Out Guy blocks her. 
           The two men surrounding her. Pure fear on Mickey’s face.  
           INT. UNDISCLOSED BUILDING - NIGHT

           Honey is touring the property she bought with a FOREMAN, 
           blueprints in hand, when she gets a call.

                                 HONEY
                        Hey Annie - Okay slow down. What? 
                        Mickey? Where? I’m on my way.

           INT. NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL - MICKEY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Honey bursts in, frantic. Sees Sai, Jasmine and the other 
           girls gathered around Mickey. She’s been roughed up badly.  
           Honey kneels by Mickey’s bed, heartbroken. Sai is furious.

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m so sorry Honey, I didn’t want 
                        to tell them... I tried...

                                 SAI
                        She was on a run for you. I thought 
                        she was done with that.

           Before Honey can answer - a NURSE looks in, irritated. 

                                 NURSE
                        I told you last time, visiting 
                        hours are over. Come back tomorrow.

           Honey holds Mickey, trying to re-assure her. 

                                 HONEY
                        Don’t worry about a thing okay? We 
                        got you. You just rest up and get 
                        back to your awesome self. 
                             (to Sai)
                        I’ll fix this Sai. I will.

           Honey and the girls step out, closing the door behind them.

           INT. NEW YORK PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL  - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Once outside, Honey gets down to business. 

                                 HONEY
                        What the hell happened? 

                                 JASMINE
                        She got jumped by Rich’s guys - 
                        that’s what happened! Plus Rich 
                        showed up at my brother’s ceremony, 
                        threatened me and my family! 
           Honey’s phone RINGS. She picks up, already knowing who it is. 

                                 HONEY
                             (into phone)
                        Rich, you fucking bastard - 

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        Guess you got my message Honey.

           We INTERCUT this with RICH on the phone -- but it’s hard to 
           tell where he is. The background is dark, indistinct. 

                                 RICH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I made sure they didn’t mess up her 
                        pretty face. I’m an aesthete, as 
                        you know. 

                                 HONEY
                        Listen fucko - I don’t know what 
                        games you’re playing but I’m going 
                        to rip your dick off and feed it to 
                        you for what you did to Mickey.

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        Not if you ever want to see your 
                        precious cargo again. 

                                 HONEY
                        You think I give a shit about a 
                        backpack’s worth of product? 

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        No, by the looks of it, I’d say 
                        it’s about two hundred and fifty 
                        thousand dollars worth of product. 
                        Cool cases too. Almost had me 
                        fooled. Very stylish of you.

           It dawns on Honey - Rich has the TRUCK with the second WEED 
           SHIPMENT. Her stomach drops.

                                 HONEY
                        What are you talking about?

           We now see Rich is in front of Honey’s truck, his goons 
           spread out around it. Shit-eating grin on his face.

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        Don’t treat me like an asshole, 
                        Honey. You’ve seen what happens 
                        when I get mad. People you care 
                        about get hurt. 

           It takes every inch of self-control, but Honey calms herself.
                                 HONEY
                        What do you want for the truck? 

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        I was thinking about what you said. 
                        How our business relationship is so 
                        important to you. How you wouldn’t 
                        want anything to ruin it. 

           Rich is savoring this. It’s better than sex for him.

                                 RICH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I figure, if you don’t have a 
                        business anymore, we wouldn’t have 
                        to worry about any of that. 

           Honey’s throat is closing up. What does Rich want?

                                 RICH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        So here’s how you get your truck 
                        back - you give me your client 
                        list. Every single customer you got 
                        because I supplied you with weed.  
                        Because I’m selling them all the 
                        heroin, coke and fentanyl you’re 
                        too pussy to offer them. 

                                 HONEY
                        You must be fucking joking. 

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        Bitch, please. I’m guessing you 
                        bought this weed on credit -- 
                        because that tainted product I got 
                        you sure didn’t sell. So if you 
                        don’t play ball with me to get your 
                        truck back, whoever your supplier 
                        is, they’ll be coming after you. 
                        And I’m guessing they’re not sweet 
                        on you like I am. 

           CLICK - Rich hangs up. Honey stares at her phone like it’s 
           cursed. Then realizes all the Queens are staring at her. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS’ DISPATCH CENTER - NIGHT 

           Everyone is gathered together. Morale is low. The once tight-
           knit girls are starting to fray. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Fuck it. Let Rich keep that weed. 
                        Give him the list, cut our losses. 
                                 HONEY
                        We can’t do that. We have Fashion 
                        Week to finish, clients counting on 
                        us. What we need is our truck back.

                                 JASMINE
                        Are you shitting me, Honey? Rich is 
                        threatening my family, Mickey’s in 
                        the hospital, and all you can think 
                        about is FASHION WEEK?! 

           Honey snaps. The pressure finally getting to her. 

                                 HONEY
                        If we don’t get that weed back, 
                        WE’RE ALL FUCKING DEAD!

           The girls are shell-shocked. What did she just say?

                                 MOR
                        What are you talking about?

                                 HONEY
                        I bought the weed on credit, okay? 
                        And if we don’t sell it, we can’t 
                        pay back Dell what I owe him.

                                 JASMINE
                        Why would you do that? We had 
                        enough cash to cover the deal.

           And so the other shoe drops.

                                 HONEY
                        I put all the money into a grow 
                        site location. A building came up 
                        that I couldn’t pass on - 

                                 JASMINE
                        You bought a fucking building 
                        without running it past us!?

                                 HONEY
                        I knew you’d say no. I was going to 
                        tell you and Mickey after Fashion 
                        Week. We had a surefire thing - you 
                        have to believe me.

           Jasmine is boiling over. Sara tries to keep the calm. 

                                 SARA
                        You can just withdraw from the sale 
                        and get the money back, right?
                                 HONEY
                        I tried. It’s frozen in an escrow 
                        account. I can’t touch it.

           Shit just got real. An audible GROAN from the room. Jasmine 
           looks like she could light Honey on fire with her eyes. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Why am I not fucking surprised.

                                 HONEY
                        Jasmine, I made a mistake - we can 
                        still salvage all of this. Trust 
                        me, we can figure this-

                                 JASMINE
                        Trust? Really? HOW DARE YOU ASK ME 
                        TO TRUST YOU AFTER EVERYTHING-

           Honey snaps - gets in Jasmine’s face.

                                 HONEY
                        EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IS BECAUSE OF 
                        ME! If it was up to you, we’d still 
                        be working in a club for minimum 
                        wage. So unless you got a solution, 
                        SHUT THE HELL UP and let me think! 

           But Jasmine gives it right back. 

                                 JASMINE
                        You talk a big game. We’re supposed 
                        to be partners, yet you treat us 
                        like fuckin employees, Honey! 

           Murmurs in the room. Jasmine not alone in feeling this way.

                                 HONEY
                        I’m the only one with a vision-

                                 JASMINE
                        Well, look where your VISION has 
                        gotten us now! 

           She shoves Honey. Honey shoves back.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jasmine, Honey - stop!

           Annie separates the girls. Honey on her last nerve.

                                 HONEY
                        I’M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE FOR 
                        WANTING MORE FOR MY LIFE! 
           Jasmine regards Honey coldly. Like a complete stranger.

                                 JASMINE
                        You think you can do this on your 
                        own - go ahead. Make all the dumb 
                        decisions you want, but I’m done. 
                             (a beat)
                        Unlike you, I’ve got other people 
                        to think about. 

           Jasmine BLAZES OUT - girls clearing a path instantly. Honey 
           is speechless. Jasmine’s words puncturing old wounds.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jasmine wait -

           Annie chases after her. The girls look anxiously at Honey for 
           direction. What now? What’s the move? But Honey has none. She 
           retreats into another room, SLAMMING THE DOOR. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS’ DISPATCH CENTER - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She tears the room apart, furious at Rich, at Dell, herself. 
           The stability and control she had - gone. Full blown panic 
           boiling, Honey breaks: crumples onto the floor crying, alone.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Those deals with the devil always 
                        come due. There’s no outsmarting 
                        them, no outrunning them. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - MICKEY’S ROOM - DAY

           Honey looks at a sleeping Mickey. Hooked up to machines, in a 
           hospital bed, because of her. Honey totally lost, despondent.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        You have to pay the price.

                                 MICKEY (O.S.)
                        Honey?

           Mickey has woken up. Honey leans forward, pushes tears away. 

                                 HONEY
                        Hey Micks... How you feeling?

                                 MICKEY
                        I’m okay. The pain meds they have 
                        me on are grrreeeat. Should be out 
                        of here in no time. Said I’m a fast 
                        healer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Like Wonder Woman, without the cool 
                        chest plate or accent.
                             (off Honey’s tears)
                        Woah, are you okay? 

                                 HONEY 
                        Yeah... no. I ruined everything. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Did Rich get the truck? I’m sorry-

           For the first time, we see Honey really let her guard down. 
           She’s shaken, scared of losing everything. 

                                 HONEY
                        No, I’m sorry. I’ve made a terrible 
                        mistake Mickey... I bought the weed 
                        on credit from Dell and now Rich is 
                        out for blood -- Jasmine hates me, 
                        I’ve ruined everything...
                             (tears streaming)
                        I’ve put everyone I love in danger. 

           Mickey grabs Honey’s hand. Holds it tightly.

                                 MICKEY
                        The only mistake you made was 
                        thinking you had do this all on 
                        your own. We’re your family Honey.  

           The word family really hits Honey hard.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Am I pissed? Yeah. But like I told 
                        you from day one, we’re partners. I 
                        can forgive you. 

           Honey wipes away tears. 

                                 HONEY
                        Thanks Micks... But I don’t think 
                        the other girls will. They don’t 
                        trust me and I don’t blame them. 

                                 MICKEY
                        You have to trust people for them 
                        to trust you. Give them a chance. 
                        They might surprise you. 

           INT. HIGH QUEEN’S DISPATCH CENTER - DAY

           Honey walks in nervous, not sure of the reception she’ll 
           receive. The girls look up, shocked to see her. Honey?
                                 HONEY
                        When Mickey, Jasmine, and I started 
                        this, no one expected anything from 
                        any of us. But look at what we’ve 
                        all built together. It’s not just a 
                        multi-million dollar company - it’s 
                        a family. I know if we work 
                        together we can figure this out...

           She looks around the room at all the Queens now.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        And I also know I’ve abused your 
                        trust, so if you want to leave. I 
                        won’t hold it against you. 

                                 MOR
                        We all loved you like a sister and 
                        you went behind our backs. 

                                 KATRINA
                        You were reckless and selfish.

           Honey can’t look up. Her closest friends about to walk away.

                                 ANNIE
                        But sisters also forgive each 
                        other. They believe in each other. 
                        And we’re not gonna stop now.

           All the girls embrace Honey as sisters, as a real family.

                                 HONEY
                        I promise I’ll figure something 
                        out. I don’t have a plan yet but-

           The girls share a smile. 

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s okay, cause we do!

           Annie reveals what they’ve been huddles around - their plan.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to keep the Fashion 
                        Week plans as is. We have enough 
                        inventory left for two days.

                                 HONEY
                        What about Dell and the truck?

           Montana leans back in her chair, born for this.
                                 MONTANA
                        Simple. We steal it back.

                                 ANNIE
                        We’re gonna make Rich rue the day 
                        he fucked with the High Queens!

           Honey smiles -- a proud mother. Let’s do this. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS DISPATCH - DAY

           All the girls do their runs as usual. It’s going to be a 
           close call - but they might be able to pull this off in time.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        For the plan to work, nothing had 
                        to seem out of the ordinary. 

           Montana and Honey work their contacts and scour online for 
           where Rich could be keeping the truck.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Everything was in place for Day 
                        Four. It was business as usual. 

           INT. TOM FORD RUNWAY SHOW - BACK STAGE

           We see our REDHEAD QUEEN (from the opening) wrapping up a 
           sale at the Tom Ford after party, fresh from the catwalk.

                                 HONEY(V.O.)
                        We even had a lead on the truck’s 
                        location. I was starting to think 
                        we might actually pull this off.

           EXT. TOM FORD RUNWAY SHOW - DAY

           We pick our Redhead out on the street - and find ourselves...

           INT. HIGH QUEEN’S DISPATCH - DAY

           Back at OUR OPENING TEASER. The fancy apartment building. 
           Honey at the helm of their Fashion Week Headquarters.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But - you know what happens next...

           The events play out as before - Annie hands Honey the phone. 
           Honey steps down to the street... where she’s GRABBED. 
           A BURLAP BAG PULLED OVER HER HEAD. She’s quickly BOUND and 
           THROWN INTO A CAR TRUNK. Everything goes BLACK. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           OVER BLACK we hear MALE VOICES whisper, the sound of 
           footsteps on concrete. Honey’s breathing quickens. The bag is 
           pulled off her head and she finds herself in-

           INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT FLOOR - DAY

           All machinery and hooks. The stench overpowering. Honey tied 
           to a chair, her mouth duct-taped. Surrounded by SCARY 
           MOTHERFUCKERS. Honey squirms in her chair violently...

                                 DELL (O.S.)
                        Gonna hurt yourself if you keep 
                        thrashing around like that. 

           Dell stands in front of Honey. 

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        Uncover her mouth. We need to talk.

           One of the Men rips the duct tape off - Honey winces. 

                                 HONEY
                        Dell? What the fuck is going on? I-

           Dell grabs Honey’s face hard. Gets in close.

                                 DELL
                        No. You listen. I talk. The only 
                        reason you’re not dead is because I 
                        want some answers. Got it?

           Honey nods. The friendly farmer facade has been replaced by a 
           serious motherfucker you don’t want to cross.

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        Word on the street is a lady dealer 
                        and friends got themselves in a 
                        pickle. Their product got stolen.

                                 HONEY
                        I don’t know what rumors you’ve 
                        heard Dell, but everything is fine. 

                                 DELL
                        Don’t lie, Honey. It’s very 
                        unbecoming. I don’t care about 
                        whatever turf war you’ve got 
                        yourself in. That’s your business. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DELL (CONT'D)
                        What I do care about is my money. 
                        Money you still owe me. And after 
                        what’s happened, I’m just not 
                        comfortable with the timetable we 
                        agreed to. So... I want it now.

                                 HONEY
                        Dell, I swear - You’re gonna get 
                        your money. My girls are selling 
                        product as quickly as they get it. 
                        Fashion week isn’t even over - I 
                        just need a little more time. 

                                 DELL
                        Figured you were gonna say that. 

           He motions - one of Dell’s guys brings him a folder. 

                                 DELL (CONT’D)
                        You know Honey, I’ve found 
                        information is more valuable than 
                        product or money.

                        Anderson, 161 West 61st-- 

           He drops photos as he reads, each more painful than a punch.

                                 HONEY
                        They have nothing to do with this! 
                        Don’t you fucking touch them-

           Dell closes the folder. Waves it in Honey’s face. 

                                 DELL
                        I’m a generous man, so I’ll give 
                        you 48 hours before I start picking 
                        the High Queens apart. Don’t make 
                        me do that. Pay the money.
                             (to his guys re: Honey)
                        We’re done here. 

           Honey is dragged out of the warehouse. 

           INT. HIGH QUEENS' DISPATCH CENTER - DAY

           Honey comes in like a bat out of hell. The clock is ticking.

                                 MONTANA
                        Jesus- what happened? One minute 
                        you were here and then-
                                 HONEY
                        It’s Dell. He has all our info. Our 
                        names, addresses, everything.

           The girls exchanges look. Fuck. How did this get even worse?

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        He heard about the truck. Thinks we 
                        can’t deliver on the deal. He wants 
                        his money in the next day or...

           She can’t even bring herself to say it. Too awful. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        We have to get the weed tonight.

                                 MONTANA
                        But everything isn’t ready yet-

                                 HONEY
                        We have to make it ready. 

           The Queens blanche. Is that even possible?

                                 MICKEY (O.S.)
                        Let’s do it, then.

           Honey turns to see Mickey! She’s out of the hospital. Honey 
           hugs her friend close. Mickey winces. 

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        You think I was going to let a 
                        couple bruised ribs stop me from 
                        helping my friends pull off a 
                        heist? Bring me up to speed.

           All the girls stand in front of the plans. This time, the 
           other Queens taking point. 

                                 KATRINA 
                        Since we can’t fulfill the last of 
                        our fashion week requests with our 
                        missing product-

                                 MOR
                        -We thought we’d make up for it 
                        with the best party yet!  

           Honey smiles, nods at Montana. Who presses SEND on her phone.

           BEEP BEEP - DING - BZZZ - SWOOSH! We see A MASS TEXT going 
           out: BE HIVE VINTAGE POP-UP PARTY - featuring MR. X

           212 by Azealia Banks pulsates, pulling us into: 
           EXT. BUSHWICK - WAREHOUSE POP UP PARTY - DAY

           The best of the High Queens clientèle - beautiful models, 
           hipsters, influencers - crowd the entrance to the Warehouse. 
           Becca and Yuki wrangle the door, working the guest list. The 
           loud thumping bass rolling out into the street.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        And the truck?

                                 MONTANA (V.O.)
                        Well, thanks to Rich’s Instagram -

           We see flashes of Rich’s Instagram: Douchey workout selfies, 
           inspirational quotes, #TBT, and... his exotic car collection.

                                 MONTANA (V.O.)
                        I was able to locate where Rich 
                        stores his exotic car collection 
                        via metadata in the geotags. 

           We pan next door, to the real target: RICH’S PRIVATE GARAGE.

           INT. RICH’S GARAGE - DAY 

           The High Queen’s missing TRUCK sits in the middle of the 
           room, surrounded by BENTLEYS, MASERATIS and so on.

           Paulie and Rich’s GOONS are encamped next to the truck, pizza 
           boxes and empty beer bottles scattered around them. The party 
           noise and THUMPING BASS line leaking in from next door.

           BUZZZ! A goon gets up to answer the door. It’s A DELIVERY GUY 
           -- someone familiar to us: Derek’s friend Petey.

                                 PETEY
                        Got a delivery - 

           He holds out a BOX OF COOKIES. Goon #1 reads the NOTE:

                                 GOON#1
                        From next door: “Sorry about the 
                        noise.” 

           The Goon shrugs, takes it. Shuts the door. Paulie grabs the 
           box, hoarding it for himself. 

                                 GOON #3
                        Don’t be a dick, Paulie. 

                                 PAULIE
                        Chain of command, Rico. 
           And that’s when ALL THE ALARMS GO OFF -- freaking Paulie out.

                                 PAULIE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus fucking Christ!

           LIGHTS are FLASHING, ALARMS BLARING. Paulie and the goons 
           look around. Nothing. What’s setting them off?

                                 GOON #2
                             (shouting)
                        It’s ‘cause of the party next door. 
                        Rich has this whole place wired 
                        with sound triggers and shit!

           Goon points to the SECURITY CONSOLE. Indeed, the volume 
           meters are peaking in the red zone - the bass next door 
           blowing their mind.  Unable to take anymore, Paulie walks 
           over - SHUTS IT OFF. The noise and flashing stops.

                                 PAULIE
                        Go see what’s going on over there.

           The Goons excitedly get up, dying to stretch their legs.

                                 PAULIE (CONT’D)
                        Not all of you - one of you stay 
                        and guard the door. And be quick!

           Paulie turns back to the cookies. Plants his ass comfortably.

           EXT. RICH’S GARAGE - DAY

           Rich’s Goons stumble outside to see the party mayhem. They 
           approach, leaving one SAD GOON behind to guard the door.  
           From an ALLEY nearby, Annie watches-

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Seeing the Goons head over, Annie sends a text to Honey, as 
           Petey rounds the corner and approaches her.

                                 PETEY
                        Now what?

                                 ANNIE
                        We wait. Shouldn’t be too long.

           Petey nods, starts munching on a cookie he stole from the box

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        You idiot! Those are weed cookies! 
                        You’re gonna be high as a kite!
                                 PETEY
                        You say idiot, I say genius. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE POP UP PARTY - CONTINUOUS 

           The place is packed. A DJ spins on a MAKESHIFT STAGE. Honey 
           standing behind him, monitoring the party. DING! Honey gets 
           the text from Annie. Turns to Montana. 

                                 HONEY
                        They’re on their way over.

           Montana, her laptop open, adds:

                                 MONTANA
                        Sound from the party worked. They 
                        turned off their alarms. 

                                 HONEY
                        Go time. You know what to do.

           Mickey nods, motions to Yuki, while Honey signals Mor and 
           Katrina to descend onto the floor. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE POP UP PARTY - DAY

           The Goons approach Becca, taking in all the beautiful women 
           hanging outside. Goon #1 pushes his way to the front.

                                 BECCA
                        Sorry, we’re at capacity. You’ll 
                        have to wait in line.

                                 GOON #1
                        Naw. I need to speak to the guy in 
                        charge. Unless you want us to call 
                        the cops on your little party.

           Becca faux “recoils.” Oh noes! 

                                 BECCA
                        Okay, fine. Just go in and ask for 
                        Derek. He’s by the stage.

           INT. WAREHOUSE POP UP PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           The Goons head for the stage, when Mor and Katrina intercept 
           them. Katrina “trips”, spills her drink on a Goon #1.

                                 KATRINA
                        Whoops! I’m soooo sorry!
           The girls pat him down. Hello.

                                 GOON #1
                        It’s all good mami. 

                                 KATRINA
                        Let me buy you a drink to 
                        apologize.

           He hesitates. Looks to the stage, then backs to the girls. 

                                 KATRINA (CONT’D)
                        C’mon! I don’t want to miss Mr. X.

                                 GOON #1
                        He’s gonna perform here?
                             (off their nods)
                        We could stay for one drink, right? 
                        Paulie won’t mind...

           BEHIND THE BAR, SARA pours drinks, SPIKING THE GOONS’ drinks. 
           She hands them to MOR and KATRINA who pass them to the guys. 

                                 KATRINA
                        Bottoms up fellas.

           The Goons down the SPIKED DRINKS happily.

           INT. RICH’S GARAGE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Paulie’s three weed cookies deep and isn’t feeling too good. 
           He jumps up, rushing to the BATHROOM. PUKING his guts out...

           EXT. RICH’S GARAGE - DAY

           Mickey and Yuki stumble toward the GOON guarding the door. 

                                 MICKEY
                        We really have to pee and the 
                        line’s super long next door. Can we  
                        please use your bathroom?

                                 DOOR GOON
                        Can’t do it. Sorry.

           The girls look at each other. Yuki digs in her purse.

                                 YUKI
                        What if we gave you our extra VIP 
                        pass? Mr. X is gonna perform. This 
                        will get you right in.
                                 DOOR GOON
                        Mr. X?!?

           They nod. Door Goon looks at them, then to the line of 
           beautiful people. He takes the pass, cracks open the door.

                                 DOOR GOON (CONT’D)
                        It’s to the right. Be quick.

                                 MICKEY
                        Thanks! 

           The girls slip in. Goon looks at the pass. Happy. 

                                 DOOR GOON
                        Fuck this Rico making me stay 
                        behind. If he’s partying, so am I.

           He leaves his post, slips on the badge.

           INT. RICH’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Inside Mickey and Yuki scan the room. No one here. They clock 
           that the door goon has left and head for the truck.

                                 MICKEY
                        Never thought I’d be so happy to 
                        see an off-white panel truck. 

           Mickey opens truck door revealing a MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WEED. 
           Mickey grabs a brick and tosses it to Yuki. It’s heavy.

                                 YUKI
                        And here I became a High Queen so I 
                        could avoid manual labor. 

           INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Honey looks out into the crowd and spots the Goons - now so 
           woozy they can barely stand. She smiles, pleased. DING!

           Around the party, we see each remaining Queen’s phone light 
           up with Mickey’s text: READY TO MOVE. ALL HANDS ON DECK!

           Honey SIGNALS to Derek, who’s standing near the stage. Then  
           her and the girls step out into the adjoining ALLEY-

           EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Honey comes out meets Annie by the propped back door of 
           Rich’s garage, the other Queens following close behind.
           INT. RICH’S GARAGE / ALLEY WAY / WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 

           The High Queens LINKING UP to steal back their weed. Passing 
           out one brick at a time -- out Rich’s garage, through the 
           alley, and finally into their warehouse -- storing their 
           product underneath the main stage of the party.

           At a normal party, this might get noticed but... UP ON STAGE, 
           the DJ finishes up his set and DEREK walks out:

                                 DEREK
                        Please welcome to the stage, a man 
                        who needs no introduction - MR. X!

           MR. X comes out on stage. The crowd goes beyond INSANE.

                                 MR. X
                        Come on, put your hands up. Put 
                        your hands up!

           The world’s most famous entertainer is playing a warehouse. 
           The scene is complete MAYHEM. Forget noticing the High Queens 
           -- you could teleport this place to Mars and nobody’d notice. 

           INT. RICH’S GARAGE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Paulie sweaty, dehydrated. Goes to wash his face. Stumbles 
           and FALLS DOWN -- picks himself up, readying to exit. 

           The girls hear Paulie stumbling around. Honey motions to 
           them, mouths - HURRY UP!!! We gotta go!

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           The girls have almost all the weed loaded up. Then... POLICE 
           SIRENS in the distance. Approaching rapidly. 

                                 BECCA
                        Shit! I think someone called the 
                        cops on the party!

           Honey doesn’t panic, just nods. 

                                 HONEY
                        We knew this might happen. Just 
                        stick to the plan. I’m gonna grab 
                        the last brick.

           INT. RICH'S GARAGE - DAY

           Honey heads back into the truck, grabbing the last brick.
                                 PAULIE (O.S.)
                        Honey? Is that you?

           Honey turns to see Paulie nearby. His hand resting next to 
           the ALARM CONSOLE. But instead of running, Honey just says:

                                 HONEY
                        How you feeling Paulie?

                                 PAULIE
                        I’ve been better. 
                             (clocking the empty truck)
                        You stole your weed back, huh? 
                        Smart. Always were damn smart.

                                 HONEY
                        Thanks Paulie. 

           Paulie cradles his hand reflexively -- the one Rich STABBED. 
           Taking a moment. Deciding. Then... 

                                 PAULIE
                        You know what? Fuck Rich.

           Paulie moves off, heading for the door. He’s out of here. 

                                 PAULIE (CONT’D)
                        See ya around, Honey. 

                                 HONEY
                        See ya Paulie. 

           Honey smiles, heads out through ALLEY back into the Party.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE POP UP PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           Just as a squadron of NYPD COPS PULL UP OUTSIDE... Fighting 
           their way through the crowd, headed INSIDE. 

                                 NYPD COP
                        Show’s over folks - break it up.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           As the NYPD squad pushes through the crowd, heading for main 
           stage Honey signals to Derek - go time - then... disappears.

                                 DEREK
                        Hope this works.
           Derek PUSHES A BUTTON and the BACK WAREHOUSE DOORS SUDDENLY 
           SWING WIDE OPEN, THE CURTAIN SEPARATING THE “FRONT” AND 
           “BACKSTAGE” DROPS FROM THE CEILING...

           - AS THE STAGE STARTS TO MOVE -- WITH MR. X STILL PERFORMING.

           You see, the “Stage” is on a FLATBED TRUCK -- sound system 
           and all. A mobile Madison Square Garden. The Cops are PUSHED 
           ASIDE by a sea of fans chasing after the moving stage. 

           INT. FLATBED TRUCK - CAB (DRIVING) - DAY

           Becca’s at the wheel driving, with Honey in the front cab. 
           They HIGH-FIVE each other -- victorious. Because...

           EXT. FLATBED TRUCK - STAGE (DRIVING) - DAY

           While Mr. X performs to his adoring fans, gliding through NYC 
           streets... We PAN DOWN BELOW -- TO THE TRUCK’S UNDERCARRIAGE.

           Where we see the HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF WEED packed in. Now 
           back in the hands of the High Queens. They pulled it off.

                                 RICH (PRE-LAP)
                        YOU-FUCKING-IDIOT!

           INT. RICH’S PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           LOUD GUNFIRE ERUPTS... as Rich plays FORTNITE, oblivious. 
           He’s taking fire, losing. He screams into his headset.

                                 RICH
                        On your left, you fucking inbred-

           YOU DIED __RICH-RULES89__ flashes on the screen. Rich hurtles 
           his controller at the wall, where it bursts apart.

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        MOTHERFUCKER!

           His BUTLER knocks, shows someone in. Rich looks up. Smiles

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        Well. Look what the cat dragged in. 

           ...It’s JASMINE! She can’t believe it’s come to this.

                                 JASMINE (PRE-LAP)
                        I’m here because I think we can 
                        help each other get what we want.
           INT. RICH’S PENTHOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Rich pulls out a bottle of Glenlivet -- pouring Jasmine and 
           himself a couple of fingers each.

                                 RICH
                        And what is it you want?

                                 JASMINE
                        For all this to end. For you to 
                        leave my family alone and give us 
                        protection from her new supplier.

                                 RICH
                        Trouble in the hen house?  

                                 JASMINE
                        Let’s just say Honey only ever 
                        looks out for herself. Time I 
                        started doing the same.

           Rich sits down next to Jasmine - fully engaged.

                                 RICH
                        See, all I ever wanted was to help 
                        all of you make money. Instead, 
                        Honey betrayed me, just like she 
                        did you. But you... you’ve always 
                        had a good mind for business...

           He strokes Jasmine’s hand as he pass her a drink. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        So what, pray tell, can you offer 
                        me for my protection?

                                 JASMINE
                        Her future. 

           Rich gives Jasmine a look -- go on. 

                                 JASMINE (CONT’D)
                        Honey will never give you her 
                        client list. Not while she thinks 
                        her business can still survive.

                                 RICH
                        And how do we take that away?

           Jasmine takes a long sip of her whiskey. Steeling herself. 

                                 JASMINE
                        We burn down her grow site.
           This - this Rich loves. He toasts to Jasmine.

                                 RICH
                        So tell me - where IS Barbie’s 
                        dream house?

           INT. UNDISCLOSED BUILDING - NIGHT

           Rich walks around Honey’s FULLY ERECT GROW-SITE. This is 
           Christmas come early for Rich -- pure joy. 

           He STRIKES A MATCH and throws it. Jasmine watches the flames 
           grow - her face illuminated by the blaze. Unreadable. 

           INT. HIGH QUEEN’S DISPATCH CENTER - NEXT NIGHT

           This place is on full tilt - Cash being dumped, cases being 
           refilled. Annie and Honey are counting the cash as fast as it 
           comes in. Their eye on the clock. Annie shakes her head.

                                 ANNIE
                        On the original timetable, we could 
                        have paid Dell, no problem. But 
                        doing it in 48 hours? Even with the 
                        party, we’ll still come up short- 

                                 HONEY
                        How short?

                                 ANNIE
                        A hundred thousand. And we only 
                        have two hours before Dell wants 
                        his money. Or...

           Annie trails off. Honey’s phone BUZZES. She ignores it.

                                 MICKEY
                        Maybe Dell will understand? 

           Honey shakes her head. Her PHONE BUZZES again. 

                                 HONEY
                        There’s only one thing Dell 
                        understands. Money.

                                 ANNIE
                        But... We don’t have it.

           It pains Honey to say this, but it’s their only option...

                                 HONEY
                        What’s the oldest form of money?
           Annie puzzles on this riddle for a second. Then, realizes:

                                 MICKEY
                        Property? No, you’re not going to 
                        give him the building?! That’s your 
                        dream. 

                                 HONEY
                        We’re my dream. We can bounce back 
                        from this. But what’s a future 
                        without each other? 

           Now she checks her phone. Immediately jumps up, RUSHING out--

           EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - NIGHT

           Honey pushes through a crowd of onlookers staring at the 
           BURNING BUILDING. FIREFIGHTERS working hard to put out the 
           flames when the building caves in on itself. 

           There’s no other way out now. Her dream burnt to the ground. 
           She dials a number, bracing herself--

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        Honey! What a pleasant surprise.

                                 HONEY
                        You win, Rich. I’ll sell you the 
                        client list. I want one hundred 
                        thousand and I want to meet in an 
                        hour. Just you and me, no one else. 

                                 RICH (O.S.)
                        Done.

                                 HONEY
                        I’ll text you an address. 

           She hangs up. Silhouetted against the burning building.

           INT. BECCA’S CAR (DRIVING) - SUNRISE

           Becca drives, Honey in the passenger side. FILE FOLDER with 
           the client list in her lap. Mickey and Annie ride in back. 
           All the girls together riding in complete silence. They watch 
           the sunrise above the East River as they speed along the FDR.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - SUNRISE

           Becca pulls to a stop, Honey gives her girls a nod. This is 
           the end, but no one wants to acknowledge that. 
           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Honey walks inside, alone, to find Rich inside, leaning on 
           his vintage Trans Am. Smug grin etched across his face.

                                 RICH
                        Honey, you look tired. Have you 
                        forgotten to moisturize daily?

           Honey is 100% over this shit. She hands him the client list.

                                 HONEY
                        Where’s the money, Rich?

           Rich pops the Trans Am TRUNK. Hefts a briefcase out.

                                 RICH
                        Right here sweetheart. But we’ve 
                        got some housekeeping to take care 
                        of first. Oh darling, could you 
                        come out for a second?

           Honey’s confusion turns to heartache when Jasmine gets out of 
           the Trans Am. Jasmine can’t meet Honey’s eye, traumatized. 

                                 HONEY
                        Jasmine?!? Why...

                                 JASMINE
                        You wouldn’t listen, Honey. You put 
                        my family in danger. You put us ALL 
                        in danger. And for what? 

           Rich gets close to Honey. Longing for her. Caressing her.

                                 RICH
                        All of this could have been avoided 
                        if you weren’t so stubborn, Honey. 
                        We could have ruled Manhattan 
                        together. A modern Alexander the 
                        Great and Cleopatra. 

           Honey laughs. Laughs and laughs. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        The fuck is so funny?

           She slams the list into Rich’s chest, reaches for the case - 

                                 HONEY
                        Alexander the Great died 300 years 
                        before Cleopatra was born, dipshit. 
                        You can’t even get your evil 
                        villain speeches right. 
           Rich snaps. Grabs Honey and points his 9MM GLOCK AT HER HEAD.

                                 JASMINE
                        You said no one would get hurt!

           He swings the gun at Jasmine, who flinches. Glares at Honey:

                                 RICH
                        You think you’re so special, so 
                        smart. But I took everything you 
                        had. And I’m not done yet. 

           Rich drags her towards his car, reaches for a GAS CAN inside. 

                                 RICH (CONT’D)
                        I burnt your little grow site 
                        downtown and now I’m gonna burn you-

                                 HONEY
                        What are you talking about? I don’t 
                        have a grow site downtown-

           Huh? What did Honey say?

                                 RICH
                        No you don’t- CAUSE I BURNT IT TO 
                        THE GROUND, YOU STUPID CUNT. 160 
                        South Street is closed for business-

                                 DELL (O.S.)
                        What did you fucking say?

           Rich turns to see Dell is here with his MEN, their shotguns 
           pointed at him. Rich is VERY confused.

                                 RICH
                        Dell?? What are you doing here?

                                 DELL
                        I’m here to meet her. To get my 
                        money. But forget that. What 
                        address did you burn to the ground? 

           Rich holds his gun up in the air -- trying to stay calm.

                                 RICH
                        160 South Street. This bitch was 
                        trying to go around us and set up 
                        her own grow site downtown.

           Dell looks like he could eat Rich up and spit him out.
                                 DELL
                        I can’t tell if you’re dumb or have 
                        a death wish - but you just burnt 
                        down MY GROW SITE you cocksucker.

           Rich blanches. Dell’s guys circle Rich, kick him to the 
           ground. Pages from Honey’s CLIENT LIST scattering around him.

                                 RICH
                        No. It’s her grow site - Jasmine 
                        tell them - it’s Honey’s.

           Dell reaches down, picks up a page from the LIST. All Non- 
           NYC address and weird LLC names. Dell can’t believe it.

                                 DELL
                        Then tell me, boyo, why do you have 
                        a list of my safehouse addresses?

                                 RICH
                        What? No, it’s Honey’s client list - 
                        she gave that to me-
                             (points to Jasmine)
                        WE HAD A DEAL!

           Jasmine is now standing next to Honey. We see them link 
           pinkies - their B.F.F Ritual.  All a part of their plan. 
           Honey grabs the BRIEFCASE with the 100k, tosses it to Dell.

                                 HONEY
                        Dell, here’s the first hundred 
                        thousand I owe you. And...

           Honey waves and Becca slowly drives the car inside. Mickey 
           gets out, pops the trunk- FILLED WITH CASH. 

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Here’s the rest as promised.

           Dell flips through the cash in the trunk. Satisfied. Dell’s 
           guys circling Rich, who’s starting to really, truly panic.

                                 DELL
                        Know what this looks like to me, 
                        Rich? You got high on your own 
                        supply, started taking out your 
                        local competition and were planning 
                        on coming after ol’ Dell next. That 
                        sound about right, ladies?

           Honey, Mickey and Jasmine nod. Sounds about right.
                                 RICH
                        They’re so clearly lying. Dell, 
                        I’ve done good by you. You can’t 
                        believe those bitches over me.

                                 DELL
                        Well... This seems like one of 
                        those “He said, She said” 
                        situations. Maybe it’s just the 
                        times we’re living in, but I’m 
                        gonna believe the lady on this one. 
                             (then)
                        Besides, I like dealing with her a 
                        lot better than dealing with you.

           Rich is dragged off by Dell’s men, screaming the whole way.

                                 RICH
                        LET GO OF ME - DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA 
                        WHO MY FATHER IS?! IF YOU LAY ONE 
                        MORE FUCKING HAND ON ME, I’LL HAVE-

           Dell hands Honey the Queens’ address list. Tips his hat.

                                 DELL
                        Ladies, been a pleasure doing 
                        business. 

           And like that’s he gone. It’s over. 

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - STATEN ISLAND - WATERFRONT - SUNRISE

           Our Queens reunited. They hold each other. Honey pulls out a 
           lighter. BURNING the folder with the addresses.

                                 BECCA
                        So... Can someone explain to me 
                        what the hell is going on? 

                                 HONEY
                        Jasmine was working for us the 
                        whole time.

                                 MICKEY
                        And our grow-site?

                                 JASMINE
                        The real one? It’s perfectly safe.

           The girls sigh. Relieved. 
                                 MICKEY
                        But how did you know about Dell’s 
                        stash houses? 

                                 HONEY
                        I knew that a guy raking in several 
                        million dollars a year would need a 
                        shell company to run it through. So 
                        Montana followed the money with 
                        Annie’s help and Derek’s software. 
                        We just needed the name. 
                             (off her look)
                        They were held under his wife’s pet 
                        name for him - Skipper Green.

           FLASHBACK: Honey first meeting with Dell - when she borrowed 
           his lighter. It’s engraved: To my Love, Dell “Skipper” Green.

                                 HONEY (CONT’D)
                        Figured the guy was sentimental. 
                        Most criminals are. 

                                 JASMINE
                        Spoken like a truly sentimental 
                        criminal. 

           The girls second that - relieved it’s all over... A ROAR 
           rising on our soundtrack, louder and louder until we CUT TO:

           A SUBWAY CAR FLASHING BY. Sparks flying. From the bowels of 
           the subway tracks we rise up to the street to find - 

           EXT. CHELSEA STREET - DAY

           Honey walks down the chic neighborhood of HIGH-END ART 
           GALLERIES and BOUTIQUES. CHYRON: One Year Later

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        Tell me what you see. 

           Waves hello to the local florist, passing neighbors, friends. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        A friendly neighbor, a happy 
                        family? Prestige, culture, class?

           She’s a fixture in the community. People wave happily back.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        People don’t look too closely at 
                        pretty things. 

           We follow Honey up stairs to a TOWNHOUSE and into--
           INT. THREE STORY TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           A chic space. Finely decorated to Honey’s taste. Honey sorts 
           through her mail - stops on the POWER BILL. Rips it open.

           We turn away from Honey to reveal: ALL THE QUEENS working 
           together in a FULLY OPERATIONAL HYDROPONIC WEED FARM - and 
           you guessed it - siphoning power from the SUBWAY GRID below. 

           Honey checks the high-tech voltage meter on the wall against 
           her very average power bill. She smiles, pleased.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        But we’ve always known what we are.

           Honey puts the finishing touches on WEED PATENTS for her 
           signature strains. Preparing for the future. She passes the 
           documents off to a PREGNANT Annie, ring on her finger. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        A family first, an empire second.

           Annie hands Honey PLANE TICKETS and an INVITE with the CHANEL 
           LOGO. Mickey & Jasmine walk over with suitcases ready to go.

           EXT. THREE STORY TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           Honey, Mickey, and Jasmine are the coolest, most bad-ass 
           chicks in NYC - a private town car awaiting them outside.

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        So you might see a model, a writer, 
                        and an artist - But what I see? 
                        Strong, powerful, and independent 
                        women who can run their own shit. 

           PAULIE steps out of the car, opens the door for them. They 
           get in - off to expand their empire. 

                                 HONEY (V.O.)
                        I see High Queens.

           We pan up into the skyline as Beyonce’s RUN THE WORLD rises: 
           Girls, we run this motha, yeah/Who run the world? GIRLS!
