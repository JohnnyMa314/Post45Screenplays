           FADE IN:

           On a LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL PLAYER at the plate, gripping
           his bat tightly. Fear in his young eyes. This is ANDY
           CAMPBELL (9) and it's the biggest moment of his life.

           We pull back to reveal --

           EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND -- DAY

           A field of players. BASES LOADED. The SCOREBOARD reads
           "Away: 6  Home: 5" in the bottom of the NINTH INNING. TWO
           OUTS and a FULL COUNT. BLEACHERS FULL OF PARENTS watching.

           Andy takes a deep breath. The PITCHER stares him down with
           his best nine-year-old game face. Throws the pitch --

           CRACK! Andy's eyes light up as he sends the ball soaring
           into the outfield. IT'S OUTTA HERE! The CROWD EXPLODES as
           Andy runs the bases with jubilation.

           He crosses home and is hoisted onto the shoulders of his
           teammates. A moment you remember till your dying day.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        You know those 'what if' moments...

           WE CUT BACK TO --

           Andy at bat with the same fear. Here comes the pitch. But
           this time, HE DOESN'T SWING. Just watches it go by, frozen.

                                 UMPIRE
                        Strike three!

           The crowd explodes, cheering for the other team who now
           celebrates, HOISTING THE PITCHER UP ON THEIR SHOULDERS.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        It's fair to say I've had a few.

           Andy walks towards the dugout, head hung low. A moment that
           scars you for life. His angry TEAMMATES there to greet him.

                                 TEAMMATES
                        You couldn't even swing? / What a
                        little bitch! / You cost us the whole
                        season, Andy!

           Andy flops down on the bench, tears filling his eyes.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        I mean, what if I'd grounded out? At
                        least that'd be respectful. Or what
                        if I'd gotten beamed in the face?
                        Sure, I'd have a bloody nose or a
                        fractured eye socket, but hey, at
                        least we would've won. 
           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- EVENING

           A dejected Andy and his mom, DAWN (late 30s), walk towards
           an AGING ROADSIDE DINER, a few cars parked outside. A
           glowing neon sign proclaims --

                              HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- EVENING

           A place from a bygone era. White counters. Red stools.
           Vintage neon signs. You can practically smell the grease,
           and it smells damn good. A jukebox plays a CLASSIC OLDIE.
           Only A COUPLE OF CUSTOMERS, and this is a good day.

           Andy sits drinking a ROOT BEER FLOAT, the perfect cure for a
           shitty day. But he stops mid-slurp as he sees --

           A young girl named PIPER FLYNN (9) eating a burger with her
           parents, talking with her hands in a big way as she speaks.
           Her laugh is infectious and carefree. She notices Andy
           staring and waves at him with a sweet smile.

           He waves back, sipping his float, dumbstruck.

           But the mug slips out of his fingers and he SPILLS HIS FLOAT
           ALL OVER THE TABLE. He curses under his breath, mortified as
           his mom helps him clean up the mess.

           Piper grabs some napkins and brings them over. Andy takes
           them from her and THEIR EYES MEET, a foam mustache still on
           his face. And just that fast, he's in love.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        I think about a lot of what if's...
                        But the biggest one is what if I'd
                        never met Piper Flynn that day?

           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM -- DAY 

           Andy and Piper sit on the floor, COMICS strewn around them.
           Piper reads one out loud, acting out all the parts in a
           silly way as Andy watches, enraptured.

           INT. KITCHEN, ANDY'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Piper and Andy bake cookies together, creating an epic mess.

                                 PIPER
                        And our restaurant will have big
                        comfy chairs, and board games, and
                        only serve hot dogs and mac n cheese.

                                 ANDY
                        What about pizza?

                                 PIPER
                        Okay, pizza too. And ice cream.
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY

           As a TEACHER drones on, Andy sketches a COMIC BOOK SCENE OF
           HIM AND PIPER IN SPACESUITS KICKING ALIEN ASS. Piper glances
           over and Andy quickly hides it. He thinks about it for a
           moment, and then passes it over to her.

           Piper looks at it, then smiles at him and sticks it into the
           cover of her notebook. He smiles back proudly.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        When you think about it, every little
                        what if, every little decision, can
                        alter the course of your entire life.

           WE CUT BACK TO -- Andy still sketching the comic book scene.
           Piper glances over and he hides it.

           But this time HE DOESN'T GIVE IT TO HER.

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Andy, Piper, and a GROUP OF OTHER KIDS run away, scattering
           around the property, hiding in different places.

                                 (
                                 SEEKER
                                  eyes closed
                                            )
                        Eight... Nine... Ten!

           Andy climbs a tree, reaching a high branch, the dense leaves
           obscuring him. Only to realize Piper is hiding there too.

                                 ANDY
                        Can I hide with you?

                                 PIPER
                        Shh...

           She points down below as the Seeker jogs by. Once he's gone,
           they let out their breath, laughing quietly. They're looking
           right into each other's eyes now. Piper illuminated by the
           moon's glow streaming through the leaves.

           And in that moment, ANDY KISSES HER. A childish innocent
           peck. When he opens his eyes, Piper is smiling at him.

           WE CUT BACK TO --

                                 ANDY
                        Can I hide with you?

                                 PIPER
                        Shh...

           Once again, they wait quietly as the Seeker jogs past.
           Again, they let out their breath and their eyes meet.

           Only this time, Andy freezes. Then looks away, missing his
           chance. Piper watches him, then turns away too.
                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        Every little decision...

           We MATCH CUT ON ANDY'S FACE to --

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

           ANDY (17) walks through the hall of a small town high
           school, just another face in the crowd.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        I mean, we've all been there, right?
                        We've all had what if's. And they
                        suck.

           He passes PIPER (17) walking amidst the popular crowd. She
           still has that same carefree laugh. That same genuine smile.
           Only she's holding hands with BRAD (17), who seems to have
           all the natural confidence Andy lacks.

           Andy makes eye contact with Piper as she passes. But all he
           gets in return is a polite smile.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        Because you know if you had just
                        swung that bat, if you had just
                        kissed that girl, your life would be
                        completely different...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. FOODLAND GROCERY STORE -- DAY

           A chain grocery store. Andy and KYLE (17) stack SODA CASES.
           Kyle may be fun to hang out with, but he's definitely a lifer
           in this job. Andy stands on a ladder as Kyle hands him cases.

                                 KYLE
                        I think one on one, the Mountain
                        takes them all. Easy.

                                 ANDY
                        I don't know man, I really think Snow
                        would have a chance.

                                 KYLE
                        Wait, are we talking pre-op or post-
                        op Mountain?

                                 ANDY
                        I was thinking freakish Mountain and
                        reincarnated John. You know, make it
                        fair.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, well if you're giving them both
                        their super powers and shit, then
                        maybe Snow would have a chance.
                                 DARRYL (O.S.)
                        What the hell are you doing?!

           Andy looks over to see their manager, DARRYL (20s), a guy
           who went straight from high school to nowhere.

                                 DARRYL
                        I said re-stock the soda display, not
                        make... Whatever the hell that is.

           Only now do we reveal that Andy has made an EPIC, LO-FI
           JACK-O-LANTERN IMAGE out of the STACKED SODA CASES.

                                 ANDY
                        You said to make it festive.

                                 DARRYL
                        Customers don't want to think,
                        customers want to buy shit and leave.
                        How the hell are they supposed to buy
                        a Coke Zero if it's buried under a
                        dozen Slice boxes?

           Andy and Kyle shrug. Who cares. It's awesome.

                                 DARRYL
                        Take it down. Now!

           He walks off. Kyle looks up to Andy.

                                 KYLE
                        Sorry man. Assholes don't recognize
                        artistic genius till after you're
                        dead.

           They begin taking down the display case by case.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SUTTON -- EVENING

           Andy steps out of the store and heads down main street, if
           you can call it that.

           The town is ONE BLOCK LONG and closed up for the night.
           There's "Miller's Guns." "Top Shelf Liquor." "Liquor and
           More" right across the street. A gas station. A boarded up
           bowling alley. A dumpy cafe called "Mindy's," the only
           restaurant in town. And an old single screen movie theater,
           its marquee reading, "Spider-Man 7: The Revenge." 

           And that's about it. A dead town you dream of escaping. A
           weathered sign reads, "WELCOME TO SUTTON. POPULATION: 988."

           EXT. RURAL ROAD -- NIGHT

           Andy walks down the lonely road past the tall trees and
           rolling hills. The middle of nowhere.

           He passes HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS, the only sign of
           life out here. Andy doesn't glance up from his phone.
           In the parking lot by the diner, A PERSON SUDDENLY APPEARS
           OUT OF THIN AIR. He glances around for a moment, then walks
           inside. But Andy is too engrossed in his feed to notice.

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Andy walks up to his family's house out in the country. Lawn
           overgrown. Flaking paint. Not a place that feels very homey.

           INT. ANDY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Andy steps inside the disorganized and cluttered space. A
           terrible INFOMERCIAL plays on TV. Andy's dad, CHARLIE (40s),
           snores on the recliner, looking disheveled. There's a 12-
           pack of cheap beer next to him, mostly empty. One still in
           his dad's hand, spilling out over his chest.

                                 ANDY
                        Dad. Dad.

           Charlie stirs with a groan.

                                 ANDY
                        Shouldn't you be at work?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don't work there anymore. Kevin
                        thought it was in the company's "best
                        interest" to let me go.

                                 ANDY
                        Just like that, huh?

           He doesn't believe it for a second. Charlie sighs.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He claimed I was drinking on the job.
                        But I wasn't. 

                                 ANDY
                        You weren't?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Naw. Well, I mean, not really. Not
                        often. Who cares if I drink if those
                        engines get fixed. His loss.

           Charlie realizes he still has a beer in his hand and takes a
           swig. Andy begins picking up the empty cans from the floor.

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Andy carries a garbage bag outside, empty beer cans clinking
           within. Drops it into the trash can.

           He glances up to the night sky. But it's overcast, no stars
           peeking through the clouds. Nothing to wish upon tonight. 
           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           The walls are covered with ORIGINAL DRAWINGS of alien worlds
           and fantastical creatures. Bookshelves filled with SCI-FI
           AND FANTASY NOVELS and COMICS. A teenager who'd rather live
           in his imagination than reality.

           Andy sits at his desk, illuminated by the glow of the tablet
           that he is drawing on with a stylus.

           It's HIS OWN COMIC BOOK, featuring a teenage boy fighting
           robots on a far off world. Andy's talent is clear. He may
           not be a pro, but with some training, he could be.

           Andy flips to the cover of his comic: THE UNFATHOMABLE
           ADVENTURES OF AARON ANDERS. It looks pretty damn cool.

           But his eyes judge his work far too harshly. He turns off
           his tablet. Hesitates.

           Then opens the top desk drawer and peers inside.

           Nestled amongst the items is a FRAMED PHOTO OF ANDY AND HIS
           MOM FROM WHEN HE WAS A KID (9). They're smiling elatedly,
           riding a ROLLER COASTER together at an amusement park.

           Now we get a good look at her. A woman full of love, with a
           smile that says she's an awesome mom. Or she was.

           Andy stares into the image from his past... When things were
           so much better.

           Then he closes the drawer.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD -- EVENING

           Andy walks home after another long day.

           A car turns off the road in front of him, drawing his
           attention as it pulls into the parking lot of --

           HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS.

           Andy stops and stares, eyeing the "All-Night" on the glowing
           neon sign, considering. 

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- EVENING

           The bell on the door rings as Andy walks in. It looks the
           same as it did when he was a kid. Timeless and nostalgic. 

           Andy takes a seat at the counter, glancing at the menu.
           Double Cheeseburgers. Chili Fries. Root Beer Floats. Apple
           Pie. Yeah, we're getting hungry too.

           He eyes the table where Piper once sat. It's occupied by
           another couple now. Only a few other patrons throughout.

           HARRY (60s) emerges from the kitchen, wearing a red pinstripe
           apron and white hat. A guy from an era when men were men.
           He's rough around the edges, but if you want good advice,
           he's better than any bartender.

           He carries four plates of food, which he sets down at
           various tables. Quickly grabs a pot of coffee and refills
           someone's cup. Hurries back into the kitchen as smoke starts
           rising from the griddle. A one man whirlwind.

           He emerges again, toweling his hands as he approaches Andy.

                                 HARRY
                        What can I get ya, kid? Looks like
                        you had a day.

                                 ANDY
                        I'll have a root beer float and a job
                        application.

           Andy folds up the menu and slides it back in place, trying
           to be smooth. Harry is unimpressed. 

                                 HARRY
                        Nice try kid, but we're all staffed
                        up.

                                 ANDY
                                 (
                                             )
                                  looks around
                        You're the only one here.

                                 HARRY
                        Like I said, we're all staffed up. But
                        tell ya what, I'll get ya that float
                        faster than you can say ice cream.

           He grabs a frosted mug and starts filling it up.

                                 ANDY
                        What about nights?

                                 HARRY
                        What about nights?

                                 ANDY
                        I already have a day job after
                        school, so I'm interested in nights.
                        It is all-night hamburgers, right?

                                 HARRY
                        I work nights, and I work them alone.

                                 ANDY
                        I'll do everything you don't want to
                        do. Wash the dishes, take out the
                        trash, whatever.

                                 HARRY
                        Kid, you couldn't handle the night
                        shift.

           Huh? What does that mean? 
                                 HARRY
                        You know, when I was your age, I was
                        road tripping across the country and
                        chasing girls. Catching some of them
                        too. You're a young guy, no reason to
                        hang around an old joint like this. 

                                 ANDY
                        Just give me an interview.

                                 HARRY
                        That was your interview. Look kid,
                        every time I hire someone for nights,
                        it doesn't end well. They always wind
                        up leaving. Not worth the trouble.
                        Trust me, I'm doing you a favor.
                        Enjoy your float.

           He sets down the root beer float and heads off to fill up
           someone's coffee. Andy sinks in his seat. But as he looks
           down at the float, he remembers something...

                                 ANDY
                        Hey Harry!

           Harry begrudgingly turns back.

                                 ANDY
                        Do you remember the first time I came
                        in here?

                                 HARRY
                        A lot of people come in here.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, I remember. I had just struck
                        out three times in my little league
                        championship game. Then my mom
                        brought me here and got me a root
                        beer float. I still sucked at
                        baseball, but all in all, it wasn't
                        such a bad day. So I figure, this
                        could be a pretty cool place to work,
                        because I don't know if you realize
                        it, but you're selling a lot more
                        than just burgers here.  
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Plus, my dad's between jobs, so
                        someone's gotta cover the bills for a
                        few months, and this is the only
                        place I can walk to in less than an
                        hour.

                                 HARRY
                        I hate sob stories.

                                 ANDY
                        So do I. But I need this job. And you
                        may not want to admit it, but I know
                        you could use a hand around here.
           Harry studies him. Gears turning.

                                 HARRY
                        Alright, kid.

           Andy's eyes widen, hardly believing it.

                                 HARRY
                        Shift is from ten PM to six AM.
                        Minimum wage and no benefits, aside
                        from the best damn burgers you'll
                        ever eat. But one customer complains,
                        one customer stiffs you for the
                        check, and you’re out. Got it?

                                 ANDY
                        You're not gonna regret this, Harry!

                                 HARRY
                        I'm already regretting it. You free
                        to start tonight? 

           INT. KITCHEN, HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Steam bursts out of an industrial dish washer as the doors
           rise. Harry's hand on the handle. Andy follows him through
           the kitchen that hasn't been updated in decades. A burger is
           a burger, then and now.

                                 HARRY
                        Orders come in there, go out there.
                        Dirty dishes go here, clean ones go
                        there. Then the cycle repeats itself.
                        You know, rocket science stuff.

                                 ANDY
                        Got it.

                                 HARRY
                        I like to keep the place clean, so if
                        you ain't serving, you damn sure
                        better be cleaning. Toilet flushes
                        like a champ but it sure don't clean
                        itself.

                                 ANDY
                        Got it. 

           Harry turns to him, very serious. 

                                 HARRY
                        Now listen... We get a lotta funny
                        people in here late at night. But
                        they're good customers, so just take
                        their orders and bring their food.
                        Don't bother 'em.

           Not quite sure what that means, but Andy nods.
                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, no problem.

                                 HARRY
                        I ain't messing around here, kid. Now
                        I'm gonna repeat myself just this once
                        'cause it's really important. Do-not-
                        bother-the-customers. Don't look at
                        'em funny. Don't tweet or bleep or
                        instagrain or whatever the hell it is
                        you lonely teens do these days. And
                        don't ask 'em questions, unless it's
                        'What can I get ya?' or 'Would you
                        like fries with that?'

                                 ANDY
                        I got it. 

                                 HARRY
                        Good.

           He hands Andy a red pinstripe apron and matching hat.

                                 HARRY
                        Now put these on and look like a man.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           TWO TRUCKERS get up from their booth. Andy cleans up their
           plates, looking straight out of the 1950s in his uniform.

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks, have a great night.

           They grunt in response. The bell dings and Andy looks over.

           Piper just walked in the door. Oh shit.

                                 ANDY
                        Hi.

                                 PIPER
                        Hey, I thought you worked at
                        Foodland.

                                 ANDY
                        I do. I mean, I just picked this up
                        to get some extra cash. For like,
                        concerts and stuff.

                                 PIPER
                        Cool.

           Andy smiles. An awkward moment.

                                 PIPER
                        Can I get a table?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. Of course. Anywhere you like.
           Piper sits at a booth. Andy gets her a menu, fills up her
           water glass, nervousness in his actions. 

                                 PIPER
                        So one more year, huh.

                                 ANDY
                        One more year?

                                 PIPER
                        Till we can get out of this town.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. I guess so. You got a
                        destination in mind?

                                 PIPER
                        Chicago hopefully. They've got this
                        amazing culinary school, but it's
                        super competitive, so I probably
                        won't get in.

                                 ANDY
                        Are you kidding? There's no way
                        they'll reject you. Your Christmas
                        cookies are the best I've ever had.

                                 PIPER
                                 (
                                  laughs
                                       )
                        Andy, we were like, nine.

                                 ANDY
                        Doesn't matter. A great chef is a
                        great chef. So you actually gonna
                        open that restaurant? With the big
                        comfy chairs and board games and mac
                        n cheese.

                                 PIPER
                        And pizza. 
                                 (
                                  smiles
                                       )
                        I'm thinking about calling it the
                        Cat's in the Cradle. You know, like
                        the song. What do you think?

                                 ANDY
                        I think I'll be your first customer.

           She smiles, genuinely touched.

                                 PIPER
                        Thanks, Andy.

           He smiles back. Wanting to say so much more.

                                 PIPER
                        Hey listen, I'm sorry we haven't hung
                        out lately. It's just, you know --
           The bell on the door DINGS as Brad and some FRIENDS walk in
           with raucous chatter and laughs, breaking the moment.

                                 BRAD
                        What's up honey. Campbell! Didn't
                        know you worked at this shithole.
                        Bring us some fries and Cokes, huh?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. Coming right up.

           He walks off as Brad and the others sit.

           Andy watches from afar as he gets their drinks. Piper and
           Brad laughing, flirting. The sad part is, she looks happy.
           He may as well be invisible again.

           He looks away, focusing on his work.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- LATER

           The clock on the wall reads 1:57. The place is deserted.
           Piper and her friends long gone.

           Andy sits alone at the counter with a burger, fries, and
           root beer float.

           He pulls out his phone and opens Facebook. Scrolls through
           his photos, until he comes to an OLD PICTURE OF HIM AND
           PIPER AS KIDS, smiling with their root beer floats in the
           diner. Tagged with "#TBT!"

           Andy stares at it, though it only makes him feel worse.

           DING! The bell on the door jars his attention. Andy quickly
           puts away his phone and gets up --

           And freezes on sight of the person who just walked in.

           It's a SHORT GUY zipped up in a REFLECTIVE SILVER HEAVY
           WINTER COAT, THICK GLOVES, and SNOW PANTS. He pulls down his
           hood, causing ice to fall out of it, revealing FROSTED
           GOGGLES like he's fresh out of a blizzard.

           Andy stares. What. The. Hell.

                                 BLIZZARD GUY
                        Tab-le for une.

           His accent is thick and hard to place. Maybe Russian?

                                 ANDY
                        Uh, wherever you'd like.

           Andy gestures to the wide open diner. Blizzard Guy looks
           around. Then walks all the way to the furthest corner booth.

                                 (
                                  sotto
                                 ANDY
                                 )
                        Oooo-kay...
           Blizzard Guy examines the menu like it's a foreign
           transcript. Andy approaches with his best friendly smile.

                                 ANDY
                        What can I get ya?

                                 BLIZZARD GUY
                                 (
                                  points to menu
                                               )
                        Vhat is dis ting?

           Andy glances where he's pointing. Seriously?

                                 ANDY
                        That's a... A hamburger.

           Blizzard Guy grunts, not pleased.

                                 BLIZZARD GUY
                        You ave frazbursnakles?

                                 ANDY
                        I'm sorry, what?

                                 BLIZZARD GUY
                        Frazbursnakle. If no, I ave twigler
                        wit cheeze.

                                 ANDY
                        Uh... Let me check with the manager.

           KITCHEN

           Andy steps in. Harry is cleaning the grill.

                                 ANDY
                        Do you make a Frazbur... Something?

                                 HARRY
                        Frazbursnakle? Yeah, I can make that.

           Andy waits for an explanation. But Harry offers none. 

           DINER

           Andy heads back to Blizzard Guy's table, who is eyeing a
           straw with extreme curiosity.

                                 ANDY
                        It'll be coming right out, sir.

                                 BLIZZARD GUY
                        I pay now. Money may no be good.

           He sets down a handful of HEXAGON SHAPED BRONZE COINS. Andy
           picks one up, eyeing the medieval castle etching. Huh?

                                 ANDY
                        I'll check with the manager...
           KITCHEN

           Andy steps back in. Harry is making what looks like a stir-
           fry of beef and fries wrapped in a pancake. A Frazbursnakle?

                                 ANDY
                        Hey, do you take money from --
                                 (
                                  checks coins
                                             )
                        The Republic of Marovia?

                                 HARRY
                        Yeah, I can change that.

           Harry takes the coins. Opens a CASH BOX sitting on a nearby
           shelf. Rifles around inside it, then pulls out a few similar
           coins and hands them back like it's nothing.

                                 ANDY
                        Where's the Republic of Marovia?

                                 HARRY
                        Wherever he's from.

           Harry slides him the plated frazbursnakle.

           DINER

           Andy carries the dish out, still trying to process. He sets
           it down along with the change. Blizzard Guy is elated.

                                 BLIZZARD GUY
                        Ah, my gratude!

           The bell on the front door dings again. Andy casually turns.

           And his jaw nearly hits the floor.

           THREE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN (early 20s) stroll in, wearing jeans
           and open leather jackets, bare skin showing beneath. 

                                 (
                                               )
                                 WOMAN
                                  British Accent
                        Should we just sit anywhere?

           Andy stumbles, gawking.

                                 ANDY
                        Sure.

           They head to the counter, CASUALLY TAKING OFF THEIR JACKETS,
           REVEALING THEIR BARE BREASTS like it's any other Tuesday.
           Okay, maybe we don't see their breasts, but Andy sure does.
           And he looks like a kid who has never seen a pair outside of
           his computer screen. Let alone three pairs.

                                 TOPLESS WOMAN
                        We're ready if you are.

           Andy walks over, unblinking, trying to act natural. Pulls
           out his order pad and pen, hands trembling.
                                 ANDY
                        Hi, umm... What can I get you?

                                 TOPLESS WOMAN
                        I have a question. What exactly is a
                        bay-nay-nay split?

                                 ANDY
                        It's, uh, a banana... That's split.
                        With ice cream. And whipped cream.

                                 TOPLESS WOMAN
                        But what's a bay-nay-nay?

                                 ANDY
                        It's... A fruit. You know, kinda...

           Andy awkwardly gestures in the air. The women stare. He
           moves down the counter and pulls a banana out of a cabinet.

                                 ANDY
                        You know, a banana.

           The women exchange baffled expressions.

                                 TOPLESS WOMAN
                        This place is so weird.

           KITCHEN

           Andy dashes in. Harry is filling condiment bottles.

                                 ANDY
                        There are three naked women out
                        there! I mean, not full naked, but
                        you know, top-half naked.

                                 HARRY
                        What's the matter, kid? Never seen
                        nipples before?
                                 (glances at Andy)
                        Huh, guess you probably haven't.

           Andy just stares, flabbergasted.

                                 HARRY
                        I told ya, kid, we get some funny
                        ones in here late at night. Just take
                        their orders and bring their food.

           Andy manages a small nod and heads back out.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- LATER

           THE PLACE IS FULL NOW and bristling with energy like it's
           happy hour. A classic oldie plays from the jukebox. Andy
           juggles plates, trying to keep it together as he passes --

           A table of women in SPANDEX BODY SUITS WITH FLOOR-LENGTH
           MULTICOLORED HAIR.
           A group of men in shirts and ties EATING THEIR BURGERS USING
           ONLY THEIR MOUTHS. A couple SPEAKING A LANGUAGE THAT SOUNDS
           LIKE GIBBERISH. A STEAMPUNK ZEPPELIN PILOT who cuts his
           fries with a fork.

           Andy tries not to gawk. Tries to keep focused. He sets a
           milkshake by a STONER DUDE, who takes a sip.

                                 STONER DUDE
                        Dude... This is so dizzy...

                                 ANDY
                        Excuse me?

                                 STONER DUDE
                        It's dizzy, man...

           Before Andy can ask what that means --

                                 TATTOO GIRL
                        Hey waitperson!

           Andy turns to a GIRL WITH ELABORATE FACIAL TATTOOS.

                                 TATTOO GIRL
                        Can you play the Heebie-Jeebies?

                                 ANDY
                        The who?

                                 TATTOO GIRL
                        You know, the Heebie-Jeebies!

           Andy hurries to the JUKEBOX. Scrolls past bands he's never
           heard of. "The Warlocks." "Wicked Lester." "The Silver
           Beatles" who look strikingly similar to The Beatles.

                                 ANDY
                        What the hell...

           He comes to a group with facial tattoos. THE HEEBIE-JEEBIES.
           Hits play. A song comes on that feels like a zanier version
           of 50s rock 'n roll. Tattoo Girl and several others cheer
           and sing along. Andy shakes his head. What is going on?

           A DING from the door makes Andy turn. It's a guy in a HAZMAT
           SUIT. He pulls off his helmet and looks around with wonder.

                                 HAZMAT SUIT
                        There are women here...

           He hurries down the counter and sits next to a GOTH GIRL.

                                 HAZMAT SUIT
                        We have to procreate! Now!

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Nah, I'm good, thanks.
                                 HAZMAT SUIT
                        Woman, please! For the future of
                        humanity, we must!

           Goth Girl just rolls her eyes and dips another fry.

           Before Andy can react, an ADORABLE OLD MAN (80s) comes up,
           pointing to his menu excitedly.

                                 ADORABLE OLD MAN
                        Good savior on high, is this red
                        thing what I think it is?!

                                 ANDY
                        A cherry?

                                 ADORABLE OLD MAN
                        You still grow fruit here! Real
                        fruit!

                                 HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY (O.S.)
                        Hey servant!

           Andy rushes over to a GUY IN A GAUDY HAWAIIAN SHIRT (40s).

                                 HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY
                        Okay, before I drop any cash, I've
                        got three questions for you. First
                        off, are we at war with anyone?

                                 ANDY
                        I don't think so...

                                 HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY
                        Are humans the top of the food chain?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah?

                                 HAWAIIAN SHIRT GUY
                        And who is the leader of this nation?

                                 ANDY
                        Uh, Donald Trump?

           Hawaiian Shirt Guy stares. Then sets his menu down and WALKS
           OUT THE DOOR. Andy is stupefied.

           A MAN walks by in an ELECTRIC BLUE VEST with wires sticking
           out, MEDIEVAL TIGHTS, and a rather significant CODPIECE.

                                 MODERN MEDIEVAL MAN
                        Three cheers for the great bargla!

           Andy notices he left his matching BLUE HAT on the table.

                                 ANDY
                        Sir, you forgot your hat!
           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy runs out with the hat, only to see the man driving away
           in his JUNKER OF A CAR, BLASTING BIZARRE HARMONIC MUSIC.

                                 ANDY
                        Sir, wait! You forgot your --

           THE CAR VANISHES INTO THIN AIR.

           Andy is left jaw dropped. That didn't just happen...

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy steps back inside, in a daze.

                                 CELL PHONE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Oh my God, she's so cute!

           A GROUP OF GIRLS ogle one of their phones. Andy DOUBLE
           TAKES, staring at the screen, not believing his eyes --

           It's a video of one of the girls playing with a BABY
           STEGOSAURUS as if it was a puppy.

                                 CELL PHONE GIRL 2
                        That's the most adorbs diny I've ever
                        seen!

           KITCHEN

           Andy flies in. Harry's making a sundae with extra cherries.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, what the hell is going on?!

                                 HARRY
                        Just take their orders and bring
                        their food, just like I told ya.

                                 ANDY
                        It's kinda hard to take their orders
                        and bring their food when they're
                        disappearing into thin air and
                        exchanging videos of their pet
                        dinosaur! Which looked awfully real I
                        might add! I mean, what in the world
                        is going on with these people?!

                                 HARRY
                        I'll tell you after you've worked
                        here a month. Think of it as your
                        benefits kicking in.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, if that's how you want to play
                        it, I'll make you a deal. If you tell
                        me what's going on right now, I swear
                        I won't tell a soul.

                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                        But if you don't, I'm gonna Instagram
                        the shit out of this place. And then
                        you're gonna have to deal with a lot
                        more questions.

                                 HARRY
                        Can't tell ya, kid. You're not ready.

           Andy meets his stern gaze. Then pulls out his phone and
           snaps a photo of the strange looking food on the counter.

                                 HARRY
                        What are you doing with that thing?

           Andy turns to the dining area, snapping more photos.

           Harry tries to grab his phone.

                                 HARRY
                        Wait! Don't do that! Stop! Stop!!
                        Alright, fine! I'll tell ya, but
                        don't say I didn't warn you. God damn
                        Millennials...

           He lets out an exasperated sigh.

                                 HARRY
                        Okay. All them people out there are
                        just people, no different than you or
                        me. They're even from around here. 
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        You know... Just not here, here.

                                 ANDY
                        You mean, they're like... Time
                        travelers?

                                 HARRY
                        Don't be a moron. Time travelers go
                        forward and back, that's make believe
                        shit, everybody knows that. These
                        folks go side to side.

           Andy stares. What did he just say? Harry sees the look on
           his face and sighs, annoyed. Puts a burger on the grill.

                                 HARRY
                        Okay, let's say this burger here is
                        our universe.

                                 ANDY
                        Our universe?
                                 HARRY
                                 (
                                  puts on another burger
                                                       )
                        And this other burger is another
                        universe. Maybe one where women don't
                        wear shirts or disco never died.
                                 (
                                  puts on more burgers
                                                     )
                        And all these burgers are more
                        universes. Maybe in one Gore beat
                        Bush for real, or Elvis is still
                        alive, or Napoleon didn't lose at
                        Waterloo. You get the idea.
                                 (
                                  puts a pickle on a burger
                                                         )
                        Now let's say this pickle here is a
                        traveler, meaning he's in the know,
                        and he's feeling adventurous. So he
                        jumps to another universe --

           He tosses the pickle onto a different burger.

                                 HARRY
                        And another universe. And another.
                        And so on and so forth with more
                        pickles and a lot more burgers.

           Harry keeps moving the pickle to different burgers.

                                 ANDY
                        But... How many universes are there?

                                 HARRY
                        How would I know, kid? I just make
                        the burgers.

                                 ANDY
                        But... This doesn't make any sense...
                        How does no one know about this?!

                                 HARRY
                        What's there to know? Funny people
                        come into diners at four in the
                        morning. Everyone knows that.

                                 ANDY
                        But what are they doing here?

                                 HARRY
                        Maybe they just like my burgers.
                                 (
                                  off Andy's look
                                                )
                        Okay, turns out there's some funny
                        business with the Earth's magnetic
                        fields that I'm told only allows
                        people to jump universes in a few
                        spots around the world. One of the
                        spots happens to be right here, where
                        I happened to build my diner. Next
                        nearest spot is a coffee shop in
                        Montana, but I hear the owner is a
                        real dick. There's also one in Tokyo,
                        which pretty much explains Japan.

                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        I don't know how it works at all the
                        other places, but here, folks can
                        come in late at night, have a burger,
                        pay with whatever they got, and be on
                        their way without anyone like you
                        judging them for lookin' funny.

                                 ANDY
                        You're telling me that Harry's All-
                        Night Hamburgers is... A hangout for
                        parallel universe travelers?

                                 HARRY
                        Hangout, rest stop, airport, burger
                        haven. We're kinda a one-stop shop.

           Andy's head might explode.

                                 HARRY
                        Look kid, I know it's a lot coming at
                        ya right now, but do me a favor.
                        Don't freak out.

           Andy stares at the burgers, sizzling on the grill...

                                 ANDY
                        How do you go to one of these
                        parallel universe... Places?

                                 HARRY
                        Now listen to me very carefully kid.
                        You do not want to jump to a parallel
                        universe.

                                 ANDY
                        Why not? They sound incredible.

                                 HARRY
                        Oh sure, they sound incredible. Till
                        you find out it's a one way ticket.
                        No one knows how many universes are
                        out there, so you don't get to pick
                        which one you want to go to. It's a
                        totally random jump every time. Once
                        you step into that multiverse,
                        there's no coming back home again.

           Andy takes this in, hardly able to process.

                                 HARRY
                        There? Satisfied? Now go take your
                        break and pick your jaw up off the
                        floor. Then when you come back, you
                        can take their orders and bring their
                        food, just like I told ya. That's all
                        you gotta worry about.
           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy steps outside and looks around the empty parking lot.
           But his eyes widen as --

           One by one, TRAVELERS APPEAR OUT OF THIN AIR, carrying RETRO
           TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES. Some look like Walkmans, others like
           PalmPilots, Game Boys, or pagers. Lighting up with enough
           bells and whistles to make them futuristic and cool.

           The Travelers take in their new surroundings, getting their
           bearings. Then casually walk past Andy into the diner.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy steps back in, gazing around at the patrons with awe.

           Several sing along to a song that sounds like "The Piano
           Man" only they're singing "The Trumpet Man." Others toast
           with exotic drinks. A few are dancing to the music with
           strange movements we've never seen before.

           A smile spreads across Andy's face. Un. Fricken. Believable.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

           Andy walks through the hall, seeing the world around him in
           an entirely new light. Everything looks so ordinary.

           INT. FOODLAND GROCERY STORE -- DAY

           Andy and Kyle stock soda cases. One after another. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SUTTON -- DAY

           Andy walks down main street, past the liquor stores and
           boarded up bowling alley. The town is so dead and empty.

           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Andy makes tweaks to his Aaron Anders comic book. But his
           heart's not in it. His mind somewhere far away...

                                 KYLE (PRE-LAP)
                        Man, I wish that was my life...

           INT. KYLE'S BASEMENT -- NIGHT

           Andy and Kyle sit on the couch, staring at a tablet. ON
           SCREEN - A YOUNG DJ performs in front of a packed crowd.

                                 KYLE
                        I mean, look at him. He's our age.
                        Can you imagine how much play he gets
                        every night. What a way to live...

           But Andy's not paying attention. Something else on his mind.
                                 ANDY
                        Do you ever think... What if I could
                        just start over?

                                 KYLE
                        What, like in a video game?

                                 ANDY
                        Sort of, but... In a different game.
                        A better game.

           Kyle ponders this.

                                 KYLE
                        Sometimes I think what if I quit the
                        grocery store, cashed all my money
                        out of the bank, and just said screw
                        it. I'm gonna learn to DJ, I mean
                        really learn. See where it takes me.

                                 ANDY
                        So why not say screw it?

                                 KYLE
                        I don't know...
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        I was just kidding around, man.

           He goes back to watching the video.

           But he wasn't kidding around and Andy knows it.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy pours coffee for a TRENDY GIRL (20s) with a MOSTLY
           SHAVED HEAD AND PIGTAILS, wearing ALL WHITE LEATHER.

                                 TRENDY GIRL
                        What do you call this stuff again?

                                 ANDY
                        Coffee.

                                 TRENDY GIRL
                        Coffee...

           She takes a sip, really experiencing it.

                                 TRENDY GIRL
                        Mmm... Tastes like gnobbers.

           Andy nods, no idea what that means. Lingers a moment.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey, is it worth it? You know...
                        Traveling and stuff.

                                 TRENDY GIRL
                        Do it! If you're even thinking about
                        it, do it.
                                 ANDY
                        Really?

                                 TRENDY GIRL
                        Flip yeah! Best decision of my life.
                        Just last week, I was in a universe
                        where Kurt Cobain never died and I got
                        to see Nirvana in concert. Before
                        that, I found a gig teaching kids how
                        to ride woolly mammoths. I've gotten
                        drunk with neanderthals. I mean don't
                        get me wrong, some universes suck. You
                        just gotta keep your finger on the
                        button when you show up someplace new,
                        and be ready to say flip this and move
                        on to the next one. 

                                 ANDY
                        What about the whole you can't go
                        home thing?

                                 TRENDY GIRL
                        I didn't have anything to go home to.
                        Do you?

           Andy ponders that very question.

           INT. ANDY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Andy walks in to see his dad passed out in front of the TV
           again. A TWELVE PACK nearby, all the cans empty. Andy sighs,
           and then leans the chair forward. Charlie stirs, groggy as
           Andy helps him up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know, it's mom's birthday today.

                                 ANDY
                        I know, dad.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I just wanted to have a toast.

           He's very wobbly as Andy leads him up the stairs.

           MASTER BEDROOM

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let's sing her happy birthday.

                                 ANDY
                        No, let's get you to bed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on, she'd like that. Happy
                        birthday to you, happy birthday to
                        you, happy birthday dear Dawn...

           Andy lies him down and Charlie is practically out as his
           head hits the pillow. Andy looks him over with sadness.
           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Andy scrolls through Piper's Facebook feed. Piper and Brad
           at a football game. A selfie of them kissing. Making silly
           faces with friends at a party.

           He clicks through to the same old photo of HIM AND PIPER AS
           KIDS, smiling with their root beer floats in the diner. 

           He looks around his room, taking in the state of his life.

           Then opens his drawer to look at the photo of him with his
           mom. He stares at her smiling image.

           And gives a small nod.

           Then he shuts off his tablet. Puts on his jacket. Takes the
           lid off a shoe box and grabs the WAD OF CASH from inside.
           Pockets half of it.

           INT. HALLWAY, ANDY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Andy peers into his dad's room, where Charlie snores.

                                 (
                                  sotto
                                 ANDY
                                 )
                        Bye dad.

           He sets the other half of his money on Charlie's dresser.

           Then walks away down the hall, zipping up his coat.

           EXT. RURAL ROAD -- NIGHT

           Andy walks down the lonely road.

           He sees Harry's All-Night Hamburgers up ahead, glowing
           brightly in the darkness. A beacon of hope.

           Andy stops and stares at it, considering the road ahead.

           With a deep breath, he proceeds.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy picks up two root beer floats and carries them over to
           a booth occupied by TWO SURFER DUDES (20s) who look like
           they're backpacking their way from universe to universe.

                                 SURFER DUDE
                        I'm telling ya, this place was so
                        konky. The kids didn’t even have
                        parents. They all came out of test
                        tubes and were like, raised by the
                        village. Nicest people I ever met.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh yeah, I've been to that one.

           They turn to him.
                                 SURFER DUDE
                        Seriously? Dude, what are the odds?!
                        You travel often, man?

                                 ANDY
                        Oh yeah, all the time. This gig is
                        just temporary. You know, save up
                        some cash for the next trip.

                                 SURFER DUDE 2
                        So what's the spoinkest place you've
                        ever been?

                                 ANDY
                        The spoinkest... Oh man, that's
                        tough. I've been to so many...
                        Spoinky places.

                                 SURFER DUDE
                        Yeah, but what's the one where you're
                        just like... Where the snap am I?

                                 ANDY
                        Umm...

           Think of something Andy...

                                 ANDY
                        Okay yeah, so there was this one
                        where the country was called
                        Westeros... And there were all these
                        warring families, like the Lannisters
                        and the Starks and the Targaryens...
                        Everyone kept killing each other.
                        Literally, everyone died... And there
                        were these dragons --

                                 (
                                 SURFER DUDE
                                  points to friend
                                                 )
                        Dude, I told you there was one with
                        dragons! We just haven't found it yet!

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, and there was this other one
                        with all these elves. We hiked up a
                        big mountain in this country called
                        Mordor. And we got into this huge
                        fight with a bunch of orcs.

                                 SURFER DUDE
                        Holy giester! I feel like such an
                        amateur now.

                                 SURFER DUDE 2
                        You're like a seasoned veteran of
                        inter-dimensional travel.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, it's sorta my passion.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDY (CONT'D)
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        The thing is, my device, transporter,
                        thing-y... Whatever you call it where
                        you're from... It got fried.

                                 SURFER DUDE 2
                        Oh no...

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, it totally sucks. This
                        stormtrooper shot it to pieces. You
                        guys don't happen to know anyone
                        who's like, selling one do you?

                                 SURFER DUDE
                        I can totally hook you up. I've got
                        an extra Jumper I keep as a backup.
                        It's old but in totally bonk
                        condition.

                                 ANDY
                        How much would it cost?

                                 SURFER DUDE
                        Oh man, I don't know, it's always so
                        hard doing currency exchanges.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        How about you buy me dinner?

                                 ANDY
                        You want to trade an inter-dimensional
                        Jumper... For a hamburger?

           A long moment. The Surfer Dude looks self-conscious.

                                 SURFER DUDE
                        Sorry man, didn't mean to insult you.
                        How about for a side of fries?

                                 ANDY
                        Okay. Yeah, that's totally fair.

           INT. KITCHEN, HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy walks in, tucking something into his pocket.

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        You alright, there?

           Andy turns to see Harry looking on with prying eyes.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, yeah, of course. Totally fine.
                                  pulls out order pad
                                 (
                                                    )
                        Hey one of those guys asked for his
                        burger charred to a crisp. Wasn't
                        sure if you do that.
                                 HARRY
                        If he wants a hockey puck, I can make
                        a hockey puck. 

                                 ANDY
                        Okay, cool.

           But Harry still eyes him, sensing something.

                                 (
                                 ANDY
                                  thinking fast
                                              )
                        Listen, you mind if I take my fifteen
                        now? Feel like I could use some fresh
                        air to wake up a little.

                                 HARRY
                        Sure, kid. Whatever you need.

           Andy takes off his hat and apron and steps out the back.
           Harry eyes him the whole way.

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy looks over his shoulder as the door closes. No more
           prying eyes. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out --

           The PARALLEL UNIVERSE JUMPER. He gazes down at it. It's
           pretty retro, kind of like an old Motorola Razr, with a
           TRIPLE INFINITY LOOP LOGO on the front. Andy is skeptical.

           Until he flips it open, revealing a HIGHLY ADVANCED interior
           with HOLOGRAPHIC BUTTONS, whirring with ENERGY. The center
           button GLOWS BRIGHT RED with an IMAGE OF A HUMAN FIGURE AND
           AN ARROW POINTING FORWARD.

           Andy stares at it, mesmerized by the possibilities...

           His eyes rise to the vast stretch of nothing around the
           diner. Back to the Jumper in his hand.

                                 (
                                  sotto
                                 ANDY
                                 )
                        What if...

           He takes a breath. Then PRESSES THE GLOWING RED BUTTON...

           And nothing happens.

           Andy looks around, but everything is the same. He flips the
           Jumper open and closed. Shakes it. Hits it. Nothing.

           He sighs, annoyed. Heads back inside.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy walks in the front door and stops in his tracks.

           THE PLACE IS EMPTY. Harry looks up from behind the counter
           where he's polishing float mugs.
                                 HARRY
                        What can I get ya, kid? Looks like
                        you had a day.

                                 ANDY
                        Where did everyone go?

                                 HARRY
                        Eh, slow morning. Means you can sit
                        wherever you'd like.

                                 ANDY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 HARRY
                        What am I talking about? What are you
                        talking about?

                                 ANDY
                        Harry, I work here.

                                 HARRY
                        Harry? Name's Billy.
                                 (
                                  off Andy's look
                                                )
                        Oh I get it... You just popped your
                        cherry.

           He chuckles as Andy realizes...

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy dashes out the door. Looks up at the neon sign --

                             "BILLY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS"

                                 ANDY
                        Holy shit...

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [UNIVERSE B] -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy's jaw hangs open as he walks back in the door.

                                 ANDY
                        Where am I?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        In my diner. Now you gonna order
                        something? I got rules against
                        loitering. 

                                 ANDY

                                 (
                                  suddenly remembers
                        Yeah, no, wait a minute...
                                                   )
                        Are we at war with anyone?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        War? Whatcha talkin about, kid?
                                 ANDY
                        You know... War. Fighting, killing,
                        mass destruction, that sort of thing.
                        Are we doing that with anyone?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        That sounds terrible. Why the hell
                        would anyone do that?

                                 ANDY
                        I... I don't know.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        Okay, this is probably gonna sound
                        stupid, but are humans at the top of
                        the food chain?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        I don't know what you're used to, but
                        around here, we don't put our food on
                        chains. We put it on plates.

                                 ANDY
                        Uh, alright... And who is president?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        Olivia Davis. Splendid lady.

                                 ANDY
                        Whoa. A female president?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        They have male presidents in your
                        universe? That sounds like a recipe
                        for disaster.
                                 (
                                  guffaws
                                        )
                        Sorry kid, but I gotta ask. What
                        kinda messed up world do you come
                        from?

                                 ANDY
                        A very messed up one apparently.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        So, uh, what am I supposed to do now?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        Whatever you want. So either order
                        something or hit the road.

           Andy pulls out his wad of cash.

                                 ANDY
                        Any chance you could exchange this?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        Sure. If you order something.
           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [B] -- MORNING

           Andy steps outside, sipping a milkshake as he eyes his new
           currency. Just like dollar bills, except the presidents are
           all women. He tucks them away.

                                 ANDY
                        Don't freak out... Don't freak out...

           The sun is just starting to rise over the horizon,
           illuminating the road before him, leading into town.

           He takes a breath, steadying his nerves. Then slides the
           Jumper into his pocket and ventures forth into the great
           unknown.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SUTTON [B] -- MORNING

           Andy comes around the bend onto main street. But nothing can
           prepare him for this. The buildings look the same.

           But it's AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLACE.

           This small town is ALIVE WITH PERSONALITY and BUSTLING WITH
           ACTIVITY. Everyone dressed in VIBRANT COLORS with LOUD
           HAIRSTYLES. Everything feels fresh, stylish, and hip. The
           type of town you'd dream of living in.

           Andy looks around, a fish out of water, lost in this strange
           new world. It all feels so familiar... Yet so different.

           Top Shelf Liquor is now "The Health Hut." Liquors and More
           is now "Organic Originals." The old bowling alley is
           "Xavier's Escape Maze." The gas station is a HYDROGEN
           STATION. The restaurant is "Wildcraft Artisanal Delicacies."
           The movie theater marquee reads, "THE LEGEND OF ZELDA."

                                 ANDY
                        No freaking way...

           A LADY walks out a door, carrying flowers and WALKING A PIG.
           It oinks cheerfully at Andy. He stares as they pass, then
           backs up to see the sign above the shop. Miller's Guns is
           now "MILLER'S FLOWERS."

           He shakes his head, astonished.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY [B] -- DAY

           Andy walks down the same hall, but now it's overloaded with
           spirit. COLORFUL DECORATIONS for the school and teams. STATE
           CHAMPION BANNERS for all different sports. Every student
           dressed with the same over the top spunk as in town.

           But that's not the strangest thing of all...

           Everyone makes eye contact with Andy as he passes, smiling
           and shouting out greetings, like HE'S THE POPULAR ONE. 
                                 STUDENTS
                        Campbell! Didn't know you were back!
                        / Been loving your Telegram feed,
                        man. / Dude, how's your trip been?

           Andy ad libs hellos, unsure what to make of his new social
           status.

           And then he sees her...

           PIPER. Walking with Brad and their same group of friends.
           Like everyone else, her CLOTHES ARE BRIGHTER, HER HAIR
           ZANIER. But she still has that same sparkle in her eyes.
           That same smile. The same girl he fell in love with.

           But this time when she sees Andy, she stops in her tracks. A
           smile explodes across her face.

                                 PIPER
                        CAMERON?! OH MY GOD!!

           Cameron? But before Andy can even react, PIPER RUNS TOWARDS
           HIM, JUMPS INTO HIS ARMS --

           AND PLANTS A HUGE KISS ON HIS LIPS.

           HOLY. SHIT.

           When she finally pulls away, Andy's eyes are still closed.
           Floating on a dreamy cloud. He opens them to see Piper
           smiling, inches away.

           Yes, that really just happened.

                                 PIPER
                        I can't believe you're here! You said
                        you weren't gonna be back for another
                        two weeks.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, well, I --

                                 PIPER
                        Wait... Did you come back early just
                        to surprise me?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, uh... Surpriiiise.

           He smiles sheepishly. She squeals and hugs him tightly,
           kissing him over and over.

           Andy notices BRAD standing nearby, watching enviously. Andy
           can't help smirking.

                                 PIPER
                        Oh my God, look at your hair... What
                        did you do to it?
                                 ANDY
                        Oh, uh, I was in such a hurry to see
                        you so I didn't do anything to it.

                                 PIPER
                        That's so sweet.

           The BELL RINGS and students hurry towards their classes.

                                 BRAD
                        Come on, Phoenix.
                                 (
                                  glares at Andy
                                               )
                        Not all of us have private tutors on
                        the road, you know.

           Andy mouths "Phoenix?" Nor does the rest make sense to him.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Sorry, I gotta zip. But Zayden's
                        having people over tonight, we should
                        totally go!

                                 ANDY
                        Zayden?
                                 (
                                  no idea
                                        )
                        Oh yeah, totally.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Dizzy. I'll come pick you up after
                        school. I'm so excited. This is gonna
                        be the best night ever!

                                 ANDY
                        Absolutely. Best night ever.

           She kisses him again with sweet, romantic, bliss.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        I love you so much.

                                 ANDY
                        I love you... Too.

           Piper runs off to class. Leaving Andy in the now empty hall,
           looking like he just won the lottery. Did that really just
           happen?! He lets out a dumbfounded laugh.

           Then walks off with a skip in his step.

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE [B] -- DAY

           Andy strolls towards his house. The lawn is freshly mowed.
           Blooming flowers in every bed. A complete turnaround from
           the home he knows. This universe just keeps getting better.

           INT. ANDY'S HOUSE [B] -- DAY

           The door opens as Andy steps in.
                                 ANDY
                        Whoa...

           The decorations look pulled from the pages of an interior
           decorating magazine. Polished, bright, and colorful. 

                                 ANDY
                        Hello?

           No answer. Andy hesitates, then --

                                 ANDY
                        Mom?

           Still no answer. Andy heads upstairs, exploring further.

           ANDY'S BEDROOM [B]

           Andy steps in... And he can't believe his eyes.

           It's the UPSCALE VERSION OF HIS ROOM. The same sort of sci-
           fi and comic stuff he had in his own room, but it's all
           ELEGANTLY FRAMED, making it look far more sophisticated.
           Sleek furniture. Fancy drawing desk. A cool dude lives here. 

           Then he sees the framed covers of THREE AARON ANDERS GRAPHIC
           NOVELS. The first we recognize from the comic that he was
           working on. But the rest he hasn't even imagined yet.

                                 ANDY
                        Son of a bitch...

           His eyes drift to the COLLAGE OF PHOTOS on the wall.

           They tell the story of a completely different life. Nine-
           year-old Andy on the shoulders of his teammates after
           winning the championship game. On the HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL
           TEAM. At a SCHOOL DANCE WITH PIPER. His hair is styled with
           more pizzazz. His clothes bolder. Screaming confidence.

                                 ANDY
                        Who is this guy?

           He goes to the drawing desk, touching the computer and
           opening a web browser. Types in Facebook.com. "WEBSITE NOT
           FOUND." Strange... Google.com. "WEBSITE NOT FOUND." He
           checks the browser history. Sees MYSPACE at the top.

                                 ANDY
                        Seriously?

           He clicks it, bringing up his MySpace profile, showing a
           picture of the other him wearing an Aaron Anders T-Shirt.

           He scrolls down, seeing photos of the other him posing with
           FANS HOLDING UP HIS COMIC. Posts about BEING ON A COMIC BOOK
           SIGNING TOUR. Pics of LONG LINES OF FANS waiting for his
           autograph. The other him hanging out at HIP PARTIES. In
           CITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. Having the time of his life.
           Andy stares in awe at this alternative life.

           Then he hesitates, remembering something. He opens his desk
           drawer and peers inside --

           Nestled amongst the items is a framed photo of NINE-YEAR-OLD
           ANDY POSED WITH HIS MOM.

           BUT THIS PHOTO IS DIFFERENT. Instead of being on a roller
           coaster, it's Andy in a homemade superhero cosplay costume
           with his Mom smiling next to him. 

           Andy stares, confused. He doesn't remember this.

           Then he HEARS THE DOOR OPEN downstairs.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh shit!

           Andy gets to his feet and goes to the mirror. He tries to
           readjust his hair, struggling to make it look like the guy
           in the photos. Not nearly enough product. Not happening.

           FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS. Andy curses under his
           breath, giving up on his hair. He steps out into the --

           HALLWAY [B]

           And sees his DAD approaching. HE LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETELY
           DIFFERENT PERSON. Clean-cut, styled hair, dressed in a
           slick, colorful BUSINESS SUIT.

                                 ANDY
                        Dad?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cameron?!

           HE YELLS EXCITEDLY and greets Andy with a big hug. Andy is
           so shocked he lets out an awkward yell of his own.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you doing home?! What
                        happened to the signing tour?

                                 ANDY
                        I, uh, decided to come back, just for
                        the weekend. Dad, I can't believe
                        this. You look great!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Great?
                                 (
                                  chuckles
                                         )
                        That one of those hopster words you
                        offspring use these days?

                                 ANDY
                        No, I mean, you look dizzy. Really
                        dizzy. Were you just at a job
                        interview or something?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, was interviewing a candidate for
                        the vice president of international
                        sales gig. My little startup just
                        keeps growing and growing.

           He chuckles. Andy can't mask his astonishment.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey, you okay Cam? You look a
                        little... Off. Something happen?

                                 ANDY
                        What? No.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You're not sky, are you?

                                 ANDY
                        Sky?

                                 CHARLIE
                        It's okay if you're sky. I'm not
                        judging.

                                 ANDY
                        No, dad, I'm not sky --

                                 CHARLIE
                        You can tell me. It's not like I
                        didn't do that stuff when I was your
                        age too, you know.

                                 ANDY
                        I'm not sky. I'm just... Happy. I
                        really missed you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I missed you too, son.

           He pulls Andy in for another hug. This time, Andy hugs back. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Does Phoenix know you're home?

                                 ANDY
                        Phoenix?
                                 (
                                  remembering
                                            )
                        Oh yeah. We're going out tonight.

                                 CHARLIE
                        She's one lucky girl, you know. Gets
                        to date my successful, driven,
                        creative genius of a son. I'm so damn
                        proud of you, Cam.

           Andy manages a smile. A lot to live up to.
           INT. BATHROOM, ANDY'S HOUSE [B] -- DAY

           Andy steps into the bathroom, closing the door. He stands
           over the sink, taking breaths.

           His eyes rise to his reflection in the mirror, seeing
           someone who is clearly not the Cameron these people know.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay... You can do this. You're
                        Cameron. Just for tonight. Or maybe a
                        few days. Until he gets back. It'll
                        be like a vacation. A vacation from
                        your life. Yeah.

           He stands up a little taller.

                                 ANDY
                        You're Cameron.
                                 (
                                  more confident
                                               )
                        You're Cameron.

           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM [B] -- DAY

           Andy looks over the photos of Cameron on the walls, studying
           his clothes, his hair. He opens the closet door, revealing
           an assortment of BOLD, MULTI-COLORED CLOTHES. Andy smiles.

                                 ANDY
                        You're Cameron.

           The sound of KNOCKING takes us into --

           INT. ENTRYWAY, ANDY'S HOUSE [B] -- NIGHT

           The door opens, revealing Piper, dressed like a fashionista
           walking a European runway. Her eyes light up as she sees --

           CAMERON. Or rather, Andy dressed as Cameron. Wearing a
           bright outfit that belongs at an ultra hip nightclub. He
           even has an intellectual looking BERET. The spitting image
           of his alternate self.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Wow. You look so dizzy...

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks. You look pretty dizzy
                        yourself.

           The BEEPS AND WARBLES of electronics take us into --

           INT. PIPER'S CAR [B] -- NIGHT

           A fully autonomous hydrogen car that perfectly befits this
           incredible universe. Piper sings along with the SONG on the
           radio, dancing as the car drives itself. Andy feigns singing
           along, but clearly doesn't know the words. 
                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        This song always makes me think of
                        that night...

                                 (
                                  no idea
                                 ANDY
                                        )
                        Yeah... Me too...

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Remember what we were doing during
                        this part?

                                 ANDY
                        Uh... How could I forget?

           Piper laughs. Then starts belting out the chorus. Andy just
           hums along with the melody.

           Suddenly Piper's PHONE RINGS. ANDY'S PHOTO pops up on the
           car's huge dashboard display. "Cameron Calling..."

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Wait... You're calling me?

                                 ANDY
                        Don't answer it!

           Andy fumbles with the touchscreen, rejecting the call.

                                 ANDY
                        My phone got stolen. This guy's been
                        prank calling everyone and texting
                        dick pics. Don't open anything from
                        me. Ignore all my texts and calls.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Ew. Why haven't you changed your
                        number to a new phone?

                                 ANDY
                        I will. I just... I had to see you
                        first. I couldn't wait any longer.

           Piper's heart melts.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Ohh Cameron... I wish we never had to
                        be apart.

                                 ANDY
                        Believe me, I feel the same way.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Well we're together now and the night
                        is infant. Time to get our groove on.

                                 ANDY
                        Our groove?
           EXT. BACKYARD, HOUSE [B] -- NIGHT

           This isn't your typical house party. It's a RAGING EDM RAVE
           in someone's backyard. There's a professional stage setup on
           the back porch, ripping out pulsing music. Laser lights.
           Fog. TONS OF BODIES grinding and gyrating. If this is a high
           school party in this universe, we never want to graduate. 

           Piper drags a dumbfounded Andy into the mayhem.

                                 ANDY
                        Who are all these people?

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        You don't honestly think Zayden could
                        keep a private show secret, do you? 

           The lights flare, and Andy gets a better look at the stage.
           That's when he sees --

           KYLE is the one rocking the TURNTABLES, headphones pressed
           to his ear as he cues up the next track. Lasers spell out
           ZAYDEN in the fog above him. Girls scream his name.

                                  sotto
                                 ANDY
                                 )
                                 (
                        Zayden?

           Kyle notices Andy and points to him, pumping his fist
           excitedly. Andy waves back, trying to comprehend. 

                                 ANDY
                        This is insane.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        I know, right?! Come on, babe, dance
                        with me.

           She starts DANCING IN A BIZARRE WAY. To us, it looks
           ridiculous, like she's doing her best tree-in-the-wind
           impression. But that's what everyone is doing. Andy tries to
           mirror them, but looks like a guy at a junior high dance. 

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                                  yelling in his ear
                                                   )
                                 (
                        What's wrong?

                                 ANDY
                        Nothing. Best night of my life.

           Piper eyes him, sensing something awry.

                                 KYLE [ZAYDEN]
                                 (
                                  on microphone
                                              )
                        Yo yo yo, take a breath party people,
                        and lend me your ears.

           The beat fades so Kyle's voice can be heard.
                                 KYLE [ZAYDEN]
                        I want to thank you all for coming
                        out tonight. But I especially want to
                        thank my main man, Cam, who traveled
                        a long way to be here. He's the most
                        talented guy this town has ever
                        produced, and I wouldn't be up here
                        if it wasn't for him.

           The crowd cheers. People start turning to Andy.

                                 KYLE [ZAYDEN]
                        You see, a couple years ago I was
                        pretty lost. Then Cam told me, "Hey
                        Zayden, just say screw it, man. Stop
                        worrying and start living." So I did.
                        And look where I'm livin' now!

           More cheers. People slap Andy on the back like he's a hero.

                                 KYLE [ZAYDEN]
                        So if you're feeling a little unsure
                        of yourself, if you're too scared to
                        follow that dream, you should take
                        Cam's advice. Raise your hands up
                        high and just say... SCREW IT!

                                 ALL
                        SCREW IT!!

           Raucous cheers. Andy is astonished by the scene.

                                 KYLE [ZAYDEN]
                        Now the only thing more dizzy than
                        Cam's advice are his moves on the
                        dance floor.

           Andy freezes. Oh shit...

                                 KYLE [ZAYDEN]
                        So this one's for you, Cam. Take us
                        home, buddy!

           Kyle brings up the beat and PLAYS A DANCE SONG THAT NO ONE
           IN OUR UNIVERSE HAS EVER HEARD BEFORE. All eyes shift to
           Andy, opening up a circle around him, waiting for him to
           bust a move. Piper watches excitedly.

           But Andy just stands there, petrified. The music is bumping
           but he's not moving. People exchange confused glances.

           Andy's wide eyes lock on Piper, who stares at him
           expectantly. She mouths "What's wrong?"

           It's now or never...

                                 (
                                  sotto
                                 ANDY
                                 )
                        Screw it.
           Andy snaps to the beat, one arm flying straight out, the
           other locking behind his head. And he starts doing... No
           he's not... Oh my God, yes he is. He's doing THE SPRINKLER!

           But to this crowd, it looks fresh and new. They've never
           seen anything like it before.

                                 CROWD
                        Look at that move! / That's so bonk!
                        / That dude must be sky as a kite!

           They all start MIRRORING HIS MOVES! Everyone is doing the
           Sprinkler! Piper steps up next to Andy, dancing with him.
           And that's all it takes for him to push it further.

           He breaks into the SHOPPING CART, dramatically grabbing
           imaginary items. Everyone adjusts, following his lead. He
           switches to the ROBOT, stiffly moving his body. The crowd
           imitates him, loving it.

           Kyle pushes the music, getting ready to let the beat drop --

           And when it does, Andy busts out FREAKING GANGNAM STYLE!

           The crowd goes nuts, jumping and screaming! They all try to
           keep up, everyone doing Gangnam Style for the first time.

           To us, it looks absurd. But to this crowd, it's brand new
           and cutting edge. And Andy is at the center of it all.

           The music comes to an emphatic close and EVERYONE ROARS!
           They swarm around Andy, everyone wanting a piece, everyone
           wanting a picture. Piper wraps him up in a BIG KISS.

           It is by far, the best night of his life.

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE [B] -- NIGHT

           The lights are off. Piper's hydrogen car pulls to a stop.

           INT. ANDY'S HOUSE [B] -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy and Piper step into the dark house, whispering and
           laughing. They head upstairs. Sounds of a TV nearby.

           Andy glances into Charlie's room to see him watching a
           nature documentary, sipping a green smoothie. Charlie
           notices Piper and gives Andy an 'atta boy' gesture.

           Piper takes Andy's hand and leads him down the hall. Oh
           shit, this is getting real. Andy tries to stay calm. Tries
           to play it cool.

           ANDY'S BEDROOM [B]

           Andy turns a lamp on.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        I've missed being here.
                                 ANDY
                        I've missed having you here.

           He nervously fumbles with the light, trying to set a
           romantic mood. But Piper takes his hand.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Hey... It's fine.

           She turns him to face her, looking deep into his eyes.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        It's perfect actually.

           Andy nods.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Babe, you're trembling.

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry. I just...

           He hesitates. Something holding him back.

                                 ANDY
                        What if we move somewhere else? Like
                        Chicago. Tomorrow. No goodbyes, no
                        farewell parties, we just say screw
                        it and go. I could open a comic book
                        store. You could open your
                        restaurant. Just the two of us.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Open my restaurant?
                                 (
                                  laughs awkwardly
                                                 )
                        Cam, I haven't cooked since I started
                        that fire when we tried to bake
                        Christmas cookies.

           Andy blinks hard, trying to process this.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, I know, I meant...

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        I'm happy with you here, in Sutton. I
                        don't ever want to leave.

                                 ANDY
                        I don't ever want to leave either.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        So stop worrying so much about the
                        future. Tonight is ours.

           She steps back and slides off the straps of her dress,
           letting it fall to the floor, revealing her bra and panties.

                                 ANDY
                        Holy shit.
                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        I've been waiting so long for this.

                                 ANDY
                        Not as long as I have...

           She kisses him passionately, TAKING HIM DOWN ONTO THE BED,
           UNLEASHING HER PENT UP SEXUAL AGGRESSION. Andy is like a
           baby gazelle being mauled by a lion. She rips off his shirt.
           Unfastens his belt and yanks off his pants.

           Then her PHONE RINGS. She glances at it.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        That's so weird. You're calling me
                        again.

           Andy silences it. Piper smirks. They get right back to it.

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE [B] -- SIMULTANEOUS

           A second car pulls up next to Piper's. The door opens --

           And ANDY STEPS OUT, carrying a travel bag.

           Only it's not Andy. It's CAMERON. The alternative version of
           Andy who belongs in this universe. The one this Piper is in
           love with.

           Cameron eyes Piper's car, confused why it's here, but
           intrigued. He heads towards his house.

           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM [B] -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Andy and Piper are getting hot and heavy under the covers.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        You wanna get a sheath.

                                 ANDY
                        A what?
                                 (
                                  thinks fast
                                            )
                        Oh, yeah.

           He stumbles out of bed, wearing only his boxers, looking
           around. Where the hell are the sheaths? He opens a drawer.
           No. Tries another.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        They're not in the bathroom anymore?

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry, just thought one might...

           He darts into the connecting --

           BATHROOM [B]

           Andy turns on the light. Starts rummaging through the
           medicine cabinet. The door drifting half closed behind him.
           HALLWAY [B] -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Cameron comes up the stairs. He stops at Charlie's door,
           seeing his dad engaged in a yoga routine. Very zen.

                                 CAMERON
                        Surprise! Thought I'd swing home for
                        the weekend before my next signing.

           Charlie relaxes out of his pose, confused.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you sky right now?

                                 CAMERON
                        What? No, not at all.
                                 (
                                  laughs nervously
                                                 )
                        Hey, what's Phoenix's car doing here?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Last I checked, she was in your room,
                        champ.

                                 CAMERON
                        Really? Cool.

           Cameron heads down the hall, towards his bedroom. Charlie
           watches, not sure what to make of it.

           BATHROOM [B] -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Andy frantically searches through drawers, looking for that
           elusive tool that will let him live his dream.

           He freezes as he hears the BEDROOM DOOR CREAK OPEN --

           ANDY'S BEDROOM [B] -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Cameron steps in, noticing the mood lighting. Piper is under
           the covers, scrolling through her phone, her back to him.

                                 CAMERON
                        Hey...

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                                 (
                                  not looking back
                                                 )
                        Hurry up. I'm naked.

                                 CAMERON
                        Seriously?

           Cameron quickly starts removing his clothes.

           BATHROOM [B] -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Andy is frozen behind the door. He cringes as he hears
           Cameron climbing into bed with Piper. Then there's kissing.
           And sensual groaning. What a nightmare!
                                 PIPER [PHOENIX] (O.S.)
                        Aren't you forgetting something?

                                 CAMERON (O.S.)
                        What? Oh yeah.

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX] (O.S.)
                        You kept me waiting that long and
                        forgot to get a sheath?

                                 CAMERON (O.S.)
                        Relax, babe. Ten seconds.

           ANDY HEARS HIM APPROACHING. Oh shit! Oh shit! He jumps into
           the shower and ducks behind the curtain as --

           Cameron pushes the door open.

           WE STAY WITH ANDY behind the curtain. Holding his breath.
           Tense as hell.

           HE HEARS CAMERON open the cabinet, move stuff aside, pull
           out a box, and remove a crinkly wrapper. Andy squeezes his
           eyes closed, but he can't ignore the sounds. 

           The light turns off. Andy opens his eyes. He steps out of
           the shower and tiptoes to the half-open door. Ever so
           slowly, he peers around it into the bedroom. He can't see
           them from his vantage point. But then he hears --

           SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK from the bed. Gradually building.
           Along with growing purrs of pleasure. Panting breaths.

           Andy might just cry. This is torture. Absolute torture.

           SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK.

           His eyes dart about, desperate. He glances at the bathroom
           window, the quickest means of escape.

           Then he realizes something even more awful.

           He glances back into the bedroom. His pants are on the floor
           with HIS PARALLEL UNIVERSE JUMPER STICKING OUT OF A POCKET.

           SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK.

           Andy takes a breath. Steels himself. He's gotta get it. It's
           the only way out of this hell.

           Keeping his eyes to the ground, he crouches down and
           silently slips into --

           ANDY'S BEDROOM [B] -- CONTINUOUS

           Still wearing only his boxers, Andy slowly advances towards
           his pants and the Jumper he so desperately needs.
           He can hear things heating up in bed. But he forces himself
           to keep his eyes focused on the Jumper. He's almost there.
           He reaches out for it --

           And PIPER MOANS deeply.

           Which is too much for Andy. He has to sneak a glance. Just
           for a second. His eyes rise --

           We don't see what he sees. We only see the maelstrom of
           emotions on his face. First it's awe...

           Followed by soul crushing sadness.

           His eyes sink closed. He grabs his pants and the Jumper.
           Quickly moves towards the door --

           CREAK! Under his foot. Andy's head snaps around to look at
           the bed -- Just in time to see PIPER'S HEAD TURN.

           She's looking right at him, crouching there with his pants
           in hand... BUT HER MIND CAN'T PROCESS THE SIGHT. She slowly
           turns back to Cameron, on top of her with his eyes closed,
           still thrusting. Back to our Andy...

           And PIPER SCREAMS!

           So loud and shrill that Andy jumps, losing his balance and
           falling over, dropping his pants. The Jumper and his wallet
           tumble away. Cameron turns and sees a stranger in his room. 

                                 CAMERON
                        WHAT THE FLIP?!

           Andy grabs his Jumper and wallet, and BOLTS FOR THE DOOR,
           leaving his clothes. Cameron leaps out of bed after him --

           HALLWAY [B]

           Andy runs down the hall. Charlie comes to his door.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cameron? What are you --

           Andy races by. Closely followed by buck ass naked Cameron
           (good thing we're respectable and only see waist up).

                                 CHARLIE
                        Cameron?!

           ENTRYWAY [B]

           Andy races down the stairs, Cameron right behind him.

                                 CAMERON
                        Come back here, you creeper!

           Andy's almost to the door, but Cameron leaps and TACKLES
           HIM. They roll around, struggling, until --
           They're face to face. Cameron freezes, staring in horror.

                                 CAMERON
                        You're... You're...

           Lights snap on. CHARLIE RACES DOWN THE STAIRS.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What's wrong?! Who is --

           He suddenly see two identical versions of his son. Now it's
           his turn to SCREAM. Beyond mind blown.

           Andy knees Cameron in the groin and throws him off.

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry...

           He gets to his feet and runs for the door. Grabs the knob --

                                 PIPER [PHOENIX]
                        Cameron?!

           Andy looks back. She's at the top of the stairs in a sheet,
           looking like she's staring at a ghost.

           Andy struggles to find the words to explain...

           But there's no explaining this... HE DASHES OUT THE DOOR.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [B] -- NIGHT

           Andy sits at the counter, nursing a milkshake. The look of a
           man who had the world in his hands and then lost it. Still
           just in his boxers, which is perfectly normal around here.

           He sits next to a SKEAZY DUDE (40s) in a wild suit.
           Triangle-shaped tie. Zippers. A literal rainbow of colors.

                                 SKEAZY DUDE
                        These things happen all the time.
                        Couple years of therapy and they'll
                        begin to believe it was some kind of
                        shared psychosis. Or clones. Lots of
                        people fall back on clones.

                                 ANDY
                        What if we'd just stayed at the
                        party? Or what if we'd gone to her
                        house instead? Everything was going
                        so great...

           He slurps his milkshake, sucking it dry.

           A YOUNG WAITER (18) picks up Andy's empty glass.

                                 YOUNG WAITER
                        Get you anything else?
                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, I need a root beer float.

                                 YOUNG WAITER
                        A what?

                                 ANDY
                        You know, a root beer float.

                                 YOUNG WAITER
                        Let me check with the manager...

           The waiter heads for the back. The Skeazy Dude finishes his
           burger, licking his fingers with big slurps.

                                 SKEAZY DUDE
                        So you really love this girl, huh?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, but she doesn't love me. She
                        loves the other me. Who's a lot like
                        me, just... Better.

                                 SKEAZY DUDE
                        Then there's a pretty simple solution
                        to your problem. Kill yourself.

           Andy blinks... What the what? 

                                 SKEAZY DUDE
                        I mean, don't kill yourself. Kill
                        your-self. Your other self.

                                 ANDY
                        Isn't that like... Murder?

                                 SKEAZY DUDE
                        I like to think of it as recycling a
                        photocopy. Done it a bunch of times
                        myself. Got it down to a science.
                                 (
                                  lowers his voice
                                                 )
                        The trick is... Don't try to bury the
                        body or chop it to pieces. That always
                        gets messy. All you gotta do is take
                        the other you's body out into the
                        woods behind the diner, put your
                        parallel jumper thingy in his hands,
                        and make his finger press the button.
                        Then poof! Sayonara photo copy and
                        you're living the life you dreamed of.

                                 ANDY
                        That sure sounds like murder.

                                 SKEAZY DUDE
                        Sounds more like love to me.

           Andy ponders that as the waiter returns.
                                 YOUNG WAITER
                        Manager's making you one of those...
                        Things you asked for.

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks.

           The Skeazy Dude leaves cash on the counter.

                                 SKEAZY DUDE
                        Tell Billy thanks. Burger was great!
                                 (
                                  to Andy

                        All I'm saying is think about it.

           He heads for the door, leaving Andy alone at the counter.
           Harry comes out of the back with Andy's root beer float.

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        Sorry for the confusion. Kid's new.

                                 ANDY
                        I get it.
                                 (

                        Hey, hypothetically speaking, if
                        someone were to "recycle his
                        photocopy," would that have any...
                        Cosmic ramifications?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        You mean like blowing up the space
                        time continuum?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        No idea. But I know I'd sure feel bad
                        about it for the rest of my life.

           Andy sighs heavily, dejected.

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        Heard you say you love this girl.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah.

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        So stop dicking around here and go
                        find the her that loves you back.

           Sage advice, as always.

                                 ANDY
                        Right.

                        I don't suppose you know any place
                        around here where I could crash for
                        the night?
                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        Got a few cots in the basement. Just
                        don't make a regular thing of it. 

                                 ANDY
                        Of course. And um... Any chance
                        you've got some spare clothes lying
                        around here too?

                                 HARRY [BILLY]
                        Sure, kid. Check the lost and found.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A STORAGE CLOSET door opens, REVEALING AN EPIC HODGEPODGE OF
           VASTLY DIFFERENT ITEMS FROM VASTLY DIFFERENT UNIVERSES. A
           helmet with horns tumbles out past Andy's feet. He sighs.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh boy...

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- MORNING

           Andy steps out wearing a leather shirt and polka dot
           polyester pants. He pulls out his Jumper.

                                 ANDY
                        Alright multiverse. Let's see what
                        you've got.

           He presses the button --

           BEGIN PARALLEL UNIVERSE SEQUENCE

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

           Andy saunters through a new version of his high school,
           trying not to look self conscious in his outfit. He stands
           out dramatically from everyone else, who all wear COLORFUL
           ROBES MADE OF FEATHERS. Then he sees --

           PIPER AND KYLE MAKING OUT by their lockers.

           Andy rolls his eyes and heads back the way he came.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

           Another universe. Andy now in a BLACK LEATHER BONDAGE
           OUTFIT, which fits in perfectly with everyone's style. Then
           he sees --

           PIPER MAKING OUT WITH A GIRL by their lockers.

                                 ANDY
                        Are you kidding me?!

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

           Andy wears an EVENING GOWN in a universe where the girls
           wear suits and the guys wear dresses.
           He stops when he sees Piper talking to her friends in an
           ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LANGUAGE. She turns to him with a smile.

                                 PIPER
                        Gunta fallye enrimi dor, Eglaton?

           Andy blinks, clueless. Piper's brow furrows.

                                 PIPER
                        Gunta fallye enrimi dor?

                                 ANDY
                        Uh... No hablo...

           Peace out.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

           Andy wears a LEOPARD PRINT BODY SUIT, just like everyone
           else. He sees Piper walking alone in the opposite direction.
           He smiles and waves at her --

                                 ANDY
                        Hey!

           CRACK! PIPER DECKS ANDY IN THE FACE, FLOORING HIM.

                                 PIPER
                        How do you explain this, Nova?!

           Piper holds up her phone. On it, ANOTHER ANDY is kissing
           ANOTHER GIRL as she takes a selfie.

                                 ANDY
                        What? That's not... That's not me!

                                 PIPER
                        Oh and I suppose that wasn't you in
                        all the other ones either. Go poof
                        yourself you poofing anuspit!

           She storms off, leaving Andy on the ground, stunned.

                                 ANDY
                        Damn it!

           EXT. GRAVEYARD -- DAY

           Andy stands over a tombstone. AN ETCHING OF PIPER'S FACE on
           the grave with the words, "Once Met, Never Forgotten..."

           He tosses up his hands with frustration and walks off.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy stands across from VARIOUS VERSIONS OF HARRY.

           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           Andy steps into DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF HIS BEDROOM.

           -One with photos of him playing a bizarre musical instrument.

           -Another covered with revolutionary political artwork.

           -Another is a Buddhist's dorm, with a mat on the floor,
           burning incense, and flourishing plants.

           SERIES OF SHOTS: Andy opens his desk drawer. In each one, A
           DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE PHOTO WITH HIS MOM.

           -Andy and his Mom at a sporting event.

           -Andy and his Mom on an exotic beach.

           -Andy and his Mom opening presents on his birthday.

           She always has the same face, the same smile. Just a
           different look and situation.

           Andy picks up the last photo and SMASHES IT ON THE DESK IN
           FRUSTRATION, BREAKING THE FRAME. Then slams the drawer shut.

           END PARALLEL UNIVERSE SEQUENCE
           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy walks in, looking exhausted. At his wit's end. Harry
           comes out of the kitchen in his usual apron. 

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Looks like you had a --

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah Harry or Frankie or Tommy or
                        whatever your name is. I've had a
                        day. I've had a lot of days. Now
                        before I drop any cash, I've got some
                        questions for you. First off, are we
                        at war with anyone?

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea,
                        Syria. You know, the usual.

                                 (
                                  not caring
                                           )
                        Cool. And are humans at the top of
                        the food chain?

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Yup. We'll kill anything, and eat it
                        too.

                                 ANDY
                        And who's the leader of this country?

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Kanye West.

           Andy stares, stunned. Harry starts laughing.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        I love it when that line works.
                                 (

                        you gonna keep asking questions, or
                        you gonna order something?

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [UNIVERSE C] -- MORNING

           Andy steps out, sipping a milkshake, glancing around. Trees.
           Electricity. Sunshine. Looks promising.

                                 ANDY
                        Please be okay...

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE [C] -- DAY

           Andy walks towards the house. Fairly well maintained but
           nothing fancy. So far, so good. 
           INT. ANDY'S HOUSE [C] -- DAY

           Andy steps inside and glances around. Everything looks
           pretty dang normal.

                                 ANDY
                        Finally.
                                 (
                                     )

                                 (
                                     )
                        Mom?

           No answer. He heads upstairs.

           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM [C] -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy freezes in the doorway...

           IT'S NOT HIS ROOM.

           It's a girl's room. Pink, frilly comforter on the bed.
           Posters of hot pop stars. Along with tons of photos and
           knickknacks from the life of a teen.

                                 ANDY
                        What the...

           He opens the desk drawer. The FRAMED PHOTO OF ANDY'S MOM is
           in its place, but in this version, she's smiling next to a
           YOUNG GIRL at a science museum exhibit.

           Andy's eyes rise to the FAMILY PHOTOS around the room. In
           every one, his dad poses with the same girl. But ANDY'S NOT
           IN ANY OF THE PHOTOS.

                                 ANDY
                        No...

           The BATHROOM DOOR KNOB TURNS behind him --

                                 ANDY
                        Oh shit...

           A TEENAGE GIRL (17) STEPS OUT IN A TOWEL, drying her hair.
           She freezes when she sees Andy standing there. Her name is
           IRIS and to her, Andy is a stranger in her bedroom.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey...

           IRIS SCREAMS IN TERROR. She runs back into the bathroom and
           slams the door.

                                 ANDY
                        No wait, it's okay! It's nothing like
                        that!

           The sound of the FRONT DOOR OPENING.
                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Hey Iris, I'm home, sweetie --

           The shrillest scream imaginable from the bathroom.

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        IRIS!

           ANDY RUNS FOR IT --

           HALLWAY [C]

           Only to see CHARLIE coming up the stairs, WIELDING A GOLF
           CLUB LIKE A BROAD SWORD.

                                 ANDY
                        Wait, I can explain --

           Too late! Charlie SWINGS THE GOLF CLUB AT HIM! Andy ducks
           just in time as THE CLUB SMASHES THROUGH A FRAMED PHOTO!

                                 ANDY
                        I'm your son!

           He swings again! Andy barely dodges as THE CLUB SMASHES
           THROUGH DRYWALL.

           Charlie swings again! Andy ducks and races for the stairs.
           But HE TRIPS, TUMBLING DOWN THEM. Charlie gives chase, still
           brandishing his club.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Get outta here, you sick pervert!

           ANDY RUNS OUT THE DOOR. And just keeps running.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SUTTON [C] -- DAY

           Andy walks through town, realizing he recognizes all of the
           businesses. "Miller's Guns." "Top Shelf Liquor." "Liquors
           and More" across the street. "Mindy's Cafe." The same movie
           theater marquee, "Spider-Man 7: The Revenge."

           Everything looks exactly the same as his home universe.

                                 ANDY
                        This doesn't make any sense...

           Then he freezes, eyes locked on --

           PIPER, inside Mindy's cafe. Aside from her waitress uniform,
           she looks just like the Piper he knows.

           INT. MINDY'S CAFE [C] -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy steps up to the hostess's podium. Piper heads over. Her
           name tag reads "Addison."

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Hi, breakfast for one?
           Andy waits for her to recognize him.

           But she just stares back, confused by his lack of response. 

           Welcome to the Twilight Zone.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- NIGHT

           Andy sits at the counter, drinking his usual root beer
           float. CLARENCE (40s) sits next to him, wearing a florescent
           track suit that is way better than anything from the 80s.

                                 ANDY
                        It was like she'd never seen me
                        before in her life...

                                 CLARENCE
                        If it makes you feel any better, my
                        wife stabbed me once when I crawled
                        into bed with her. Granted, I didn't
                        know we weren't married in that
                        universe. Never hurts to ask first.

           He sets down some foreign bills and stands to leave.

                                 CLARENCE
                        Well I'm off to work. Good luck
                        finding that girl. Or the right
                        version of the girl, that is.

                                 ANDY
                        Off to work? You mean you live here?

                                 CLARENCE
                        Yeah, got tired of looking for the
                        next best thing, so decided to settle
                        down. I know this universe isn't your
                        cup of joffee, but compared to where
                        I'm from, it ain't too shabby. Don't
                        have to wear a gas mask to step
                        outside, and you can still make
                        babies without a bunch of scientists
                        in your pants. So I can't complain.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        But I'm sure you'll find another
                        universe where you're happy again.

           He walks out, leaving Andy at the counter. Harry steps up.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Get you another float?

                                 ANDY
                        Just the check. I've gotta get out of
                        here.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        What's the rush, kid? You just won
                        the lottery.
                                 ANDY
                        How did I win the lottery?

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Sounds like you're the one and only
                        you in this universe. You have any
                        idea how many folks would kill to
                        stumble into a place like that?

                                 ANDY
                        They'd kill to find a universe where
                        they didn't exist and their dad tried
                        to murder them?

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        No, they'd kill to find a universe
                        where they could be whoever they
                        wanted to be. That's freedom if I've
                        ever heard it.

           He sets the check down and heads for the back.

           Andy watches him go, suddenly seeing his situation in a new
           light. Full of possibility.

           INT. MINDY'S CAFE [C] -- MORNING

           Andy strolls back into the cafe... But there's something
           different about him now. The look on his face. The way he
           walks. He just seems confident. And downright cool. 

           Piper recognizes him this time. Seems a little odd to see
           him two days in a row.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Staying to eat this time?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, figured I'd give it a shot.
                        Hey, can I ask you a question. Why
                        aren't you in school?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I'm on my gap year.

           Obviously. Andy plays along.

                                 ANDY
                        Oh. Cool.
                                  beat
                                     )
                                 (
                        Me too.

           He smiles and Piper returns it politely.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Cool. Right this way then.

           INT. MINDY'S CAFE [C] -- LATER

           Andy peruses the menu. The food all looks nice and normal. 
                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Any questions about the menu?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, what do you recommend?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Umm, well the California scramble is
                        our most popular.

                                 ANDY
                        Forget what's popular. What do you
                        like?
                                 (
                                  checks her name tag
                                                    )
                        Addison.

           Not your average customer, and she likes that.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Well, that depends. I'm always a
                        sucker for a cinnamon roll and a
                        latte... Unless I'm in the mood for
                        pancakes, then I'm all about the
                        blueberry flapjacks with scrambled
                        eggs and sausage... Or if I'm just
                        looking for a little slice of heaven,
                        the crunchy Luxembourg toast with a
                        side of bacon is kingdom come.

                                 ANDY
                        Then it's decided. Crunchy Luxembourg
                        toast with a side of bacon.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                                 (
                                  smirks
                                       )
                        We'll get that right out for you.

           INT. MINDY'S CAFE [C] -- MORNING

           Another day. Andy sits in the same booth. He smiles at Piper
           as she approaches.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Any questions about the menu?

                                 ANDY
                        I'm feeling the blueberry flapjacks
                        with scrambled eggs and sausage.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Coming right up.

           INT. MINDY'S CAFE [C] -- MORNING

           Yet another day. Andy at the same booth again. Now Piper
           seems amused by this.

                                 ANDY
                        Seems like a cinnamon roll and latte
                        kind of morning.
                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Be right out.

           He's growing on her.

           INT. MINDY'S CAFE [C] -- MORNING

           Another day. Andy twirls his menu, doesn't even need it.

                                 ANDY
                        I was considering the California
                        scramble since it's so popular... But
                        I just can't get my mind off that
                        Luxembourg toast with a side of
                        bacon, so I'll have to go with that.

           Piper can't help but like this guy.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        You got it. 

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, and Addison?

           She turns back. Andy takes a breath, then --

                                 ANDY
                        What would you say to hanging out
                        sometime after your shift?

           That actually sounded smooth. She smiles coyly.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        You got a name? "Dude from the cafe"
                        sounds kinda sketchy.

                                 ANDY
                        Maddox.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Maddox... It's nice to meet you.  

           His turn to smile.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- EVENING

           Andy and Piper sit at a booth, eating frazbursnakles and
           drinking root beer floats. The place is mostly empty. None
           of the late night crowd just yet.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                                 (
                                  eating
                                       )
                        This is incredible. What do you call
                        it again?

                                 ANDY
                        A frazbursnakle.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I've never even heard of it.
                                 ANDY
                        Neither had I. Till I started
                        traveling.

           This gets her attention.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Where have you been?

                                 ANDY
                        You know... India, Mexico, China...

           Harry refills their water glasses, rolling his eyes.

                                 ANDY
                        ... Australia, Cuba, Italy, France --

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        France?

                                 (
                                 ANDY
                                  realizing
                                          )
                        Oh, yeah, um, it's this cute little
                        island off the coast of... Russia.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Damn. Sounds like you've been
                        everywhere.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah, I figured it's a big universe,
                        may as well explore it. You know, see
                        what's out there. Meet new people.
                        Have new experiences. Try new food.
                        Stop worrying and start living.

           He takes another bite, playing it cool like it's no big
           deal. And it's working. Piper's intrigued.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        So where's the coolest place you've
                        been so far?

                                 ANDY
                        If I had to choose just one... The
                        Republic of Marovia. It’s this tiny
                        little country. It's not even on most
                        maps. But it's got this incredible
                        vibe. Everyone wears these really
                        bright colored clothes, and their
                        hair is just wild. And they have this
                        incredible music that you'll never
                        hear anywhere else. Like there was
                        this one song --

           He hums the melody of the song that he danced to at Kyle's
           raging party. Drumming his hands on the table, getting into
           it. He sounds ridiculous, but it's making Piper smile.
                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        That sounds awesome.

                                 ANDY
                        It was awesome. For a while. But it
                        just wasn't home.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        So where is home?

                                 ANDY
                        I guess I'm still looking for it.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I think we all are.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        But I don't get it. What's someone
                        like you doing in a town like Sutton?

                                 ANDY
                        Just passing through. Till I figure
                        out the next big adventure.

           A moment between them as they look into each other's eyes.

                                 ANDY
                        What about you? You work at a cafe...
                        Ever think about opening your own
                        place?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                                 (
                                  laughs
                                       )
                        I wouldn't even know where to start.

                                 ANDY
                        Well, how about the name.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                                 (
                                              )
                                  playing along
                        Okay, what should I call it?

                                 ANDY
                        I don't know. What about... The Cat's
                        in the Cradle?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I like that.
                                 (
                                  thinking about it
                                                  )
                        It could have these big comfy
                        chairs... Board games...

                                 ANDY
                        And it'd only serve hot dogs and mac
                        n cheese.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Yeah, but like really upscale and
                        artisanal. Kid's food for grownups.
                                 ANDY
                        Of course. What about pizza?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Obviously there'd be pizza. And
                        gelato. Gotta have gelato.

                                 ANDY
                        Sounds perfect.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I'm seriously getting excited about
                        this.

                                 ANDY
                        I seriously am too.

           They're leaning in closer now.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        You'll have to come back and visit
                        sometime to see it.

                                 ANDY
                        Maybe I'll stick around for a while.
                        I'm starting to like this town.

           Piper smiles.

           EXT. FOREST TRAIL [C] -- NIGHT

           Piper carries a small lantern and leads Andy down the trail.

                                 ANDY
                        Where are we going?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        You'll see.

           The trees and underbrush open up to reveal --

           EXT. POND [C] -- CONTINUOUS

           An old, wooden dock that stretches out into the pond. Piper
           turns off the lantern. Andy stares at the reflections of the
           moon and stars dancing across the gently rippling water. A
           secluded place full of wonder. 

                                 ANDY
                        How have I never been here before?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        How could you have been?

                                 ANDY
                        I don't know... Just figured someone
                        would've told me about it before now.
                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        That's the cool thing about this
                        town. There are so many little nooks
                        and crannies that most people don't
                        even bother with.

           They stare up at the stars. It's so beautiful.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        You should be honored, you know. I
                        never bring anyone here. It's my
                        place to think.

                                 ANDY
                        So what are you thinking about?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        The usual stuff. Like when can I get
                        another one of those frazbursnak-
                        things.
                                 (
                                  smiles, beat
                                             )
                        But I'm also thinking, what if I
                        never leave this town? Or what if I
                        do leave and never want to come back?

                                 ANDY
                        What if you don't need to decide
                        tonight?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I guess I don't have to.

           A moment between them. Just the gently lapping water.

           Then Andy begins to hum "Cat's in the Cradle." Piper looks
           over, unsure if she should laugh. But Andy holds out his
           hand, asking her to dance.

           She takes it and steps closer to him. He holds her as they
           begin to slow dance to his tune.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        You dance a little funny.

                                 ANDY
                        How do you like to dance?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        It doesn't matter. I like this.

           She leans her head on his shoulder.

                                 ANDY
                        Addison?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Yes?

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you.
                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        For what?

                                 ANDY
                        For bringing me here.

           She smiles up at him.

           He leans forward slowly. And their lips meet. Softly,
           sensually. There's magic between these two.

           They wrap their arms around one another in what couldn't be
           a more perfect moment as the stars twinkle above them.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK:

           EXT. POND [C] -- MORNING

           Andy opens his eyes as the morning sun creeps over the
           trees. He's laying on a blanket in the grass near the dock.
           But Piper isn't laying next to him.

           He sits up. Then sees her sitting on the end of the dock,
           feet dangling in the water. She smiles as he approaches.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Good morning.

                                 ANDY
                        Good morning, yourself.

           He sits next to her. Rolls up his pant legs and dangles his
           feet in the water. 

                                 ANDY
                        You know, I think I might have found
                        my new favorite place in the world.

           She considers him for a moment. Then looks away, something
           weighing on her. 

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        It's crazy, isn't it? How someone new
                        can come into your life and just
                        change everything.

                                 ANDY
                        Totally.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I think you're one of those people
                        for me.

                                 ANDY
                        Seriously?

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I was up all night thinking about
                        what you said. And I figured it out.
                                 (MORE)
                                 PIPER [ADDISON] (CONT'D)
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        I want to open that restaurant.

                                 ANDY
                        That's great. You totally should.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        But then I realized... How am I
                        supposed to know anything about food
                        if this town is all I've ever
                        experienced? I have to go out there
                        and see and taste and smell all the
                        world has to offer. Just like you
                        did.

                                 ANDY
                        Sure... Yeah, after your gap year is
                        over, you --

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I don't want to wait that long. I've
                        been waiting my whole life. It's time
                        I start doing.

           Certainty in her eyes that wasn't there before. And a
           growing distress on Andy's face.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        I'm so lucky to have met you. But of
                        all people, I know that you'll
                        understand that I have to do this.

           No, he doesn't. Andy's mind is racing. How could this have
           gone so wrong? Then he blurts --

                                 ANDY
                        I'll come with you!

           Piper stiffens. An awkward laugh escapes her.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ANDY
                        Wherever you go, I'll go with you.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Maddox... I'm flattered, but let's be
                        serious. I just met you. 

                                 ANDY
                        You said that some people come into
                        your life and change everything. You
                        changed everything for me too. Since
                        the first time I saw you. 

           He means something so much deeper, but it doesn't come off
           that way to her. More just weird and desperate.
                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        Listen, I had fun last night too. But
                        let's just leave it at that, okay?

           She kisses him on the cheek. Then stands up and walks off
           the dock. Andy gets to his feet --

                                 ANDY
                        I love you!

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        What?

           She turns back, baffled.

                                 ANDY
                        I love you.

                                 PIPER [ADDISON]
                        You don't even know me.

           Totally weirded out, she goes up the trail out of sight.

           And Andy can only watch her go, alone on the dock.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- NIGHT

           Andy sits alone at the counter, nursing a root beer float.
           Burger and fries nearly untouched. Harry nearby.

                                 ANDY
                        If I hadn't brought up her
                        restaurant, she'd still be here.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        If you hadn't lied to her, she'd
                        still be here too.

                                 ANDY
                        You said be who I wanted to be.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Don't be a tipshit, kid. I meant be
                        your best self, not make someone up.

           Andy pushes the burger away with a sigh.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        My food's made for eating. Get you
                        something else instead?

                                 ANDY
                        I don't suppose you know any place
                        around here where I could crash for
                        the night?

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Got a few cots in the basement. Just
                        don't make a regular thing of it.
           INT. BASEMENT, HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- NIGHT

           The old wooden stairs creak under Andy's feet as he descends
           into the dark storeroom. Shelves of ingredients. Industrial
           refrigerators with rattling compressors. And a few OLD COTS
           with worn blankets. A couple other TRAVELERS sleep on them.

           Andy sighs and sits on an unoccupied cot. He lays down and
           it squeaks stiffly under him. He shifts around, trying to
           get comfortable.

           But his eyes remain open. Staring up at the ceiling.  

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- NIGHT

           Andy steps out the back door and takes a deep breath. It's
           quiet out here. Parking lot nearly vacant now.

           He gazes up at the starry sky. A beautiful sight, but it
           only makes him feel smaller and more alone. 

                                 MAVIR (O.S.)
                        You know one thing I do love about
                        this jumping business...

           Andy turns to see an old man, MAVIR (80s), sitting at one of
           the outdoor tables, wearing a plaid threadbare coat and hat.
           Looks more homeless than old and wise. But there's something
           familiar about him. We've seen him before...

                                 MAVIR
                        The stars are different in each
                        universe. Different clusters.
                        Different galaxies. The multiverse is
                        more diverse than piddly little us
                        could ever possibly imagine.

                                 ANDY
                        To be honest, I hadn't noticed.

                                 MAVIR
                        I didn't either. Not for years. But
                        after a while, up was the only place
                        I felt like looking.

                                 ANDY
                        Don't I know you from somewhere?
                                          )
                                 (
                                  realizing
                        Yeah... You're the fruit guy from the
                        diner. Extra cherries on your ice
                        cream sundae.

                                 MAVIR
                        Afraid you're mistaken, young man. I
                        don't even know what cherries are.
                                 (
                                  chuckles
                                         )
                        I bet you met another me. Funny how
                        big and how small the multiverse can
                        be at the same time.

                                 MAVIR (CONT'D)
                                 (
                                  extends his hand
                                                 )
                        Name's Mavir. You're welcome to sit,
                        you know.

                                 ANDY
                        Just needed a little air. Was gonna
                        head back in.

                                 MAVIR
                        It's not like you'll get any sleep
                        down in that crusty old cellar
                        anyway. Sit down, son.

           Andy hesitates, then takes a seat at the table.

                                 MAVIR
                        Tell me somethin'. This other me...
                        Was there a woman with him? Sandy
                        blonde hair, green eyes, a smile that
                        makes you feel like the luckiest guy
                        in the world.  

                                 ANDY
                        Not that I saw. He was by himself.

           Mavir nods, small and accepting. Sighs.

                                 MAVIR
                        Her name's Zora. She was my wife. At
                        least, for a while. I didn't realize
                        what I had, and... Well, I made a
                        mistake. And she left. She was right
                        to. And you know what I did? I ran
                        away to find a universe where she
                        didn't know what I'd done.

                                 ANDY
                        Did you find it?

                                 MAVIR
                        Oh, I've met plenty of different
                        Zoras. Just not my Zora.

                                 ANDY
                        Well how long have you been looking?

                                 MAVIR
                        Thirty-four years.

           Andy stares at him, unblinking. Oh shit...

                                 MAVIR
                        That other me... Was he happy?

                                 ANDY
                        Umm... I don't know. Seemed like it.

           Mavir smiles wistfully.
                                 MAVIR
                        Good for him.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        I keep hoping that one of these days,
                        I'll press that button and wind up
                        back where I came from. I figure...
                        Maybe after being gone for so long,
                        she'll have forgiven me.

           A long moment passes. Something weighing on Andy's mind.

                                 ANDY
                        I was looking for someone too. But...
                        I'm starting to think maybe I'm not
                        meant to find her. The crazy thing
                        is... When I first left, I was
                        thinking about someone else.

           Andy hesitates. Then meets Mavir's gaze.

                                 ANDY
                        I wanted my family back. I wanted to
                        find a place where we were what we
                        used to be... Before my mom died. But
                        no matter how many different versions
                        of our house I step into, she's never
                        there.

                                 MAVIR
                        What was she like, back where you
                        were from?

           Andy takes a shaky breath.

                                 ANDY
                        She was the only person who could
                        make a shitty day better. She had
                        this dream of being a scientist. Or
                        at least a science teacher. Her and
                        my dad were saving up so that she
                        could take classes and get her
                        degree. But then I came along, and
                        she gave it all up... For me. That's
                        just the kind of person she was. The
                        sad part is, after she died... My dad
                        turned into the same sad drunk as the
                        guy who hit her with his car. He just
                        sat in his chair, and I sat in my
                        room. I wanted nothing to do with
                        him. I left him all alone back there
                        with a couple hundred bucks.

           They sit in silence, each weighed down by their demons.
           Mavir gazes up at the stars.

                                 MAVIR
                        You know... Maybe there's some
                        advanced creatures out there who've
                        really figured it out.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAVIR (CONT'D)
                        Like they can pinpoint the exact
                        universe they want to go to. The one
                        that's perfect just for them.

                                 ANDY
                        You think there's a universe out
                        there where your wife loves you?

                                 MAVIR
                        I've gotta believe there is. Why else
                        would I keep pressing the button?

           Andy nods. Wanting to believe it's true.

           INT. BASEMENT, HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- MORNING

           Andy opens his eyes. Sunlight streams down the staircase. He
           sits up and stretches his neck. Not a comfy night's sleep.
           He sees Mavir on a nearby cot --

           But something's wrong. The old man's eyes are open. And he's
           not breathing. Andy scrambles to him.

                                 ANDY
                        Mavir? Mavir?!

           Realization spreads across his face.

           EXT. CEMETERY, WOODS, NEAR HARRY'S HAMBURGERS [C] -- EVENING

           A small cemetery amongst the trees, sparsely populated with
           GRAVES. The headstones show only dates. NO NAMES.

           Andy, Harry, and a few other weary Travelers stand around a
           mound of dirt. A fresh grave.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        What did you say his name was?

                                 ANDY
                        Mavir.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Mavir... Maybe you'd like to say a
                        few words about him?

                                 ANDY
                        I just met him last night.

           Harry nods. Not the first time this has happened.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Well then, Mavir was a good customer.
                        Ate every last fry. Paid in full.
                        Left a nice tip. It was a pleasure
                        cooking for him. He'll be missed.

           Andy stares at Mavir's grave. Then his eyes wander over the
           nearby blank headstones. All the unnamed travelers who never
           found what they were looking for.
           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- NIGHT

           Harry raises his milkshake in a toast. Andy and all the
           other Travelers do the same.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        To Mavir... May he find peace and
                        prosperity in that last universe of
                        all.

           They all clink glasses and sip their milkshakes.

           Except for Andy, who is deeply troubled.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [C] -- LATER

           Andy sits alone at the counter. He stares at his phone,
           scrolling through PHOTOS FROM HIS HOME UNIVERSE. Piper with
           her arm around him. Kyle making a ridiculous face. With both
           of his parents when he was young.

           He keeps swiping past more memories, each one another punch
           in the gut. Doesn't look up as Harry approaches.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Kid, I got a strict no loitering
                        policy. You gotta go outside. See the
                        world. Live a little.

                                 ANDY
                        You know Mavir had been traveling for
                        thirty-four years? And all he wanted
                        to do was go home.
                                  beat
                                 (
                                     )
                        This whole multiverse thing's a sham.
                        I'm through with it.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Well then, you could do worse. This
                        universe here ain't too bad.

                                 ANDY
                        I'm not staying here. I'm going home.

           Harry stares at him.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Kid, the odds of you finding your
                        universe are beyond impossible.
                        Winning the lottery, getting struck
                        by lightning, those are cakewalks
                        compared to this.

                                 ANDY
                        There has to be a way. I mean, look
                        at this. 

           He pulls out his Jumper, pointing to its triple infinity
           symbol.
                                 ANDY
                        That's a logo. Someone built this. If
                        they can figure out how to get me
                        here, they can figure out how to get
                        me home.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        You're forgetting one thing, kid.

           He takes the Jumper from Andy's hand and waves it around.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        These things don't work. You press
                        that button and POOF! You're gone.
                        That's why every Jumper is different.
                        None of 'em ever caught on. Who would
                        ever make more than a prototype if
                        the prototype makes you vanish into
                        thin air and never come back?
                                 (
                                                     )
                                  hands him the Jumper
                        Now my advice is to find yourself
                        some nice little universe where no
                        one hates ya and nothin's gonna eat
                        ya. Then live out your life.

                                 ANDY
                        I don't want to live in some random
                        universe! I WANT TO GO HOME!

           Silence around the diner. All the other Travelers turn,
           staring at him with pity.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Kid... If I had a quigly for every
                        time some Traveler said that, I could
                        close this joint down and retire.

           Andy picks up his Jumper, desperation taking over.

                                 ANDY
                        It's a random jump every time, right?
                        So if I keep pressing the button,
                        eventually I'll get home.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Or eventually you'll wind up like
                        Mavir. I've been running this place a
                        long time. No one, and I mean no one,
                        has ever found their way home.

                                 ANDY
                        Then I guess I'll be the first.

           His finger hovers over the button.

                                 HARRY [GARY]
                        Come on kid, don't do it. You're
                        wasting your --
           But Andy PRESSES THE BUTTON and THE BACKGROUND INSTANTLY
           CHANGES AROUND HIM --

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- CONTINUOUS

           A NEW VERSION of the diner. Harry approaches with an
           EXTREMELY LONG BEARD. 

                                 HARRY
                        Looks like you had a day, kid. What
                        can I --

           Andy presses the button again --

           BEGIN TRAVEL SEQUENCE

           WE STAY ON ANDY AS THE BACKGROUND RAPIDLY CHANGES AROUND HIM
           EVERY TIME HE PRESSES THE BUTTON, cycling through universe
           after universe in the blink of an eye.

           Every time, it's a different version of the diner. Different
           uniforms. Different paint. Different colored stools.

           HE PRESSES THE BUTTON - Lands in a universe where everyone
           is dressed in FURRY WINTER COATS and eating FRAZBURSNAKLES.

           PRESSES THE BUTTON - The diner becomes an ELEGANT DINING
           ROOM, everyone in tuxedos and evening gowns, eating their
           food using only their mouths.

           PRESSES THE BUTTON - VIKINGS dance and raise their mugs of
           mead high, singing a drinking song.

           PRESSES THE BUTTON - A communist soup kitchen, everyone
           wearing dull, faded clothes. GIANT BANNERS show an OLD WHITE
           MAN'S STERN FACE, dictator style.

           The pace rapidly accelerates, ANDY ALWAYS REMAINING CONSTANT
           AS THE BACKGROUND CHANGES.

           He lands in a diner where there are ONLY WOMEN. Another
           where there are ONLY MEN. Another where he's the only one
           NOT IN A HAZMAT SUIT. Another where he's surrounded by
           NEANDERTHALS EATING RAW MEAT at their booths.

           Andy keeps pressing the button, desperation taking over. But
           in every version of the diner, there is stranger clothing.
           Stranger foods. Stranger decor. Stranger music. 

           Andy's agitation grows. But he keeps pressing the button.
           Diner after diner. Universe after universe.

           Day transitions to night.

           Back to day.

           Back to night.

           We can't even tell anymore.
           But Andy can't stop. His eyes become bloodshot. Stubble
           grows on his face.

           Each button press becomes more tired. Methodical. The speed
           of universes passing around him slows down. He doesn't even
           glance around anymore. Not even bothering.

           All hope fades from Andy's expression as the daunting
           realization takes hold. This truly is impossible.

           He can barely keep his eyes open anymore. He presses the
           button one more time --

           And THE STOOL CRUMBLES TO ASH BENEATH HIM.

           Andy collapses to the ground. The Jumper tumbles out of his
           hand. He's too tired to even reach for it. His exhausted
           eyes close as we PULL UP AND AWAY TO REVEAL --

           THE BURNED OUT SHELL OF THE DINER IN A NUCLEAR WASTELAND.

           Everything is blackened by fire and ash. All of the trees
           are charred toothpicks pointing to the dismal gray sky. No
           greenery. No signs of life. Everything dead.

           And Andy lays in the center of it.

                                                          FADE TO BLACK:

           Silence.

           Then distant, muffled sounds. They gradually grow louder.
           Echoey. Hard to make out.

                                                                FADE IN:

           Andy slowly opens his eyes to see he's in --

           INT. BASEMENT, HARRY'S HAMBURGERS [UNIVERSE D] -- NIGHT

           The basement of the diner. But in this universe, it looks
           like a survivalist's fallout shelter.

           Shelves full of nonperishable food. Bins of supplies.
           Hodgepodged suits of protective gear that look like
           something out of a post apocalyptic nightmare. Everything
           dirty and singed, like it was pulled from a fire. 

           Andy sits up with alarm. Where the hell am I?

           But then the echoey sounds take shape around him... And to
           his surprise, it sounds like --

           LAUGHTER. Lively conversation.

           Warm candlelight draws Andy towards the other end of the
           space. The voices grow louder as he approaches. They begin
           to sound familiar as Andy steps around a shelf to see --
           PIPER, KYLE, and IRIS, along with SEVERAL OTHER FACES we
           might recognize from high school. Their clothes are tattered
           and blackened by soot. Kyle stands in front of the group,
           drawing on a chalkboard.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Stick! / Line! / Trough! / Animal!

           Andy's jaw drops. Are they playing Pictionary?!

           Kyle draws what looks like a stick figure animal. An upside
           down top hat. Then an emphatic arrow from one to the other.

                                 EVERYONE
                        Hole! / Rat hole! / Rabbit catcher!

           Kyle emphasizes the arrow. Andy stares. How are they not
           getting this?

                                 ANDY
                        The Cat in the Hat?

           All of them turn, startled to see Andy standing there.

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        Bingo! Five points for the new guy.

                                 IRIS [ALICE]
                        No way, how did you get cat in the
                        hat out of that?

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        Cuz I'm an amazing artist, ain't that
                        right, new guy? How you feeling, man?

           Andy suddenly starts feeling his pockets as he realizes --

                                 ANDY
                        Where's my stuff? Where's my Jumper?!

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        All your stuff's right there. Don't
                        worry, you're safe with us.

           Andy sees his things nicely arranged on the nearby table,
           most notably, his Jumper.

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks, but I gotta get out of here.

           He frantically grabs his things.  

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        What's your hurry?

           Andy slows and meets her gaze.
                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        You've gotta be hungry. We just
                        whipped up some stew. Why don't you
                        have a bowl with us before you go?

           She's dirty and disheveled... And yet, she has the same
           sparkle in her eyes that he's always known.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay.

           INT. BASEMENT, HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [D] -- LATER

           Andy sits at an old table with all of them, eating stew.

                                 ANDY
                        So how long has it been like this?

                                 IRIS [ALICE]
                        How long has what been like this?

                                 ANDY
                        The diner. The world. Life.

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                                 (
                                  chuckles
                                         )
                        Listen to this guy. Where are you
                        from, man? You just crash here on a
                        spaceship or something?

                                 ANDY
                        No, I... I live in a bunker too. Only
                        it's a lot... Bigger... With a lot
                        more people... I'm part of the
                        resistance.

                                 IRIS [ALICE]
                        Resisting who exactly?

                                 ANDY
                        The ones that did this to us.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Did what to us?

                                 ANDY
                        You know... I mean...

           He stops and thinks about it. Sighs.

                                 ANDY
                        You know what... Screw it. I don't
                        have any idea what's going on here.
                        I'm a parallel universe traveler.

           They all stare at him for a long moment.

           Then Kyle slams his hand on the table, beyond excited.
                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        I told you guys! I told you! I've
                        been saying it for months, all these
                        strange people in their strange
                        clothes with their strange accents,
                        who always show up out of nowhere and
                        are in such a rush to leave. They
                        must be from some kind of other
                        dimension. And you all said I was
                        crazy. But could I be more right?!
                        Could I be more right?!

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        You're not joshing us? You're
                        seriously from... Another universe?

                                 ANDY
                        Swear to God. That is, if you believe
                        in a God around here.

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        Could I be more right?!

                                 IRIS [ALICE]
                        Thanks. Now he's never gonna let us
                        live this down.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        So what was your universe like? It
                        must've been pretty bad if you
                        decided to leave.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah... I mean, kinda. I guess.

                                 IRIS [ALICE]
                        Was there acid rain that melted
                        everything?

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        Or nargons that ate everyone alive?

                                 IRIS [ALICE]
                        Or some disease that turned everyone
                        into flesh eating corpses?

                                 ANDY
                        Not really, no. I was just sorta...
                        Depressed. Thought I needed a change.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Well, you're welcome to stay here as
                        long as you like.

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks.

           He takes a spoonful of his stew.
                                 ANDY
                        This is really good by the way.

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        Yeah, thank Mary. She makes
                        everything around here.

                                 ANDY
                        It's really good, Mary.

           Piper smiles back at him.

           INT. BASEMENT, HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [D] -- LATER

           Most of the candles are out now. Deep, steady breathing from
           the cots.

           Andy and Piper sit in two beat up comfy chairs.

                                 ANDY
                        Do you miss it? The old world?

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        What's there to miss?

                                 ANDY
                        I don't know... Everything?

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Have you ever read one of those books
                        where the characters are on some far
                        off alien world?

                                 ANDY
                        You mean science fiction?

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Yeah. Have you read any of those?

                                 ANDY
                        A lot of them actually.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Do you ever miss those places?

                                 ANDY
                        Umm... Maybe in some ways, like,
                        wouldn't it be cool to be there or
                        see that. But they're not real.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Well, the old world, it's not real to
                        me. It's just stories, same as the
                        science fiction books. This is the
                        only world I've ever known. And I'm
                        okay with that.

           A moment as Andy takes this in.
                                 ANDY
                        I wrote a science fiction story once.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Really? What's it about?

                                 ANDY
                        It's called "The Unfathomable
                        Adventures of Aaron Anders." This guy
                        Aaron has this spaceship that lets
                        him travel to any alien planet in the
                        blink of an eye. He goes on all these
                        crazy adventures and meets this...

           He trails off, becoming self conscious.

                                 ANDY
                        It's just this stupid comic I was
                        tinkering around with when I was
                        bored.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        It doesn't sound stupid.
                                 (
                                  smiles
                                       )
                        You're him. You're Aaron Anders.

                                 ANDY
                        What? No, not at all.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        You have a device that lets you go
                        anywhere you want in the blink of an
                        eye. Sounds a lot like your story.
                        Maybe you're just missing the
                        adventure part.
                                 (
                                  has a thought and smiles
                                                         )
                        Come on. I'll take you on one.

           She takes his hand and leads him towards a MAKESHIFT HATCH.

                                 ANDY
                        Where are we going?

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Outside.

                                 ANDY
                        But... Isn't that dangerous?

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        That's why it's an adventure.

           EXT. RUINS OF HARRY'S HAMBURGERS [D] -- CONTINUOUS

           Piper and Andy emerge from the hatch. Her eyes rise to the
           pitch black sky. 

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Wait for it...
                                 ANDY
                        Wait for what?

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        There!

           Andy follows her gaze... And his jaw drops.

           LIGHTING STREAKS ACROSS THE NIGHT SKY from horizon to
           horizon. Only this isn't like the lightning we know. The ash
           clouds make it appear in GORGEOUS COLORS. Oranges. Purples.
           Reds. An otherworldly light show. Stunning to behold.

                                 ANDY
                        Whoa...

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        See? Not all fire and brimstone.
                                 (
                                  laughs
                                       )
                        Well, kind of fire and brimstone.

           They take in the mesmerizing sight.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        You know, there actually is one thing
                        I wish we had from the old world.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        When I was a little girl, my dad
                        found this old record player with a
                        big bin of records. We cranked the
                        little wheel on the side, and
                        listened to them over and over again.
                        We played them until they faded away,
                        and we couldn't hear them anymore.
                        But I can still hear the songs in my
                        head sometimes. 

           She starts humming a tune, and we realize that it's "Cat's
           in the Cradle." Andy smiles at her.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        What?

                                 ANDY
                        I've got something for you.

           INT. BASEMENT, HARRY'S HAMBURGERS [D] -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy leads Piper to his things and picks up his PHONE. 

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        What is that?

                                 ANDY
                        It's kind of a lot of things, but
                        most importantly, it's a music
                        player. It's got a couple thousand
                        songs on it.
                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        But it's so small.

           He opens the music app. Hits play.

           HARRY CHAPIN'S "CAT'S IN THE CRADLE" plays. 

           Piper's jaw drops as the song begins. She listens intently,
           tears welling up in her eyes.

                                 KYLE [JAMES] (O.S.)
                        What is that? Is that music?!

           The others quickly come over from their bunks. In awe of the
           music filling the basement.

           They gather around, listening to the old song that we could
           hear anytime we want. But for them, this is a moment they'll
           never forget.

           Andy watches with a broad smile on his face. The best he's
           felt in a very, very long time.

           EXT. RUINS OF HARRY'S HAMBURGERS [D] -- TWILIGHT

           Andy, Piper and the others emerge from the basement. Andy
           has his things, ready to go.

                                 KYLE [JAMES]
                        You sure you can't stay longer?

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        I already tried. He can't stay. He
                        has more adventures waiting for him.

           She exchanges a smile with Andy.

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. I've got places to go.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        But here. Take this.

           He hands Piper his phone. She accepts it like a rare
           treasure, genuinely touched.

                                 ANDY
                        Just... Skip over all the Justin
                        Bieber stuff. It was a phase.

           He pulls out his Jumper, finger on the button.

                                 PIPER [MARY]
                        Safe travels. 

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks. And for what it's worth, this
                        is the coolest universe I've been to
                        so far.
           He presses the button. And the world around him vanishes in
           an instant --

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- DAY

           Andy looks around to see that everything once again appears
           normal. Green trees. Cars parked in the lot. And most
           importantly, the diner with its glowing neon sign.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- DAY

           Andy sits down at the counter as Harry comes out from the
           kitchen, toweling off his hands.

                                 HARRY [LARRY]
                        What can I get ya, kid? Looks like
                        you had a day.

                                 ANDY
                        Actually Larry, I'm having a great
                        day. But listen, before I drop any
                        cash, I've got a question for you...
                                 (
                                  smiles
                                       )
                        What's cool to do around here?

           EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP -- DAY

           Andy sits in the driver's seat of a CHERRY RED CONVERTIBLE
           SPORTS CAR. The dash is sleek and modern, like a Tesla.

           We recognize the car salesman sitting next to him is DARRYL,
           Andy's old boss from the grocery store. His name tag reads
           "Falcon." And he still looks like a douche.  

                                 DARRYL [FALCON]
                        Zero to sixty in 2.2 seconds. Goes a
                        thousand miles on a single charge.
                        And you can go fully autonomous with
                        the touch of a button.

                                 ANDY
                        Sounds dizzy, Darryl. Let's see what
                        this bad boy can do.

                                 DARRYL [FALCON]
                        My name's not Darryl.

                                 ANDY
                        Sorry, you look like a Darryl.

           Andy presses the 'on' button and takes the wheel. The car
           begins to move.

           But not forward. IT LIFTS OFF INTO THE AIR.

           It's a freakin' FLYING CAR!
           EXT. SKY ABOVE SUTTON -- DAY

           Wind billows through Andy's hair as he screams with elation,
           SOARING THROUGH THE SKY. Darryl hangs on for dear life.

                                 DARRYL [FALCON]
                        Slow down! Slow down!

           But Andy just speeds up and flies higher, causing Darryl to
           scream too.

           Andy gazes over the side, taking in the picturesque bird's
           eye view of his town. From up here, it's breathtaking. He
           zooms down, flying past the diner and its neon sign.

                                 DARRYL [FALCON]
                        If you put a dent on this baby, it's
                        gonna be my nipper!

                                 ANDY
                        Shut up, Darryl!

           He jets off into the clouds.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Close on ANDY'S EYES, filled with skepticism. Cut back to
           reveal --

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SUTTON -- DAY

           Another universe with a normal looking version of his town.
           Except for one thing.

           EVERYONE IS NAKED.

           Young people, old people, attractive people, awkward people.
           Going about their business, cool as cucumbers. Strategically
           placed objects prevent us from seeing any actual nudity. But
           ANDY SEES EVERYTHING.

           And he looks pretty self-conscious, the only one wearing any
           clothes. But then he steels himself.

                                 ANDY
                        Screw it.

           He pulls off his shirt. Drops his drawers.

           Then walks into town like he owns the place, arctic white
           ass cheeks and all.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD, FOREST -- DAY

           Another universe. Andy walks down the dirt road towards town,
           surrounded by dense trees on either side. He's sweating more
           than normal. A lot more buzzing insects than normal too.

           He spots a bright YELLOW ROAD SIGN up ahead. An ANIMAL
           CROSSING sign. But as he draws closer, his eyes narrow.
           On this sign is the silhouette of a TYRANNOSAURUS REX.

           THUMP... THUMP... THUMP... Behind him. Andy slowly turns.
           Eyes widening as he sees --

           A T-REX CROSSING THE ROAD.

           Andy takes in the sight of the gigantic beast with a mixture
           of awe and terror. But mostly terror. The T-Rex slows, and
           turns its enormous head towards him. Andy SCREAMS.

           But the T-Rex just eyes him quizzically, canting its head
           like a confused dog.

           Then Andy notices a bridle around it's head. Is it
           domesticated? He takes a cautious step towards the beast.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. RANCH -- DAY

           Andy decked out in a swank dinosaur skin cowboy hat, dusty
           brown shirt, rugged cargo pants, and cowboy boots. He helps
           a KID climb onto the saddle ATOP A JUVENILE T-REX.

                                 ANDY
                        There you go. Now just swing your leg
                        over. Don't worry, he won't bite.

           Around him, other COWBOYS help kids onto the backs of small
           dinosaurs. THEY'RE TEACHING THEM HOW TO RIDE.

           HARRY RIDES BY ON A FULL SIZE T-REX, driving a HERD OF
           TRICERATOPS through a grassy field as if they were cattle.

           We follow him, revealing a RUSTIC LOG CABIN OF A DINER, with
           a sign proclaiming, "Teddy's All-Night Triburgers."

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy wears his dino cowboy gear as he eats a triburger and
           sips a milkshake.

           But his attention is focused on the TABLET he's drawing on.
           Like an iPad, but larger with a different interface.

           On it, he DRAWS A TRAVELER'S GUIDE TO THIS UNIVERSE in his
           typical comic book style. Complete with sections that talk
           about domesticated dinosaurs, food recommendations, places
           to visit, etc.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- LATER

           Harry stands behind the counter, looking at Andy's Universe
           Guide on the tablet with a raised eyebrow.
                                 ANDY
                        So it's like a travel book,
                        travelogue, guide book, sorta thing.
                        Has what to do, where to go, what to
                        eat, what not to eat, local currency.
                        That sorta stuff.

           As he speaks, Harry swipes, revealing ANOTHER UNIVERSE GUIDE
           for one Andy previously visited. And another. And another.

                                 ANDY
                        I just figured you could hand them
                        out to travelers when they arrive, so
                        they don't feel quite so lost.

           Harry eyes him.

                                 HARRY [TEDDY]
                        You know what, kid... That’s a pretty
                        dongo good idea.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - DIFFERENT UNIVERSE GUIDES come off VARIOUS PRINTERS:
           archaic, hyper advanced, and everything in between.

           - The pages are picked up by DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF HARRY,
           who stands next to Andy wearing different outfits.

           - Harry hands out the Universe Guides to TRAVELER AFTER
           TRAVELER as they come into the diner. Each one looks at it
           with their own kind of gratitude.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Another universe. Andy sits at a booth, drawing its guide. 

           Shuffling papers draw his attention to the counter where TWO
           TRAVELERS are discussing each other's universe guide books.
           Andy smiles, proud.

                                 WAITRESS (O.S.)
                        Hi, what can I get ya?

           Andy looks up, recognizing her voice. It's PIPER. Dressed in
           the diner's waitress outfit. Andy is caught off guard for a
           moment. Didn't expect to see her here.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        Or if you need a few minutes, I can
                        come back.

                                 ANDY
                        That's okay. Let's see, I'll have...

           He flips through the menu, taking in the exotic cuisine.
           Piper notices his half-finished universe guide drawing.
                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        Wait... Are you the one who's been
                        drawing these? You're Andy?! THE
                        Andy?!

           From the sound of her voice, she's talking to a celebrity.

                                 ANDY
                        Uh... I guess so?

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        Holy gobbersmack, that's nanzers!
                        I've been collecting every one of
                        your guides I can get my hands on.

           She pulls a folded stack of papers out of her apron, all
           Andy's Universe Guides.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        I've been saving my tip money for
                        months so I can just take off and
                        jump.
                                 (
                                  thinking
                                         )
                        Hey... Would you maybe be willing to
                        go on one or two jumps with me? You
                        know, just to show me the ropes.

                                 ANDY
                        I mean, yeah, I'd be...

           But then he stops himself, thinking about it more.

                                 ANDY
                        Actually, uh...
                                 (
                                  reads name tag
                                               )
                        Larkin. The truth is, I'd love to
                        travel with you. But I don't want you
                        to make a decision you'll regret.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        Wait, seriously?

                                 ANDY
                        A wise man once told me not to go to
                        a parallel universe. Not gonna lie, I
                        should have listened to him.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        But there's nothing for me here. This
                        universe is downright lomidic
                        compared to all the others out there.

                                 ANDY
                        Let me guess. You have a lot of what
                        if's?

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        I mean... A few, kinda, sure. 

           She has some big ones.
                                 ANDY
                        Jumping to another universe won't
                        make them go away. Of all the
                        universes I've been to, you know
                        which one I miss the most?
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        The one I started in.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        Must've been way dizzier than mine
                        then.

                                 ANDY
                        Not really. It's pretty middle of the
                        road as far as universes go.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        Then what's there to miss?

           Andy takes a moment, considering.

                                 ANDY
                        I miss the chances I never took. I'll
                        never get to tell the girl I loved
                        that I loved her. I'll never be able
                        to help my dad get better. I'll never
                        get the comic that I poured my heart
                        and soul into read by anyone else.
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        If you're looking for something, stay
                        here and go after it.

           Piper is taken aback. Not what she wanted to hear.

                                 ANDY
                        But hey, it's your choice. If you
                        really want to go, I'll trade you my
                        jumper right now.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        For what?

                                 ANDY
                        How about a side of fries?

           He takes out his Jumper and sets it on the table.

           Piper carefully picks it up, turning it over in her hand.
           Imagining the possibilities. She looks up at Andy, staring
           into his eyes, trying to read his story.

           Then she sets the Jumper back down.

                                 PIPER [LARKIN]
                        Jerry will come take your order. Safe
                        travels, Andy.

           Andy watches her head towards the kitchen. She takes off her
           apron and hands it to Harry as he comes out.
           Then she turns and walks out the door.

           Harry watches, stunned. Then heads over to Andy.

                                 HARRY [JERRY]
                        What'd you tell her?

                                 ANDY
                        The truth.

           Not what Harry was expecting. But he nods, understanding.

                                 HARRY [JERRY]
                        Twigler with cheese and a root
                        bubble float, on the house.

           Andy nods his thanks.

           He glances out the window, watching Piper walk off towards
           her life.

           He may have done the right thing, but he's still alone.

           INT. BASEMENT, HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy lays on his cot in the darkness, drawing on his tablet,
           illuminated by its glow. Other Travelers are fast asleep.

           ON SCREEN: A comic book style drawing of him alongside his
           parents. Piper next to him, his arm around her. Warm smiles
           on all their faces.

           He stares at it. His own perfect universe.

           Then he swipes an eraser across the image to delete it.

           He sets down his tablet, and just lays there, awake and
           alone in the darkness amidst the other sleeping travelers.

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- DAY

           Andy steps outside. Sighs. Another day, another universe.

           He pulls out his Jumper. Without fanfare, he presses the
           button and lands in --

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS [UNIVERSE E] -- DAY

           Andy looks towards the diner's omnipresent neon sign,
           getting his bearings. 

           But it's not there.

           Confused, he turns around and sees --

           THERE IS NO HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS.

           In its place is a boxy INDUSTRIAL BUILDING, far bigger than
           the diner. Long since ABANDONED, surrounded by a decade's
           worth of growth. Dark windows. Ominous quiet.
           For the first time in any universe Andy has seen, there are
           not even remnants of the diner. It never existed here. Andy
           takes in the sight with a hint of sadness.

           But the SOUND OF A REVVING ENGINE turns his head as --

           A FUTURISTIC CAR barrels down the road, hovering a few feet
           off the ground.

           Andy jogs out to the road, giving him a clear view of a
           FUTURISTIC TOWN in the distance. Holograms dance above
           buildings. Flying vehicles in the sky. It feels straight out
           of a sci-fi novel that he would read.

           Intrigued, he sets off towards the town. He passes by an OLD
           CORPORATE SIGN beside the driveway, OBSCURED BY OVERGROWN
           VINES. He doesn't even notice it.

           But we do. And behind the growth, we can just make out
           something familiar...

           A TRIPLE INFINITY SYMBOL.

           The same logo we've seen over and over on Andy's Jumper.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SUTTON [E] -- DAY

           Andy wanders down main street, gawking at the sights. It's
           still his town, but unlike any version he's ever imagined.

           Everything is sleek and elegant with minimalist design.
           Businesses tout robotic maids, language learning microchips,
           and lab grown organic meat. Every holographic logo has
           dazzling colors. The CITIZENRY wear form-fitted clothes and
           computerized accessories on their heads and wrists. 

           It sure looks like the future, but a hologram in a window
           claims March 4, 2018. Maybe the dark ages never happened.

           PIPER comes down the sidewalk, walking her DOG that zips
           around sniffing with a hover pack. There's something even
           more striking about her here. Like the foxy sci-fi girl of
           his dreams.

           Andy watches her move closer. Wanting to approach...

           But something comes over him. He steels himself, steps out
           of her way, and simply smiles politely as she passes.

           And that's when he sees it.

           Amidst the futuristic shops, one stands out with its bold
           simplicity. Like a next century Apple Store...

           Only ITS LOGO IS A TRIPLE INFINITY.

           Andy stares, scarcely believing his eyes.

           With trembling hands, he pulls out his Jumper. The logo is
           exactly the same.
           His gaze returns to the store. Other shoppers breeze past
           him and step through the door, like it's any other shop.
           Andy follows them inside...

           INT. TRIPLE INFINITY STORE [E] -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy looks around, in a state of nervous awe. Holographic
           phones. Advanced computers. AR headsets.

           But NO JUMPERS IN SIGHT. Nothing even resembling one.

                                 HARRY [ZARRY] (O.S.)
                        Help you find something, sir?

           Andy turns to see HARRY. Clean cut. Hair coiffed. In a slick,
           one piece uniform with a triple infinity logo. Not quite as
           sexy as many of the younger folk, but even he looks freakin
           cool. His name tag: "Zarry"

                                 ANDY
                        Whoa. What are you doing here?

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        What am I doing here? What are you
                        doing here?

           Still the same old Harry. Andy holds up his Jumper.

                                 ANDY
                        I'm looking for whoever made this
                        thing.

           Harry eyes the Jumper, downright baffled. Is this a joke?

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        What the huzu is it?

                                 ANDY
                        What do you mean, what is it? It's
                        got your logo on it!

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        Looks like a cheap knockoff, kid.
                        Hope you didn't pay much for it.

                                 ANDY
                        It's not a knockoff. It's beyond the
                        real deal. Listen, I really need to
                        meet whoever made it.

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        How would I know who made it? I don't
                        even know what it is.

                                 ANDY
                        It's a --

           Andy takes an exasperated breath. So close... This can't be
           happening...
                                 ANDY
                        Alright, Zarry. This is going to
                        sound crazy, but I swear to you that
                        it's true...

           Harry doesn't look convinced of anything yet.

                                 ANDY
                        I'm a parallel universe traveler... I
                        came here, using this device... And I
                        know that someone in this universe
                        built it.

           Employees and customers glance over. Who is this crazy guy?

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        Cute story, kid. But I've got a low
                        tolerance for practical nokies. I'm
                        gonna have to ask you to leave.

           He grabs Andy by the arm and ushers him towards the door.

                                 ANDY
                        I'm serious, Zarry, or Harry, or
                        Barry, or whatever you like to go by,
                        I couldn't make this up!

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        Then apparently you made a wrong
                        turn, cuz in our humble world,
                        parallel universe travel doesn't
                        exist. We're old school round here.

                                 ANDY
                        Listen, I know you! You've been in
                        practically every universe I've seen.

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        You don't know me, kid.

           He's about to shove Andy out the door --

                                 ANDY
                        Yes I do! And you shouldn't be here,
                        you should be running your diner!

           Now THAT stops Harry in his tracks.

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        What did you say?

                                 ANDY
                        You should be running your diner. You
                        know, big neon sign by the road, or I
                        suppose holographic sign around here.
                        All the comfort food a person could
                        want after a rough day. With good
                        music to set the mood. And it's open
                        all night long.
           Harry doesn't blink, like he's seen a ghost.

           Then he rummages around his pocket and pulls out a flexible
           device that unrolls into a screen. Touches it to reveal --

           A SKETCH OF THE DINER. As Andy stares at it, it lifts off the
           screen, becoming a hologram. ZARRY'S ALL-NIGHT ZAMBURGERS.
           The blueprint for his dream. Just like Andy described it.

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        I've never told a soul about this...

                                 ANDY
                        Well, I've been there. It's one of
                        the best places around.

           He holds up his tablet, swiping through his universe guide.
           Past version after version of the diner in all its neon glory
           before Harry's wide eyes.

                                 ANDY
                        Please. I just want to go home.

           Harry eyes the Jumper, beginning to believe.

           INT. TRIPLE INFINITY STORE [E] -- LATER

           Andy paces, no interest in the advanced tech around him. He
           doesn't even care about Kyle and Brad eyeing him from across
           the store in their uniforms.

           Harry steps out from the back.

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        Alright kid, you better not be some
                        sockjob, cuz I just went way above my
                        paymark for ya. Dr. Farland wants to
                        meet you face to face.

                                 ANDY
                        Who's Dr. Farland?

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        Apparently the one who built that
                        thing you're holding.

                                 ANDY
                        Dizzy. So where do I go?

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        I have no idea. I just got an E.M.
                        that said, "If he is what he claims,
                        he'll know where to meet me."

                                 ANDY
                        That's it?

                                 HARRY [ZARRY]
                        That's it.
                                 ANDY
                        But I don't...

           He trails off as a smile spreads. He knows exactly where to
           go.

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you.

           He dashes out the door, calling back --

                                 ANDY
                        And you really should open that
                        diner! You're a great chef!

           Hmm... Harry likes the sound of that.

           EXT. ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL BUILDING [E] -- DAY

           Andy jogs towards the abandoned industrial building where
           the diner usually sits. But this time, he notices the old
           sign outside, obscured by vines.

           He pulls the vines away, revealing the large TRIPLE INFINITY
           LOGO. Only now we see the company name below it --

                                   INFINITE HORIZONS

           Andy's eyes rise to the building... So close.

           INT. ABANDONED INDUSTRIAL BUILDING [E] -- DAY

           The door creaks open and Andy steps into a long forgotten
           building. Shafts of sunlight stream in, casting geometric
           shadow designs across the the wide open workspace. Aerial
           sculptures still hang from the ceiling, drifting in the
           breeze. Broken furniture and equipment are strewn about,
           covered in dust. No one's been here for a long time.

           It was a cutting edge facility once. But now, it's a tomb. A
           place where dreams died.

                                 ANDY
                        Hello? Dr. Farland?

           No answer. But he does hear something. A faint METALLIC
           CLINKING.

           Andy follows the sound, heading down a hallway, his
           footsteps echoing. The persistent clinking grows louder. He
           rounds a corner into a --

           RESEARCH LAB [E]

           Scattered shafts of light illuminate advanced machinery that
           was long ago left to rust. Years more advanced than ours,
           and somehow even more troubling in its lifelessness.
           But the clinking metal sound is no longer faint. It's coming
           from in here. Andy steps forward, looking around. And he
           realizes, he's not alone.

           There's A WOMAN sitting with her back to us at the far end
           of the lab, tinkering with a sputtering holo projector,
           fixing it. Clinks from her tools.

           Andy eagerly moves towards her. She senses someone behind
           her and turns to face him.

           But in all of the universes Andy has been to, nothing can
           prepare him for this...

           IT'S HIS MOM. 

           His breath catches as he stares at the woman he hasn't seen
           since he was a boy. She may be dressed differently, but
           there's no mistaking her face. Her eyes. 

           A long moment passes as these two take each other in. The
           inventor and her test pilot. The mother and her son.

                        You're him... You're really him...

                                 ANDY
                        I am...

           She shuts off the hologram and steps forward, looking over
           Andy with the glee of a scientist whose impossible theory
           has been proven right.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        You have to understand my skepticism.
                        There've been many other so-called
                        universe travelers over the years.
                        People who take pleasure in rubbing
                        failure in my face --

                                 ANDY
                        You're anything but a failure.

           He pulls out his Jumper and holds it out. She takes it from
           him with the utmost delicacy. Mesmerized by it. He watches
           her every move for the subtlest detail, trying to restrain
           his emotions, knowing that to her, he's just a stranger.

                        it when no one was listening. After
                        the character in the book. Mulliver's

                        Gulliver... I like that too.

                        back. I mean, look around you. This
                        used to be our lab. This little
                        gadget basically ended my career. And
                        here you are now, telling me it
                        actually works?

                                 ANDY
                        Oh, it works. And there are others
                        like it out there. From different
                        inventors in different universes.

                        I'll show you.

           He pulls out his tablet and sets it down. Scanning through
           his artwork of all the places he's been. Dinosaurs. Flying
           cars. Nuclear apocalypse. And many more.

           Andy stares, on the verge of breaking down. Hugging her.
           Telling her everything. But he doesn't. He holds it back.

                                 ANDY
                        I did. Once.

                        I think so. Her life wasn't anything
                        like this. But she had a son.

           Dawn smiles at the thought.

                                 ANDY
                        No. Not at all. 

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        What about you? You've been all over
                        the multiverse... What were you
                        looking for?

           She's standing right in front of him. He forces a smile.
           This is very hard for him.

                                 ANDY
                        When I left, I was looking for a lot
                        of things. But now, I just want to
                        get back.

           Dawn considers him for a long moment, on the same page.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        It took me a while, but I realized
                        that sending someone into a parallel
                        universe is kind of like sending them
                        into space. It seems hard to get them
                        there, but then you learn, it's even
                        harder to bring them back. 

                                 ANDY
                        Believe me, I know.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        But I think I know why the back
                        button doesn't work.

           She touches a small button to the left of the forward arrow.
           A button that has never done anything for Andy.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        We tried to chart the universes 
                        mathematically, like coordinates on a
                        map. But the multiverse is infinitely
                        more complicated than that. The human
                        mind is the only computer complicated
                        enough to navigate it. If I'd been a
                        mother, like the other me you met, I
                        might have figured it out sooner.

           A moment as this sinks in for Andy.
                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        You're unique. We're all unique. You
                        may be ninety-nine percent similar to
                        a million other yous out there. But
                        there is at least one thing about you
                        that makes you different than all the
                        rest.

                                 ANDY
                        That's a nice sounding theory.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Well it's more than just a theory. I
                        built a prototype.

           She lifts a hard case off the floor and sets it on the
           table. Flips the latches and opens the lid. Inside is a U-
           SHAPED DEVICE WITH A SIMILAR DESIGN AS ANDY'S JUMPER, and an
           ADVANCED HEADSET in the shape of a Greek laurel crown.

           She pulls out the device and SNAPS IT ONTO THE BASE OF
           ANDY'S JUMPER, a perfectly designed accessory. As she does,
           the crown comes to life, pulsing with glowing light.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        I had to build it myself because the
                        company would never fund it. The idea
                        is that it taps into your memories.
                        Memories that are unique only to you
                        and your universe. Your memories
                        provide the navigational coordinates,
                        and the machine matches them.

                                 ANDY
                        And this thing... It works?

           Uncertainty from Dawn.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        In theory. I've never had any data to
                        plug into it. You're the first real
                        multiverse traveler I've ever met.
                        So... It might work. Or you might
                        vanish into oblivion.

           Well that's ominous. Andy doesn't like the sound of it. He
           stares at her invention. But then something comes over him.
           He chuckles, amused it's come to this.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        What is it?

                                 ANDY
                        Swing the bat.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Swing the what?

                                 ANDY
                        Just go for it.
           Dawn sees his determination. He believes in her.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        I just realized... You're the most
                        extraordinary person I've ever met...
                        And I don't even know your name.

                                 ANDY
                        Andy.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Andy... That's a nice name.

           She smiles. Then opens the Jumper, revealing its holographic
           buttons whirring with energy. She presses a rapid sequence
           of keys. The accessory and headset respond in kind, humming
           with a higher pitch.

           She lifts the headset and sets it on Andy's head like a
           futuristic crown. Then she sets the Jumper in his hand and
           closes his fingers around it. A magical touch to Andy.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Okay... Now press the button. Only
                        don't let go until I tell you.

                                 ANDY
                        Won't I disappear the moment I press
                        it?

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Not anymore. Or at least, I certainly
                        hope not.

           Andy looks at the Jumper with the same trepidation he had
           the first time. Then presses the button, holding it down.

           He doesn't disappear. Instead, the HUMMING GROWS LOUDER AND
           LOUDER. Around the lab, lights on equipment flicker and
           flash. Sparks fly from some of them. Andy flinches, but he
           doesn't let go of the button.

           Then WISPY HOLOGRAMS MATERIALIZE in the air around him,
           projected by his headset. GLOWING DOTS OF WHITE LIGHT fill
           the room like a 3D planetarium.

           As more and more dots appear, they take on a shape
           reminiscent of A BRANCHING TREE. A stunning sight to behold.

                                 ANDY
                        Is that... The multiverse?

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Just a small part of it. Your part.
                        That's your tree. The universes in
                        which some version of you exists. Now
                        all we have to do is find yours.

           Andy gazes at the countless dots. There must be MILLIONS.
                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        I need you to think back, Andy. Think
                        back to an event that shaped your
                        life. That changed who you are.

           Andy takes a moment, thinking...

                                                                 CUT TO:

           A RAPID-FIRE SERIES OF MEMORIES FLOW IN AND OUT OF EACH
           OTHER: Little league runners on base, parents cheering,
           Young Andy at bat, he watches the ball fly past --

           BACK TO ANDY. He looks around as a few GLOWING WHITE DOTS
           DISAPPEAR. But the vast majority remain.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        What are you thinking about?

                                 ANDY
                        Striking out in little league.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Apparently a lot of you struck out.
                        Think harder. Something more personal.

           Andy steadies his breathing. Focusing...

           RAPID FIRE IMAGES: Kids scatter for hide and seek, Andy
           climbs a tree to see Piper, their eyes meet, Andy looks
           away, missing his chance to kiss her --

           BACK TO ANDY. He watches more glowing dots disappear. But
           still too many remain to count.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        These memories are a part of the vast
                        majority of the yous out there. You
                        need to hone in on something that is
                        only yours.

                                 ANDY
                        Okay... I think I've got something.

           RAPID FIRE IMAGES: Andy steps out of the diner with the
           Jumper, trepidation in his eyes, presses the glowing button
           for the first time --

           BACK TO ANDY. A lot of dots disappear this time, making
           entire branches and limbs vanish. BUT THOUSANDS OF DOTS
           STILL GLOW around the lab.

                                 ANDY
                        No way! That many other me's jumped
                        to parallel universes?

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        In infinite universes, is that so
                        hard to believe? Keep going. You're
                        getting closer.
           But he's getting frustrated. Did every version of him make
           the same mistakes? He steels himself and tries again.

           RAPID FIRE IMAGES: Teenage Andy embraces both of his
           parents, kisses the original Piper, autographs his Aaron
           Anders Comic for adoring fans --

           BACK TO ANDY. ALL OF THE GLOWING DOTS VANISH. His heart
           sinks.

                                 ANDY
                        What happened?

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        You're not thinking of memories.
                        You're imagining something you've
                        never experienced, aren't you?

           Andy sighs, averting her gaze.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        It only works with the unique
                        signature of your memories. They're
                        your roadmap. 
                                 (
                                  softens
                                        )
                        Listen, when you're in a bad place and
                        you need to go somewhere that feels
                        like home... What do you think of?

           Andy looks her in the eye.

           And suddenly he knows...

           He takes a deep breath, closing his eyes, taking us into --

           RAPID-FIRE IMAGES: A theme park, nine-year-old Andy looks
           around with wide eyes, eats cotton candy, turns to HIS MOM
           LEADING THE WAY as she holds his hand, laughs as she tousles
           his hair, they ride a roller coaster, their hair blowing in
           the wind, smiling with elation. A perfect moment...

           The IMAGE FREEZES. And we realize we're looking at the
           FRAMED PHOTO of Andy and his Mom on that roller coaster. We
           pull out slightly to see it in his old drawer. In his
           original bedroom. In his own universe.

           BACK TO ANDY. He opens his eyes, knowing he's found it.

           And sure enough, a SINGLE POINT OF LIGHT appears in front of
           him. Dawn smiles at him with pride.

                                 ANDY
                        My mom... It was a memory with my
                        mom. The photo was always different
                        in every universe. But that was mine.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        She must be very important to you.
                                 ANDY
                        She is.

           They hold each other's gaze.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        You have to hold onto that memory.
                        When you let go of that button, no
                        matter what happens, keep hold of it.
                        If you lose it, there's no telling
                        what'll happen to you.
                                     )
                                  beat
                                 (
                        Are you ready?

           Andy eyes the jumper in his hand. Then looks back at his
           mom. And he lowers the Jumper.

                                 ANDY
                        Dr. Farland... There's something I
                        have to tell you... I...

           He looks deep into her eyes. And she seems to recognize
           something in his. She reaches out and takes his hands.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Andy... It's going to take you home.

           Andy nods.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Let go...

           He raises his Jumper. And takes one last look at his mom.

                                 ANDY
                        Thank you. For everything.

                                 DAWN [DR. FARLAND]
                        Safe travels, Andy.

           Andy smiles at her. Then lets go of the button.

           And the BACKGROUND BEHIND HIM TRANSFORMS, but not in a flash
           like we're used to. Instead, it RIPPLES WITH ENERGY.

           UNIVERSES BEGIN TO FLOW PAST, fluidly dissolving from one to
           the next.

           Andy remains constant as we catch glimpses of the many
           universes that he has visited -- Dinosaurs. Naked people.
           Apocalypse. Version after version of the diner flow past,
           with all of their various clientele.

           Andy turns his head, distracted by the sights, and suddenly
           the flow of energy takes on a darker, ominous tint. The
           universes traveling by become more abstract and
           unrecognizable. HE'S OFF COURSE.

           But ANDY CLOSES HIS EYES, focusing. FLASHES OF ANDY AND MOM
           laughing together. At the amusement park. That special day.
           And the flow of universes around him STEERS BACK ON TRACK.
           More familiar places.

           He's getting closer and closer. MORE FLASHES OF ANDY AND HIS
           MOM. Eating cotton candy. Riding the roller coaster.

           The pace of THE UNIVERSE FLOW ACCELERATES until there is a
           sudden FLARE OF LIGHT.

           And EVERYTHING STOPS...

           Andy opens his eyes to see that he's standing in --

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- DAY

           1950s music plays on the jukebox - a song that we all
           actually recognize. Andy glances over the patrons at booths,
           quietly eating their burgers and fries.

           But one of them looks familiar... It's the DOUBLE OF MAVIR.
           Eating a SUNDAE WITH EXTRA CHERRIES.

           Andy lowers his Jumper. Takes a few tentative steps. Then he
           sees --

           A MISSING POSTER on the door. With HIS PHOTO on it.

           CRASH! From behind him.

           Andy snaps around to see Harry's astonished face, fallen
           plates of food at his feet.

                                 HARRY
                        Are you... You?

           Andy looks at his name tag. It actually reads "Harry."

                                 ANDY
                        Are we... Are we at war with anyone?

                                 HARRY
                        Not officially.

                                 ANDY
                        Are humans at the top of the food
                        chain?

                                 HARRY
                        For better or worse.

                                 ANDY
                        Who's the leader of this country?

                                 HARRY
                        Still Trump.

                                 (
                                  sighs
                                 ANDY
                                 )
                        I guess I can live with that.
           Harry smiles.

                                 HARRY
                        Welcome home, kid.
                                  toughens up
                                 (
                                            )
                        You ran out of vacation days a long
                        time ago.

           Andy can't wipe the smile off his face.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SUTTON -- DAY

           Andy RUNS TOWARDS TOWN, passing the weathered sign that
           reads, "WELCOME TO SUTTON." He slaps the side of it as he
           goes by, letting out a LOUD CHEER. Thrilled to be back.

           He runs down main street, beaming at all the familiar
           places. "Mindy's Cafe." "Miller's Guns." Both liquor stores.
           The marquee on the movie theater now reads, "Spider-Man 8:
           The Return."

           Then he notices a MISSING POSTER WITH HIS PHOTO in a shop
           window. THEY'RE IN EVERY SHOP WINDOW. ON EVERY LAMP POST.

           Several PASSERSBY double take as he runs by.

                                 PASSERSBY
                        Is that... / Oh my God, he's alive!

           EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Andy runs towards his house. Even in all its simplicity and
           disrepair, it has never looked so good.

           INT. ANDY'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Andy hurries through the door and looks around. The house is
           still a mess. But something feels different about it...

           The sound of a voice leads him into the DINING ROOM, where
           he is astonished to see --

           The room has been turned into "Find Andy" Mission Control.
           Stacks of Missing Person fliers. A banner signed by tons of
           volunteers. Maps of the state and country covered with pins.

           His dad sits at the table, focused on a laptop with a phone
           to his ear. He's still scraggly and unshaven. But there's a
           sense of determination in him that wasn't there before. The
           desperate determination of a father who misses his son.

                                 CHARLIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Yes, I understand that his story has
                        already been featured on your
                        newscast, so all I'm asking for is an
                        update, get his picture on the air,
                        anything --

                                 ANDY
                        Dad?
           Charlie turns. He drops his phone on sight of his son and
           springs out of his chair, knocking it over. He stares at
           Andy, not believing his eyes.

           And in this moment, Andy realizes just how much pain he's
           caused him.

                                 ANDY
                        I'm so, so sorry.

           Charlie wraps Andy up in the tightest hug he's ever felt.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I missed you so much.

           Andy holds him close. It's good to be home.

           INT. ANDY'S BEDROOM -- DAY

           Andy walks into his room and looks around. Everything just
           as he left it. The art on the walls. The books on the shelf.

           He steps over to his desk, opens the drawer, and gazes down
           at the framed photo of him and his mom on the roller
           coaster. His salvation.

           Andy picks it up. Then he takes another picture off the wall
           over his desk, and hangs the framed photo of his mom right
           in the center for him to see. That's where she belongs.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

           Andy strides down the familiar hall. All eyes are on him in
           shocked disbelief.

                                 STUDENTS
                        Oh my god, Andy?! / Welcome back,
                        man. / So glad you're okay. / I
                        thought you were dead.

           Andy ad libs hellos. He's not a face in the crowd anymore.

           Kyle comes running down the hall towards him.

                                 KYLE
                        Andy?! Jesus Christ, man! Where the
                        hell have you been?!

           Andy shrugs, keeping his cool. 

                                 ANDY
                        I just said screw it.

                                 KYLE
                        You just said screw it?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. You should try it too.
           Up ahead, Andy sees Piper walking with her group of friends.
           The real Piper. The one he's always loved.

           She stops upon seeing him.

                                 PIPER (O.S.)
                        Andy?! Oh my God!

           She rushes over and practically tackles him with a hug. A
           warm welcome that makes him smile, but there's something
           more pressing on his mind. He gently pushes her back.

                                 ANDY
                        Piper, there's something I have to
                        tell you. I want you to know that...
                        You're dizzy.

                                 PIPER
                        What?

                                 ANDY
                        You're great. You're the best you.
                        And don't let anyone ever tell you
                        otherwise.

           And with that, he turns and walks off down the hall, leaving
           everyone standing there. Huh?

                                 PIPER
                        Andy, wait! What happened to you?
                        Where have you been?

           Andy looks back. Everyone stares, waiting for an explanation.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        So here's a what if... What if you
                        disappear without a trace for months
                        on end, and then you show up out of
                        the blue, and everyone wants to know
                        what happened to you. What do you do?
                                 (
                                  beat
                                     )
                        Well in my case, I told the truth. I
                        went on a mind bending journey across
                        parallel universes in search of a
                        deeper sense of happiness and meaning,
                        and ultimately decided to come back.
                        So... Mostly the truth.
                                     )
                                 (
                                  beat
                        And then I got sent to lots and lots
                        of therapy.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy is in his waiter uniform once again, moving through the
           diner, right at home.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        But after a while, everything settled
                        back to normal, like I'd never left.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANDY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I was even able to catch up on my
                        classes and graduate on time. And
                        through it all, there was only one
                        person who believed every single word
                        that I said...

                                 HARRY
                        Order up!

           Andy takes the burgers from Harry and delivers them to a
           table of TRAVELERS.

                                 ANDY
                        Can I get you anything else?

                                 TRAVELER
                        Do you have any uchabeck?

                                 ANDY
                        Sure thing.

           He grabs ketchup off an adjacent table and hands it over.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- LATER

           Andy sits at the counter, on his break. He eats a
           frazbursnakle, drinks a root beer float, and draws on his
           tablet. It's a guide to this universe. His home.

           He comes to the "What To Do" section... And stares at it,
           thinking about it for the first time.

           Harry comes out of the kitchen and wipes down the counter.

                                 ANDY
                        Hey Harry... What's cool to do around
                        here?

                                 HARRY
                                 (
                                  confused
                                         )
                        What's cool to do around here?

                                 ANDY
                        Yeah. You know, why'd you choose to
                        live in this universe over all the
                        others out there?

                                 HARRY
                        What are you talking about? This is
                        my universe.

                                 ANDY
                        Wait, seriously? You've been running
                        this place for all these years and
                        you never left?

                                 HARRY
                        Never even thought about it.
                                 ANDY
                        How could you have never even thought
                        about traveling?

           Harry smirks.

                                 HARRY
                        I never said I didn't travel, kid.

           HARRY'S OFFICE

           Harry opens the door and Andy peers into a small, cramped
           office with invoices and receipts piled high on the desk.

           But the walls are FILLED WITH PHOTOS. Tons of photos. HARRY
           WITH HIS WIFE AND KIDS in exotic locales ALL OVER THE WORLD. 

                                 HARRY
                        You ask what’s cool to do around
                        here? Kid, what isn’t cool to do
                        around here?

           Andy ogles the photos, jaw hanging open.

           Harry in Tokyo. Berlin. Paris. Chicago. Machu Picchu. Angkor
           Wat. At temples in Greece and India. In front of pyramids,
           Egyptian and Mayan. Holding exotic animals in the Outback
           and jungle. Atop skyscrapers and in underground caverns.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s a huge world out there. And
                        you've got your whole life ahead of
                        you. So live the hell out of it.

           He heads back into the diner. Andy's eyes wander over all of
           the photos of Harry filling the walls. He's been everywhere.

           A life well lived.

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- LATER

           Most of the travelers are gone now. Just a few regulars,
           including Mavir eating another cherry-covered sundae.

           Andy's eyes drift fondly over the empty diner. The counter,
           stools, neon signs. His home away from home. He sighs.

           Then removes his apron. Pulls off his hat. Walks up to
           Harry, who's wiping down an already spotless table.

                                 ANDY
                        Harry, it’s been a blast working
                        here. But it's time for me to go.

           He holds out his apron and hat.

                                 HARRY
                        Like I said, kid. It's best I work
                        nights alone.
           Harry takes the uniform. Then cracks a smile.

                                 HARRY
                        But for what it's worth, if I had an
                        employee of the month, you'd be it.

                                 ANDY
                        Thanks, Harry. Oh, one more thing...

           Andy picks up his bag and pulls out a printed TRAVEL GUIDE.
           He hands it to Harry. In the "What To Do" section it simply
           reads, “Everything!” Harry smiles.

           Andy extends his hand.

                                 ANDY
                        And just so you know, you make the
                        best damn burgers in the multiverse.

                                 HARRY
                        Thanks, kid. But I already knew that.

           Harry proudly shakes his hand.

           Andy heads towards the door, but stops next to Mavir's
           table. The old man looks up at him, not knowing Andy's
           history with his other self.

           Andy pulls out the Jumper and Headset that brought him home.
           Sets them on the table in front of Mavir.

                                 ANDY
                        Here. Focus on your best memory with
                        her, and this will take you home.

           Mavir eyes him with disbelief... And hope.

                                 ANDY
                        And after you get back, give it to
                        the next person who needs it. 

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Andy steps outside. With a deep breath, he walks away
           without looking back.

                                 ANDY (V.O.)
                        And that’s why I, Aaron Anders, left
                        Zarry’s All-Night Zamburgers. No more
                        what if's... Just what's next.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. COMIC BOOK SHOP -- NIGHT

           The walls are lined with comic books and memorabilia. Andy,
           now in his early 20s, reads at a podium in front of a SMALL
           GATHERING OF PEOPLE. GLOSSY POSTERS stand behind him with
           comic imagery from "AARON ANDERS: ACROSS THE MULTIVERSE."
                                 ANDY
                        I don't miss the multiverse. But I
                        definitely miss the burgers.

           He closes the graphic novel as those in attendance applaud
           respectably. Amongst them is his dad, beaming with pride.
           Charlie looks like a new person, clean shaven, put together,
           a spark in his eye.

           The crowd disperses and several EAGER KIDS approach Andy.

                                 KID
                        So wait, is Zarry's a real place?

                                 ANDY
                        I don't know. What do you think?

           The kid isn't so sure.

                                 ANDY
                        Tell ya what. If you ever find it,
                        make sure you order the
                        frazbursnakle. I hear it's dizzy.

                                 KID 2
                        But what do you think Zarry will do
                        now that Aaron Anders left the diner?

           The thought makes Andy smile.

                                 ANDY
                        My guess is, Zarry will probably just
                        keep doing what he does best.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           A bumping night, with a diner full of TRAVELERS from every
           universe under the sun. Dino wranglers. Goths. Hazmats.
           Vikings. And everyone in between.

           Harry emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray full of food.
           He weaves in and out of the commotion to deliver them to
           hungry guests, who waste no time digging in.

           This is his element. This is his home.

           EXT. HARRY'S ALL-NIGHT HAMBURGERS -- NIGHT

           Laughter and music filter out. More travelers emerge from
           thin air and walk through the diner's doors. Eager to swap
           stories, have some laughs, and eat frazbursnakles. Above it
           all, the neon sign glows brightly in the darkness.

           Just another night at Harry's All-Night Hamburgers.

                                                               FADE OUT.
