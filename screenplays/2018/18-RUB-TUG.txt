           INT. OFFICE - SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           JEAN MARIE GILL, late 20s, stands in front of a mirror 
           studying her cropped Steve McQueen haircut and slim build 
           in an immaculate Pierre Cardin men’s suit.  

           SUPER: Pittsburgh, 1979

           Disco music thumps from a nightclub above.  The basement 
           office is filled with velvet furniture and gold tchotchkes.  
           A Pittsburgh Steelers “Steel Curtain” banner hangs on the 
           wall.  Exotic BIRDS flutter around a big cage.  

           Jean stuffs a SOCK down her pants and appraises the bulge.  
           She adds a second sock and adjusts the bigger bulge.  

           The door opens and in walks CYNTHIA BRUNO (25), beautiful, 
           clad in a fur coat, diamonds, and a thick Texas accent.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Baby, honey, sweetheart, they’re 
                        singing the anthem.  We gotta get 
                        up there!  

           Jean continues to study her bulge.

                                 JEAN
                        What do you think?  Bigger than 
                        Terry Bradshaw’s?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        The quarterback?  Oh yeah, for 
                        sure. 

                                 JEAN
                        What about Lynn Swann?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Definitely bigger.  He’s a skinny 
                        little wide receiver. 

                                 JEAN
                        Franco Harris?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Mmm.  Maybe bigger.

                                 JEAN
                        Mean Joe Green? 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Mean Joe Green, no.  He’s like six-
                        foot-eight.  Don’t be silly.  Can 
                        we go now?
                                 JEAN
                        I’ll meet you up there. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        No, no, no.  We gotta go together.  
                        Everyone’s waiting for us.  C’mon.  
                        They’re singing the anthem!    

                                 JEAN
                        Gimme five minutes.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                            (crosses her arms)
                        You’re doing it again.   

                                 JEAN
                        What am I doin’ again?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Breaking your word, not making an 
                        effort, not doing what you 
                        promised the therapist--

                                 JEAN
                        --I promised your psychic, not 
                        your therapist--

                                 CYNTHIA
                        --Whatever.  Venus is rising and 
                        you’re in retrograde.  I need you 
                        rising, baby.  

           Jean wraps her arms around Cynthia.

                                 JEAN
                        I just gotta do a thing first.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You always gotta do a thing first.  

                                 JEAN
                        Let me tell you about tonight: 
                        we’re gonna watch my Steelers beat 
                        your Cowboys in the Super Bowl--

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Nooooo.
                                 JEAN
                        Yessss.  And then we’re gonna 
                        celebrate with a bottle of that 
                        pink champagne you like and I’m 
                        gonna put on Ella and make you a 
                        bubble bath with the cinnamon 
                        candles from Morocco.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Are you joining me in this bath?

                                 JEAN
                        What do you think?  Now I need 
                        five minutes.  Wait for me, ok?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Wait for you here?

                                 JEAN
                        Wait for me here.  Five minutes.  
                        Then we’ll go up together and 
                        watch the kickoff.    

           Cynthia devours Jean in a kiss.  Jean pulls away and 
           strides out of the office...

           ...She comes to a door at the end of the hall, enters...

           INT. BASEMENT ROOM - SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Two HENCHMEN in SUITS bookend a SCHLUBY GUY TIED TO A 
           CHAIR, pants around his ankles, arm hooked to a LIE 
           DETECTOR.  A rusty CAR BATTERY on the table beside him.  

                                 SCHLUBY GUY
                        What -- what -- what’s happening?!   

           Jean approaches silently.  There is real power in her 
           silence.  She grabs a pair of JUMPER CABLES. 

                                 SCHLUBY GUY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you gonna do with those?!

           The henchmen yank off his underwear.

                                 SCHLUBY GUY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey--

           She CLAMPS the JUMPER CABLE to his COCK.

                                 SCHLUBY GUY (CONT’D)
                        --Fuuuuuuuck!
           Jean holds the other end over the car battery terminal.

                                 JEAN
                        Are you going to lie to me?

                                 SCHLUBY GUY
                        No!  Fuck no!  

                                 JEAN
                        Are you sure?

                                 SCHLUBY GUY
                        I swear to Jesus Christ on the 
                        cross I’m not gonna lie!

           The dial JUMPS on the lie detector.  Jean cocks an eyebrow.

                                 SCHLUBY GUY (CONT’D)
                        --No! No! NO! Don’t, don’t, don’t--

                                 JEAN
                        Ok, I’m gonna give you a second 
                        chance. 

                                 SCHLUBY GUY
                        --Thank god, thank you--

                                 JEAN
                        Don’t make me hurt you.  I don’t 
                        wanna see you hurt.  I just want 
                        the truth.  Are you gonna tell me 
                        the truth?

                                 SCHLUBY GUY
                        Christ almighty, fuckin-A yes!  

           The dial JUMPS again -- a lie!  

                                 JEAN
                        It’s gonna be a late night, boys.

           Before Schluby Guy can protest, Jean SNAPS the cable to the 
           battery -- ZZZZZ!  He lets out a blood-curdling scream AND 
           WE FREEZE on Jean’s look of glee/his look of blinding pain.

                          “Based On A True Story”
           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - LATER - NIGHT

           The hottest nightclub in Pittsburgh.  Filled with 
           POLITICIANS, LAWYERS, JUDGES, COPS, and WISE GUYS decked 
           out in the height of 70s fashion.  The 1979 “Steelers vs 
           Cowboys” Super Bowl plays on a projector against a wall.

           Everyone’s head turns as Jean and Cynthia make their 
           entrance.  A crowd quickly forms around them.  Cheeks are 
           kissed, words whispered, respect given.  

           Jean’s the alpha dog in this room of gangsters and power 
           brokers; Cynthia her queen.

           relaxed, charming, cool in her gold sunglasses -- as 
           Schnable interviews her.  

                                 MIKE SCHNABLE
                        Some people call you the Queen of

                                 JEAN
                        Do they now?  

                                 MIKE SCHNABLE
                        Others call you the king.

                        So, Jean, king or queen, the sixty-

                        how’d you’d do it? 

           He holds the microphone out for her.  Jean pauses.  A thin, 
           devious smile starts to form on her face... and we PUSH IN 
           CLOSE.  CLOSER.  CLOSER...

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - PITTSBURGH - NIGHT

           An overflowing dumpster JOSTLES. 
           SUPER: Six Years Earlier

           Behind the dumpster, Jean (now in her early 20s) gives a 
           HANDJOB to a COLLEGE KID.  Her hair is long and unkempt, 
           her frayed jacket too thin for the cold.  

           The college kid comes and quickly zips up.  Jean wipes her 
           runny nose on her sleeve.  

                                 JEAN
                        ...Twenty bucks, man. 

           He pulls two crumpled tens out of his pocket.  Jean adds 
           the cash to a SMALL WAD.  

           INT. MOMMA’S BAR - LATER - NIGHT

           A gay bar filled with lesbians, homosexuals and 
           transvestites.  Jean, at the bar, rocks in place -- eyes 
           alive and furious -- as she hustles a HIPPIE LESBIAN.

                                 JEAN
                        You can finish off most of these 
                        hard-on’s inside a minute.  Count 
                        it down like the moon launch.  
                        Three, two, one... Neil 
                        Armstrong’s in fuckin’ orbit!

                                 HIPPIE LESBIAN
                        I don’t gotta use my mouth?

                                 JEAN
                        No, sweetie.  Save that pretty 
                        little mouth for me.  Way we do it: 
                        I supply the boys, you do the 
                        jerking.  Five goes in my pocket, 
                        fifteen in yours.  

                                 HIPPIE LESBIAN
                        What happens if they want more 
                        than my hand?

                                 JEAN
                        They’ll go home disappointed and 
                        bloody.

           Hippie Lesbian laughs, unsure if Jean is serious.  Jean 
           laughs darkly.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        There’s a fortune to be made on 
                        the streets.  
                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Every fella’s on strike or 
                        unemployed and they’re all hard 
                        up.  This city is primed to get 
                        fucked--

           SEVERAL COPS barge into the bar, blowing WHISTLES.     

                                 BARTENDER
                        Fag raid!  

           Everyone scatters.  A COP slams Jean against a wall.  
           Enraged, she KNEES him in the nuts.  

           He curls into a ball to the floor.  Jean CACKLES -- BAM! -- 
           COP #2’S NIGHTSTICK SLAMS INTO HER FACE.

           EXT. MOMMA’S BAR - LATER - NIGHT

           Police march the gays, lesbians, and transvestites through 
           a gauntlet of NEWS PHOTOGRAPHERS and into POLICE VANS.  
           Most cover their faces in shame except for...

           ...Jean.  She emerges, nose-bloodied, with her cuffed hands 
           raised defiantly high and shoots the cameras a lethal grin. 

           INT. CITY BUS - DAY

           A week or so later.  Jean sits in the back of the bus as it 
           passes through the heart of dystopian 1973 Pittsburgh: 

           Burnt-out buildings.  Dumpster fires.  Trash-strewn 
           sidewalks.  Skid row for blocks.  The streets are filled 
           with JUNKIES, PIMPS, and STREET HOOKERS. 

           The bus passes several factories where STRIKING STEEL 
           WORKERS hold up signs, march, and fight with STRIKE 
           BREAKERS.  

           A BUSINESSMAN sits down next to Jean.  Her eyes roam 
           covetously over his SUIT.  He misinterprets her gaze for 
           flirtation.  She forces a thin smile and looks away.

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Jean gives a SHY COLLEGE KID a handjob behind the dumpster.  

                                 SHY COLLEGE KID
                        Don’t look at me... turn the other 
                        way... don’t look at me...

           He comes in her hand and takes his time zipping up.  Jean 
           snaps her fingers, waiting to get paid -- the kid 
           hesitates, then BOLTS away without paying.
                                 JEAN
                        Oh you little shit.

           She chases him through the alley, past a few STREET HOOKERS 
           (whom we’ll meet soon) working the boulevard. 

                                 STREET HOOKER #1/BIG AMY
                        Get ‘em, honey!

           EXT. SIDE STREETS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Jean’s losing ground.  The kid disappears down an alleyway.  
           She begins to head back when something catches her eye: a 
           storefront with ASIAN LETTERING.  

           A BLUE COLLAR GUY brushes past her and enters.  Jean peers 
           in the window: a THAI GIRL escorts Blue Collar Guy through 
           a beaded door curtain.  MAN #2 trots out of the parlor.  He 
           gives Jean a wink and moves off.  Jean enters.

           INT. THAI MASSAGE PARLOR - NIGHT

           A sign behind the counter reads:

                               MEN ONLY 
                             30 minute $5 
                             60 minute $10  

           Another WELL-DRESSED MAN is whisked into a room.  A THAI 
           GIRL in a kimono appears in front of Jean-- 

                                 THAI GIRL
                        Men only.  

                                 JEAN
                        What are ya’ll selling here?  What 
                        is this place?

                                 THAI GIRL
                        Massage.  Men only.  

                                 JEAN
                            (looks around)
                        Massage huh?

                                 THAI GIRL
                        Men only. 

           Two more BUSINESSMEN enter the parlor.  Jean continues 
           looking.  An idea beginning a form.  A fuse has been lit. 
           INT. PITTSBURGH PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           Jean leans against a bookshelf, reading “How To Start A 
           Small Business.”  She looks around, slips the book in her 
           bag.  She stalks the aisles, stealing more BOOKS.  A 
           suspicious LIBRARIAN begins to follow her--

                                 LIBRARIAN
                        Ma’am?

           Jean makes a run for the exit AND WE CUT TO:

           EXT. THREE RIVERS BANK - DAY

           Jean paces outside the bank, looking uncomfortable in a 
           dress.  A tattered briefcase dangles by her side.  She 
           works up courage and strides inside.

           INT. THREE RIVERS BANK - LOAN OFFICE - LATER - DAY

           Jean, out of her element, fidgets across from GEORGE 
           HERZFELD, a balding loan officer on a power trip. 

                                 HERZFELD
                        A massage parlor?  Downtown?  
                        Downtown Pittsburgh?  

                                 JEAN
                        Yeah, yes sir, that’s right.  

                                 HERZFELD
                        Have you ever been downtown?  It’s 
                        full of bums and whores.    

                                 JEAN
                        I live downtown. 

           His skeptical look morphs into a smile as SALLY MAITE (25) -
           - a wholesome apple pie secretary -- brings him coffee.  

                                 HERZFELD
                        Thanks, babe.  Something different 
                        with your hair?  Curls?  Yeah?  
                        Let me see that smile.     

           She forces a smile and walks away as he lights a Merit.  
           Jean swallows her disgust.  

                                 HERZFELD (CONT’D)
                        So where’s your prospectus?  

                                 JEAN
                        My what?
                                 HERZFELD
                        Business plan?  
                            (off her befuddled look)
                        About yay big?  It’d be in your 
                        briefcase.

                                 JEAN
                        I don’t have one of those.

                                 HERZFELD
                            (scanning her paperwork)
                        See you left your education blank.  
                        College?

           Jean slowly shakes her head, no.  He checks a box--

                                 HERZFELD (CONT’D)
                        ...High School?

           Jean just looks at him.  He checks another box--

                                 HERZFELD (CONT’D)
                        Gonna take that as a “no.”  

                                 JEAN
                        So listen, I’ve done about every 
                        job in the want-ads, right?  
                        Pushed a mop...

           FLASH ON: Jean mops the floor of a steel refinery.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        ...served greasy food to greasy 
                        assholes... 

           FLASH ON: Jean edges past tables with an armful of plates 
           in a greasy spoon diner. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        ...whatever it took to survive, 
                        believe me, I’ve made a dollar 
                        doin’ it.

           FLASH ON: Jean rips out asbestos from a dust-filled attic.

                                 HERZFELD
                        Mhmmm. 

                                 JEAN
                        But you can’t work for the man, 
                        you gotta be the man.  I don’t 
                        have your “plans” and 
                        “perspectives,” but I got a nose 
                        for people and--
                                 HERZFELD
                        I’m afraid the answer is no.  

           Jean leans back in her chair.  

                                 JEAN
                        No?  No what?  You ain’t even 
                        heard my ideas for this parlor.
                            (reaches in her pocket)
                        --few written down here--

                                 HERZFELD
                        I’ve heard enough, Miss Gill.  
                        Thank you.

           EXT. THREE RIVERS BANK - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Jean dejectedly crosses the parking lot.

                                 SALLY MAITE (O.S.)
                        Miss Gill?

           The wholesome secretary, Sally Maite, holds up Jean’s 
           tattered briefcase she left inside.  Jean takes it -- the 
           latch slips and several stolen library books tumble out.  

                                 JEAN
                        Your boss is a fuckin’ asshole.  

           Jean turns to go.  Sally feels sorry for her.  

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        You can try the city.  

                                 JEAN
                        How’s that?

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        The city revitalization program.  
                        They’re giving away old buildings 
                        to new businesses.  

                                 JEAN
                        Givin’ away?  For free?  Just 
                        “here you go?” 

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        If you qualify.  If your business 
                        is a morally-upstanding addition 
                        to the community.  

           ON Jean, thinking...
                                 JEAN (V.O., PRE-LAP)
                        Praise the lord!

           INT. COURTHOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

           Jean, holding a KING JAMES BIBLE, sits across from a bow-
           tied CITY OFFICIAL looking over an APPLICATION. 

                                 CITY OFFICIAL
                        Praise the lord, indeed.  A new 
                        congregation would be a welcome 
                        addition to the northside.  

                                 JEAN
                        We’ll be taking a real hands on 
                        approach to the word of god. 

                                 CITY OFFICIAL
                        That’s wonderful.  All I need is 
                        your ordination materials and I 
                        can submit your application. 

                                 JEAN
                        My what?

                                 CITY OFFICIAL
                        Your ministry certificate.  You’re 
                        an ordained minister, correct?

           Jean purses her lips...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           A PREACHER dunks Jean’s head into a baptismal pool.     

           INT. CHURCH - BACK OFFICE - LATER - DAY

           The preacher stubs out a cigarette and signs a ministry 
           certificate.  Jean counts out $100 in cash.  

                                 JEAN
                        This will square me with the city?

                                 PREACHER
                        And the lord, ma’am.  

           She slides over $100, he slides over the certificate.
           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Jean holds court in a back booth, surrounded by several 
           street hookers dressed in skirts and faux fur: SWEET MARIE, 
           LADY BIRD, LITTLE JANE, BIG AMY, SMOKEY, THREE TUG MARY and 
           the confused-looking wholesome bank secretary, Sally Maite.  

                                 SWEET MARIE
                        I suck cock, Jean, I don’t rub 
                        backs.

                                 LADY BIRD
                        Yeah I don’t wanna rub a buncha’ 
                        strangers.  That’s gross. 

                                 JEAN
                        Gross?  You stick your tongue up 
                        five assholes a night and 
                        massaging a guy’s back is gross?

                                 LADY BIRD
                        I don’t do the tongue thing 
                        anymore.

                                 BIG AMY 
                        Sure you don’t.  

                                 SMOKEY
                        I make two hundred a night on the 
                        boulevard. 

                                 JEAN
                        You’re gonna make four a night 
                        workin’ for me, Smokey.

                                 SALLY MAITE
                            (puts up a hand)
                        Excuse me.  Jean, you said this 
                        was a massage parlor.  

                                 JEAN
                        Yeah.

                                 SALLY MAITE

                        Pros.  To a gal.  And I want you 
                        to join us.

                                 SALLY MAITE
                            (incredulous)
                        I’m sorry?
                                 JEAN
                        You’re gonna be our -- what do 
                        they call it -- CFO.

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        CFO?  You’re talking about a 
                        brothel; I’m a secretary.  

                                 JEAN
                        I’m third generation hillbilly.  
                        Everyone starts somewhere.  And we 
                        are not a brothel.  

                                 SMOKEY 
                        We’re not?  Jean, no man is gonna 
                        pay more to get their shoulders 
                        rubbed than their balls sucked.  

                                 JEAN
                        What if they got both?

                                 LITTLE JANE
                        Then we are fuckin’ them?

                                 JEAN
                        Oh yeah.

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        This is immoral. 

                                 JEAN
                        So’s workin’ for that grab-ass at 
                        the bank.  You wanna keep smiling 
                        pretty for him or run a real 
                        business with me?  

           Sally thinks.  Jean turns back to the girls--

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Ladies, it’s like this: every 
                        fella wants to get laid.  But alot 
                        of these fellas are too 
                        embarrassed to go to a whorehouse 
                        or the boulevard.  These fellas 
                        will come to us because no one’s 
                        too shy to get a massage.  
                        Understand? 

           Some nods in the group.  Others remain on the fence.

                                 SWEET MARIE
                        What if they just want a massage?  
                        We still hafta fuck ‘em?
                                 JEAN
                        Everyone’s gonna leave my parlor 
                        happy one way or another.  
                        Including all of you.  What’s your 
                        split with that greasy pimp, 
                        thirty seventy?  I’m gonna make it 
                        fifty fifty.

           The girls nod amongst themselves, that’ll work.

                        lower.

           Jean pays more attention to the man’s crew-cut hair than 
           the massage.  She leans forward, staring AND WE CUT TO:

                        They don’t squirt in six minutes, 
                        it’s an extra five bucks a minute 
                        until they do.

                        loosen the muscle. 

           Jean, still studying the muscular man’s crew cut, runs a 
           hand through her own hair.

                        over more dollars: twenty for

           Sally Maite does her nails behind a desk with a name plate 
           that reads: Sally Maite, CFO.  Jean blows into the room--

                                 JEAN
                        We papered half the town with 
                        flyers.  Where the fuck is 
                        everyone? 

           Sally pushes a newspaper forward: “Steel Mill Closed!”  
           Three Thousand Out Of Work”.   

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        The unemployment line.  Third Mill 
                        closed this year.   

           Jean studies the newspaper.  Thinking.

           A drab, low ceiling office filled with smoke.  A long line 
           of UNEMPLOYED STEEL WORKERS waiting for their unemployment 
           checks.  Eyes move to the exits -- Jean’s girls holding up 
           signs: CASH YOUR CHECKS AT HEALING HANDS.  

           EXT./INT. HEALING HANDS - DAY

           A line snakes out the front door of the parlor.  Two dozen 
           STEEL WORKERS with unemployment checks in hand.  

           INT. SALLY'S OFFICE - HEALING HANDS - SAME TIME

           The line ends at Sally’s desk.  She cashes a check--

                        Fifty, sixty, seventy dollars, 
                        there you go.  

           WORKER #1 exits the office with his CASH.  Little Jane puts 
           an arm around him... leads him through the FOYER...

           herself, looks out the window, and marvels: the line of 
           customers is now wrapped around the building. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           A few months later.  The safe is filled with so much cash 
           it won’t close.  Jean and Sally Maite count money by hand 
           and add figures to ledgers.  Suddenly, a SCREAM.  Coming 
           from the foyer.  

           Jean grabs a LOUISVILLE SLUGGER from under the desk -- 
           strides out to find...

           INT. FRONT DESK - HEALING HANDS - CONTINUOUS

           Cynthia Bruno (now 20 years old) -- black eye, big fat rock 
           on her finger, crazed expression -- WAVING A .45 at several 
           of Jean’s girls, all of whom have their hands in the air.  

           Elton John’s “Your Song” plays on a RADIO.  TIME SLOWS TO A 
           CRAWL AS WE PUSH in on Jean.  Transfixed.  She can’t take 
           her eyes off Cynthia.  Love at first sight.  

                                 ELTON JOHN

                        I said which one of you whores is 
                        fuckin’ my husband?!  
           The room remains silent.  Cynthia suddenly FIRES -- a 
           bullet blasts out a window.  The terrified girls scream.  

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT’D)
                        That was a warning shot, next one 
                        I put between someone’s eyes!

                        That’s him.

                                 JEAN
                        Can’t say I have.  But I’d be 
                        lying if I told you he wasn’t in 
                        here every night.

                        that’s not a problem, but you 
                        gotta do something for me.  Two

                        What -- what two things?

                                 JEAN
                        First thing, put that .45 down. 
                        Second thing, come have a drink

                        carries a lotta weight in Dallas 
                        but don’t mean shit anywhere else.  

                                 JEAN
                        Cynthia Bruno from Dallas.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Then Artie brought me to 
                        Pittsburgh and made me a Caione.  

                                 JEAN
                        Artie the one give you that 
                        shiner?  

           Cynthia doesn’t answer, but of course he did.  She pours 
           Jean a shot of whiskey.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Where you from, Jean Marie?

                                 JEAN
                        Oh, here and there.  Started out 
                        in Bucks County.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Farm country.  Your daddy a 
                        farmer?

                                 JEAN
                        Horse breeder.
           INT. BREEDING SHED - 1965 - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Jean’s DADDY props a MARE’S foreleg onto a breeding board. 
           Jean, 17, face full of sweat and mud, yanks the reigns of a 
           bucking STALLION.  

                                 JEAN’S DADDY
                        Hold ‘em, Jean, hold ‘em 
                        goddamnit.  

           INT. JEAN’S OFFICE - HEALING HANDS - NIGHT

           It’s now Jean’s turn to pour a shot for Cynthia.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Was he a good daddy to you?  

                                 JEAN
                        He wasn’t so bad.  Threw me out 
                        when I was 16, but I had that 
                        coming.

           FLASH ON: Jean, 16, giving a BOY a BLOW JOB on the bathroom 
           toilet.  The door opens and Jean’s DADDY walks in.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What about your momma?

                                 JEAN
                        Oh she was a good momma.  She let 
                        me back in...

           FLASH ON: Jean going down on a GIRL.  Jean’s MOMMA walks in 
           this time.  Jean looks up from between the girl’s legs.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        ...before she threw me out for 
                        good. 

           They share a laugh.  Jean’s eyes never leave Cynthia’s.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You look at me funny. 

                                 JEAN
                        What’s funny about how I look at 
                        you?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Well, it ain’t normal.  So it’s 
                        funny.  

                                 JEAN
                        You like normal? 
                                 CYNTHIA
                        Sometimes.

                                 JEAN
                        What about other times?

           The two ladies meet eyes.  Hold.  Cynthia laughs.  Jean 
           laughs.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You’re a Scorpio.  I can tell.  
                        Scorpio all the way.  Am I right?
                        I’m right.  Me, I’m a Gemini.  
                        That makes me a talker.  I do like 
                        to talk.  

           Little Jane appears in the doorway, still scared of Cynthia-  

                                 LITTLE JANE
                        Her husband’s here.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Sonofabitch.

           Cynthia goes to stand but Jean puts a hand on her shoulder: 
           I’ll take care of this.  

           Jean grabs her baseball bat and exits the office.  

           STAY on Cynthia.  

                                 ARTIE/CYNTHIA’S HUSBAND (O.S.)
                        Where is she?  Get her out here.  
                        Cynthia?  Where is that bitch?!  

           Cynthia rises and crosses the room.  More VOICES -- an 
           argument -- YELLING -- an audible CRACK -- a SCREAM.  

           She peeks down the hall: Jean slams the bat against Artie’s 
           knees.  Again and again... 

           Artie screams in pain.  Cynthia takes a swig from the Jack.  
           Artie CRAWLS out the front door on two busted kneecaps.  

           Jean returns to Cynthia.  The bat dangles from her hand.  
           Cynthia fixes a loose strand of Jean’s hair and walks out 
           of the parlor.  Jean watches her go.

           EXT. HEALING HANDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Cynthia steps out into the cold night air, moves past her 
           husband, who’s hobbling in agonizing pain back to his car.
                                 CYNTHIA
                        I want a divorce.

                                 ARTIE
                        ...Cynthia?!

           Cynthia keeps on walking. 

           INT. DATE-A-DOLL - NICK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           NICK LAROCCA -- (27) brash, confident, wearing two gold 
           necklaces that disappear into thick chest hair -- is 
           getting a blowjob from a RED-HEAD under his desk.  

           A thin envelope dropped in front of him.  Nick looks up at 
           a RAT-FACED PIMP with rings on his fingers.  Nick lifts the 
           envelope, it sags over. 

                                 NICK
                        Why is this limp?

                                 RAT-FACED PIMP
                        I had to bring in some new girls 
                        this month.  

                                 NICK
                        What happened to the old girls?

                                 RAT-FACED PIMP
                        They all quit.  

                                 NICK
                        What do you mean, quit?  Whores 
                        don’t quit, you quit them--    

           Nick notices something.  It’s quiet in here.  Too quiet.  
           He stands.  Zips up.  Walks out of his office...

           INT. DATE-A-DOLL - BROTHEL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           ...looks around.  A few GIRLS are playing cards.  Other 
           than that, NO CUSTOMERS, the place is EMPTY.   

                                 NICK
                        What am I looking at here?

           EXT. HEALING HANDS - DAY

           Another busy day at Jean’s parlor.  The line of customers 
           extends out the front door.  A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR with 
           tinted windows rolls by ominously.  
           INT. HEALING HANDS - LATER - DAY

           Polished shoes step into the foyer.  FOUR WISE GUYS IN 
           PIERRE CARDIN SUITS.  They cut the line and waltz inside.  
           Jean turns to see them, does a slow burn-- 

                                 JEAN
                        Can I help you boys?  

           INT. BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           Jean sits in the backseat between TWO WISE GUYS.  Equal 
           parts nervous and fascinated.  Her eyes scan their flashy 
           suits, polished shoes, confident masculinity.  The Wise Guy 
           on her right-- 

           TOM CLIPP (30), stoic, muscular, meticulously tailored and 
           manicured -- meets her look.  She nods in respectful 
           approval of his suit.   

           EXT. SUDS CAR WASH/INT. LAROCCA’S CADDY - DAY

           SEBASTIAN LAROCCA (75) -- grandfatherly, spry -- sits 
           behind the wheel of an immaculate Cadillac Seville dressed 
           in a sweater and Jeans.  

           The Town Car pulls alongside of his Caddy.  Tom Clipp 
           escorts Jean into the passenger seat.  He closes the door 
           behind her.  She’s now alone with LaRocca.  Hold.

                                 LAROCCA
                        Do you know who I am?

           Jean does.  LaRocca’s the most powerful man in Pittsburgh.  
           She swallows her fear--  

                                 JEAN
                        I seen you in the papers. 

                                 LAROCCA
                        I’m told too much press is bad for 
                        business.  So be it.  Having my 
                        picture in the papers allows me to 
                        shine a light on the injustice 
                        against Italian Americans.  No 
                        other people have been as 
                        persecuted by the government than  
                        Italians.  No one.  

           Jean just nods, ok.  Larocca puts the Caddy in drive and 
           rolls into the car wash.  Time to talk business.
                                 LAROCCA (CONT’D)
                        Six months ago you were jerking 
                        off college kids in back alleys, 
                        Jean, now you’ve got the most 
                        profitable whorehouse in town.  

                                 JEAN
                        Massage parlor.  We’re doin’ ok.

           Soapy suds black out the windows.

                                 LAROCCA
                        Do you know anything about wolves?  

           Jean isn’t sure how to respond.  

                                 LAROCCA (CONT’D)
                        The forest can’t survive without 
                        the wolf.  Key to everything.  
                        It’s true, it’s science.  You kill 
                        the wolf, you got chaos.  The deer 
                        run wild, graze the land to a nub.  
                        The squirrels, the beavers, the 
                        monkeys, zebras, they all move 
                        out.  And soon the forest becomes 
                        a desert.  

           Leather tongues shimmy and sway over the Caddy.

                                 LAROCCA (CONT’D)
                        My nephew is a wolf.  The natural 
                        order of these streets begins with 
                        him.  Because he has one job: 
                        clear out the deer, which allows 
                        the grass to grow and the river to 
                        flow and nature is harmonious.  
                        It’s just science, Jean.  

           The Caddy clears the leather tongues.

                                 LAROCCA (CONT’D)
                        I’d like you to turn over your rub 
                        parlor to my nephew and come run 
                        my faggot spas.    

           The high-pitched WHINE from the car wash dryers kicks in.  

                                 LAROCCA (CONT’D)
                        None of my guys will touch this 
                        business.  But if it makes a 
                        dollar, who am I to question how, 
                        what, or why?  
           As they emerge from the wash, LaRocca hugs her.  Jean’s 
           expression is blank. 

                                 LAROCCA (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to the family.  Alright...

           Tom Clipp opens the passenger door and escorts her out.  

           EXT. HEALING HANDS - LATER - NIGHT

           Jean steps out of the Town Car, flanked by LaRocca’s wise 
           guys.  A CLOSED sign now hangs in the window.  

           INT. HEALING HANDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Nick Delucia is sitting behind the front desk with his feet 
           up, smoking, talking on the phone as they enter.   

                                 NICK (CUPS THE PHONE)
                        Box your things up, honey, I gotta 
                        hit the road in ten.  

           Nick smushes his smoke out on the carpet.  Jean, still 
           expressionless, disappears into her office.

                                 NICK (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        ...Back on the boulevard, where do 
                        you think?  They’ll get over it.  
                        Date-A-Doll’s got a full house 
                        tonight, and--  

           Behind him, the BARREL OF A 12-GAUGE SHOTGUN emerges from 
           the darkness of Jean’s office.  Nick turns in mid-sentence--  

           JEAN HAS THE 12-GAUGE AIMED DIRECTLY AT HIM.    

                                 NICK (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Call you back.  

           Nick hangs up.  Considers Jean without too much concern:

                                 JEAN
                        You got ten motherfucking seconds 
                        to get outta my parlor. 

                                 NICK
                        How about you calm down, sweetie?

                                 JEAN
                        Nine...

           She is suddenly GRABBED from behind by Tom Clipp.  He 
           WRESTLES the shotgun away from her.   
           Nick LEAPS OUT from behind the desk.  The crew descend on 
           Jean like hyenas, PUNCHING and STOMPING and KICKING.  

           Nick grabs a LAMP and SMASHES it over her head.  One of the 
           men sets fire to the curtains with a Zippo.  The gangsters 
           rain down a few more blows, until Jean is numb and 
           motionless.  They stride out of the parlor...  

           Tom Clipp looks over his shoulder at her for a brief moment 
           -- is that a look of regret? -- before he follows the 
           others out.

           Jean is dazed, face-bloodied, ribs broken, couple teeth 
           missing.  She summons all her strength and rises to her 
           knees as the BLAZE grows around her.

           INT. BATHROOM - CYNTHIA’S APT - LATER - NIGHT

           Cynthia is soaking in the tub -- no longer wearing her 
           wedding ring -- a JOINT in her mouth, cold rag over her 
           eyes -- the doorbell BUZZES -- she pulls the rag off. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CYNTHIA’S APT - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT

           Cynthia opens the door to reveal: Jean.  Blood caked to her 
           face and neck, hair full of ASH, eyes swollen, lip split.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Oh my god.

           Jean’s legs buckle and she collapses into Cynthia’s arms.  

           INT. BEDROOM - CYNTHIA’S APT - LATER - NIGHT

           Jean lies unconscious.  Cynthia cleans her wounds with a 
           pot of ice water and a sponge.  Blood swirls in the water.  

           INT. BATHROOM - CYNTHIA’S APT - DAY

           A HAND pushes the ajar bathroom mirror in place, revealing 
           Jean.  It’s a few days later.  Her face is horribly bruised 
           but the swelling has gone down.  

           She sheds her robe.  Now completely nude, she grabs a pair 
           of SCISSORS and begins cutting off her hair.  

           INT. BEDROOM - CYNTHIA’S APT - MOMENTS LATER

           Cynthia enters with a tray of food.  The bed is empty.  
           Jean comes out of the bathroom: NUDE, HAIR CHOPPED SHORT.  

           She crosses to Cynthia -- leans in to kiss her -- Cynthia 
           shies away.  Jean pushes her against the wall.  The tray of 
           food crashes to the floor.  
           Cynthia stops resisting and lets herself be kissed... 
           softly at first, then harder.  Jean tears off Cynthia’s 
           dress and presses her body against her AND WE CUT TO: 

           EXT. STOREFRONT - DOWNTOWN - DAY

           The mob is now in the rub parlor game.  WORKERS are tacking 
           up a sign “GOOD SPA” as Nick Delucia tours the building 
           with his uncle, Sebastian LaRocca, and a few other WISE 
           GUYS.  Nick puts Tom Clipp into a headlock, horsing around.  
           Clipp begrudgingly plays along.  

                                 JEAN (V.O., PRE-LAP)
                        They gotta fear you.  There ain’t 
                        no other way.  You can’t be free 
                        until you’re feared...  

           INT. BEDROOM - CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jean and Cynthia lie in each other’s arms.  Jean’s bruises 
           have now mostly healed.  

                                 JEAN
                        ...And the more you’re feared, the 
                        more free you are... to do what 
                        you want, who you want, when you 
                        want, how you want... free to be 
                        anything you want.

           Cynthia just listens quietly.

           INT. BATHROOM - CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jean pulls on a pair of men’s pants -- a leather belt 
           slides around her waist - dress shirt is buttoned -- black 
           tie snakes around her collar -- feet step into dress shoes -
           - a comb moves through her short hair -- .38 pistol is 
           wedged into her waist band.  

           EXT. CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT - SIDEWALK - DAY

           Jean steps outside dressed as she was at the start of the 
           movie: Pierre Cardin suit, Steve McQueen haircut.  

           She takes one unsteady step forward.  People brush by her 
           on the sidewalk.  She takes another step.  And another.  
           She gains more confidence with each step.

           INT. ROADSIDE BAR - NIGHT

           A gay bar just outside Pittsburgh.  Dimly lit, shades 
           drawn.  Closeted HOMOSEXUALS drink and converse in hushed 
           tones.  Tom Clipp drinks alone at the end of the bar.  
           Jean sits down next to him.  Clipp doesn’t react.  He 
           lights a Camel.  Beat.

                                 JEAN
                        I knew what you were the moment I 
                        laid eyes on you.

                                 CLIPP
                        A bookie from the northside once 
                        sat down in that stool.  The 
                        police found his body in a scrap 
                        yard the next morning.

                                 WIREY GUY (O.S.)
                        Who’s this?

           Jean turns around: a WIREY GUY wearing mascara and a 
           handlebar mustache stands behind her.    

                                 CLIPP
                        She’s the broad, the one I was 
                        telling you about.

                                 WIREY GUY
                        The dead broad?  
                            (looks at Jean)
                        I thought you were dead.  

           Jean looks from the Wirey Guy to Clipp.

                                 CLIPP
                        This is Miss Frank.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Frank Cocchiara.  No one calls me 
                        Miss Frank, understand?  I’m no 
                        faggot.

                                 CLIPP
                        Ask him why he isn’t a faggot.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Because I always ask for money. 

                                 CLIPP
                        He always does.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        And you always pay.  

           Clipp suddenly EXPLODES -- grabs Jean by the THROAT -- 
           lifts her off the barstool -- slams her against a wall!

           The bar clears out.  It’s just the three of them now.  
                                 JEAN
                        You can’t hide in this bar 
                        forever.  Some day, some how 
                        they’ll find you out!  

           This is the fear Tom Clipp lives with every day of his 
           life.  He releases her neck.    

                                 CLIPP
                        Why are you here?

                                 JEAN
                        I need a friend, and so do you.  
                            (beat)
                        LaRocca’s the only swinging dick 
                        in this town that matters, and 
                        he’s 75 fuckin’ years old.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        What is she saying?  What are you 
                        saying?

                                 JEAN
                        I’m saying it’s time he stopped 
                        mattering.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        You told me this broad was dead, 
                        Clipp, you didn’t tell me she was 
                        crazy.

           But Tom Clipp is listening.  

                                 JEAN
                        He’d never see us comin’.
                            (beat)
                        We could run things.  No one else.  
                        Just us.  You’d never hafta look 
                        over your shoulder in here again.  

           Tom Clipp is still listening.

           EXT. CIVIC CENTER - DAY

           Sebastian LaRocca holds up a sign: “BEING ITALIAN IS NOT A 
           CRIME.”  THIRTY ITALIAN AMERICANS at a rally holding up 
           signs, protesting outside the FBI offices in Pittsburgh.  
           LaRocca works up the cheering crowd with a BULLHORN:

                                 LAROCCA
                        They think we’re just some Guineas 
                        they can push around!  They messed 
                        with the wrong wops!
           INT. STRIP CLUB - SAME TIME - DAY

           Nick Delucia enjoys the girls with his BODYGUARD GOON (300 
           lbs).  TWO low rent STRIPPERS dance on the stage.  More 
           STRIPPERS work the tables in the crowd.  

           ...Jean steps inside, unseen.  Eyes go straight to Nick.

           EXT. CIVIC CENTER - SAME TIME - DAY

           LaRocca presses flesh with the crowd of STEEL WORKERS, 
           WIVES, and BABIES.  Poses for photo-ops.  Cameras FLASH.  

           INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY - SAME TIME

           Nick weaves through the tables -- swaying to the music -- 
           pinching asses -- on his way to the bathroom...

           INT. BATHROOM - STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           He sidles up to the urinal.  In the closed stall beside 
           him...

           ...Jean waits with her .38.  It trembles in her hand.  She 
           is on a precipice.  Her eyes are wide and unblinking.  She 
           clutches her hand to stop it from trembling.

           EXT. CIVIC CENTER - SAME TIME - DAY

           LaRocca is now surrounded by several older ITALIAN 
           AMERICANS.  He hugs an OLD BALD GUY...  

                                 LAROCCA
                        Can I rub this head for luck?  How 
                        long we known each other, sixty 
                        years?  Gimme that head...

                                 VOICE
                        Hey, Sebass?  

           NO ONE calls LaRocca that.  He turns around-- 

                                 LAROCCA
                        Alright, who’s the comedian?  

           It’s Miss Frank.  LaRocca almost chuckles at his eye liner, 
           until he sees Miss Frank’s gun -- BOOM!  

           LaRocca clutches his throat, stumbles face first into a 
           fountain.  Blood blooms in the fountain water.  

           LaRocca’s BODYGUARD, slow to catch, draws a GUN from his 
           pocket when... Tom Clipp steps out from behind a pillar and 
           SHOOTS him in the temple.  
           Clipp and Miss Frank race away into the scattering crowd. 

           INT. STRIP CLUB - MENS ROOM - DAY - SAME TIME

           Jean, still in her stall.  Heart pounding.  Fighting back 
           panic.  She pushes open the stall door with a shaky hand... 

           Nick -- back to her -- is drying his hands at the sink.  
           The panic races up Jean’s throat.  She raises the .38.  

           Nick turns around.  Jean FIRES.  ONCE.  TWICE.  Nick slumps 
           to the floor.  The bathroom door suddenly opens.  

           NICK’S GOON, all 300 pounds of him.  He sees his boss on 
           the floor.  Sees Jean.  Sees Jean’s gun.  

           Jean pulls the trigger again.  The GOON is shot in the 
           chest.  But he doesn’t go down.  He lumbers forward...

           Jean gets off a second shot: the bullet BLOWS the top of 
           the Goon’s head off.

           He pitches forward, into her.  They both go down.  Hard.   
           Jean is now pinned under three hundred pounds of dead, 
           bleeding goon.  A WAIL and a GROAN...   

           NICK DELUCIA IS STILL ALIVE.  Two feet away on the floor.  
           Bloody.  Weak.  But alive.  

           Jean pushes against the dead goon with all her strength but 
           he won’t budge.  

           Nick props himself up onto his elbow.    

           Jean’s arms are pinned, but she can lift her wrist three 
           inches, which means she can lift her gun three inches.  

           With considerable effort, Nick pulls a REVOLVER out of his 
           jacket pocket.  

           Jean squirms with all her might but the big dead goon isn’t 
           going anywhere.  She lifts the gun three inches in her 
           pinned hand...

           Nick points his revolver at her.  Struggling to breath...

           Both straining to aim... BAM!!!  Nick is shot between the 
           eyes.  Blood and bone splat against the wall.  

           A fresh scream.  From the doorway where... A NUDE DANCER 
           now stands - hands over mouth -- horrified.

                                 JEAN
                        Get this tub of shit off me! 
           The dancer pulls on the dead goon.  Jean squirms out from 
           under him.  She stands.  Covered in blood.  The dancer 
           shrieks again.  Jean points the gun at her--

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Shut up.

           The dancer stops screaming.  Jean pushes the door open... 

           INT. STRIP CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           She moves through the terrified customers cowering behind 
           tables.  At this moment, she is the most feared person in 
           Pittsburgh.  A smile spreads across her face as she exits 
           the darkness of the club and emerges into daylight.  

                                                          FADE TO WHITE

           INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

           CLOSE on a FACE.  Sleeping alone in bed: PATTI TRULESKI 
           (35), an overworked single mother of two.  

           The sound of GIGGLING.  A tiny HAND lifts Patti’s eyelid.  

           Patti’s eyes fly open and she HISSES LIKE A CAT at...

           SAM (3) and WENDY (5) -- her children -- standing bedside.  
           They SCREECH and race out of the room.  

           Patti looks at her alarm clock 6:22am.  

           INT. PATTI’S KITCHEN - LATER - MORNING

           A modest, two-bedroom townhouse cluttered with toys and 
           mismatched furniture.   

           Patti, curlers in her hair, flips french toast in a frying 
           pan while bacon sizzles in another.  

                                 PATTI
                        You don’t get the good stuff until 
                        those vitamins are all chewed up.  
                        Chew, chew, chew... 

           The kids chew their vitamins and go “aaaaah” to show 
           they’re finished.  Sam knocks a carton of MILK into her 
           OPEN BRIEFCASE.

                                 SAM
                        Sorry, mommy.  

           Patti shakes milk off AFFIDAVITS, FILES, COURT BRIEFINGS.  
           Sam giggles.  
                                 PATTI
                        You’re not really sorry, are you?

           Sam shakes his head, no.  Patti plugs in a hair dryer and 
           starts blow-drying the documents.  

           A BABYSITTER (19) enters through the back screen door.  

                                 BABYSITTER
                        Morning, Ms. Truleski.  

                                 PATTI
                        How are ya, hon?  Sit, eat.  I’m 
                        already late.  Wendy’s got her 
                        little friend coming over in an 
                        hour and Sam needs a bath pronto.

                                 BABYSITTER
                        We can take care of that. 

           She scoops up Sam and looks at Patti expectantly.

                                 BABYSITTER (CONT’D)
                        So, Ms. Truleski, it’s already 
                        Wednesday.

                                 PATTI
                        Oh, right.

           Patti reaches into her purse for cash.  It isn’t much.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        This is for last week, and I’ll 
                        get you caught up this week 
                        tomorrow. 
                            (points to the cash)
                        Can you use some of that for milk?  
                            (to her kids)
                        Give momma a kiss, love muffins.  

           Wendy farts.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        That’s my girl.  

           Patti hustles to the hall closet, grabs a JACKET and GUN 
           HOLSTER, removes a COLT .45 from a SAFE, holsters it...  

           INT. PATTI’S HONDA CIVIC - LATER - MORNING

           Patti speeds across town, curlers still in her hair, 
           cigarette in her mouth, singing at the top of her lungs to 
           the Allman Bros on the car radio.  
                                 PATTI (SINGING)
                        My father was a gambler down in 
                        Georgia / He wound up on the wrong 
                        end of a gun / And I was born in 
                        the back seat of a Greyhound bus,
                        Rollin' down highway forty-one...

           She begins taking out the curlers while she drives.   

           INT. PITTSBURGH CIY GOVERNMENT BUILDING - LATER - MORNING

           Patti hurries through the entryway in heels.  Clack.  
           Clack.  Clack.  Flashes her ID to the SECURITY GUARD:

                        PATTI TRULESKI ASSISTANT DA

           INT. OUTER OFFICE - MAYOR’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Patti crosses the office to a ruddy-faced D.A. CHARLIE W. 
           DUGGAN (40), who wears a corduroy suit almost as well as 
           his world class comb-over. 

                                 PATTI
                        Sorry, I’m here, sorry!  

                                 DUGGAN
                        Patti.

                                 PATTI
                        ...Hell of a morning.  

           Duggan notices a kid’s drawing is half sticking out of her 
           briefcase.  She yanks it free, puts it in her purse.

                                 DUGGAN
                        I thought Joe had the kids this 
                        week?  

                                 PATTI
                        Don’t even get me started.

                                 DUGGAN
                        I never liked that guy.  Did the 
                        McCormick brief get filed?

                                 PATTI
                        Last night.  Come here.

           Patti pulls off a couple pieces of tissue stuck to shaving 
           cuts on Duggan’s neck.  

                                 DUGGAN
                        ...Thanks.  
           A typing SECRETARY looks up--

                                 SECRETARY
                        You can go in now. 

           Patti moves to the door to the mayor’s office, but Duggan 
           blocks her.

                                 DUGGAN
                        So... he, uh, he asked me to ask 
                        you to wait out here. 

                                 PATTI
                        Wait out here?  Why? 

                                 DUGGAN
                        He’s in a mood.

                                 PATTI
                        I’m in a mood, we’re all in a 
                        mood, we live in fucking 
                        Pittsburgh, so what?  

                                 DUGGAN
                        He’s also worried about leaks to 
                        the press.  

                                 PATTI
                        He’s worried about leaks because I 
                        told him he should be worried 
                        about leaks.  Are you going in?

                                 DUGGAN
                        I’m going in. 

                                 PATTI
                        Then I’m--

                                 DUGGAN
                        --We’ll talk after.

           But Patti doesn’t budge.  They bottleneck at the door, 
           mumbling at each other.  

           Duggan slips inside past her, closes the door in her face.

                                 PATTI
                            (to the secretary)
                        You see what just happened?

           The secretary keeps on typing.  Patti paces a few beats.  
           Fuck this.  She opens the door and ENTERS--
           INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The room is filled with smoke.  RICHARD CALIGUIRI (50) -- 
           the old school, shameless political opportunist Mayor of 
           Pittsburgh -- heads a round table.  

           On either side of him: two AIDES, D.A. Duggan, and the 
           police chief, JAY MCBRIDE (50s) mustached, corrupt.  

           Duggan gives Patti a “what the fuck?” look.  She drags a 
           chair over, sits down.  

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        ...I ran on this shit.  I was the 
                        law and order candidate.  That 
                        means I gotta deliver some law and 
                        fucking order, people.     

           He throws a newspaper down on the table.

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI (CONT’D)
                        You can’t walk past a newsstand in 
                        this city without seeing dead 
                        guineas on the front page of the 
                        Gazette.  That’s not law and 
                        order.  That’s anarchy.  

           Grumbles of “no” around the room.

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI (CONT’D)
                        Sebastian LaRocca was gunned down 
                        in broad daylight.  There were -- 
                        how many witnesses?  

                                 MAYOR’S AIDE
                        --Hundred--

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        A hundred witnesses.  Why aren’t 
                        his killers in custody right now?  

                                 JAY MCBRIDE
                        We’re putting together a list of 
                        suspects, local mob figures--

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        --This better be a short fucking 
                        list.  

                                 PATTI
                        They won’t be hard to find. 

           Everyone turns to Patti.  Duggan shoots her daggers.
                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        How’s that, sweetheart?

           Patti gives them all a look: isn’t it obvious?

                                 PATTI
                        Whoever killed the king is now on 
                        the throne.

           EXT. STOREFRONT / GEMINI SPA - DAY

           WORKERS remove a “Good Spa” sign and replace it with a 
           “GEMINI SPA” sign.  This is the parlor Nick and LaRocca 
           were about to open before being gunned down.  Twice the 
           size of Healing Hands.  

           INT. GEMINI SPA - DAY

           The front entrance opens and Jean’s girls flood inside.  
           Jean is the last to step in.  She’s wearing a flashy velvet 
           suit and a cashmere scarf.  She glances around, pleased, 
           this is all hers now.  

           INT. JEAN’S OFFICE - GEMINI SPA - NIGHT

           Jean’s lying on a massage table as TRUDY, a beautiful new 
           girl, massages her nude body.  Tom Clipp and Miss Frank 
           enter the office.  

           Clipp has shed his gangster attire.  He’s now dressed ala 
           Jon Voight in Midnight Cowboy.  Miss Frank wears a 
           sleeveless leather jacket and Jeans, sans shirt.  

                                 JEAN
                        You boys want a massage?  Trudy’s 
                        got the magic touch. 

                                 CLIPP
                        We need envelopes.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Two of ‘em.  Thick with cash. 

                                 JEAN
                        Kinda soon for a shakedown, ain’t 
                        it?

                                 CLIPP
                        Price of doing business in 
                        Pittsburgh.  One envelope for 
                        downtown.  One for City Hall.  

                                 JEAN
                        What am I buying?
                                 MISS FRANK
                        Peace of mind.  Every week you pay 
                        is a week the boys in blue don’t 
                        come down here for a visit. 

           Jean thinks.  The wheels begin turning.

                                 JEAN
                        Tell me again why we don’t want 
                        them coming down here?

           EXT. PARLOR - NIGHT

           A “CLOSED FOR PRIVATE PARTY” sign is hung in the window.

           INT. PARLOR - NIGHT

           A banner over the front desk reads “BLUE NIGHT.”  THIRTY OF 
           PITTSBURGH PD’S FINEST.  A drink in every hand and a lady 
           in every lap.  Jean escorts TWO BUXOM GIRLS over to Chief 
           Jay McBride, whom we met earlier at the mayor’s office.

                                 JEAN
                        I found a couple ladies in need of 
                        a search and seizure, Chief.

                                 JAY MCBRIDE
                        Oh, is that right?    

                                 JEAN
                        Even brought their own cuffs.

           The buxom girls lead McBride into a room. 

           INT. MASSAGE ROOM - GEMINI SPA - LATER - NIGHT

           McBride, handcuffed to a bed, is being serviced by both 
           girls.  In the ceiling a/c vent, WE SEE A RED DOT.  A CCD 
           CAMERA RECORDS THEM.  

           INT. COUNT ROOM - GEMINI SPA - SAME TIME - NIGHT

           Jean enters.  Tom Clipp and Miss Frank watch three 
           SURVEILLANCE MONITORS of POLICEMEN in various sex acts.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        You’re a bad, bad girl.  

                                 CLIPP
                        We still gotta pay every week.  

                                 JEAN
                        But now we got some insurance on 
                        that payment.  
                                 JEAN (CONT'D)
                        I want a list of every councilman, 
                        judge, and D.A. downtown.

                                 CLIPP
                        Why?  

                                 JEAN
                        Cause we’re throwing another party 
                        next week. 

           INT. GEMINI SPA - NIGHT

           Another party.  City Hall bigwigs: ASSEMBLY MEN, JUDGES, 
           STATE CONGRESSMEN, and DISTRICT ATTORNEYS.  Jean sits with 
           FRANK SPIRO (50ish), a CITY COURT JUDGE.  He kisses her 
           hand, notices her bare ring finger.

                                 JUDGE SPIRO
                        You don’t have a fella, Jean? 

                                 JEAN
                        No, sir, but I am up to my 
                        eyeballs in pussy.

                                 JUDGE SPIRO
                        Not a bad place to be.

                                 SWEET MARIE
                        Come with me, Judge.  

           He heads off with Sweet Marie into a room.  

           TIME CUT - LATER

           Jean, arm in arm with two lovely LADIES, approaches 
           District Attorney Charlie Duggan sitting alone.

                                 JEAN
                        ‘Evening, Mr. Duggan.  

           Duggan looks at the lovely ladies, shifts uncomfortably.  

           INT. COUNT ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

           Jean finds Clipp and Miss Frank watching the CCD monitors: 
           Duggan sits on the bed, fully dressed, meekly conversing 
           with the two girls, also fully dressed.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        This dog don’t hunt.

                                 JEAN
                        We threw him the wrong bone.
           INT. D.A. DUGGAN’S OFFICE - CITY HALL - DAY

           Monday morning.  Back at work.  Duggan, wearing a mustard-
           colored suit, gazes out the window, big smile on his face. 

                                 PATTI (O.S.)
                        How was your weekend?

           Patti Truleski in the doorway.  Duggan looks over at her 
           AND WE FLASHBACK TO:

           INT. PITTSBURGH PLAZA HOTEL - SUITE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Duggan is getting plowed by a GAY STUD.  An empty bottle of 
           DOM in a bedside bucket with a CARD attached: Enjoy, Jean.

           INT. DUGGAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Back to Duggan and Patti.  He smiles--

                                 DUGGAN
                        Terrific.   

                                 PATTI
                        Where’d you guys go, Poconos? 

                                 DUGGAN
                        Trudy went with the kids.  I 
                        stayed here, caught up on, you 
                        know, things, work.

                                 PATTI
                        Good, good.  While I have you, 
                        where are we on the LaRocca hit?

                                 DUGGAN
                        It’s been quiet.    

                                 PATTI
                        Quiet?

                        Real quiet.  

                                 PATTI
                        What about all those witnesses?  
                        Nothing? 

                                 DUGGAN
                        I’ll let you know when somethin’ 
                        comes in.  Close the door on your 
                        way out, will ya? 

           Patti leaves, confused.

                        The counter-culture movement has 
                        done away with the more puritan 
                        aspects of previous decades... 

           INT. CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cynthia is watching the nightly news on the couch.  Jean is 
           in the bedroom stuffing CASH BRICKS into a brand new SAFE.  

                                 NEWSCASTER ON TV
                        ...And it seems that everyone has 
                        gotten in on the action.  Whether 
                        watching a pornographic film at 
                        the local theater or flipping 
                        through a sex advice manual in 
                        line at the grocery store, 
                        Americans are breaking many sexual 
                        taboos.  Interracial dating, open 
                        homosexuality, communal living, 
                        casual nudity, and dirty language 
                        all seem to indicate a profound 
                        change in sexual behavior.

                        Honey?

           Jean emerges from the bedroom.

                                 JEAN
                        Yeah, babe.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You gotta expand.   

           INT. AL’S DINER - NIGHT

           An empty, greasy spoon diner.  Jean, Tom Clipp, and Miss 
           Frank step inside.  The hard luck owner, AL, looks up at 
           them.  Jean plops down a PAPER BAG STUFFED WITH CASH.  Al 
           looks from the cash to Jean, it’s his lucky day.

           INT. MODEL INC. - OFFICE - DAY

           An oily modeling agent, SAAR LOMAX, sits between Clipp and 
           Miss Frank.  Jean across from them.  A VALISE between them.  
           Saar eyes the valise with disappointment. 

                                 SAAR LOMAX
                        It looks kinda small.  
                                 JEAN
                        It’s a good-sized bag.  

                                 SAAR LOMAX
                        It’s small, look at it.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        I think you’re right.  But I bet 
                        if we tried real hard, we could 
                        stretch this bag open and cram 
                        just about anything we wanted in 
                        there.  

                                 CLIPP
                        You wouldn’t want anything else 
                        crammed in there, would you?

           They have Saar boxed in on the sofa.  His voice is dust:

                                 SAAR LOMAX
                        I’ll just, ah, take it as is.  

           INT. SMOOTH - NIGHT CLUB - DAY

           LOU GERSON, a burly club owner, arms folded and a look of 
           disdain for the three homosexuals standing in front of him.

                                 LOU GERSON
                        No.  

                                 JEAN
                        No?

                                 LOU GERSON
                        Huh-uh.  

                                 JEAN
                        Why?  

                                 LOU GERSON
                        Not interested. 

                                 JEAN
                        Why?  

                                 LOU GERSON
                        Don’t matter.  I ain’t selling.  

                                 CLIPP
                        Maybe you should think about it.  
                        Go ‘head.  Take a moment.   

                                 LOU GERSON
                        Don’t need a moment.  Answer’s no.  
                                 MISS FRANK 
                            (holds up a bag of cash)
                        This is a generous offer.  Feel 
                        how heavy this bag is.

                                 LOU GERSON
                        I don’t wanna feel it.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Maybe you should feel it anyway.  

                                 LOU GERSON
                        Maybe you should shove it up your 
                        ass.

                                 JEAN
                        What’s with the hostilities, Lou?  
                        We’re just trying to put money in 
                        your pocket.  

                                 LOU GERSON
                        I don’t want your faggot money in 
                        my pocket.  Now get the fuck out.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Is that any way to talk to a lady?

                                 LOU GERSON
                        She don’t look much like a lady.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        I was referring to myself.

           Jean SHOOTS Lou Gerson in the head.  BLOOD sprays her tie.  

           Lou Gerson tumbles to the floor.  His legs KICK as he 
           bleeds out.  Tom Clipp and Miss Frank are shocked by Jean’s 
           moment of sudden violence.  

                                 JEAN
                        Too much?

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Little bit.  

                                 JEAN
                        Well, fuck.  
                            (to Lou)
                        Sorry.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                            (to the boys)
                        We should get him off the floor 
                        before he ruins the hardwood.  
           They dump Lou Gerson’s lifeless body into the bar ice.

           INT. CYNTHIA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Candlelit.  Incense.  Cynthia, wearing an open robe, lies 
           on the sofa as Jean goes down on her.  Cynthia’s about to 
           climax when...  Jean stops, looks up.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Why’d you stop?

                                 JEAN
                        I wanna meet your family.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Baby, you’re telling me this now?

           Jean nods innocently.  

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT’D)
                        It’s a bad idea, Jean.  

                                 JEAN
                        Why’s it a bad idea?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Buncha’ reasons.  Momma only knows 
                        oil derricks, needlepoint, and 
                        Jesus.  She won’t understand this.    

                                 JEAN
                        She don’t gotta understand it.  
                            (quiet, vulnerable)
                        ...I wanna know your people.  

           Cynthia sighs, relents.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I’m good with mommas.  

           Jean returns to the business at hand.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You ain’t met mine.  Mmmm...

           Cynthia climaxes LOUDLY and WE ABRUPTLY CUT TO:

           INT. BRUNO HOUSE - DINNER TABLE - DALLAS - DAY

           Silence.  The clink of fine china and throats being 
           awkwardly cleared.  The dinner table consists of Cynthia’s 
           MOMMA, DADDY, AUNT SALLY, AUNT BOBBI, NANA (hearing-aid), 
           Jean, and Cynthia.  
           The walls of the stately house are covered with bucolic 
           paintings and taxidermy.  Momma’s already on her second 
           Sherry and eyeballing Jean.  

                                 JEAN
                        Fine house you have here, Mrs. 
                        Bruno.  

                                 MOMMA
                        That’s a dinner fork, dear.  We’re 
                        having salad now.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Momma.

                                 JEAN
                        No, no, she’s right.

           Jean picks up the correct fork.  Daddy turns to Cynthia--

                                 DADDY
                        So how do you know Jean?

                                 MOMMA
                        They’re roommates, haven’t you 
                        been paying attention?  

                                 NANA
                        I had a roommate once.  A real 
                        nice gal from Tuscaloosa.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Jean’s got her own business in 
                        Pittsburgh, Daddy.  

                                 DADDY
                        Is that right?  You’re a business 
                        lady then?

                                 JEAN
                        Yes, sir.  I own a massage parlor 
                        and I’m opening a nightclub soon.  

                                 NANA
                        Massage?  Oooh-la-la.  

                                 AUNT BOBBI
                        You want a massage, Nana?

           Nana chuckles.  Momma eyes Cynthia’s hand.

                                 MOMMA
                        You didn’t tell me you took your 
                        ring off.  
                                 CYNTHIA
                        I most certainly did.  

                                 NANA
                        What happened to her ring?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        It’s off, Nana.  
                            (wiggles her fingers)
                        See?

                                 MOMMA
                        Artie called me.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Did he?  Where from?  A 
                        whorehouse?  

                                 MOMMA
                        The hospital.  He was all beat up.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Ain’t that a shame.  

           Cynthia discreetly squeezes Jean’s hand under the table.  

                                 JEAN
                        I hear you’re in the oil business, 
                        Mr. Bruno?  

                                 DADDY
                        Oil, yes--

                                 MOMMA
                        He’s retired.  We’re retired now.  

                                 DADDY
                        Well--

                                 MOMMA
                        Hush and let us ladies talk.  
                            (pours more Sherry)
                        Where’d you meet my daughter, 
                        Jean?

           Jean thinks before answering, decides the truth is best:

                                 JEAN
                        I met Cynthia in my parlor.  

                                 MOMMA
                        She come in for a massage?
                                 JEAN
                        No, ma’am.  

                                 MOMMA
                        Well what’d she come in for?

                                 JEAN
                        She was looking for her husband.  

                                 MOMMA
                        Did she find him?  In your parlor?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        --We came here for turkey, Momma, 
                        not a trial--  

                                 MOMMA
                        Jean, did she find him?

                                 JEAN
                        She did.  

                                 MOMMA
                        Then what happened?  

           Jean looks from Cynthia to Cynthia’s Momma.

           FLASH TO: Jean swinging her bat down on Artie Caione’s 
           knee.

                                 JEAN
                        I beat the ever-loving-shit outta 
                        him with a baseball bat.

           Silence.  Finally:

                                 MOMMA
                        ...I see.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        He had it comin’. 

           More awkward throat clearing at the table.  

                                 MOMA
                        Do you have a fella, Jean?

                                 JEAN
                        A fella?  

           The aunts snicker knowingly at the end of the table.  
                                 CYNTHIA
                        What’s so goddamn funny down 
                        there? 

                                 AUNT BOBBI
                        Nothing, dear.  

                                 MOMMA
                        A fella, you know, a boyfriend?

                                 JEAN
                        No, ma’am, I do not. 

           More snickers.  Jean shoots the aunts a lethal smile.  
           Momma downs her Sherry.  

                                 MOMMA
                        Are you sleeping in my daughter’s 
                        bed?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Momma!

                                 MOMMA
                        Is she?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Momma!

           Momma gives Jean an even look.

                                 MOMMA
                        Jean: you’re sitting at my table, 
                        eating my food, in my house.  I 
                        deserve the truth.  Are you 
                        sleeping in my daughter’s bed?

                                 JEAN
                        ...Only when she ain’t sleeping in 
                        mine.  

           Momma swallows.  Then:

                                 MOMMA
                        Get out.  Both of you.  

                                 DADDY
                        Margaret--

                                 MOMMA
                        This does not hold!  We’re a 
                        wholesome family.  
                                 NANA
                        We’re what?

                                 MOMMA
                        Wholesome!  

                                 CYNTHIA
                            (stands)
                        Goodbye, Momma. 

                                 DADDY
                        Cyn--

                                 MOMMA
                        Don’t come back until that woman’s 
                        out of your bed.  

                                 DADDY
                        Margaret--

                                 MOMMA
                        Do you hear me? 

                                 JEAN
                        It was nice meeting ya’ll.  

                                 NANA
                        You too, dear.  

           Cynthia drags Jean out of the house.

                                 MOMMA (O.S.)
                        You’re not welcome back until 
                        she’s gone! 

                                 JEAN
                        Your momma’s a rascal.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Let’s get fuckin’ married.

           INT. BEACH - HAWAII - NIGHT

           A 4-person wedding.  On the sandy shores of Waikiki, Miss 
           Frank marries Jean and Cynthia.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        In the power, well, no one’s 
                        vested in me, you may now kiss the 
                        bride.  

           The girls kiss.  Tom Clipp fiddles with a camera, trying to 
           capture the moment.  He can’t get it to work.
                                 JEAN
                        It’s the button on top.

                                 CLIPP
                        --Something wrong the flash--

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Lemme see it.

                                 JEAN
                        --Oh for chrissakes-- 

           THE CAMERA FLASHES.  FREEZE on Jean and Cynthia gesturing 
           to the men to hurry up. 

           INT. HOUSE - PITTSBURGH’S BRENTWOOD SUBURBS - DAY

           A palatial house in a Tony suburban neighborhood.  Jean 
           covers Cynthia’s eyes with her hands as they cross the 
           threshold of the front door.  

                                 JEAN
                        Open your eyes.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Holy shit. 

                                 JEAN
                        Biggest house on the block.  Feel 
                        the floor.  Feel it.  That’s real 
                        stone.  

           Cynthia wanders into the enormous entryway.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        This really ours?

                                 JEAN
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Cynthia jumps into Jean’s arms and they fall to the marble 
           floor, groping and kissing.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        I want you to make us a home here, 
                        Cyn.  A real home.  Can you do 
                        that for us?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Hell yes!  Look at this place.  
                        We’ll throw parties every night--
                                 JEAN
                        No parties.  Not here.  I want 
                        this to be our thing.  Just you 
                        and me.  I want this to be a real 
                        home. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Well, alright then...

                                                              SMASH TO:

           INT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - DAY

           Jean at the dinner table, fork in hand, chewing 
           distastefully.  Cynthia, wearing an ill-fitting apron, 
           watches her like a hawk across the table.  A home-cooked 
           meal between them.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        How is it?

                                 JEAN
                            (tastes like shit)
                        It’s pretty good.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        It’s not pretty good.  

           Jean spits the food out into a napkin.  

                                 JEAN
                        You don’t know how to cook?

                                 CYNTHIA
                            (with an edge)
                        I guess I don’t.

                                 JEAN
                        So we’ll order in.  No big deal.   

           Jean takes in the messy house: Cynthia’s clothes are strewn 
           everywhere.  Empty wine bottles and overflowing ashtrays.  
           Pots and pans stacked in the sink.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What?

                                 JEAN
                        Maybe we could keep the place a 
                        bit tidier? 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You want it tidy? 
           Jean nods.  Cynthia gives her a withering look:

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT’D)
                        When exactly did you get the 
                        impression I was a homemaker?  I’m 
                        built for fun and fuckin’, that’s 
                        it.  

                                 JEAN
                        We have our fun, but when we come 
                        home we’re a family.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        “Family” to you means I cook and 
                        clean?

                                 JEAN
                        We each got a role.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What’s your role?  

                                 JEAN
                        I provide.  

           Cynthia starts to giggle.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Why are you laughing at me?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Honey, you ain’t Ozzie and I ain’t 
                        Harriet.  If I wanted to be a 
                        housewife I would’ve stayed with 
                        Artie.  

                                 JEAN
                        Who said housewife?  I’m asking 
                        for just a little bit of normalcy 
                        in this house.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Tough.  You ain’t getting it! 

           Cynthia stalks away.

                                 JEAN
                        Cyn? 

           The bedroom door slams.  Jean takes another bite of dinner.    

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        C’mon out, the meatloaf isn’t so 
                        bad.  
                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                            (spits it out)
                        Goddamn...

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Lou Gerson’s old club has been transformed into the hottest 
           nightclub in Pittsburgh.  

           As decadent as Max’s Kansas City.  Decorated in pink nude 
           sculptures and a gold ceiling.  White smoke fills the room.  

           Topless women, leather fetishists in spiked dog collars, 
           drag queens, politicians, lawyers, and businessmen dance to 
           thumping disco under a spinning globe.  

           Patti Truleski, the A.D.A. we met earlier, is dancing her 
           ass off as her date, SPECIAL AGENT JEFF CONKLIN, awkwardly 
           shuffles his feet.

                                 PATTI
                        We’re not in court anymore, 
                        Howard, you can let loose a 
                        little.  

                                 CONKLIN
                            (over the loud music)
                        What?

                                 PATTI
                        Let loose!  Woooooooo!

           TIME CUT - MOMENTS LATER

           Patti and Conklin move through a throng of people to the 
           bar.  Patti’s attention is drawn over to...

           ...Jean Marie Gill.  Dressed in a silk scarf, velvet suit, 
           large sunglasses, and a ten thousand dollar gold Rolex 
           watch.  Jean is the center of attention in a booth stuffed 
           with DRAG QUEENS, POLITICIANS, and HOMOSEXUALS.

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - BATHROOM - LATER

           Patti fixes her makeup in the mirror.  Jean sidles up next 
           to her.  Patti steals a couple looks.  Jean notices.

                                 JEAN
                        Hi.

                                 PATTI
                        Hello.

           A PARTY GIRL does a line of coke next to them.  
                                 JEAN
                        What precinct are you with?

                                 PATTI
                        I’m sorry?

                                 JEAN
                        You’re a vice cop?

           Coke Girl, overhearing, quickly scoots out of the bathroom. 

                                 PATTI
                        You think I’m a cop?  Do I look 
                        like a cop?  

                                 JEAN
                        You look like you’re trying not to 
                        look like a cop.  

                                 PATTI
                        Maybe that’s why I’m not getting 
                        anywhere with my date tonight.

           The ladies share a laugh.  Jean likes her already.  She 
           thrusts out a hand:

                                 JEAN
                        ...I’m Jean.  

                                 PATTI
                        Patti.  I’m an attorney, actually. 
                        A.D.A.

                                 JEAN
                        Ahh.  I was close.  

                                 PATTI
                        You were close.

                                 JEAN
                        Lady prosecutor.  I didn’t know 
                        they had those.  

                                 PATTI
                        Just one.  Hear they might hire 
                        another gal next year--  
                            (attentions shifts to 
                              Jean’s Rolex)
                        --Whoa, that’s a nice watch.  

                                 JEAN
                        You like it?  
                                 PATTI
                            (examines it)
                        It’s a knockoff?  Nope, damn, it’s 
                        real, look at that thing.

                                 JEAN
                        I’ll get you one.  

                                 PATTI
                        You’ll get me one?  This watch?

                                 JEAN
                        Sure.  I’ll send it over to your 
                        office.   

           Patti pauses.  Cocks her head:

                                 PATTI
                        What do you do, Jean?    

           Jean gestures the club.  

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        You manage this place?

                                 JEAN
                        Manage, own, operate.  Whole 
                        shebang.  This place and a few 
                        others.

           Patti looks at Jean with fresh eyes.  Who the hell is this 
           woman?  Several BACHELORETTE PARTY LADIES burst into the 
           bathroom.  Jean winks mischievously--

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Nice meeting you, Counselor.

           Patti, fascinated, watches her go.  

           EXT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - LATER

           A DRAG QUEEN does a strip tease on Jean’s table as her 
           entourage throws money at him.  Jean cheers him on. Across 
           the room, Patti leaves with Conklin.  Her eyes move to Jean 
           for one final glance before she exits.  

           Sally Maite, Jean’s accountant, approaches her table.  

                                 JEAN
                        Sally, Sally, Sally... Siddown, 
                        have a drink.  

           Sally scooches in next to her.
                                 SALLY MAITE
                        You cleared a million dollars this 
                        month.  Congratulations.  

                                 JEAN
                        I guess I’m rich now.

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        You would think.  Except you’re 
                        spending... 

           She pulls out a black book filled with Jean’s finances.

                                 SALLY MAITE (CONT’D)
                        ...fifteen thousand a month on 
                        Cristal champagne...

                                 JEAN
                        Worth every penny.  

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        --twenty thousand on flowers--

                                 JEAN
                        --dandelions and roses, Cyn’s 
                        favorite--

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        --A hundred thousand in mink 
                        coats.  

                                 JEAN
                        Gotta stay warm, it’s cold 
                        outside.

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        You bought the End Street movie 
                        theater...  

                                 JEAN
                        That’s a business.     

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        It was until you instructed the 
                        staff to play only one movie. 

           FLASH ON: Jean and Cynthia in an empty theater with a tub 
           of popcorn enjoying the hell out of Dog Day Afternoon.  

                                 JEAN
                        When something comes out that’s 
                        better than Dog Day, we’ll change 
                        it. 
                                 SALLY MAITE
                        Just promise me you’ll try to take 
                        it easy on the spending.    

                                 JEAN
                        I’ll promise you something better: 
                        I’m gonna make a lot more money.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           CASH floor-to-ceiling. 

           --Several famous paintings are hung in her various rooms 
           and offices: Warhol, Jackson Pollock, Dali, Picasso. 

           --Cynthia follows deliverymen carrying several NUDE GODDESS 
           SCULPTURES into her house. 

           --Rooms are transformed with leopard-printed furniture,

           INT. PATTI’S OFFICE - DA’S OFFICE - DOWNTOWN - DAY

           Patti is swamped with paperwork.  An intern hands her a 
           small package.  She opens it, a short note from Jean, 
           “Enjoy, Counselor.”  Underneath the note: a GOLD ROLEX.  

                                 PATTI
                        Sonofabitch.

           Patti tries the watch on.  She admires it for a beat and 
           then slides it off and tosses it back in the box.  She 
           looks at the box, thinking.

           EXT. MUSCLE BUSTLE - DAY

           A hardcore bodybuilders’ health club in downtown 
           Pittsburgh.  Jean and Tom Clipp stand out front, looking 
           over the building. 
                                 JEAN
                        This could be good.  We put a 
                        parlor in the front, dance bar in 
                        the back. 

                                 CLIPP
                        Or we could leave it as is, 
                        y’know?  
                            (off her look)
                        Fitness is the future. 

           They walk inside to REVEAL:

           INT. MUSCLE BUSTLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

           The place is packed with GAY BODYBUILDERS.  Jean and Clipp 
           wander through the club, looking around.  

                                 JEAN
                        These guys pay to come in here 
                        every day?

                                 CLIPP
                        It’s like a membership.  They pay 
                        monthly.  The joint’s makin’ cash 
                        hand over fist. 

           They enter the...

           INT. MUSCLE BUSTLE - LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...and pass several NUDE MUSCLE HEADS, who look at Jean 
           sideways.  

                                 JEAN
                        Relax, you ain’t got nothin’ I’m 
                        interested in.  

           Jean sees a BODYBUILDER shooting up in a bathroom stall.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        I thought this was a health club?  
                        Guy’s doing smack in the john.    

                                 CLIPP 
                        It’s not smack.  That stuff makes 
                        you strong.

                                 JEAN
                        Strong?  What do you mean, strong?

                                 CLIPP
                        Strong.  Like Superman. 
           The guy in the bathroom drops a NEEDLE and a VIAL on the 
           floor and begins SMACKING HIMSELF IN THE FACE IN A RAGE.  

           Jean walks over and picks up the empty vial, reads the 
           label: ANABOLIC-ANDROGENIC STEROIDS.

                                 JEAN
                        Ok, we’ll keep the health club.  
                            (holds up the vial)
                        Now tell me where this came from?

           INT. ROADSIDE BAR - OUTSIDE PITTSBURGH - DAY

           A briefcase filled with STEROID VIALS on a pool table.  

           POP WIDE ON THE ROOM:  

           Jean looks over the vials with a leather-clad biker -- NEAL 
           KIRBY (40) leader of the Pagan biker gang.  A few of his 
           CREW stand behind him along with Tom Clipp and Miss Frank.  

                                 JEAN
                        How much?

                                 KIRBY
                        For how much?

                                 JEAN
                        All of them.

                                 KIRBY
                        You can’t have all of them. 

                                 JEAN
                        Who says I can’t?

                                 KIRBY
                        I’ve got other customers.  

                                 JEAN
                        You had other customers.  Now 
                        you’ve got me.  

           Kirby gives his guys a look: can you believe this broad?

                                 KIRBY
                        Half is the best I can do.  Half a 
                        case, that’s it. 

                                 JEAN
                        If I wanted half I would’ve asked 
                        for half.  Half’s not enough.    
                                 KIRBY
                        That’s too fuckin’ bad, darling.  

                                 JEAN
                        Alright.  Keep the product.  I’ll 
                        buy the club instead.  

           The bikers look at each other and chuckle.  

                                 KIRBY
                        We aren’t for sale.

                                 JEAN
                        I’ll pay you more in a month than 
                        you make in a year... 

           The bikers go quiet.  She has their attention.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        And if that doesn’t do it for you, 
                        I got an endless supply of the 
                        tastiest pussy you fellas will 
                        ever get your mouths on.   

           Kirby’s crew offer grunts of approval.

           INT. MUSCLE BUSTLE - MAIN FLOOR / LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           A LONG LINE of BODYBUILDERS snake through the gym -- into 
           the locker room -- and ends at a table where Miss Frank is 
           selling steroids for fifty bucks a vial.  

           INT. MUSCLE BUSTLE - LATER

           WE MOVE THROUGH a steroid-fueled world:

           --NEEDLES plunge into beefy arms.  

           --A massive BODYBUILDER deadlifts 600 lbs.  Baby powder 
           flies off his hands. 

           --A row of GUYS are benching 300 lbs - 400 lbs while 
           screaming at the top of their lungs.  

           --Blood vessels turn purple, on the verge of popping.

           --Huge DUMB BELLS bounce to the floor with a BOOM.  

           --A collage of baby powder, spittle, IRON, and ‘roided-up 
           MUSCLES.  
           INT. MUSCLE BUSTLE - GYM FLOOR - DAY

           Tom Clipp is doing curls in the mirror.  He is RIPPED.  
           Jean enters and approaches with a gym bag of cash -- his 
           weekly cut.  Next to them, several WEIGHT-LIFTERS are 
           watching an enormous HOMOSEXUAL BODYBUILDER.

                                 JEAN
                        Who’s that?

                                 CLIPP
                        Football player.  NFL.

                        on their team?  

                                 CLIPP
                        Shhh.  Don’t tell anyone.  

           Jean thinks.  She pulls out a VIAL, walks over to the 
           homosexual NFL player, AND WE CUT TO:

           EXT. THREE RIVERS STADIUM - DAY

           The Pittsburgh Steelers practice.  Full pads.  They go at 
           each other hard.  Our homosexual player, a defensive 
           lineman jacked on roids, bull-rushes the OFFENSIVE LINEMAN 
           and SACKS Terry Bradshaw.  

           Coach CHUCK NOLL turns to an ASSISTANT--

                                 CHUCK NOLL
                        What’s gotten into him?

           INT. JEAN’S OFFICE - GEMINI SPA - DAY

           Jean studies her suit in a mirror.  Specifically her flat 
           crotch.  She has a rolled-up sock in hand.  She’s about to 
           put it down her pants, WHEN--

           A knock at the door.  Big Amy enters.

                                 BIG AMY
                        Some guys out here looking for 
                        you.

           Jean steps into the LOBBY TO FIND: the entire starting 
           defensive line for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

                                 JEAN
                        Hey, fellas?
           EXT. THREE RIVERS STADIUM - DAY

           Fifty thousand screaming fans!  Opening day of the season.  
           Steelers Vs Jets.  Joe Namath walks to the line of 
           scrimmage.  The Steelers defensive line, now all jacked on 
           roids, snort and growl at him.  He hikes the ball...  

           The linemen MANHANDLE the Jets offensive line and sack 
           Namath.  The crowd goes wild!

           INT. GEMINI SPA - NIGHT

           An epic party.  A STEELERS’ PLAYER throws Sweet Marie over 
           his shoulder.  He runs around the room, holding her in one 
           arm like a trophy.  

           The parlor is packed with PLAYERS and PAGAN BIKERS partying 
           with the girls.  Jean finds Neal Kirby, the gang leader, 
           with a girl in his lap. 

                                 JEAN
                        We’ve got the playoffs coming up.  
                        I’m gonna need more juice.

                                 NEAL KIRBY
                        How much more?

                                 JEAN
                        Much as you can get your hands on.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PITTSBURGH STEELERS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           A dozen PLAYERS sit in front of their lockers, smoking, 
           drinking, and chatting with COACHES and REPORTERS off the 
           record.  TRAINERS move through the lockers, INJECTING EACH 
           OF THEM WITH ANABOLIC STEROIDS.  

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           The room is packed with local politicians, cops, judges, 
           underworld types.  A Super Bowl party.  Jean moves through 
           the room with Tom Clipp.  

                                 CLIPP
                        He reached out again.  

                                 JEAN
                        Who?  

                                 CLIPP
                        New York.  Carmine Sozzi.  Boss 
                        out of New York.  
                                 JEAN
                        He called us?

                                 CLIPP
                        Twice now.   

                                 JEAN
                        What’s he want?

                                 CLIPP
                        What do you think?  

                                 JEAN
                        I think we’re doing ok without any 
                        bosses from New York or anywhere 
                        else.

                                 CLIPP
                        I’ll pass the word along.  

           On the projector TV, the Steelers are seconds away from 
           winning Super Bowl IX against the Vikings.

                                 EVERYONE IN THE ROOM
                        Three, two, one...

           The guests blow party horns, wave “Terrible Towels”, and 
           pour champagne.  The Steelers are world champions.  

           Jeans gets up on the bar and holds up a Terrible Towel like 
           Norma Rae.  Everyone cheers.

           In the corner of the room, Patti Truleski leans against the 
           wall, drinking a club soda, eyes on Jean.  

           Jean is surrounded by the room full of Pittsburgh power 
           brokers.  They treat her with reverence and respect.  

           PUSH IN ON Patti.  A moment of revelation: Jean is the boss 
           of Pittsburgh.   

           INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY

           Wearing goggles and protective headphones, Patti takes 
           target practice with her Colt .45.  BAM.  BAM.  BAM.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CUBICLE - DAY

           Patti stands, hands on hips, looking at a cork board with 
           twenty mug shots and surveillance photos of MOB FIGURES.   

           MARCON, a Pittsburgh PD lifer,  appears behind her.  She 
           doesn’t notice.  He clears his throat. 
                                 MARCON
                        Uh, ma’am?

           Patti turns, flashes her A.D.A. credentials.

                                 PATTI
                        Dt. Marcon?

                                 MARCON
                        That’s right.  You’re that lady 
                        lawyer keeps calling over here.

                                 PATTI
                        The one and only.   
                            (re: the board)
                        Suspects in the LaRocca slaying? 

           Marcon takes a bite out of a meatball sub.  

                                 MARCON
                        Uh-huh.

                                 PATTI
                        Got a lead on any of these humps?   

                                 MARCON
                        Not yet.  But we’re hopeful 
                        something breaks soon.  

           Marcon wipes sauce off his tie.  Patti reaches out and 
           yanks a photo off the board.  

                                 PATTI
                        This guy’s dead.

                                 MARCON
                        You sure?

                                 PATTI
                        Mm. 

                                 MARCON
                        I’ll, ah, take him off the board 
                        then.  

           More sauce drips from Marcon’s meatball sub.  Patti starts 
           to head out, stops, and turns around.  

                                 PATTI
                        While I’m here...

           Patti pulls out a PHOTOGRAPH of JEAN coming out of Smooth 
           Nightclub.  
                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        Do you know this woman?

           Marcon looks at the photograph, narrows his eyes--

                                 MARCON
                        Is that the Rub Queen?

                                 PATTI
                        ...the what? 

           INT. MADEMOISELLE LINGERIE SHOP - NIGHT

           Jean and Cynthia browse an aisle of beautiful, flowing 
           nightgowns and lingerie. 

                                 JEAN
                        See anything you like?

           Cynthia continues to move through the silk garments, her 
           fingers sliding across each.  Jean holds one up?

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Can I buy you this one?

           Cynthia just shakes her head “no.”  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        What about this one?

           Cynthia shakes her head “no” again.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You can’t pay for everything, 
                        Jean.  I need my own money.  I 
                        need a job. 

                                 JEAN
                        Can I buy you one last thing?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        ...Ok, one last thing.  

           Jean grabs Cynthia by the waist, draws her into a kiss -- 
           they lose balance -- and tumble into a bed of luxurious 
           silk and satin garments.  The STORE OWNER appears.

                                 STORE OWNER
                        Ladies, please.

           Cynthia and Jean are tangled on the floor, laughing.

                                 JEAN
                        We’ll take it!  
                                 STORE OWNER
                        Which would you like, madam?  

                                 JEAN
                        All of it.  The whole shop!  
                            (off Cynthia’s look)
                        You said one last thing.

           INT. MADEMOISELLE LINGERIE SHOP - DAY

           A week later.  Cynthia now runs the shop.  She shows off 
           all the lovely nightgowns and lingerie to CUSTOMERS.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        This lace line is straight from 
                        Europe, made from the finest silks 
                        in Belgium.  Feel how soft that 
                        is.  Feels like heaven, don’t it?  
                        You can’t get lace this soft 
                        anywhere else in America.

           INT. MADEMOISELLE LINGERIE SHOP - BACK OFFICE - SAME TIME

           Sally Maite and Jean look through the shop’s books. 

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        This shop is fifteen hundred a 
                        month in the red, Jean. 

                                 JEAN
                        At that rate, I’ll go bankrupt 
                        sometime in 2027.  
                            (looks out at Cynthia)
                        It makes her happy, that’s all I 
                        care about.

           Jean’s POV: a HANDSOME DELIVERY GUY carries in three boxes 
           of lingerie.  Cynthia signs for the order and SMILES at 
           him.  They converse for a moment.  Cynthia’s smile lingers. 

           INT. JEAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jean lies on her side, looking at Cynthia coming out of the 
           bathroom, dressed in an amazing silk nightie. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        How do I look?

                                 JEAN
                        Gorgeous...

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Say it like you mean it.
           Cynthia snuggles up to Jean. 

                                 JEAN
                        You were making eyes with that 
                        delivery boy today.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        In the shop?  He was cute.  

                                 JEAN
                        I couldn’t tell by the way you 
                        were slobbering all over him.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Are you jealous?  

                                 JEAN
                        I’ve just never seen you look at 
                        anyone that way before.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I look at you just fine.  

                                 JEAN
                        Not like that.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Well, he’s a man.  It’s different.

                                 JEAN
                        Why’s it different?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Just is.  It’s fuckin’ biology.  
                        What do they call it -- hormonal. 

                                 JEAN
                        Hormonal?   

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Yeah, hormones.  Chemical 
                        reaction.  My body feels one way 
                        about you -- a real good way -- 
                        and it feels another way about a 
                        man.  

                                 JEAN
                        I want it to feel the same way.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I just told you it can’t because 
                        of biology! 
                                 JEAN
                        I don’t give a fuck about biology.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        That makes no sense.  Biology 
                        exists whether you give a fuck 
                        about it or not.  Jean, you ain’t 
                        a man.

                                 JEAN
                        What if I was?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What are we even talking about 
                        now, baby?  Where is this coming 
                        from?  I give you plenty.  

                                 JEAN
                        I want more.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I don’t give no one else what I 
                        give you.  That should be enough.  

           Jean puts her hand between Cynthia’s legs.

                                 JEAN
                        I want more.

                                 CYNTHIA
                            (arches her back and 
                              moans)
                        You want more?  

                                 JEAN
                        I want more.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You want more?

           They begin to make love.  

                                 JEAN
                        I want more.  I want more.  I want 
                        more.  I want more.  I want 
                        more... 

           INT. GEMINI SPA - NIGHT

           Another “Blue Night.”  Patti wanders the room full of OFF-
           DUTY (and on-duty) COPS, taking in everything.  She finds 
           Jean telling a joke to SEVERAL OFFICERS.  
                                 JEAN
                        ...Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice 
                        day! 

           The officers cracks up.  Jean wheels to see Patti behind 
           her.  The two women regard each other for a moment.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        ...Excuse me, gentlemen.  

           Jean and Patti walk through the spa.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not wearing your watch.  

           Patti draws the WATCH from her purse, hands it to Jean.

                                 PATTI
                        It looked better on your wrist 
                        than on mine.  

                                 JEAN
                        That’s a shame.

                                 PATTI
                        You’re a busy woman, Jean.  
                        Aquarius, Scorpio, Libra, Gemini, 
                        Spartacus, the Lion Den... 

                                 JEAN
                        Who knew massage was so popular?

           A DETECTIVE, flanked by TWO GIRLS, moves past them and 
           disappears into a room.  Jean smiles mischievously.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re just having a little bit of 
                        fun, Counselor.

                                 PATTI
                        Men do like their fun. 

                                 JEAN
                        Women don’t?

                                 PATTI
                        Of course we do...

                                 JEAN
                        ...You just don’t pay for it.

                                 PATTI
                        Right.
                                 JEAN
                        One day you will.  Ladies are 
                        selling and men are buying for one 
                        reason only: they run things and 
                        ladies don’t.  The day the shoe’s 
                        on the other foot, this place will 
                        be full of shirtless fellas and a 
                        line of ladies out the door ready 
                        to pay for their services.  

           Patti laughs.    

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s the truth. 

                                 PATTI
                        I’m sure.  But I’m not laughing 
                        about that, Jean.  

                                 JEAN
                        No?

                                 PATTI
                        No.  C’mere.

           Jean leans in. 

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        Closer.

           Jean, intrigued now, leans in closer.  Patti locks eyes 
           with her.  Her lips an inch from Jean’s.  She whispers:  

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        I’m coming after you.   

           Jean cocks her head, genuinely surprised.  Did she hear 
           Patti correctly?  Patti nods, she did.  

                                 JEAN
                        Just you?

                                 PATTI
                        Just me.  

           Now it’s Jean’s turn to laugh.  

                                 JEAN
                        Lemme know if you want a room, 
                        Counselor.  My girls would be 
                        happy to oblige. 

           Jean wanders off, completely unworried.  A crowd of cops 
           close in around her.  She owns the room.  
           INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE - DAY

           Low-ceiling, coffee-stained, 70s era office.  Special 
           Agents Conklin (whom we met earlier as Patti’s stuffy date 
           at Jean’s nightclub) and MORRIS (40s) are laughing their 
           asses off.  Patti sits across from them, file in hand.

                                 PATTI
                        You all done?  Not yet?  How about 
                        now  No?  Ok. 

           Once the men finally calm down--

                                 CONKLIN
                        How many of these establishments 
                        did you say the suspect owns?

                                 PATTI
                        Six parlors--

                                 CONKLIN
                        Six?

                                 PATTI
                        --Yes, and more on the way.

                                 CONKLIN
                        Alright, sure, we’ll look into it.  

           Patti gives them a wary look.

                                 CONKLIN (CONT’D)
                        Because it sounds like you could 
                        use a hand here.

           Morris snorts.  Conklin giggles.  

                                 CONKLIN (CONT’D)
                        You want us to give you a hand?    

                                 PATTI
                        We’re doing this again?

           They stifle giggles.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        She owns several other properties, 
                        including the Smooth nightclub-- 

                                 CONKLIN
                        --That the club you took me to?--

                                 PATTI
                        --Yes--  
                                 MORRIS
                            (gestures, surprised)
                        You two?

           Conklin winks at Morris.  

                                 PATTI
                        ...several other bars, health 
                        clubs, salvage yards -- a few of 
                        which the previous owners are now 
                        dead.   

           Patti shows them crime scene photos.  Conklin looks them 
           over.  His bemused expression fades.  

                                 CONKLIN
                        So she’s someone’s girl.  This is 
                        mob M.O. 101.  They find a 
                        gullible young woman, put her name 
                        on some deeds, and when things go 
                        south, they let her take the fall.  

                                 PATTI
                        Jean is no one’s girl, I can 
                        assure you.  

                                 CONKLIN
                        Jesus, Patti, you could throw a 
                        rock in this town and hit a bent 
                        cop or councilman.  This broad is 
                        a nobody.  Bring us something we 
                        can sink our teeth into.  

                                 PATTI
                        I brought you the goddamn 
                        Christmas turkey.  This woman has 
                        taken over Pittsburgh.  

           Conklin and Morris exchange glances.

                                 MORRIS
                        Ok.  Here’s what we gotta do. 

           Finally they’re getting serious.  Patti leans in--

                                 MORRIS (CONT’D)
                        This case, we gotta massage it.  
                        We gotta get our hands in there 
                        and rub it out.   
                            (cracking up)
                        Rub it right out!

           Patti doesn’t respond.  She gathers her file and leaves.  
                                 CONKLIN
                        Patti.  Come back.  We were only 
                        kidding.  C’mon.  We want to hear 
                        more about the Rub Queen!

                                                                CUT TO:

           SUPER: 1979

           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Jean and Cynthia, dressed in designer men’s and ladies wear 
           -- sunglasses, scarves -- sit with a DR. KELLY, a kindly-
           looking therapist with a beard, bowtie, and a wool sweater.   

                                 JEAN
                        We’re just like any other couple.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        That hardly says it.   

                                 DR. KELLY
                        Why do you say “hardly,” Cynthia?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Because there’s not a thing normal 
                        about us.  Never has been.

                                 DR. KELLY
                        So what makes you ladies abnormal?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Well, take last weekend for 
                        example.  

                                 JEAN
                        You’re gonna bring up last weekend 
                        here?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Why wouldn’t I bring it up here?  
                        This is where you come to talk 
                        things out.  Isn’t it?

                                 JEAN
                        Alright.  
                            (to the doc)
                        She wants to talk, we’ll talk.

                                 DR. KELLY
                        What happened last weekend?
           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Loud music and strobing light fills the crowded club.  Jean 
           and Cynthia dance and dance under the spinning globe.  

           INT. BATHROOM - SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - LATER (FLASHBACK)

           PARTY GIRLS in halter tops doing blow on the counters.  A 
           bathroom stall door shakes as TWO PEOPLE HAVE SEX INSIDE.  

           Cynthia and Jean tumble into the bathroom, sweaty from 
           dancing.  Cynthia pushes Jean against the wall and kisses 
           her.  They do a bump of COKE off each other’s fingers.   

           Jean eyes a BEAUTIFUL BLONDE.  The blonde responds with a 
           quick smile.  Cynthia clocks it AND WE CUT TO:

           INT. THERAPIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           Back to the session with Dr. Kelly...

                                 JEAN
                        One little smile and she lost her 
                        head.   

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I didn’t lose my head.  

           INT. JEAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           A plate SMASHES against the wall.  Jean ducks out of the 
           way as a second plate comes whizzing at her.  Cynthia’s 
           cheeks streaked with massacre and tears.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You fucked that girl!  

                                 JEAN
                        Baby, don’t be crazy! 

           She hurls another plate -- it hits Jean.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        IknowitIknowitIknowit!  

           Jeans wraps her arms around her.  They stand there hugging.

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT’D)
                        You promise it ain’t true?

                                 JEAN
                        I promise now.

                                 JEAN
                        Do you hear that?  Listen.  
                        They’re playing our song.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You know I hate this song, Jean.  

                                 JEAN
                        You don’t hate it, you love it, we 
                        love this song!  C’mon, dance with 
                        me...

           They giggle and begin to slow dance to Elton John on the 
           broken plates.  

                                 ELTON JOHN
                        Hope you don’t mind, hope you 
                        don’t mind.

                            (whispers in her ear)
                        I know you were with her.

           The house is now filled with bird cages.  Parrots and other 
           exotic birds flutter noisily around the cages.

           Jean reads an article about herself in The Pittsburgh 
           Gazette: “The New King of Pittsburgh”  Her finger moves 
           over the word “king.”  She likes it.  Her finger moves to a 
           word she doesn’t understand.  “UNCOUTH.”  

                                 JEAN

                        What’s this word mean?

                            (looks at the paper)
                        Uncouth?  I think it means 
                        uncivilized.  

                                 JEAN
                        Uncivilized?  What’s that, like I 
                        don’t have any manners?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        More like style, I think?

                        He’s saying I don’t have any 
                        style?

                        You got a lotta style, baby, don’t 
                        worry about it.  

           Jean stews.  Her eyes flick to the journalist’s byline.

           A bearded journalist, ANDY KAMMER, fiddles with a key in

           Jean turns her attention from the word she doesn’t like to 
           the accompanying photo she does.  A b&w snapshot of a 
           masculine-looking Jean walking down the street in one of 
           her tailored suits. 

                                 JEAN
                        It’s a good picture, don’t you 
                        think?

                        Sure, but... 

           Jean grabs a pair of scissors and cuts out the photo.

                                 JEAN
                        ...But what?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Last thing you want is attention, 
                        baby.  You should stay outta the 
                        papers.  

           Jean smiles at the “King of Pittsburgh” caption.

                        Yeah I guess you’re right.

           A MAKEUP ARTIST powders Jean’s nose as a CAMERAMAN moves 
           around her with a light meter.  The reporter, Mike Schnable 
           (whom we met in the opening), sits across holding a mic.

                                 JEAN

           Newspaper clippings of Jean on the wall, including the same 
           photograph Jean cut out of the paper.  Patti watches the 
           Schnable interview on her small B/W office TV.  It’s a 
           REPLAY OF THE SCENE IN ACT ONE:

                                 MIKE SCHNABLE
                        Some people call you the Queen of

                        sixty-four thousand dollar 
                        question: how’d you’d do it?  

           Patti leans forward: the camera moves in on Jean as she 
           smiles deviously.  Closer... Closer... CLOSER...

           The King of Pittsburgh shoulders into a new suit jacket -- 
           slides a .38 in her waist band -- drops a thick wad of CASH 
           in her pocket -- shoves a rolled-up SOCK in her underwear -- 
           admires her bulge in the standing mirror.  

           PRE-LAP the sound of a SNARLING PANTHER...

           A five hundred pound PANTHER snarls and lunges!  
           It’s stopped short by a CHAIN.  Jean, Miss Frank, and 
           Cynthia cower behind a desk, screaming and laughing.  Jean 
           holds two RAW STEAKS.  

                                 MISS FRANK
                        I just shit myself.

                        it!

           The panther ROARS.  They all scream again.

                        name’s Casey.

           The panther ROARS.  Everyone screams again.  Jean moves 
           closer to the animal.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Don’t don’t don’t--

           Jean throws Casey a steak.  The panther devours it.

                        Isn’t she a sweetheart?  See?  
                        Just a kitten.  Frank, go pet her.

                        near that beast.

                        --Don’t be a baby.  

           The ferocious panther SWINGS a huge PAW at them.  They 
           scream and SCRAMBLE out of the room.
           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They all spill into the hall, laughing.  Tom Clipp 
           approaches with bloody knuckles.  Jean stops laughing, 
           looks at him expectantly--

                                 JEAN
                        Is he ready?  

           Clipp nods.  Cynthia snorts COKE off her pinky. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Enough with that junk.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        It’s just a little bit, not a lot, 
                        just a little.  

           She holds some out for Jean.  Jean declines, hands her the 
           raw steak--  

                                 JEAN
                        Go feed Casey.  She loves you. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I’m not going near that thing.

           Jean and Miss Frank follow Clipp into another--

                        You know...
                            (off his confused look)
                        The dick.  The dick department. 

                                 NUDE GUY
                        What about, what about my dick?  

                                 JEAN
                        Is it dirty?  You got a dirty 
                        dick?

                                 NUDE GUY
                        Dirty?  No.

                                 JEAN
                        You sure?

                                 NUDE GUY
                        Yeah.

                                 JEAN
                        You sure?

                                 NUDE GUY
                        ...Yeah.

                                 JEAN
                        You don’t sound sure.  Three of my 
                        girls -- one, two, three -- caught 
                        the clap this weekend.  We checked 
                        the books, you were the only one 
                        with all three--  

                                 NUDE GUY
                        --No, no, no--

                                 JEAN
                        Did you clap-out my girls with 
                        your dirty dick?

                                 NUDE GUY
                        --No, no, no--
                                 JEAN
                        I think it was you.  

                                 NUDE GUY
                        It wasn’t me, I swear.  
                            (looks down at his cock)
                        My dick isn’t dirty.

           She leans over, grabs his COCK-- 

                                 JEAN
                        This looks like a dirty dick, even 
                        smells like a dirty dick...
                            (turns to Frank and Clipp)
                        What do you think, boys?

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Looks pretty dirty to me.

                                 JEAN
                        You would know--

                                 NUDE GUY
                        --It ain’t dirty, it’s fuckin’ 
                        clean--  

                                 JEAN
                        --It’s dirty, look at that thing--

                                 NUDE GUY
                        It’s clean!  I swear on my 
                        mother’s eyes! 

           A KNOCK at the door.  Big Amy steps in.  Jean looks over 
           her shoulder at her--

                                 BIG AMY 
                        You need to see this.  

                                 JEAN
                            (to the Nude Guy)
                        To be continued.

                                 NUDE GUY
                            (sobbing now)
                        It’s not dirty!  It’s clean!

           Jean and Miss Frank follow Big Amy out...

           They climb a quick flight of stairs...
           INT. HALLWAY - GEMINI SPA - CONTINUOUS

           ...walk down a hallway, pass several working girls and 
           customers, and enter the...

           INT. COUNT ROOM - GEMINI SPA - CONTINUOUS

           ...They find the safe OPEN and completely EMPTY.  

                                 BIG AMY
                        I left for lunch at five, when I 
                        came back at six it was empty.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        How much?

                                 BIG AMY
                        Forty-two thousand six hundred and 
                        eleven dollars.  

                                 MISS FRANK 
                        So someone walked in, picked the 
                        safe, and walked out the front 
                        door with forty-two thousand 
                        dollars?

                                 BIG AMY
                        Or they had help.

           Jean turns and looks out at her girls in the main room.  
           Suspicion blooms in her mind...

           A SCREAM.  Coming from a massage room.  They step into the--

           INT. HALLWAY - GEMINI SPA - CONTINUOUS

           Another SCREAM.  Jean and Miss Frank, head-cocked, follow 
           it a few doors down...

           INT. MASSAGE ROOM - GEMINI SPA - CONTINUOUS

           They enter to find APRIL (19) a chubby new girl with her 
           ass cheeks covered in gruesome BITE MARKS.  A beefy 
           SECURITY GUARD has a PERVERT’S face mashed down on the 
           massage table.  Blood pours from the pervert’s nose.  

                                 APRIL
                        Fucker bit me!

                                 JEAN
                            (to the pervert)
                        What’d you do, mistake my girl for 
                        a Big Mac?  
           The pervert gurgles unintelligibly, his face is mashed into 
           the massage table.  Jean looks over the girl’s chewed ass.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        No one’s gonna want this tush now, 
                        look what you done to it.   

           April starts crying.  Jean walks out of the room.  

           Everyone is quietly waiting for what happens next.  Jean 
           reappears with her baseball bat.  She hands it to April.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Let him have it.  

           April looks at the bat, then looks at Jean.

                                 APRIL
                        You want me to hit him?

                                 JEAN
                        With everything you got, darling.  

                                 PERVERT
                        Mfffvhvhd!

                                 JEAN
                            (to the Pervert)
                        Move and I put a bullet in your 
                        ear.

           The pervert goes still.  April lifts the bat over her head.  
           It shakes her hands. 

                                 APRIL
                        I can’t.  

                                 JEAN
                        You can.

                                 APRIL
                        I can’t.  I can’t do it, Jean.

                           JEAN
                                                     APRIL (CONT'D)
           Do it.
                                              I can’t.  

                                 JEAN
                        Smash this toothy bastard or I’m 
                        gonna use the bat on you!  

           April shuts her eyes and...

           .....SWINGS the bat down hard on the pervert’s face!
           Bones crunch, teeth fly. 

           Jean stalks out of the room, blood speckled on her suit--

           INT. HALLWAY - GEMINI SPA - CONTINUOUS

           A crowd of GIRLS and CUSTOMERS staring at her, shocked.  

           Jean moves through them silently with Miss Frank -- swipes 
           an empty COKE BOTTLE on a table -- and heads back down the 
           stairs...

           INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

           Cynthia is sitting on the floor.  The sound of the panther 
           GROWLING from behind Jean’s office door.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Is that blood on your suit, baby?  

           Jean doesn’t respond.  All three of them enter--

           INT. BASEMENT ROOM - GEMINI SPA - CONTINUOUS

           Clipp turns around, jumper cables in hand.  The other end 
           of the jumper cable clamped on the terrified Nude Guy’s 
           cock.  Jean approaches him. 

                                 NUDE GUY
                        No, no, please no.  I swear I 
                        didn’t do it.    

           Jean holds out the coke bottle.

                                 JEAN
                        Fill ‘er up...   

           Clipp unties him.  Nude Guy pisses in the bottle.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ll see what the doc says.  If 
                        it comes back dirty, we’ll find 
                        you.  

           Nude Guy hands Clipp the coke bottle of piss. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Now get out of here.

                                 NUDE GUY
                        Can I get my clothes?

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Get the fuck outta here!
           Miss Frank kicks his nude ass as he runs out naked...  

                                 JEAN
                        We’re closin’ up shop.  No one 
                        leaves.  I want every broad down 
                        here.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Why?  What happened?

                                 MISS FRANK
                        Someone robbed us. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Don’t hurt none of these girls, 
                        Jean.

                                 JEAN
                        I’m not going to hurt no one.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You promise?  

                                 JEAN
                        I promise, baby.
                            (to Miss Frank)
                        Frank, take Cyn home.

           Miss Frank puts his arm around Cynthia and leads her out.  
           Jean’s warm smile vanishes.  She turns to Tom Clipp--  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Get those bitches down here now. 

           INT. JEAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Cynthia lies on her side in bed, feigning sleep.  Jean, 
           just home, climbs into bed and throws an arm around her.  
           Cynthia’s eyes open and fall on Jean’s scraped-up knuckles.  
           She knows Jean roughed up at least one of her girls.  Hold.   

                                 CYNTHIA
                        ...You’re no better than them.   

                                 JEAN
                        Who?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        The assholes who used to run all 
                        the things you run now.  
                                 JEAN
                        They gotta fear you.  It can’t go 
                        any other way.  Remember when I 
                        said that?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I remember.  It was about being 
                        free then, but it’s not no more.  
                        This is about doing whatever you 
                        want cause you can.   

                                 JEAN
                        ...Same thing.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You don’t really believe that.

           Cynthia sighs, rolls over, and goes to sleep.  

           INT. MAYOR’S OFFICE - CITY HALL - DAY

           A meeting in progress with Mayor Caliguiri.  D.A. Duggan 
           and several of the Mayor’s aides huddle around the mayor.  

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        It’s a corruption case and you 
                        start pulling that thread, who 
                        knows where it ends...?

                                 SECRETARY (O.S.)
                        Can’t go in there!

           Everyone’s head turns as the door opens and Patti enters, a 
           breathless SECRETARY behind her.

                                 PATTI
                            (to the secretary)
                        Thank you...

           The Mayor puts up a hand to his secretary: it’s ok.  Patti 
           strides to the Mayor and Duggan.

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                            (to Duggan)
                        Why the hell does this woman keep 
                        crashing our meetings?

           Patti lays a crime scene photo of a muddy corpse in front 
           of them. 

                                 PATTI
                        Owen Dell.  U.S.W. delegate.  Ran 
                        a local on the west side.  
           Patti drops a new crime scene photo of the DEAD NUDE GUY.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        Irving Stein.  Another delegate.  
                        Found in a downtown dumpster 
                        yesterday.  Both were regulars at 
                        Gemini Spa.

           QUICK FLASH ON: JEAN, MISS FRANK, TOM CLIPP executing each

                        We’ve got seven bodies tied to 
                        Jean Gill and her crew this year 
                        alone.

                        Jean who?  

           Patti drops a photo of Jean in front of the Mayor.  

                                 PATTI
                        Jean Marie Gill.  She’s 
                        responsible for the death of 
                        Sebastian LaRocca and his nephew, 
                        Nick Delucia.  

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        This woman?  

                                 PATTI
                        This woman.

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        You’re telling me this woman is 
                        running organized crime in 
                        Pittsburgh? 

                                 PATTI
                        I am.

           Patti drops a surveillance photo of Tom Clipp.
                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        Her crew consists of Tom Clipp, ex 
                        mob enforcer for LaRocca...

           Another photo of Clipp walking with Miss Frank.

                        sometimes lover, Frank Cocchiara.  
                        He goes by Miss Frank.   

           The Mayor gives Patti and Duggan a “you gotta be kidding 
           me” look.  Duggan purses his lips.

                        We can continue to not take these 
                        people seriously if you’re ok with 
                        finding fresh bodies in every 
                        Thursday’s trash pick up. 

           The Mayor grinds his teeth, trying to wrap his head around 
           this.  He picks up the photo of Clipp and Miss Frank.

                                 MAYOR CALIGUIRI
                        These two are lovers, you said?

           INT. GEMINI SPA - DAY

           The front doors open... Patti, WARRANT in hand, marches in 
           with FIVE PLAINSCLOTHED COPS.  Little Jane, working the 
           front desk, gives them a warm smile--

                                 LITTLE JANE
                        Todd, Curtis... you guys come in 
                        for the usual?

           Patti glares.  The embarrassed cops avert their eyes.  

                                 PATTI
                        Ma’am, this is a warrant.  Come 
                        out from behind that desk, please.

           Jean appears, coffee in hand, completely unworried.  

                                 JEAN
                        Counselor...  

                                 PATTI
                        Jean.  This is for you.   
                                 JEAN
                            (leafs through the 
                              warrant)
                        Oh my.  

           A plainsclothed cop, FERGUSON, offers--

                                 FERGUSON
                        If you could have a seat, Jean, we 
                        won’t be too long.

                                 PATTI
                        Actually, we’ll be here all night.  
                        Where’s the count room?

                                 JEAN
                        Second door on the right.

           Patti makes a beeline to it. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOBBY - GEMINI SPA - LATER - NIGHT

           Jean smiles with her hands folded behind her head as Patti -
           - sour look on her face, the search was obviously 
           unsuccessful -- exits with the cops, one by one, empty-
           handed.

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           Another night.  Party in full swing.  Suddenly, the lights 
           turn on.  Instant buzz kill.  Patti and several Pittsburgh 
           COPS enter, holding a warrant.  

           INT. MONEY ROOM - SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - LATER - NIGHT

           Patti and the cops stand outside the room with the MANAGER.  
           She gestures for him to open it.  She enters.  The shelves 
           are barren, dust outlines of where papers once lined the 
           shelves.  The money room is COMPLETELY EMPTY. 

           INT. JEAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ding-Dong.  Cynthia opens the door: Patti, warrant in hand; 
           THREE COPS behind her.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Are you fucking serious?
           INT. KITCHEN - JEAN'S HOUSE - LATER

           Cynthia and Jean sit in the kitchen quietly as Patti and 
           the cops turn over her house, ripping into pillows, 
           mattresses, sofa cushions.  

                                 JEAN
                        She isn’t going to find anything, 
                        don’t worry.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I’m not sure she cares.  Looks 
                        happy enough tearing the place 
                        apart.  
                            (beat)
                        Can’t you give her some cash to 
                        get lost? 

                                 JEAN
                        She ain’t interested in money.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Then give her more money! 

           They both turn to see Patti standing outside the kitchen, 
           eavesdropping on their conversation. 

                                 JEAN
                        What do you say, Counselor, would 
                        a suitcase of green send you on 
                        your merry way?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You could always try and find out? 

           The question hang in the air like a dangling carrot, but 
           Jean doesn’t bite.  Cynthia slides a mug of tea to Patti.  

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT’D)
                        I made you some tea.  Ain’t no rat 
                        poison in it or nothin’.  Promise.

                                 PATTI
                            (to the cops)
                        Let’s go, boys.  

           Patti and the cops leave, but not before Patti gives Jean 
           one last lingering look.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Ok, that was scary.  

                                 JEAN
                        Calm down.
                                 CYNTHIA
                        Did you see that look?  

                                 JEAN
                        I saw it.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        That’s a “I’m never gonna stop 
                        comin’ after you” look.  This 
                        woman’s trouble, Jean. 

           Jean thinks.  She picks up the mug of tea.  Looks at it:

                                 JEAN
                        You really put rat poison in this?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Maybe a little bit.

           INT. GEMINI SPA - DAY

           Jean enters the lobby with Tom Clipp and Miss Frank.  Not a 
           customer to be found.  Big Amy crosses to Jean, worried.  

                                 BIG AMY 
                        Jean.

                                 JEAN
                        I know...

                                 BIG AMY
                        They came again last night.  Threw 
                        all the customers out.  We’re down 
                        sixty percent this month.  

                                 JEAN
                        I’ll handle it.    

                                 BIG AMY 
                        Everything on the block is getting 
                        killed.  

                                 JEAN
                        Yeah...

           INT. DUGGAN'S OFFICE - DAY

           D.A. Charlie Duggan looks up from his paperwork as Patti 
           enters his office.

                                 PATTI
                        We need more warrants.
                                 DUGGAN
                        How many more?

                                 PATTI
                        Every bar, restaurant, health 
                        club, rub parlor, all of it, every 
                        piece of property in Jean Gill’s 
                        name.  

           Patti leaves.  Duggan waits until she is out of earshot.  
           He picks up the phone and dials a number.

           INT. GEMINI SPA - JEAN'S OFFICE - LATER - DAY

           Charlie Duggan huddles with a concerned Jean in her office.  
           The panther, Casey, growls in the dark corner of the room.  
           Duggan throws concerned looks toward it--

                                 DUGGAN
                        Is that, is that a--

                                 JEAN
                        She’s looking to make a name for 
                        herself.

                                 DUGGAN
                            (distracted)
                        --Who?  

                                 JEAN
                        The A.D.A. broad in your office, 
                        who do you think?  

                                 DUGGAN
                        Did you really try to give her a 
                        watch?  

                                 JEAN
                        Who doesn’t want a Rolex?  What 
                        kind of asshole sends that back?  

                                 DUGGAN
                        Patti’s a crusader.  Always been 
                        that way.  She’s a true believer.

                                 JEAN
                        How could you hire somebody like 
                        that?  

                                 DUGGAN
                        I know, it was a bad call.

                                 JEAN
                        We need to get rid of her.   
                                 DUGGAN
                        Get rid of her?

                                 JEAN
                        Not like that.  Fire her.  

                                 DUGGAN
                        That would be a problem. 

                                 JEAN
                        Why?  You’re the DA.  You can hire 
                        and fire anyone you want.  

                                 DUGGAN
                        She’s the first female A.D.A. in 
                        the city.  I fire her, it would be 
                        news, and attract a lot of 
                        unwanted attention.

                                 JEAN
                        --Cause she’s a broad?  Jesus 
                        Christ!

           Casey ROARS.  Duggan twitches.  Jean grabs a steak from a 
           small pile of raw beef on her desk and lobs it into the 
           dark corner of the room.

                                 DUGGAN
                        She’s going after your health 
                        clubs next.  

           Jean slides over a briefcase of cash.  

                                 JEAN
                        Get her off my ass, Charlie.

           Duggan scoops up the case and gets the hell out of there.

           INT. CONKLIN’S OFFICE - FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           A pair of FBI AGENTS drop two surveillance photographs in 
           front of Conklin: Charlie Duggan enters Gemini with no 
           briefcase; he exits Gemini with a BRIEFCASE.

           Conklin leans back in his chair thinking.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DUGGAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie Duggan is cooking dinner for his wife, TRUDY 
           (50ish), DAUGHTER (12), and SON (10).  He’s showing his son 
           how to make chicken parmesan.  

                                 DUGGAN
                        We roll the chicken it in the 
                        flour and then it goes in the egg 
                        and then back in the flour 
                        again... like so.  

           The door bell rings.   

                                 DUGGAN (CONT’D)
                        You get that, honey?

           His daughter hops up, walks through the house, opens the 
           front door to see: SIX FBI AGENTS.  

                                 DUGGAN’S DAUGHTER
                        ...Dad?

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Duggan has his head in his hands, deeply ashamed.  A stack 
           of HOMOSEXUAL MAGAZINES, FILM REELS, and Jean’s suitcase of 
           cash on the table.  Conklin and Morris across from him.  
           Morris slides a fingers down the stack of magazines.  

                                 CONKLIN
                        You’re a good man, Charlie.  No 
                        one wants to embarrass you.

                                 MORRIS
                        You give us things, we give you 
                        things.  It doesn’t have to be 
                        anymore complicated than that.

                                 DUGGAN
                        What do you want?

                                 CONKLIN
                        Not much.  Few dirty cops, maybe a 
                        councilmen, judge or two... 

                                 MORRIS
                        ...and of course, the rub queen.  
                        You do that...
                            (gestures the evidence)
                                 MORRIS (CONT'D)
                        ...none of this ever gets made 
                        public.

           Charlie Duggan puts his head back in his hands.

           EXT. GEMINI SPA - NIGHT

           Jean and Clipp step out of the building and walk around the 
           parking lot, hands in pockets.  

                                 CLIPP
                        Charlie Duggan walked into a 
                        federal building at nine am this 
                        morning.    

                                 JEAN
                        He’s the D.A., I’m sure he goes 
                        there all the time.

                                 CLIPP
                        He’s still in there.  Twelve 
                        hours.

                                 JEAN
                        How do you know that?

                                 CLIPP
                        You pay me to know that.  
                            (beat)
                        No one spends twelve hours talking 
                        to the feds unless they’re talkin’ 
                        to the fucking feds.

                                 JEAN
                        Shit.  

           Clipp pursues his lips.  There’s something else.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        What?  

                                 CLIPP
                        New York called again.  Carmine 
                        Sozzi’s people.  I told them we 
                        weren’t interested, again.  

           Jean thinks.  

                                 JEAN
                        Set it up.  A meet.  Let’s hear 
                        what he has to say.    

           Clipp nods, but his expression is noncommittal.  
                                 CLIPP
                        It’s New York, Jean.  That’s a 
                        leap for us.  They’re no joke.  

                                 JEAN
                        Neither are we.  

           Clipp nods, ok.  He’ll set up the meet.  Then:

                                 CLIPP
                        So what do you want to do about 
                        Duggan?

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER - NIGHT

           Charlie Duggan drives home from the federal building in his 
           Oldsmobile.  Classical music turned up loud on his radio.  
           His face is a blank slate.  

           In the rearview mirror, a pair of headlights appear.

           INT. MISS FRANK’S CAR - SAME TIME

           Miss Frank tails Duggan a few car lengths behind.  Disco 
           music pumps from his car radio.

           INT./EXT. DUGGAN’S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

           Duggan pulls his Oldsmobile into his garage.  The classical 
           music still plays. 

           EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - SAME TIME

           Miss Frank sits in his parked car, watching Duggan’s 
           Oldsmobile.  He pulls a .38 from the glove box. 

           INT. DUGGAN’S GARAGE - SAME TIME

           Duggan gazes at himself in the rearview mirror.  His 
           expression distraught, hopeless.  The classical music build 
           and builds.

           EXT. DUGGAN’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Miss Frank strides up Duggan’s driveway.  A dog BARKS from 
           behind the fence.  Miss Frank pulls out his .38-- 

           INT. DUGGAN’S OLDSMOBILE - SAME TIME

           Duggan pulls a .22 from the glove box.  The classical music 
           hits a crescendo.  He puts the gun into his mouth...  
           EXT. DUGGAN'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Miss Frank is halfway up the driveway when--

           BAM!

           Blood and brain splat the back window of the Oldsmobile.  

           Without breaking stride, Miss Frank slides the gun back in 
           his pants, turns around, and walks back to his car.  

           The sound of Charlie Duggan’s SCREAMING wife fills the air 
           as Miss Frank drives away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           The glass door is KICKED open.  Patti moves inside, 
           furious.  AGENTS look up from cubicles.  

           INT. FBI FIELD OFFICE - CONKLIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Special Agent Conklin in the middle of a meeting, 
           surrounded by three FBI AGENTS...

                                 CONKLIN
                        ...Make no mistake, gentlemen, 
                        this is a cancer and we’re going 
                        to surgically remove it, piece by 
                        piece...

           The door BANGS open.

                                 CONKLIN (CONT’D)
                        --Patti--

           Patti cross the room and PUNCHES him in the face.

           SUPER: 1980

           INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - GEMINI SPA - DAY

           Tom Clipp and Miss Frank stand outside Jean’s office with 
           FOUR NEW YORK GANGSTERS who are clearly uncomfortable in 
           the presence of homosexuals.  Miss Frank gives one of them 
           a wink.  The disgusted gangster quickly looks away.  

           INT. JEAN’S OFFICE - GEMINI SPA - SAME TIME

           Jean, dressed in a camel hair trench coat with a shirt 
           collar on the outside, in a closed-door meeting with...
           CARMINE SOZZI (50ish), a refined New York underboss donned 
           in a cashmere trench coat, Rolex, and gold pinkie ring.  
           Casey, Jean’s panther, snores in the corner of the room.

                                 CARMINE SOZZI
                        There comes a point in every 
                        successful person’s life where 
                        they have to make a decision.  Is 
                        it enough, this success, or do you 
                        want more?  It’s a question that 
                        separates the rich from the 
                        wealthy, from the guy who started 
                        McDonalds to the guy who sold 10 
                        billion McDonalds hamburgers.  The 
                        question for you, Jean, are you 
                        satisfied with one city, or do you 
                        want ten?  Or twenty?  Or the 
                        whole goddamn country?  Because if 
                        you make a deal with us, you will 
                        be giving up this tiny shit-
                        kickin’ pie for a slice of pie the 
                        size of Manhattan island.  We can 
                        bring your anabolics pipeline 
                        national.  Every NFL player, every 
                        olympian, and every nut in America 
                        who wants to look like Lou fuckin’ 
                        Ferrigno. 

                                 JEAN
                        Gill.  

                                 CARMINE SOZZI
                        Pardon?  

                                 JEAN
                        Call me Gill.  

                                 CARMINE SOZZI
                        Sure, whatever you like.  

                                 JEAN
                        Gill.  

                                 CARMINE SOZZI
                        Gill.  So are we taking you 
                        national or not, Gill?

           PUSH IN ON JEAN.  

                                 JEAN
                        Let’s do it.

           They stand and hug.  Suddenly -- shouting -- footsteps -- 
           more shouting. 
                                 CARMINE SOZZI
                        What’s happening?  What is this?

           The door flies open.  Patti Truleski and SEVERAL COPS flood 
           the room.  

                                 PATTI
                        Get those hands up, up, up.  

           Carmine and Jean put their hands against the wall.  The 
           cops frisk them both.

                                 PATTI (CONT’D)
                        Jean, you’re under arrest.  

                                 COP #1
                        Holy shit, is that a lion?

                                 JEAN
                        What’s the charge?  

           No one answers her.  The cop who frisked Carmine hands a 
           money clip with a thick wad of cash to Patti.  Patti leans 
           in close to Carmine, hands him the money clip-- 

                                 PATTI
                        Get the fuck out of my town.  

                                 CARMINE SOZZI
                        Yes, ma’am.  

           Carmine takes the money clip and ducks out of the room with 
           his crew.     

           INT. PITTSBURGH JAIL CELL - DAY

           Jean sits in a cell, alone.  Clacking high heels give way 
           to Patti, who appears on the other side of the bars in a 
           brand new perm and power suit.  Jean regards her for a 
           moment and starts to clap slowly.  

                                 JEAN
                        Congratulations.  The first lady 
                        D.A. in Pittsburgh. 

                                 PATTI
                        You made the top of the fed’s 
                        crime pyramid.  That’s a first 
                        too, Jean. 

                                 JEAN
                        Gill.  No one calls me Jean no 
                        more...  
                            (beat)
                                 JEAN (CONT'D)
                        It feels good to be the boss, 
                        doesn’t it? 

                                 PATTI
                        I’ve got a door to my office now, 
                        a girl who brings me coffee and 
                        another one who answers my phone 
                        and I still can’t put you in front 
                        of any judge in this county.  

                                 JEAN
                        Those boys do like to party. 

                                 PATTI
                        But I brought you down here 
                        anyways because it doesn’t matter.  
                        You’re going in this cell every 
                        week.  I don’t care if it’s for 
                        two hours or ten minutes.  I’m 
                        going to haul your ass down here 
                        because I fucking can.  Because it 
                        makes me feel good.  We’re going 
                        to do this dance every week, Jean. 

           Jean just smiles at her.  The sound of a door opening down 
           the hall.  Footsteps--

                                 JEAN
                        ...My lawyer’s here.  Guess I’ll 
                        be seeing you next week.

           A GUARD opens Jean’s cell.  Jean walks past Patti...

           INT. JEAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jean feeds her birds fluttering around a giant bird cage in 
           the middle of the living room.  Cynthia nervously paces 
           behind her. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What did I tell you?  What did I 
                        say?  I said trouble.  I said this 
                        crazy ass bitch was trouble.  It 
                        was true when I said it and it’s 
                        even more true now.  

           Jean remains silent, feeding her birds.  

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT’D)
                        I can be packed in an hour. 

                                 JEAN
                        What for?
                                 CYNTHIA
                        “What for?”  “What for?”  Honey, 
                        it’s over.  We gotta go.  

                                 JEAN
                        Go where?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Anyfuckingwhere but Pittsburgh! 
                        We can leave tonight.  Right now.  

                                 JEAN
                        You wanna leave?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I want us to get in the car and I 
                        want us to drive and I want us to 
                        never look back and I want us to 
                        do that right now.

                                 JEAN
                        You really wanna leave all this?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        What’d I just say?  

                                 JEAN
                        Then go.  The door’s right there.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        That’s your answer?  Really?   

           Jean doesn’t respond.  Cynthia looks at her, hurt.  She 
           stomps away.  

                                 CYNTHIA (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, Jean!

           Cynthia slams the bedroom door.  Jean sighs, walks over to 
           the door.  It’s locked.

                                 JEAN
                        Cyn... I’m sorry.  C’mon, open up. 

           Something heavy slams on the floor in the room.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s that sound?  What are you 
                        doing in there?  

           The door opens.  Cynthia blows past her with a small 
           suitcase, dresses sticking out the sides.  
                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        Stop, stop, stop.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        --No, no--

           Jean hugs her.  Cynthia stops fighting her and drops the 
           suitcase.  

                                 JEAN
                        I can’t let this woman run me out 
                        of my own town.  I just can’t--

                                 CYNTHIA
                        It’s fucking Pittsburgh, baby.  We 
                        ain’t nowhere special. 

                                 JEAN
                        It’s my town.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        We don’t need this place.  It’s a 
                        big fuckin’ world out there, and 
                        we got a dump truck of cash to 
                        live like kings anywhere in it.  

           Jean lets go of her and walks over to the mirror.  Looks at 
           herself.  Cynthia comes up behind her and hugs her. 

           HOLD ON JEAN LOOKING AT HERSELF IN THE MIRROR.

                                 JEAN
                        I can’t leave.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        Why, baby, why?

                                 JEAN
                            (looks at her reflection)
                        This.  This don’t work nowhere 
                        else.  I walk down the street, no 
                        one laughs, no one snickers, no 
                        one would dare.  They respect me.  
                        They fear me.  I mean something 
                        here.  Maybe one day soon I’ll 
                        mean something somewhere else.  
                        But that’s not today.  You take 
                        this town from me, I’m a punchline 
                        in a suit.  
           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           It’s a slow night.  Jean holds court with a table of drag 
           queens, homosexuals, and a few other hanger-ons.  A worried-
           looking Tom Clipp slides in beside her.   

                                 CLIPP
                        The Lady D.A. arrested another 
                        councilman.  

           INT. COUNCILMAN’S OFFICE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           A distraught CITY COUNCILMAN tries to climb out a window 
           while TWO COPS and Patti drag him back in. 

                                 PATTI
                        Grab his damn legs.  

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           BACK TO: Jean and Clipp.  She pours him a drink.

                                 CLIPP
                        Every time she takes someone down, 
                        it gets harder to do business.  

                                 JEAN
                        The world’s not running out of 
                        greedy councilmen anytime soon.  
                        Find a new one.  Where are we with 
                        Carmine?  

                                 CLIPP
                        First shipment is Super Bowl 
                        Sunday.  He wants to double the 
                        delivery.

                                 JEAN
                        Double?  Can we handle that?  
                            (off Clipp’s nod yes)
                        Great.  Now go find us some new 
                        friends in City Hall.

           INT. STEEL MILL - NIGHT

           An abandoned steel mill turned anabolic steroids lab.  

           SUPER: Jan 20, 1980.  Super Bowl Sunday.

           Crates and crates of steroid vials are loaded by PAGAN 
           BIKERS into the back of CITY GARBAGE TRUCKS.  

           Clipp and Miss Frank oversee the loading.  Miss Frank picks 
           up a crate, groans under the heavy weight.
                                 MISS FRANK
                        You need juice to move the juice.

                                 CLIPP
                        Gotta get you in the gym, Frank.

                                 MISS FRANK
                        And wreck my girlish figure? 

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - SAME TIME

           Jean and Cynthia hosting the 1980 “Steelers vs Rams” Super 
           Bowl party.  Terry Bradshaw throws deep to John Stallworth 
           for the go ahead touchdown.  The club goes apeshit!  Jean 
           high-fiving everyone.  

           She finds Cynthia sitting glumly in the corner of the room.

                                 JEAN
                        Come to the table, come on, what 
                        are you doing over here?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        It was fun for the first three 
                        Super Bowls.  They’re just showin’ 
                        off now.  

           Jean gives her a peck on the cheek and resumes cheering.

           EXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT

           The two trucks filled with steroids fly down a dirt road.  
           Clipp and TWO PAGAN BIKERS in one truck.  Miss Frank and 
           TWO MORE BIKERS in the other. 

           INT. TRUCK #2 - SAME TIME

                                 MISS FRANK
                        How about some tunes in here? 

           He pops in a tape -- disco music plays.  The bikers give 
           him a sour look.

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - SAME TIME

           The game is over.  The party’s hit the dance floor.  Jean 
           and Cynthia slow dance under the disco ball to Roxy Music’s 
           cover of “Jealous Guy.”  Both song and dance bittersweet.  

                                 JEAN
                        What do you think of New York?
                                 CYNTHIA
                        New York’s nice.  

                                 JEAN
                        I’m thinking New York soon.  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        A trip? 

                                 JEAN
                        More than a trip.  I’m thinking 
                        for good.  Get ourselves set up 
                        right.  A big penthouse 
                        overlooking the park.  Near that 
                        zoo you like.  Casey can live 
                        there.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        ...Really?   

                                 JEAN
                        Would you like that?  

                                 CYNTHIA
                        You know I would.    

                                 JEAN
                        Gill and Cynthia take on New York.

                                 CYNTHIA
                        ...When?

                                 JEAN
                        Soon, baby, soon.  

           Cynthia puts her head on Jean’s shoulder.  She’s heard 
           these promises before.  Her face filled with doubt.  

           Jean’s eyes flick to club entrance -- Cynthia turns... 

           TWO GUNMEN IN SUITS HAVE ENTERED THE CLUB.  SHOCK RACES 
           THROUGH THE CLUB-GOERS AS THE GUNMEN RAISE MACHINE GUNS.  

           Jean shields Cynthia, pushing people out of the way as-- 

           Bullets fly.  The room fills with gun smoke.  The spinning 
           globe CRASHES to the floor, smashing into a million pieces.  

           Jean and Cynthia drop to the floor in a hail of glass, 
           smoke, and bullets.  

           Jean’s BODYGUARDS fire back at the gunmen.  
           Several CLUB-GOERS and a COCKTAIL WAITRESS are wounded in 
           the crossfire.  The gunmen are killed. 

           INT. TRUCK #1 (MOVING) - SAME TIME

           Clipp’s truck.  County Music plays softly from the radio.  
           Headlights appear on the horizon.  A HORN honking loudly.  

           The headlights are driving in the wrong lane directly at 
           the trucks. 

                                 CLIPP
                        What’s with this guy?

           The headlights SCREECH to a stop, BLOCKING BOTH LANES.  
           Clipp and Miss Frank stop to avoid a collision.  

           HEADLIGHTS flood from the fields on either side of them.  

           MEN WITH MACHINE GUNS STEP OUT OF CARS.

           INT. TRUCK #2 - SAME TIME

           Miss Frank looks at the gunmen.

                                 MISS FRANK 
                        Oh, fuck.  

           INT. TRUCK #1 - SAME TIME

           Clipp tries to open the door...

                                 CLIPP
                        Frank!

           The night air is filled with MUZZLE FLASH.  The interior of 
           both trucks are riddled with bullets.  

           Tom Clipp is killed instantly.  So are the bikers.  

           Miss Frank crawls out of his truck, bleeding from several 
           bullet wounds.  

           He hits the asphalt with a thud but keeps crawling to the 
           shoulder of the highway.  

           Men from the field -- NEW YORK WISE GUYS -- Carmine Sozzi’s 
           crew -- appear.  They climb into the trucks and push the 
           bodies out.

           Tom Clipp is unceremoniously tossed onto the shoulder of 
           the road.  
           One of the killers stands over Miss Frank and puts a bullet 
           in the back of his head.

           They hop into the trucks and drive away.  

           INT. SMOOTH NIGHTCLUB - SAME TIME

           The club has cleared out.  The distant ring of approaching 
           police sirens.  Jean lies atop Cynthia on floor, surrounded 
           by broken glass from the fallen globe.  

                                 JEAN
                        Are you ok?  Are you ok?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I’m alright.  Baby, you’re 
                        bleeding.

           Jean feels her neck.  Blood.  She was grazed by a bullet.  

           Cynthia covers her mouth in horror.  Another inch and Jean 
           would be dead.  She goes to hug her but Jean is already 
           climbing to her feet in a rage.  

           Cynthia watches as Jean walks over to the dead gunmen and 
           FIRES A ROUND OF BULLETS INTO BOTH OF THEM.

           INT. JEAN’S OFFICE - GEMINI SPA - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jean, neck still bleeding, hair covered with dust and 
           glass, sits in the quiet of her office, phone to her ear.  

                                 PATTI (V.O., VIA PHONE)
                        ...They’re gone, Jean.  Carmine 
                        Sozzi hit the trucks the same time 
                        he hit the club.  Highway patrol’s 
                        scraping what’s left of them off 
                        the 302.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Highway Patrol unspool yellow crime tape.  Tom Clipp and 
           Miss Frank are zipped into body bags.  

           INT. PATTI’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Patti, phone to ear, shouldering into a parka.

                        Once Carmine finds out you’re 
                        alive, he’ll come back to finish 
                        the job.

           Jean doesn’t respond.

                        Could be in a week.  Could be

           Jean hangs up.  Stewing.  She picks up the phone cradle and 
           smashes it against the wall.  

           EXT. GEMINI SPA - LATER - NIGHT

           Jean steps out of the closed spa into the deathly quiet 
           night.  Looks around for possible mob hitmen.  Sees no one.

           A horn.  Distant.  Coming from a freight train.  Jean peers 
           out at the parking lot.  

           Not a soul out here.  Jean walks to her car.  Her shoes 
           crunch audibly on gravel.  Every sound amplified.  

           The freight train growing louder as it nears.  

           Jean looks up -- a lone MAN appears across the street, 
           bathed in light under a street lamp.  He doesn’t move.  

           Jean’s heart begins to pound.  She keeps walking to her car 
           while throwing glances at him.  

           The man shifts from one foot to the other.  Jean walks 
           faster.  The sound of the freight train now very loud.  
           Keys hit the lock.  

           She quickly starts her car and drives away as the sound of 
           the freight train hits a deafening roar.  

           INT. HOSPITAL - LATER - NIGHT

           Cynthia sits on a gurney behind a curtain in the ER.  
           Patti, wearing a parka, standing across from her.  
           Cynthia’s hands shake.  The nightclub shooting still fresh 
           in her mind.  She downs a couple pills.  

                                 PATTI
                        It’s all over, Cynthia.  Not even 
                        a question of when.  Just a 
                        question of where: Allegheny 
                        cemetery or Allenwood Federal Pen.  

           Cynthia covers her face and starts to cry.
           INT. JEAN’S CAR - PITTSBURGH - MORNING

           Morning light shines on Jean’s sleeping face.  She awakens 
           with a start.  Parked under an overpass.  

           INT. GAS STATION - FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Jean splashes water on her face.  She looks at herself in 
           the mirror.  Hold.  She decides on a course of action.

                                 JEAN
                        Alright...

           EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           She leans against a pay phone, talking:

           Jean hangs up. 

           INT. JEAN’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Cynthia hangs up.  She takes a cigarette out.  Her hands 
           tremble as she tries to light it.  
           Across from her: Patti and two LOCAL COPS.  Patti is 
           thumbing through BUSINESS LEDGERS IN LEATHER BINDERS.  
           JEAN’S BUSINESS LEDGERS.  

                                 PATTI
                        You’re saving her life, Cynthia.

                        Go fuck yourself.

           INT. CYNTHIA’S LINGERIE SHOP - LATER - DAY

           Jean strides inside the closed shop.  She unlocks a heavy 
           deadbolt on a steel door and steps inside--  

           INT. BACK OFFICE - CYNTHIA’S LINGERIE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           A bookkeeper’s office.  This is where all of Jean’s illegal 
           books are kept here.  She moves to a big safe -- enters a 
           combo -- STACKS OF CASH INSIDE.  Most of it loose.  She 
           starts stuffing it into her duffel bags.  

           Sally Maite appears in the outer room with takeout lunch.  

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        Gill?

                                 JEAN
                            (distracted)
                        Sally...

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        Did you get the ledgers?

           Jean’s not really paying attention as she stuffs a duffel.

                                 JEAN
                        Ledgers?  

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        Cynthia came by earlier, said you 
                        wanted the ledgers.    

           Jean stops stuffing on “Cynthia.”  Dread washes over her.

                                 JEAN
                        Cynthia was here?  Today?

                                 SALLY MAITE
                        Came by first thing in the 
                        morning.  

                                 JEAN
                        She took the ledgers?
                                 SALLY MAITE
                        She said you asked for them?

                                 JEAN
                            (ashen)
                        Goddamn.

           Jean slumps to the floor.  Closes her eyes.  

                                 SALLY MAITE (O.S.)
                        Jean...?

           Jean opens her eyes.  Sees something odd: Sally Maite has 
           her hands in the air because--

           A DOZEN FEDERAL AGENTS LEAD BY SPECIAL AGENT CONKLIN AND 
           SPECIAL AGENT MORRIS ARE FLOODING INTO THE STORE WITH 
           BADGES AND GUNS OUT.  

                                 MORRIS
                        FBI!  

                                 CONKLIN
                        Ladies, I need you on the ground, 
                        hands behind your head.  

           Jean doesn’t put her hands behind her head or lie on the 
           ground.  She simply hands Conklin the duffel of cash.  

                                 JEAN
                        Just take me to fuckin’ jail.

           INTO. GEMINI SPA - DAY

           FBI and LOCAL POLICE raid the spa.  MALE CUSTOMERS run out 
           of rooms nude.  Some are tackled, others make it out the 
           front door.  The GIRLS are robed and handcuffed. 

           INT. COUNT ROOM - GEMINI SPA - SAME TIME

           AGENTS use crowbars to pull the safe from the wall.  They 
           find something hidden behind the: a small anteroom FILLED 
           with boxes and boxes of BETA CAM TAPES.  

                                 AGENT #1
                        What do we have here?

           We see some of the labels: CHARLIE DUGGAN DA; JUDGE ALLAN 
           SPIRO; POLICE CAPTAIN JAY MCBRIDE.  These are the sex tapes 
           Jean made of her powerful clientele.  
           INT. PITTSBURGH POLICE DEPT. HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           Patti strides through the station with two INTERNAL AFFAIRS 
           AGENTS flanked on either side of her.  They stop at the 
           office of Chief Jay McBride, which is empty.  

           McBride is coming up behind them, coffee in hand.  Patti 
           turns around.  Smiles.  Waves to the McBride.

                                 PATTI
                        Morning, Chief.  

           McBride stops short, drops the coffee, takes off RUNNING.

           Patti and the agents jog after him.  

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - CITY COURTHOUSE - LATER - DAY

           Two detectives walk a CUFFED Judge Spiro out of his 
           chambers as Patti leads the way. 

                                 PATTI
                        I sure do appreciate you not 
                        making us chase you, Judge.  We’ve

           INT. PITTSBURGH COUNTY JAIL - PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

           Jean is brought into processing.  She is marched over to a 
           GUARD holding a cardboard box and a yellow jail uniform.

                                 GUARD #1
                        Clothes go in the box.  

           Jean looks herself over one last time and begins to shed 
           her suit...  

           Jacket.  

           Tie.  

           Belt.  
           Shirt.  

           Shoes.  

           Pants.  

           Rolled-up sock.  

           Underwear.   

           She stands before us completely naked, stripped of her 
           power and identity.  The guard hands her a grey jumpsuit.

                                                               FADE TO:

           WIDER: 

           Jean Marie Gill steps out onto the main floor.  Her work 
           uniform is not terrible different from her old suit.  She 
           approaches a family checking out a child’s play house.  

                                 JEAN
                        Afternoon, folks.  Can I help you?

                        you like, sweetie.  And this  
                        slide is adjustable...

           Jean detaches the slide and snaps it on the other end.  The 
           kids giggle at the funny-looking lady behind her back.  
           Jean pretends not to notice.    

                                 FATHER
                        I think we’ll take it.

           TIME CUT - FEW MOMENTS LATER

           Jean rings up the sale.  Once the family’s gone, she heads 
           over to a PREGNANT COUPLE looking through the CRIBS aisle.  
                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        See anything you like?

           The couple turns to respond -- it’s Cynthia and her new 
           HUSBAND, a button-downed accountant-type.  Cynthia’s 7 
           months pregnant.  Sober for years.  Healthy.  She freezes 
           at the sight of Jean.  Jean disarms her with a smile. 

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        That wasn’t a trick question. 

                                 CYNTHIA’S HUSBAND

                        We need wallpaper and a crib, 
                        right honey?

                                 CYNTHIA
                        ...That’s right.  Can you grab me

                        Win, win.  

           Cynthia’s husband winks at Jean and heads out.  The two 
           ladies regard each other for a moment.  

                                 JEAN
                        ...Picked out a name yet?

                        Even if no one fucks anymore, 
                        guess they still like to sweat.

           Cynthia chuckles.  Muzak plays in the background.  Elton 
           John’s “Your Song” comes on.  Cynthia just shakes her head. 

                                 CYNTHIA
                        I always hated this song.

           Jean starts to sing.  Cynthia blushes at first, then 
           becomes more emotional.
                                 JEAN
                        “It's a little bit funny, this 
                        feeling inside / I’m not one of 
                        those who can easily hide / Don't 
                        have much money but boy if I did 
                        I'd buy a big house where we both 
                        could live / Hope you don’t mind /  
                        Hope you don’t mind / Hope you 
                        don’t mind / How wonderful life is 
                        when you’re in the world...”

           Cynthia’s eyes well.  The two ladies regard each other once 
           more for a long beat.  

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        You gotta go.  

           Cynthia nods and wipes her eyes.  She leaves.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                            (to herself)
                        ...Goodbye, Cyn.

           Cynthia meets her husband at the entrance.  She steers him 
           out the door, fighting back tears.  

           Jean wanders back through the store, humming to herself.

           INT. JEAN’S TOYOTA - PITTSBURGH - NIGHT

           A somber, quiet drive home through the old neighborhood.  
           Jean suddenly hits the brakes, stopped cold by something.  

           EXT. DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Jean gets out of her car and stands in the middle of the 
           sanitized strip that was once her empire of clubs, parlors, 
           and adult theaters.  

           She’s hit with an epiphany: the sidewalks are filled with 
           openly gay, lesbian, and transgendered people.  This 
           neighborhood belongs to them now.  The spirit of Jean’s 
           empire is alive and well and thriving.  

           CUT TO BLACK
