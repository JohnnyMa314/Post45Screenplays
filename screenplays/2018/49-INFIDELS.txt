           According to the interpretation of the Quran subscribed to by 
           members of ISIS, martyrs killed by an adversary in battle are 
           honored and rewarded with eternal paradise. 

           Unless that adversary is a woman.

           In which case, they go to Hell. 

           This is a story about a lot of people going to Hell. 
           EXT. ISIS DETAINMENT CAMP - RAQQA 

           “Detainment Camp” is a generous phrase. Imagine the grimiest, 
           bullet-ridden, iron-and-rubble prison cell in the hottest, 
           bleakest, sweat-soaked nightmare of a city in the fucking 
           colon of the Middle East.    

           Goat shit too hot for flies to eat. That kind of hot.   

           There’s no stereotypical ominous Arabic music to set the 
           scene. No title telling us where we are. We get it.

           Just a few coughs and grunts, the sound of someone shifting.    

           INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

           We see FOUR SOLDIERS. American boys. Young and strong, the 
           kind you want on a recruitment poster, not chained to hooks 
           in the dirt floor like they are right now.  

           We’ll meet them one by one soon enough, but for now, we get 
           the impression that this situation is relatively new. 

           They’re not disheveled. Their wits are intact. They’re tired, 
           and hungry, and afraid -- but not broken. 

           Not yet, anyway.

           They look to each other, having long ago run out of small 
           talk, or perhaps conditioned not to speak around the guards.

           Their view, besides each other, is a vast desert landscape on 
           the other side of the bars. A solitary bush fights for life 
           in the distance. The sun bakes the sand, creating that 
           infamous mirage of dancing heat on the horizon.

           Oh, and one GUARD. Sitting on a shitty BAR STOOL next to the 
           cell. In second-hand black commando gear, Kalishnikov around 
           his back. He stares at videos on his iPhone. (How or if there 
           is any service out here is a mystery.)         

           One of the soldiers, DEX (21) finally breaks the silence, 
           woozy and slow to speak. His heavy eyelids can barely open.            

                                 DEX
                        Hey, Scrubs. In your esteemed 
                        medical opinion, why do I feel like 
                        I’m about to pass the fuck out?

           “SCRUBS” (24), is a fresh-faced pre-med with no business in 
           war. But alas, here he is. He looks to Dex.  
                                 SCRUBS
                        Dizziness?

           Dex is almost too tired to nod.

                                 SCRUBS (CONT’D)
                        Headache? 
                            (another nod)
                        How’s your heart rate? 

           The GUARD turns and YELLS. We can assume it means “Shut the 
           Fuck Up.”    

                                 SCRUBS (CONT’D)
                            (whispering)
                        Onset heatstroke. It’s gotta be a 
                        hundred-twenty out here. 

                                 DEX
                        No. Something’s wrong, man. 

           Scrubs scoots over as quietly as possible. 

                                 SCRUBS
                        Look at me. 

           Dex opens his eyes long enough for Scrubs to realize: 

                                 SCRUBS (CONT’D)
                            (shit)
                        They drugged you. 

           Then - A SOUND. A truck approaching? 

           Definitely. The GUARD abandons his stool to join outside. 

           The prisoners trade looks. The truck comes to a stop. A bit 
           of small talk in Arabic, muffled through the wall.    

           One of our boys, KHAN (25), happens to be an interpreter.      

                                 KHAN
                            (straining to hear)
                        Set it up over there.
                            (then)
                        I want the others to see it.   

           No one guesses what “it” is. But it probably isn’t good.

           We HEAR a door latch open off screen. 

           Then a VOICE we certainly don’t expect yells out - or, at 
           least, an accent we don’t expect:  
           British. That South-London grime rapper British, but British 
           nonetheless. A man speaks in English, boisterous and loud, 
           clapping his hands like an over-eager college bro. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Alright boys, it’s hotter than a 
                        fat nun’s cunt out here. Who’s 
                        ready to fucking die today? 

           He marches into frame, boots pounding. We get a look: 

           Maniacal smile. Freshly-shaven face. Racially ambiguous. The 
           swagger and looks of a footballer with the cosmic 
           determination of a cult leader.          

           And since this twisted piece of shit is why the entire story 
           is about to kick off, we might as well meet him properly: 

           OVER BLACK. 

           TITLE CARD: MEET ROB.

           BACK TO:

                                 ROB
                            (like a radio host)
                        Good morning, Caliphate. Allahu 
                        akbar - What up, fam. This is your 
                        Jihadi-in-a-black-Bugatti a.k.a. 
                        Raqqa Rob. And boy, do we got a 
                        show for you today. 

           ANOTHER GUY COMES IN HOLDING A HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO CAMERA. 

           This is performance art.  

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You. Let’s have a little fun. 

           He PICKS OUT DEX.  The GUARDS swing open the barred door and 
           rush in to grab him as we TIME CUT TO: 

           EXT. DETAINMENT CAMP - RAQQA - LATER

           CLOSE-UP OF ROPE being tied around a torso. Tight.  

           Pull back to reveal Dex being wrapped to an EIGHT-FOOT WOODEN 
           CROSS. It’s grim, and medieval, but we can only be thankful 
           he’s not being nailed to it.  

           FOUR MASKED ISIS HENCHMEN stand behind him. 

           Another HENCHMAN, off to the side, is FILMING THIS. 
           Still groggy, Dex only lifts his sinking eyes when spoken to. 

                                 ROB
                        You know the bad guy in the movie 
                        never thinks he’s the bad guy, 
                        right?  

           Rob stands face to face with Dex, making sure his lulling 
           head hears every grandiose word of his speech:    

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I love about you 
                        Americans. Your total fucking 
                        ignorance to the fact that you’re 
                        reading your own story all wrong. I 
                        mean, every hero you have, your own 
                        fucking founding fathers, were 
                        rebels. Underdogs. Terrorists and 
                        smugglers. Committing atrocities in 
                        the hopes of starting their own 
                        country, with their own rules.         

           Rob nods to a henchman. 

           CLOSE ON DEX as his face is COVERED IN POURING LIQUID. 

           Despite his grogginess, he snaps his head around in pain, 
           wincing and coughing. 

           It’s gasoline. 

           The henchman throws the now-empty GAS CAN onto the hot sand. 

           This somehow just got more fucked.

           Rob, being the Bond villain he is, takes out a CIGARETTE and 
           LIGHTS it with just the right amount of dramatic flair. 

           A long inhale. A long exhale. And he continues. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        And your culture eats that shit up. 
                        Take Star Wars. Most popular film 
                        in the world. Who are the villains 
                        in that movie? The Empire, right? 
                        The cold, greedy empire with its 
                        vast reach. Stamping out 
                        civilizations...

           He gets closer with his cigarette, hanging from his lip... 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        ... Annihilating cultures... 
                        Killing innocents. 
           Still closer. TOO close. 

           The desert heat alone feels like enough to spark a flame.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        And who takes them on? Who do you 
                        root for, but the brave and scrappy 
                        “rebels?”

           BACK AT THE CELL - We glimpse our guys’ POV of this: They 
           can’t hear it, but they watch on in disgust.  

           All of them, wanting to yell out past the AK-47 aimed at them 
           by the GUARD. 

           BACK WITH ROB AT THE CROSS - 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me, do you bat an eye when 
                        a Storm Trooper falls in battle? 
                        When you see one, do you think of 
                        his mother back home? His wife and 
                        his children? Of course not. He is 
                        expendable. A soldier on the wrong 
                        side of history.                 

           He holds the cigarette up, waves it past Dex’s reeling face, 
           then puts it behind him to tap some ash to the sand.  

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        But if you were a Storm Trooper, 
                        you would care. If you’d been 
                        drafted out of high school by some 
                        uniformed cunt with a picnic table 
                        full of brochures - you’d believe 
                        you were fighting for good, right? 
                        Protecting the empire’s freedom? 
                        And when you fell in battle, your 
                        little wife would cry, and your 
                        little Storm Trooper comrades would 
                        raise their light sabers to your 
                        bravery...       

                                 DEX
                        Rifles.    

                                 ROB
                        What’s that? 

                                 DEX
                            (with his last ounce of 
                              energy)
                        Jedis carry light sabers. Storm 
                        troopers carry rifles.          
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEX (CONT'D)
                            (adding, ‘cause why not)
                        E-11 blasters. 

           Rob can’t help but smile. Dex shoots back a defiant smirk 
           that would make Harrison Ford proud.  

                                 ROB
                        That’s right, innit? Jedis get to 
                        play by a special set of rules.

           A beat. Another long pull from the cigarette. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You boys drove the wrong fucking 
                        jeep into the wrong fucking town. 
                        And no one is coming to save you. 
                        You’re a faceless trooper dying for 
                        a cause you don’t even understand. 
                        But before you do, I want you to 
                        know that you, my friend, are the 
                        bad guy. You’re the empire.            
                            (a beat)
                        And those men behind you? They’re 
                        the rebels. 

           Dex has had enough of this. He lifts his head one last time. 

                                 DEX
                        What’s that make you, then?

                                 ROB
                        A fucking Jedi.   

           He lifts his cigarette. But instead of flicking it, gives a 
           quick command in Arabic. 

           A henchman behind the cross pulls out a KNIFE - the savage 
           kind that cuts through bone - and runs it across Dex’s neck. 

           There’s no ceremony to it. It’s ugly. 

           We’re spared the image after the first few seconds as we 
           CLOSE IN ON ROB. 

           But we hear the sound. 

           When it’s done, Rob walks over and LIFTS DEX’S HEAD by his 
           gasoline-soaked hair. 

           He carries it toward the prison cell, flicking his cigarette 
           at Dex’s body as he does. 

           THE ENTIRE CROSS GOES UP IN FLAMES. 
           POV FROM THE CELL: Rob marches toward them, sun blazing on 
           the flames in the b.g.

           He approaches the empty guard’s STOOL next to the cell and -- 

           THUMP  

           Drops Dex’s head so it faces them through the bars. 

           Dex’s eyes, finally closed. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        See ya tonight, ladies.    

           Rob marches off, acting more like he sank a three-pointer 
           than beheaded and torched a man.     

           We PUSH IN on the remaining five soldiers, enraged, and 
           scared shitless. 

           CLOSER on Scrubs... 

           CLOSER still, onto his uniform’s NAME PATCH: LOYA. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS (V.O.)
                            (PRE-LAP)
                        Captain Loya. 

           INT. GENERAL’S OFFICE - MILITARY BASE - AFTERNOON

           A matching name patch reveals PAZ LOYA (mid-20s), Scrubs’ 
           much tougher sister. Eternal flame eyes. Posture of a Navajo 
           brave. Try fucking with her.       

           Across a desk we find GENERAL BURGESS (60s), a man who 
           commands respect even without a dozen medals hanging from 
           him. But if you need that sort of thing, he’s got them. 

           He sits.  She stands. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        You know the answer I have to give 
                        you, right?

                        I - due respect, sir - I haven’t 
                        asked a question. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        Not yet. But you’re going to. And 
                        when you do, I’ll have to say “No.” 
                        I’m just hoping you understand why.

                        I think on a day like this, you’re 
                        entitled to say whatever you want.

                        It’s been six days since my brother 
                        and his team were captured. Three 
                        since... 
                            (they both know what 
                              happened)
                        ... Private Heller. And if I’m not 
                        mistaken, no one’s asking for a 
                        ransom. Or an exchange. So if 
                        they’re not hostages, and not POWs, 
                        then they’re just waiting to be 
                        killed.                  

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        I’d like to think they’re waiting 
                        to be rescued. But I concede. Not

                        There’s talk at the base about a 
                        mission.
                            (correcting, quickly)
                        An unofficial mission. To rescue 
                        them. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        Remember when I said you were about 
                        to ask a question?

                        I’ve served in combat before. 
                        Multiple engagements. I’m one of 
                        the few women who has.   

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        Yes, I’ve seen your file. I knew 
                        your name well before any of this 
                        happened. They call you “La Loba,” 
                        right? Your C.O.’s say if you were 
                        a man, you’d have a ten inch dick 
                        and battalion command.

                        So I’ll give you the respect of 
                        telling you what you need to hear. 
                        Officially, we’re looking into ways 
                        to respond and get those boys home 
                        as soon as possible.

                        Unofficially, this mission has 
                        complications. Drones are out of 
                        the game, and the target moves 
                        every twenty four hours, through 
                        the most densely populated region 
                        of an enemy caliphate whose border 
                        we haven’t yet breached with 
                        conventional weapons.

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        Unofficially? It’s complicated. 

           Paz tries a different tone. The closest she will ever get to 
           pleading. And it hurts. 

                                 PAZ
                        Yes, but I promised I’d - He’s not

                        going to make it out there.         

           The General isn’t being antagonistic. Just coolly explaining, 
           as if to a child, why the world can’t be a certain way. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        I’ve got a room full of men working

                        who took your brother. And they 
                        will get their justice. It’s just 
                        not going to be you who gives it to

                        enough. Go back to your post, Loya.    

           One thing you’ll learn about Paz is she can keep her cool. 
           But it’s pretty fucking difficult right now.

           EXT. MILITARY BASE - AFTERNOON

           Paz STORMS out of the building, past an active base of TRUCKS 
           and TROOPS buzzing about. 

           A couple DOUCHEBAG ALPHAS hoot and cat call as she passes - 

                                 ALPHA SOLDIER 
                        Where you goin’ beautiful? 

           - but she’s on fire. 

           STAY ON HER FACE, NICE AND CLOSE.      

           And the BACKGROUND CHANGES around her face as TIME PASSES. 

           QUICK SHOTS:

           INT. BARRACKS - DAY

           -- Cleaning her weapon. 

           EXT. LOOKOUT TOWER - DAY

           -- Standing her post on a lookout tower. 

           INT. MESS HALL - EVENING

           -- At the noisy Mess Hall, not eating.   

           INT. SHOWER ROOM - EVENING

           -- In the shower.      

           INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

           -- Meticulously organizing her bunk. 

           -- Lying in her bunk at night.     

           ALL WITH THE SAME STEELY FACE. SILENT. DETERMINED.  

           Like a rebellious kid in detention staring at the clock.
           And the music underscores this:  

           Something primal. Pulsing. Clocks. Heartbeat. Drums.  
           Anything that builds... builds... BUILDS... until --     

           It STOPS. 

           She sits up. Slides out of her bunk. Opens her FOOT LOCKER.  

           We see her grab a few items, making sure she doesn’t wake 
           anyone. 

           INT. COMPUTER ROOM - MILITARY BASE - NIGHT

           In a dim and empty room with a BANK OF COMPUTERS, Paz eagerly 
           taps a few keystrokes under the blue glow of a computer 
           monitor. 

           ON SCREEN: COORDINATES, MAPS, B&W AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS, etc. 

           She mouths along as she reads, like a high-schooler quizzing 
           herself with flash cards.    

           Then she shuts down the computer, and hurries out the door 
           with a --

           INT. HALLWAY - GENERAL’S OFFICE - MORNING    

           -- SLAM. MATCH SOUND TO double doors bursting open as a 
           CORPORAL charges through the hallway to the general’s office.    

           He’s at once in a rush and trying to stall what he’s doing.  

           Because he’s about to tell the General: 

           INT. GENERAL’S OFFICE - MILITARY BASE - MORNING

                                 CORPORAL 
                        Sir. We have a problem. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        Problems are the only thing we deal 
                        with out here. 

                                 CORPORAL
                        We have a DUSTWUN, sir. 
                            (before he asks)
                        Loya.

           WE FLASH TO VARIOUS QUICK SHOTS AS HE SPEAKS: 
                                 CORPORAL (CONT’D)
                        Last anyone had eyes on her was 
                        twenty-three hundred, last night. 

           -- Paz’s EMPTY, MADE BED. 

           -- Paz’s EMPTY SENTRY POST. 

                                 CORPORAL (CONT’D)
                        She left her service weapon and 
                        most of her gear.         

           -- Paz’s LOCKER, half-full of clothes, boots, etc. 

                                 CORPORAL (CONT’D)
                        Couldn’t have taken more than a few 
                        personal items. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        And there’s no way you’d come to me 
                        with this before you’d checked 
                        every inch of this base... 

                                 CORPORAL
                        She’s gone, sir. 

           The General stands and looks out the window to the base. 

                                 CORPORAL (CONT’D)
                        We’ve asked around. She didn’t say 
                        a word to anyone about where she 
                        might be going... 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                            (still looking out)
                        Oh, I know where she’s going. I 
                        just hope she realizes what she has 
                        to go through to get there. 

           Off the FORTIFIED WALL the general is staring at through his 
           window... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAWN

           For a second or two, we might be struck by the beauty of the 
           desert at dawn. The sun is nowhere to be seen yet. Just that 
           blue, disorienting twilight. At once, cold and warm.     

           The first thing we hear is a WOMAN’S VOICE.    

           Barely more than a whisper. Shaky. But growing louder.
           No subtitles for a moment. But even an untrained ear can hear 
           that it’s the same phrase, being uttered again and again, 
           with the rhythm of a frightened heartbeat.   

           The SUBTITLES finally kick in: 

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Please forgive me. Please forgive 
                        me. Please forgive me.   

           Then, FOOTSTEPS.

           Finally, we tilt down from our beautiful blue-lit horizon to 
           see SIX VILLAGERS, ALL MEN, pulling a FULLY-CLOAKED WOMAN by 
           a rope, like a sheep.

           If one of them wasn’t holding a VIDEO CAMERA, you’d think we 
           were in the stone age. And remember, this is tragically real. 

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN (CONT’D)
                            (through the thick fabric 
                              cloaking her face)
                        Please forgive me. Please forgive 
                        me. Please forgive me... 

           A GENTLE OLD MAN is the only one who will touch her. He puts 
           a helping hand on her shoulder to guide her over the patches 
           of grass and rocks. 

                                 GENTLE OLD MAN
                            (almost soothingly)
                        God will forgive you. 

           A few more steps and the shivering woman is stopped.

           She is unceremoniously DROPPED onto her knees INTO A FOUR-
           FEET-DEEP HOLE next to two discarded SHOVELS. 

           Five yards ahead, a MASSIVE PILE OF STONES. 

           Welcome to an honor killing. 

           EXT. HILLTOP - DESERT LANDSCAPE - SAME TIME 

           SUDDENLY - we SHIFT POV and see the scene through a RIFLE 
           SCOPE’S CROSSHAIRS, two hundred yards away.  

                                 EZO (O.S.)
                            (subtitled, Kurdish)
                        Shit. She’s right in the middle. We 
                        can’t miss.  
           We see the person behind the spying rifle scope. A woman, 25, 
           confident with a Zen-like calm, afraid of nothing except 
           failure.                    

           This is SEYDA. 

                                 SEYDA
                        I don’t miss.

           CUT TO BLACK: 

           TITLE: MEET SEYDA.  

           THEN: 

           Next to Seyda, also in the prone sniper position with a 
           menacing RIFLE, is her partner in crime, EZO (21). A complete 
           supernova, Ezo drinks, dances, fights and fucks like it’s her 
           last day on Earth.    

           She barely acknowledges Seyda’s cockiness, used to it.    

                                 EZO
                        That’s her father? The one holding 
                        her?        

                                 SEYDA
                        Yes. He lives. 

                                 EZO
                        He’s leading his own daughter to be 
                        slaughtered like a lamb. 

                                 SEYDA
                        A lamb gets the mercy of a knife. 

                                 EZO
                        Seyda, -- 

                                 SEYDA
                        We’re not killing him.

           Ezo knows Seyda’s not weak, but faults her for being too 
           merciful. She looks back into her scope:  

                                 EZO
                        It’s starting. 

                                                               BACK TO:

                                 MULLAH
                        We brought you here this morning to 
                        implement the punishment of stoning 
                        for adultery. A crime to which you 
                        have confessed. A crime you 
                        willingly committed. So, surely, 
                        you do not contest the verdict of 
                        Allah?  

           We can only hear the woman’s panicked BREATHING. She can’t 
           even make out the word “No.” 

           BACK ON THE HILLTOP:

                                 EZO
                        You’re hesitating. 

                                 SEYDA
                        I’m waiting. 

                                 EZO
                        You’re stalling. 

                                 SEYDA
                        I’m aiming. 

           Ezo has zero chill. Her fingertips tap and roll over the 
           trigger guard like it’s a stack of poker chips. 

                                 EZO
                        In ten seconds, I’m shooting 
                        anything with a fucking beard.    

                                 SEYDA
                        Calm down, Ezo. 

                                 EZO
                        I don’t calm down. 

           Seyda refocuses her rifle scope with the care of a surgeon. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Well, I don’t miss.

           BACK AT THE STONE PILE:

                                 MULLAH
                        Let this be a lesson to the women 
                        and wives of Islam. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MULLAH (CONT'D)
                            (looking into the CAMERA)
                        And the husbands who leave your 
                        wives alone beyond the time 
                        recommended by the shari’a. Do not 
                        make the same mistakes.  

           He looks to the Gentle Old Man, who doesn’t seem so gentle 
           now... 

                                 MULLAH (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any last words for your 
                        daughter?

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                        Baba! Please, forgive me. 

                                 GENTLE OLD MAN
                            (to Mullah)
                        No. 

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                            (through panicked tears)
                        Baba! 

                                 MULLAH
                        Very well. 

           CLOSE-UP of the STONE PILE, as one by one, the men lift a 
           stone to hurl.  

           Some as big as softballs. Some as big as cinder blocks.

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                            (to herself now, or to God)
                        Please-forgive-me, please-forgive-
                        me, please-forgive-me, please-
                        forgive-me...   

           One of the men leans like a baseball pitcher, putting all his 
           weight into his vicious throw when -- 

           POP! HIS HEAD RECOILS, BLOOD BLOOMING in the air. 

           The stone THUDS in the dirt. And before his limp body 
           follows...  

           The WASP-LIKE SCREAM of another bullet and -- 

           POP! Second man down.

           A third starts to yell out --  

           POP! POP! 
           -- Oh well, guess we’ll never get to hear it. 

           Two more fall. 

           The Woman’s head shifts within her cloak like an anxious deer 
           in the forest, desperate to make sense of the sounds.  

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Baba?! 

           The only men left standing are the Mullah and the Gentle Old 
           Man. They lock eyes with each other when --    

           POP! A spray of dusty blood, and the Mullah drops. 

           The Gentle Old Man RUNS OFF to wherever he came from. 
           (Incidentally, abandoning his daughter yet again).

           BIRDSEYE POV: We see the instant massacre in its totality. 
           Bodies strewn on the ground. Blood pooled in the sand. 

           Pulling back... back... farther away until:

           The AGONIZED SHRIEK of the Mullah pierces the morning air. 

           He’s alive. Writhing in pain, pressing a BADLY WOUNDED 
           SHOULDER. 

           BACK AT THE HILLTOP: 

                                 EZO
                        What the fuck?
                            (”after all that...”)
                        You missed.

           Seyda stands and starts dissembling her rifle mount. 

                                 SEYDA
                        I didn’t miss. I want that one 
                        alive. 

           Hey, sure. More fun for Ezo this way. She smiles.  

           The PRE-LAP SOUND of a TRUCK brings us to --   

           EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAWN

           -- The Mullah.  Moments later. Still writhing helplessly. 

           Dust spreads over him as truck tires SCREECH to a halt, 
           missing his head by mere inches. 

           Then, out of the truck, two by two... 
           BOOTS HIT THE SOIL.

           A proper hero tilt reveals a UNIT OF WOMEN, exiting the cab 
           and the flatbed of a civilian truck. Six total. You’ll 
           remember them better as you see what each of them can do, but 
           let’s just get the formalities out of the way:

           ASTI: Young enough to be in high school. Stylish, petite, 
           with an innocent face. But put a gun or a knife her hand, and 
           she’s nothing short of ferocious.      

           GERDANA: Book smarts for days. Wanted to go to college. Found 
           this to be more important. Not naturally aggressive and over-
           thinks things a bit, but gets massive points for bravery.    

           BELAR: Strong, quiet type. SCARS on her face. Terrible things 
           have happened to her, so now, terrible things happen to her 
           enemies.      

           NUSA: The one that doesn’t need a weapon to knock you the 
           fuck out. Big. Tough. Relentless. And possibly crazy.   

           SEYDA and EZO, we’ve already met. 

           The group stands in a casual line, staring unfeelingly at the 
           squirming Mullah. 

           Seyda approaches the cloaked woman and removes her hood.  

           The Woman doesn’t know what to process first. The horror of 
           bodies around her. Or the cavalry of badass female soldiers 
           who, from below, look haloed by the raw morning sunlight.   

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                        My Baba...?

           Seyda nods to Belar and Nusa, who LIFT her from her pit and 
           untie her.  

                                 SEYDA
                        He’s alive. He ran. 

           Despite her father being an inhuman piece of shit, the Woman 
           is awash with relief. She’s still processing everything when: 

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know who we are?

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                            (finally focusing)
                        You’re the Ghosts. Of the Desert. 
                        You’re supposed to be a myth. 
                                 SEYDA
                        Would you like to come with us? To 
                        our village? Where you can be 
                        protected, and fed, ... 

                                 EZO
                        And free. 

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                        But my Baba... 

                                 EZO
                        Your father was going to crush your 
                        head with a stone. 

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                        I was impure. I-- 

                                 SEYDA
                        Let your father live with his 
                        shame. Free yourself from yours.

           A long beat. The woman looks to her saviors. Then back to 
           Seyda. A nod. She’ll go with them. 

           Seyda nods back, and the group protectively leads the woman 
           to the cab of the truck. 

           Then - A GROAN from the ground. The Mullah, trying his best 
           not to scream in pain.

           Seyda picks up the toppled VIDEO CAMERA from the sand.  

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                            (into camera)
                        Daesh. Let this warning spread as 
                        quickly as your cancerous ideas. 
                        Allah does not condone murder. 
                        Allah does not condone rape. Allah 
                        does not command brutality in his 
                        name. And if Allah will not punish 
                        you for your crimes against the 
                        innocent... 

           She hands the CAMERA to ASTI, who focuses on her: 

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        We will.

           Big bad Nusa DRAGS the Mullah across the dirt. 

                                 MULLAH
                        No-no-no-no-no, wait...
           TIGHT ON THE RESCUED WOMAN, staring from the safety of the 
           truck, as we HEAR THE SOUND OF SHOVELS SLICING EARTH.   

           We see all the pain her eyes, as she watches, contemplating 
           the fate she just escaped. 

           Finally, we SWITCH TO THE MULLAH’S FACE. TIGHT. ALMOST TOO 
           TIGHT. He stares back up to see:     

           The same haloed heroes, only now they’re grinning widely.  

           REVERSE to find the Mullah, buried neck-deep. MOUTH GAGGED 
           AND DUCT TAPED. The occasional muffled moan in vain. 

           The rescued Woman is led back to her tormentor, placed in 
           front of him -- and handed a LARGE STONE.   

           She looks at it.  Looks at him.   

           He stares right back. His face, a cocktail of hate, shame, 
           and unconvincing bravery. 

           The Woman feels the weight of the stone in her hands. Then: 

           Lets it drop to the ground. 

                                 SYRIAN WOMAN
                        Peace be upon you. 

           She walks past her protectors, back to the truck.  

           The other women trade looks. Seyda nods, approvingly. 

           Mercy.

           Seyda walks to the truck and hops in, putting a comforting 
           arm around the woman. And perhaps distracting her from what’s 
           about to happen: 

           Ezo, not so kind and merciful, picks up the stone...

           Mullah’s POV: Ezo looks down, puckers a kiss and winks... 

                                 EZO
                            (pleasantly)
                        See you in Hell. 

           And SLAMS THE STONE INTO HIS HEAD. 

           Lights out. 
           EXT. UNKNOWN TOWN - SYRIA - EVENING

           OVER BLACK - We finally hear that stereotypical Middle-
           Eastern music we so often see paired with movies like this, 
           BUT, to anyone who is actually Muslim, they will recognize it 
           instantly as the Adhan, the call to prayer that plays five 
           times a day from loudspeakers atop Mosques in city squares.          

           It’s actually quite beautiful. 

           We see said SPEAKERS, and we see said MOSQUE, gorgeous ivory 
           bathed in pink light at sundown. 

           And we glide over said CITY SQUARE, bustling and alive, to 
           descend on a WOMAN, cloaked in a burqa, doing her very best 
           not to be noticed as she approaches --         

           EXT. MAHDI’S HOUSE - EVENING

           -- a modest home in a row of others just like it. 

           We get a look at her eyes, and there’s no mistaking it: 

           IT’S PAZ. 

           KNOCK-KNOCK.  She looks around as she waits...  

           After a moment, a MAN opens the door. Slight features, tired 
           eyes and a warmer smile than Paz has seen in a long time.

           His real name is MAHDI. But he’ll never go by that.

                                 MAHDI
                        You must be The Wolf. 
                            (checking around)
                        Quickly. Come in.

           He puts a protective hand on her shoulder and leads her -- 

           INT. MAHDI’S HOUSE - EVENING

           -- inside, to a surprisingly cozy home, adorned with 
           tapestries, instruments, candles and photographs.   

           Paz takes it all in, but she’s exhausted from a long journey. 

                                 MAHDI
                        Please... You won’t need this 
                        anymore.  

           He gently unwraps her face. 
                                 PAZ
                        You speak English. 

                                 MAHDI
                        I deal with many people. Speak many 
                        languages.

           They study each other. 

                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        I thought wolves run in packs.      

                                 PAZ
                        I’m more the lone kind. Looking for 
                        a new pack.

           Mahdi smiles that annoyingly safe, reassuring-father smile. 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        You’re not what I thought you’d 
                        look like.

           Mahdi walks out of frame, clinking some dishes. 

                                 MAHDI (O.S.)
                        That’s a fortunate thing, in my 
                        profession.

           Returns with a CUP OF STEAMING TEA. 

           Paz tries to be polite, but begins GULPING it from thirst, 
           steam and all. Again, Mahdi just smiles like a sage. 

                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        People are looking for you.

           This much she knows. 

                                 PAZ
                        Do you think they’ll find me?

                                 MAHDI
                        Not as long as you’re with me. They 
                        call me The Wind. I pass right by 
                        people, through every town, across 
                        every border, and no one ever sees 
                        me. I’ll get you where you’re 
                        going. 
                            (self-amused)
                        The Wolf. And the Wind. 

           He stares down at Paz’s hand, slightly shaking the TEA CUP. 
                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        I was worried you wouldn’t make it. 
                        We must leave by sundown. But 
                        first, please... join me, to eat.

           INT. MAHDI’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           He leads her into a modest kitchen with two chairs and a 
           simple meal of meat and rice and warm flat bread.    

           Paz salivates at the sight. 

                                 PAZ
                        I thought you weren’t allowed to 
                        dine with women. 

                                 MAHDI
                            (amused)
                        You don’t know enough Muslims.   

           They sit. Paz fights an animal urge to devour the food. 

                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                            (gesturing to a PHOTO)
                        My daughter and I used to eat every 
                        night together and tell stories and 
                        sing songs. It was just the two of 
                        us. Without her, it gets very 
                        quiet. So, this is - how do you 
                        say? “Like old times.” 
                            (gesturing to eat)
                        Please. 

           No formality here. Paz begins eating as politely as she can. 

           She looks at the PHOTO: A young girl, 15 at most, with 
           UNFORGETTABLE GREEN EYES. (So, don’t forget them).        

                                 PAZ
                        She’s beautiful. 

                                 MAHDI
                        Ah, yes. Eyes like...
                            (says the word in Arabic, 
                              then finds it:)
                        Emerald.   

                                 PAZ
                        Where is she now? 

           For the first time, Mahdi loses his charming air, stabbed 
           with a thousand memories... But he stays composed. 
                                 MAHDI
                        She was taken from me. Very bad 
                        men. 
                            (then)
                        I pray she is with Allah.

           Paz should leave it alone, but she’s always one to press: 

                                 PAZ
                        You mean she might be alive? 

                                 MAHDI
                        If she is alive, she’s in a place 
                        worse than Hell. 

           Mahdi looks to her, his tone and his eyes, never betraying 
           his wounded warmth. 

                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        This is why I help people like you. 
                        So that one day, praise be Allah, 
                        there will be no more people like 
                        them.

           A long beat. Paz studying his sadness. Then: 

                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        Come. The sun is setting.  

           PRE-LAP: THE SOUND OF A TRUCK ENGINE STARTING leads us to:

           EXT. MAHDI’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - EVENING

           Mahdi’s backyard. Gated on all sides. Dirt. Tires. Two stray 
           dogs and a DUSTY WHITE COMMERCIAL TRUCK, idling next to a 
           HUGE PILE OF ROLLED PERSIAN RUGS. 

           It’s a bit later. Paz is wearing a pared-down version of the 
           cammo gear she was wearing on base.     

           She loads and checks her SIDEARM, currently her only weapon. 

           Mahdi brings PAZ a SMALL BAG and gestures into the RUG PILE:  

                                 MAHDI
                        I hide fine cigars and scarves 
                        inside the rugs, so if someone 
                        happens to look - they think I 
                        smuggle goods and I pay small 
                        bribe. 

           He then gestures to the TRUCK BED: 
                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        Next. Two sets of floor planks. If 
                        by chance someone pulls the first 
                        to check beneath boards -- which 
                        has never happened, mind you -- you 
                        will be hidden safely under the 
                        second. 

           Indeed. In the REAR RIGHT OF THE TRUCK’S TRAILER, TWO SETS OF 
           PLANKS STAND UPRIGHT, creating a snug little claustrophobe’s-
           fucking-nightmare-of-a-bunk above the axle.  

           He hands Paz the BAG he is holding. She looks in... 

                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        Tight space inside floor. A bottle 
                        of water to lie next to you, with 
                        straw. One pill to help sleep. One 
                        adult diaper.                        
                            (off her look)
                        Long ride. 
                            (back to:)
                        Air gets in from underneath, to 
                        breathe. The only thing to worry 
                        about - is boredom. 

           Paz produces an ANCIENT MODEL iPOD with EARBUDS from the bag.

           Curious, she hits a few buttons. 

                                 PAZ
                        All that’s on here is Elton John. 

                                 MAHDI
                        What? You don’t like Elton John?

           INT. CRAWL SPACE / INT. TRUCK TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER

           POV inside the tiny “bunk” or “crawl space” within the lower 
           floorboards as PAZ’s lean body fights to squeeze in.

           Then we’re in the TRUCK’S TRAILER again, packed fully with 
           UPRIGHT ROLLED PERSIAN RUGS, except the exposed area where 
           Paz’s floorboards are upended.  

           Mahdi looks down to her before sealing her inside.

           Smiles, amused that Paz has her arms crossed the way a 
           vampire sleeps, clutching her HANDGUN like it’s a teddy bear. 
                                 MAHDI
                        It’s none of my business, but -- 
                        what are you planning to do when 
                        you get there?

                                 PAZ
                        First I’m going to find my brother. 
                        Then I’m going to find the man that 
                        took him - And I’m gonna cut off 
                        his head.    

           Mahdi stares a moment. Then, as softly as he says anything: 

                                 MAHDI
                            (in Arabic)
                        May God guide your journey.    

           PAZ’S POV: A BOARD SLIDES OVER HER AND SHE IS ENTOMBED.  

           OVER BLACK, we HEAR a hammer POUNDING in the nails.

           MATCH THE SOUND TO -- 

           INT. HOLDING CELL / HALLWAY - NIGHT

           -- THE POUNDING of the butt of a knife against METAL BARS.

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        Wake up you fuckin’ pussies, guess 
                        who’s back!

           SCRUBS is the first to open his eyes.    

           We’re in a different location than last time. 

           The guys look like shit now.  Dirty. Greasy. Tired. 

           And since you were promised a proper introduction to the last 
           two soldiers, now seems like a good time:  

           KHAN: The brightest of the grunts. Interpreter. Speaks three 
           languages and can still shoot a gun pretty well. 

           And ARNOLD (last name, not first): The guy with the cleanest 
           bunk in boot camp. Military teacher’s pet, born to be a 
           soldier. But currently SICK, on the floor, SHIVERING.         

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Now, now, now, now. Here I thought 
                        we were treating you like royalty, 
                        yeah? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        I even moved you all from the 
                        Garden View to the Presidential 
                        Suite, no extra cost. What the fuck 
                        happened to him?     

           Scrubs looks to the corner where Arnold shuffles in pain. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                            (with a loud SNAP)
                        Oi. Doogie fucking Houser. I’m 
                        talking to you. 

                                 SCRUBS
                        He’s sick.
                            (afraid that sounded 
                              condescending)
                        Very sick. He needs medical 
                        attention immediately. 

                                 ROB
                        Or what? 

                                 SCRUBS
                        What? 

                                 ROB
                        I said: “Or what?”

           Scrubs doesn’t want to scare Arnold any more than he already 
           is, but -- 

                                 SCRUBS
                        Or he’ll die. 

                                 ROB
                        Right. 

           But he says it like “That’s kind of the whole point.” 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Tell you what. How bout we play a 
                        little game? Someone’s about to 
                        step up to the chopping block. The 
                        weak little twat shittin’ himself 
                        in the corner... Or you. The fun 
                        part is: It’s your choice. But it’s 
                        only your choice. Say his name 
                        right now, and you live to see 
                        another day. 

           The others look to Scrubs, whose eyes are locked on Rob. 
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        It seems so easy. I mean, you said 
                        it yourself ten seconds ago, your 
                        boy’s gonna die anyway. Put him out 
                        of his misery. Save yourself. 
                            (with that shit-eating grin 
                              again)
                        Say his name.

           Scrubs looks to the GUARD who holds that ominous VIDEO 
           CAMERA. But it’s not on.  Not aimed at them.  

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Oh, don’t worry. No one’ll see this 
                        part. It’s just us here. 
                            (then)
                        Oh! I forgot to add: If you don’t 
                        decide, I’ll kill two of you 
                        instead of one. It’s kind of like 
                        Sophie’s Choice, except -- well, to 
                        tell you the truth I never saw that 
                        fucking movie. 

                                 SCRUBS
                        You’re just going to kill us all 
                        anyway.

                                 ROB
                        All the more reason to pick the 
                        sick one.
                            (then)
                        Oh, come on. May I remind you cunts 
                        that I didn’t kidnap you from your 
                        safe little beds in the night? You 
                        walked into a lion’s den. And now 
                        you’re mad when the lion bats you 
                        around a bit before biting your 
                        neck? Where’s the sport in that?
                            (to Scrubs)
                        You’ve got ten seconds to say a 
                        name. 

           He doesn’t count aloud. 

           We should feel what ten seconds feels like - as long or as 
           short as you think that is when you’re facing imminent death.

           Just when we think ten seconds MUST HAVE passed... 

                                 SCRUBS
                        Me.
                            (barely able to speak 
                              clearly)
                        Take me. Not him. 
           Rob grins ear to ear, starting a sadistic SLOW CLAP. 

                                 ROB
                        What. A. Stupid. Fucking. Choice.

           He gives a command to his GUARD, who FIRES UP THE VIDEO 
           CAMERA and starts recording: 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You know, Doc, I was hoping you’d 
                        be a hero tonight, because I think 
                        you and I can teach these boys 
                        quite the anatomy lesson. Some real 
                        hands-on learning. Shall we?         

           TIME CUT: We see through the CAMERA’S POV for a moment, but 
           it will cut back and forth throughout. Mostly reality, but in 
           a strange way, sometimes video makes things feel more real. 

           When we glimpse the soldiers on their knees, forced to  
           watch, we notice their MOUTHS ARE DUCT TAPED AND GAGGED.  

           SCRUBS IS TAPED AND GAGGED AS WELL. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Today’s lesson, children, is about 
                        the reality of gettin’ your throat 
                        cut. See, in movies and TV, it’s so 
                        clean, innit? One nice slash across 
                        the ole windpipe, and it opens up 
                        like a pretty little gash, flowing 
                        blood like a tall pour of a wine.

           He takes his time relishing in his speech, producing a SCARY 
           FUCKING KNIFE to press against Scrubs’ neck every so often.   

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        But. Like most things in life, the 
                        reality isn’t as clean and tidy as 
                        the fantasy. See, the windpipe, 
                        formally known as the trachea, is 
                        only about 2.6cm in diameter. But 
                        it’s strong. Thick rings of 
                        cartilage, tough membranes holding 
                        them together. So while it looks 
                        easy to slice, it’s really more 
                        like sawing through an industrial 
                        garden hose.
                            (with pleasure)
                        Tell me if I’m getting any of this 
                        wrong, Doc. 
           Scrubs is silent. Not merely because Rob is correct, but 
           also, you know, because this is the most horrifying fucking 
           experience of his life. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Now, sure, you could cut the 
                        carotid arteries running up the 
                        side of the neck. Those are the 
                        ones you can feel with your own 
                        fingers, through the skin, pulsing 
                        nice and juicy whenever you’re 
                        angry...   
                            (gently gliding the knife)
                        Or frightened.    
                            (then)
                        That’ll kill you quite quickly. 
                        Full rupture, both sides? 
                        Unconscious in seconds. Dead in a 
                        minute, more or less. But you know 
                        why I love the windpipe? Because 
                        it’s the maximum amount of pain. 
                        Shock can do its job best it can, 
                        but, make no mistake, you’re 
                        feeling this when it happens.            

           Scrubs’ chest begins heaving. Trying to hide his panic, but 
           animal instincts have surpassed will power. 

           Rob leans close to inspect the PUMPING VEINS in his neck:   

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                            (to the others, with 
                              earnest excitement)
                        See? 

           Back to his speech: 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause, when your trachea’s opened, 
                        blood flows into your lungs while 
                        you’re still gasping to breathe. In 
                        essence, it suffocates you from the 
                        neck up, and drowns you from the 
                        neck down. Don’t get much worse 
                        than that, bruv. 
                            (then)
                        But the real art is in the cut 
                        itself. The motion. Steady, clean, 
                        sawing, back and forth, like 
                        carving up a nice bird. 

           Suddenly, he drops the cool guy act and FIRMLY tilts Scrubs’ 
           head back like a Pez Dispenser, exposing his neck completely.  
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Here, lemme show you. Ready...   

           A tear glides down Scrubs’ cheek as he blinks. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Steady... 

           We hear the desperate breaths through his nose...

           ... Until Rob softly releases his head.

           Laughing. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Aye, I’m just fuckin’ with you 
                        boys. No, see, I want that image to 
                        spin in your heads for a while. No 
                        fun if you always know when it’s 
                        coming. I’ve been called a lot of 
                        things in my time, but 
                        “predictable?” Now, that would 
                        break my fuckin’ heart.   

           He admires his knife one last time, then sheathes it.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                            (to Scrubs)
                        Clean the piss off yourself, mate. 

           A brotherly SLAP to the back of Scrubs’ head, a bit too hard, 
           and Rob is off. 

           Scrubs recovers, staring into the middle distance, on his 
           knees. Breathing, unable to calm. Traumatized for life. 

           PRE-LAP: The warm, plush piano intro of Elton John’s “GOODBYE 
           YELLOW BRICK ROAD” plays over, taking us to -- 

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           -- the middle of nowhere. Night. Endless desert bisected by a 
           thin highway, like a snake crawling through sand. 

           A single TRUCK on the road. Drifting by as calmly as the wind 
           itself.     

           The lyrics to the song kick in, then the beat. You can take 
           it as ironic or earnest, but either way, it gives us a 
           momentary break from the traumatic near-death experiences.     

           ... momentary.
           INT. CRAWL SPACE - MAHDI’S TRUCK - NIGHT    

           The song is now sourced from Mahdi’s iPod, the earbuds 
           resting in restless ears.     

           We see Paz, but barely. Not much light in here. She’s staring 
           at nothing, trying her best to relax in the confined space, 
           something between a tanning bed and a closed casket.    

           The truck hums and bumps with a rhythm that would put a baby 
           to sleep, until suddenly...    

           The rhythm is broken. The truck is slowing to a stop. 

           EXT. DESERT ROAD / MAHDI’S TRUCK - NIGHT

           Outside, A WALL OF HEADLIGHTS. Trucks idling. A PATROL STOP 
           in the middle of nowhere. GUARDS. GUNS. The whole thing.  

           A HIGHWAY GUARD (40s), the leader of the group, approaches 
           Mahdi’s window. {ALL OF THIS IS IN ARABIC.}

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        Peace be upon you. 

                                 MAHDI
                        And also unto you. 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        May I see your papers, please. 

                                 MAHDI
                        Of course. Is there some kind of 
                        danger down the road? 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        On this road, sir, we are the 
                        danger. 

           His intimidating face finally curls a slight smile. He’s just 
           being friendly. He hands back Mahdi’s papers. 

           Mahdi follows suit, relaxed and cool.

                                 MAHDI
                        Of course. I only ask because this 
                        road is so quiet. Usually the 
                        checkpoint isn’t for miles. 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        You know, that’s what I thought 
                        when we were sent here. This road 
                        is so tediously quiet. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT'D)
                        Certainly this is a waste of 
                        manpower, but... I’m not here to 
                        think. I’m here to follow orders. 

                                 MAHDI
                        If anyone understands quietly 
                        following orders, it’s a delivery 
                        man.        

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        Well, I suppose that leads me 
                        directly to my next question. What 
                        exactly are you delivering?         

           This guy doesn’t talk like a goon stuck on border guard. And 
           it’s making Mahdi (almost) visibly nervous.   

           INSIDE THE CRAWL SPACE:  

           We see Paz, straining to hear the foreign words, praying like 
           a driver on the highway with a police car behind them: 
           “please, not tonight.” 

           BACK AT THE TRUCK WINDOW: 

                                 MAHDI
                        Rugs. Persian. Custom and hand-
                        sewn, though, not the cheap 
                        knockoffs you see at the bazaar.
                            (adding, as if the guy 
                              cares)
                        Some of them have been delivered to 
                        the Presidential Palace. Would you 
                        like to see them? 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        Well, I’m required to see them. But 
                        after your description, yes, I 
                        think I’d actually like to, as 
                        well.

           TIME CUT: The truck’s trailer gate SLIDES open, loudly, 
           revealing wall-to-wall RUGS, rolled and stacked vertically.  

           TWO PATROLMEN (basically skinny armed soldiers in black) jump 
           in and start parting the rugs, lightly investigating.  

           A THIRD PATROLMAN stands to the side of the road. 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                            (continuing his thought)
                        I wonder what kind of rug draws 
                        Assad’s eye.
                                 MAHDI
                            (keeping totally cool)
                        The kind that takes a long time to 
                        make. It’s what separates an artist 
                        from a craftsman. Art’s value can 
                        be inflated. But craft is 
                        undeniable. It takes time. And a 
                        man’s time is the most valuable 
                        thing of all.         

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        I couldn’t agree more. And in the 
                        spirit of not wasting either of 
                        ours, I don’t think it will be 
                        necessary to search through your 
                        truck, or unravel your finely 
                        crafted rugs. Unless, of course, 
                        there is something hidden in them 
                        that would be of interest to me? 

                                 MAHDI
                        No, sir. Other than an interest in 
                        fine tapestry, I’m afraid you’d 
                        find this truck rather boring. 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        Very good. Because I wasn’t ordered 
                        to rifle through people’s 
                        possessions. Or to slow down what 
                        must already be a long journey. I 
                        was ordered to find something. 
                        Something very specific.   
                            (then)
                        A person, to be exact.

           Don’t worry. Mahdi’s a pro. He doesn’t suddenly turn white 
           from fear or anything...  

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                            (to his men)
                        Take the rugs out of the truck. But 
                        lay something beneath them first.
                            (looking to Mahdi)
                        This is fine craftsmanship, after 
                        all.

           The men throw a tarp from their truck across the ground and 
           begin unloading the rugs, laying them on their side. 

           One pulls a razor to slice the cord that binds a rug, when --

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        No, no. Don’t search the rugs. 
                        Unload the rugs.

                            (a beat) 
                        Then get some tools from the truck. 
                        We’re going to have to lift the 
                        floorboards. 

                                 MAHDI
                        Sir, is this necessary?

           The Highway Guard is turning his attention when -- 

                                 MAHDI (CONT’D)
                        You said you were looking for a 
                        person? I know many people, maybe I 
                        can help you. What does this person 
                        look like?       

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        Valuable.

           A spark. Mahdi tries: 

                                 MAHDI
                        We were just talking about that, 
                        no? How value is a funny thing. 
                        Feels like it can go up and up and 
                        up...  
                            (if he’s not being clear 
                              enough)
                        As long as someone’s willing to 
                        pay. 

           The Highway Guard stares at Mahdi... a long time.  

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                            (leaning in, voice lowered)
                        The jackals behind me would happily 
                        eat the scraps you throw to them. 
                        But me? I hunt for bigger game. 

           Okay, Mahdi’s a bit nervous, but again -- ain’t his first 
           rodeo with a border guard...  

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        See, there are rumors of a great 
                        smuggler, who takes important 
                        people to important places. 
                        Operating right under our noses. 
                        But the problem with operating 
                        under people’s noses is that, 
                        eventually, they catch the awful 
                        scent of a filthy, sniveling rat. 
                        And as clever as you are, you can 
                        never get rid of that stench.  
                                 PATROLMAN #1 
                        It’s empty. 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        The boards beneath the boards. 
                        Remove them as well.

           Okay, fuck it. He’s scared now... 

                                 MAHDI
                        Sir, please, -- 

                                 PATROLMAN #2 (O.S.)
                        BE QUIET. 

           Mahdi turns to see a KALASHNIKOV aimed at him.  Fuck.

           INSIDE THE TRUCK TRAILER, the men begin REMOVING THE NAILS 
           with a board-bending CREAK, then RIPPING THEM UP.  

           CREAK... SNAP... CREAK... SNAP...

           (They’re starting from the left side.) 

           (Paz is on the right.)

           INSIDE THE CRAWL SPACE: Paz squirms to ready her gun, 
           “aiming” up at her hardwood coffin ceiling...     

           CREAK... SNAP... CREAK... SNAP.  Getting closer and closer.  

           OUTSIDE: Mahdi watches the truck like a poker player waiting 
           for a river card that can’t possibly save him. 

           This is happening, and it’s not going to end well. 

           IN THE TRUCK TRAILER: The men pull the planks with the 
           efficiency of a Daytona pit crew.  

           CREAK... SNAP... CREAK... 

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                            (in Arabic)
                        WAIT!!!

           SNAP! 

           A ripped plank reveals A MAN WE’VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE, HIDDEN 
           IN THE CENTER OF THE TRUCK’S FLOOR.    

           Not two feet from where Paz is hidden.  

           Has he been there this whole fucking time?
                                 MAN IN THE CRAWL SPACE
                        Don’t shoot. Please. I surrender. 

           IN PAZ’S CRAWL SPACE: Paz is as shocked as we are. 

           IN THE TRAILER: The patrolmen snap two more boards and pull 
           The Man from his space with very little love.

           They put him on his knees and tie his hands behind his back. 

           *The spot where Paz is hiding is left untouched - glaringly 
           obvious to us, but hey, they seem to have what they came for. 

           OUTSIDE: The Highway Guard looks to Mahdi, satisfied. 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        Well, there you have it. 

           He gestures to the Patrolmen holding the AK. 

           Mahdi turns to beg for his life when --

           A SPATTER OF BULLETS, and Mahdi drops like a blanket yanked 
           from a clothesline. 

           It’s merciless and quick.  He’s gone. 

           IN THE CRAWL SPACE: Paz is trying not to breathe. Totally 
           confused by what she’s hearing. 

           BACK OUTSIDE: The Highway Guard walks past the pile of rugs 
           to see them SPRAYED WITH BLOOD... 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Hm. We ruined his fine crafts. 

           ... then approaches the MAN IN THE TRUCK, who is now on his 
           knees.    

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Abergel. Nice to finally meet. 

           IN THE CRAWL SPACE: A Patrolman’s boot shifts directly above 
           where Paz’s face is, CREAKING the wood.  

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Come, you can ride with me. The 
                        accommodations are more 
                        comfortable, I assure you. 

           *All of this is an Arabic, mind you. Paz can’t understand a 
           word being said, and can’t see a thing. 
                                 HIGHWAY GUARD (CONT’D)
                            (to his men)
                        Keep whatever’s hidden in the rugs 
                        for yourselves. Take this truck 
                        back with us. Then burn it. 

                                 PATROLMAN #2
                        What about him? 

           The Highway Guard barely glances at the fallen Mahdi. 

                                 HIGHWAY GUARD
                        Leave him. 

           And with that, he walks back to the ominous wall of 
           headlights. 

           The men do what they’re told, and their new prisoner is 
           dragged off the truck to await his fate. 

           IN THE CRAWL SPACE: The sound of Paz trying to coax her 
           breath into silence. 

           “What the fuck just happened?” ... “How am I still alive?”... 

           And more thoughts. About everything. Racing through her head 
           until THE ENGINE REVS BACK UP. The voices grow distant. 

           And the truck begins driving again, down the endless, snaking 
           road in the desert.

           DISSOLVE TO BLACK. 

           A LONG BEAT. 

           THEN: Voices...

           INT. CRAWL SPACE / INT. TRUCK - MORNING

           Arabic. Waking Paz from a shallow sleep. 

           A ribbon of light peeks through from the underbelly of her 
           crawl space. It’s morning.   

           And it’s HOT. She’s sweating through her clothes. Can hardly 
           breathe. Hair stuck to her forehead like a shower tile.

           EXT. TRUCK / ABANDONED BUILDING - SAME TIME 

           We see Mahdi’s truck, parked outside some kind of shot-to-
           shit industrial building. It kind of looks like an elementary 
           school, or medical clinic. 
           But has long lost its initial purpose.

           ISIS SOLDIERS, the real deal, black-clad, masks, leather gun 
           holsters, straight out of an internet video, patrol the 
           grounds. Some stand around smoking. Some play cards.

           Only a handful of them. It’s not a military base or anything. 
           But something important enough goes on inside. 

           We’ll get to that in a minute. Right now we’re with Mahdi’s 
           truck. Parked far away from the others, maybe fifty yards. 

           A SOLDIER approaches with TWO GAS CANS and begins pouring a 
           TRAIL OF GAS, beneath the truck, walking away...  

           When he gets far enough, he lights it. 

           The flames ride across the surface of the sand, racing to the 
           truck when -- 

           INT. CRAWL SPACE / INT. TRUCK

           -- BOOM! If Paz had enough space, the sound alone would make 
           her spring up like a mousetrap. But since she’s locked in a 
           claustrophobic tomb, she just gropes at her surroundings 
           wondering what the FUCK that was.     

           (CUT BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE AND THE CRAWL SPACE) 

           The FLAMES from the exploded gas tank embroil the truck’s 
           underbelly, licking the side walls, rising. 

           Paz pushes desperately, not knowing what’s happening yet... 

           Until the SMOKE begins to enter her air vent.  

           And it starts to HEAT. Not baby-in-a-hot-car heat, like it 
           felt already... baby-in-a-burning-fucking-building heat.

           Her face registers: 

           She’s about to burn alive. 

           OUTSIDE: A few of the guards go into the building. Maybe that 
           was their only job. Maybe they have better things to do.

           THREE STAY. Playing cards. Not giving a shit about the truck. 

           IN THE CRAWL SPACE: Paz FURIOUSLY pushes. Knees. Kicks. Like 
           Houdini in a straight jacket, if he was, you know, on fire.  

           And this isn’t “KILL BILL.” She’s not going to Kung Fu her 
           way out of here. 
           Time to see if all those push-ups made her stronger than 
           nails in wood.   

           ALL HER MIGHT, she pushes. 

           ABOVE: We see the BOARDS rise slightly, nails creaking, only 
           to slam back down.

           Oh, and MORE SMOKE.  

           Outside: MORE FLAMES. 

           Every time she pushes now, it’s like pressing her back onto a 
           hot skillet. But she does. Gritting teeth, sweating...   

           EXT. TRUCK / ABANDONED BUILDING - SAME TIME

           ... AND SCREAMING. 

           THIS gets the attention of the three remaining ISIS boys. 
           They trade looks. 

           Yep. Distant SCREAMING, MUFFLED. They’re not imagining it.  

           The Masked Soldier who lit the fire walks back toward the 
           truck, more apprehensively than he should for someone hearing 
           a woman yelling helplessly.    

           The OPEN TRUCK TRAILER is now a SMOKE FILLED BOX with a few 
           remaining rugs that no one wanted to plunder.

           He hears POUNDING... COUGHING... WOOD BREAKING? ...

                                 ISIS SOLDIER #1
                            (in Arabic)
                        Who’s in there? 

           Then SILENCE. 

           He takes the final steps toward the truck, shielding his face 
           from the heat when -- 

           BANG-BANG-BANG!   

           He drops as PAZ comes running from inside the trailer, also 
           shielding her face from the SMOKE and FLAMES.    

           The TWO CARD PLAYERS, proverbial dicks in their hands, can’t 
           even grab their weapons before Paz races toward them, 
           COUGHING, STUMBLING, and SHOOTING.  

           She EMPTIES HER CLIP.  They die. 
           It’s inelegant, but hey, give her a break.   

                                 PAZ
                            (collapsing)
                        Fuck. Shit. FUCK. 

           She kneels next to her too-slow victims and grabs an AK-47. 

           Coughing, hyperventilating, looking around panicked. 
           Realizing she wasn’t exactly a ninja with those gunshots.        

           Right on cue, VOICES YELLING from inside the structure. 

           They’re going to come get her.   

           But who is “they?” And where-the-overheated-Hell is she?

           INT. STRUCTURE - HALLWAY - SAME TIME  

           Inside the rundown building, we follow TWO MORE ISIS SOLDIERS 
           following the sound, walking down the hallway in no huge 
           hurry. More annoyed than worried. 

                                 ISIS SOLDIER #2
                        What the fuck is going--

           AUTOMATIC RIFLE SPRAY puts them both down. Quick and LOUD. 

           INT. STRUCTURE - VARIOUS HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS

           The scene is one continuous shot, unflinching, as Paz 
           saunters her way through the hallways of the grimy building, 
           SHOOTING DOWN ISIS SOLDIERS like a video game from Hell.

           It’s not stylized. It feels real. Sickeningly real. 

           Less John Wick, more wide-eyed Clarice Starling in Buffalo 
           Bill’s basement. Paz is terrified. In battle mode. Still 
           completely unaware of her surroundings. 

           She takes down EIGHT MEN total. Turning corners. Exchanging 
           bursts of fire. 

           Then, checking each DOORWAY for danger as she passes, she 
           enters a particular doorway to see -- 

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - STRUCTURE - SAME TIME

           -- A MAN TIED TO A CHAIR. 

           Alone in a tiled room. Beaten and bleeding from the head.  
           Staring back at her, with a defeated, neutral gaze. 

           *(We recognize him as the MAN FROM THE TRUCK. Paz has never 
           seen him before, though). 

           No time to make sense of this fucked up mess. She checks the 
           room, clears it, and exits back into the --

           INT. STRUCTURE - VARIOUS HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS

           -- hallway she came from. It’s unnervingly quiet, except we 
           swear we can HEAR Paz’s heartbeat. 

           She’s about to choose which way to explore next, when a sound 
           makes her decision for her: 

           GUNSHOTS. WAVES OF THEM. 

           MEN YELLING, then SILENCED. 

           SHELLS landing on tile floors, with an echo. 

           Then a single THUMPING SOUND.  Repetitive.  Metronomic. 

           Paz steels herself and walks toward it. 

           Thump... Thump... Thump... 

           TURNING THE CORNER, she sees: 

           A complete fucking mess. SIX DEAD ISIS SOLDIERS. Shredded. 
           Blood pooling. Guns by their sides. 

           One has a DAGGER buried in his head, the handle sticking out 
           from beneath his chin. (Yeah, that way.)

           And while he’s very much dead, some leftover reflex is making 
           his leg KICK the hallway wall:

           Thump... Thump... Thump... 

           Paz stares at it, wondering what we should be wondering, too: 
           If they were coming to shoot Paz, who shot them? 

           But alas, no time for thinking... 

           REVEAL: A GUN BARREL pressed to the back of Paz’s head. 

                                 EZO (O.S.)
                        [Kurdish command] 

                                 PAZ
                        I don’t underst-- 
                                 EZO
                            (in English now)
                        Drop your weapon. 

           Paz complies. 

                                 EZO (CONT’D)
                        Turn around. 

           Paz complies again.

           And is rightly angry at herself for not hearing SIX SOLDIERS 
           sneak up behind her. Our “Ghosts.” Our pack of badasses.   

           But strangers to Paz. 

           Paz watches as the MAN FROM THE TRUCK is freed and let out of 
           the interrogation room, joining them. A familiar ally. 

           None of this makes sense. 

           Seyda approaches Paz. Two great rebels, face to face.  

                                 SEYDA
                        My name is Seyda Nahai. Who the 
                        fuck are you?

           Off Paz, CUT TO:

           INT. COVERED TRUCK BED - DAY

           We’re rumbling along in the back of a covered truck. 

           The GHOSTS sit, scattered around, casual. And the MAN FROM 
           THE TRUCK, known better as ABERGEL(40), sits directly across 
           from Paz, staring inquisitively. 

           The back of Paz’s shirt is pulled over her shoulders, as her 
           BURNS are being salved and bandaged by Gerdana (the shy, 
           booksmart Ghost).

           A beat, as Paz and Abergel stare at each other in silence. 

           Paz couldn’t look more tired. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        You’re the one from the news. 

                                 PAZ
                        You’re the one from the truck.    
                                 ABERGEL
                        And the chair. Being kindly beaten

                        English, I wouldn’t have butchered  
                        my Arabic manual for two years.

                        I speak English. Seyda and Ezo

                        mostly Kurdish.

                        his head.

                        just gonna body these twats no 
                        matter what. Why negotiate with a 
                        madman?” And I suppose that’s fair. 
                        But if anyone’s capable of building 
                        a bridge of trust between two 
                        nations, it’s a diplomat like me, 
                        don’t you think? 

           With a smug laugh:  

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got twelve hours.

           A truck REVS up off screen. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                            (with a whistle)
                        Alright... 

           As he walks out of the shot, leaving us with our soldiers: 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Movin’ on, boys!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRUCK / EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           PAZ wakes in the back of the truck she fell asleep in.  It’s 
           some time later, but she doesn’t know how long. 

           The Ghosts are gone. She gathers herself.  

           ABERGEL sits in a folding chair with a cigarette, watching 
           her.  

                                 ABERGEL
                        Don’t worry. I’m just here to make 
                        sure you’re okay. They thought it 
                        might be traumatic for you to wake 
                        up in a truck in a strange place 
                        again. 

           Paz looks around. They seem to be parked on some kind of 
           DESERTED FARM, stretching for miles. A SMALL RANCH HOUSE sits 
           on the property. 
                                 PAZ
                        Where are we? 

                                 ABERGEL
                        A safe-house. If you can call 
                        anything “safe” out here. 

                                 PAZ
                        Well, that’s reassuring. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Call me Abergel. 
                            (off Paz’s look)
                        Before. I never introduced myself.
                            (extending a hand)
                        I’m Abergel.

                                 PAZ
                        Abergel. Is that a first name, or a 
                        last name? 

                                 ABERGEL
                        It’s a fake name. 

                                 PAZ
                        You and I really need to work on 
                        our trust issues.

                                 ABERGEL
                        I work in Intelligence. The less 
                        you know about me, the better. I’m 
                        the only thing people out here hate 
                        more than an American soldier. 

                                 PAZ
                        A spy? 

                                 ABERGEL
                        A Jew. 

           A smile between them. 

                                 PAZ
                        Mossad?

           Abergel gives her a smug grin, like that’s what a child would 
           guess. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Let’s just say I’m on your side.  
                            (then, re: the house)
                        Come on in. They’re waiting to see 
                        you. 
           Paz collects herself and follows Abergel into -- 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           -- the ranch house, which is actually pretty cozy for a 
           military “safe house.”  A family of farmers must have lived 
           here before. Wealthy, too. It’s the first truly nice space 
           Paz has seen in a long time. A fireplace, rugs, functioning 
           kitchen, furniture.  

           The Ghosts are sitting around the couches in the living room 
           talking when they see Paz enter and look up.   

           Seyda stands. Gets right down to business: 

                                 SEYDA
                        What would justice be for you? 
                        Rescuing your brother alive or 
                        killing the men who took him?  

                                 PAZ
                        Can’t it be both? 

                                 SEYDA
                        Killing them is vengeance. Only God 
                        brings justice.   

                                 PAZ
                        Well, no offense, but I don’t 
                        believe in God. So to me, any 
                        justice in this life is gonna get 
                        done right here. 

                                 SEYDA
                        We’re in the business of freeing 
                        the innocent. If wicked men are in 
                        our way, so be it. But punishment 
                        for its own sake, that can send you 
                        fighting the wrong battles.   
                            (then)
                        Didn’t anyone ever tell you to 
                        choose your battles? 

                                 PAZ
                        Yeah. I chose all of them.

           Ezo grins.

                                 EZO
                            (in Kurdish)
                        I’m starting to like her. 
                                 SEYDA
                            (back to Paz)
                        Abergel looked into it. Your 
                        coordinates check out. As well as 
                        your intel. So. As a show of 
                        gratitude...     

           She glances to her still-skeptical peers. 

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        We’ve decided to help you.

           Before Paz can fully light up - 

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        But we have to do it our way. 
                        Surgical. Calculated. Coordinated. 
                        We don’t run and gun here. 

                                 PAZ
                        Of course. 

                                 SEYDA
                        But that takes time. This isn’t an 
                        easy one. We need time to make a 
                        proper plan. 

                                 PAZ
                        Right, only - 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Only time is of the essence.

                                 PAZ
                            (hating that she’s on the 
                              verge of begging again)
                        Yes. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Abergel put a call in to a friend 
                        or two. The moment we hear from 
                        them - we form a plan that will 
                        keep us all alive. From there, we 
                        don’t waste a single second. I 
                        Promise.

           Paz thinks, but Abergel can’t help but point out: 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Considering your only other option 
                        is a service pistol and a really 
                        long walk in the desert... 
           Of course. Paz straightens up, and extends a hand for Seyda 
           to shake. 

                                 PAZ
                        Thank you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Paz taking a much-needed shower. That exhausted, face-right-
           in-the-water-stream kind, leaning with one arm against the 
           tiles. Burns on her back. Scrapes and bruises all over her. 

           QUICK SHOTS: Towels herself off. Faces herself in the mirror. 

           Gets dressed in new clothes the Ghosts have given her. It’s 
           by no means a uniform, but it does make her look like one of 
           them.    

           She makes her way out into the -- 

           INT. BEDROOM - SAFE HOUSE - DAY 

           -- bedroom, where a bunch of COTS are set up among an ARSENAL 
           WEAPONS. Every RIFLE you can imagine. Boxes of AMMO. 
           EXPLOSIVES. KNIVES. Some lying right on the pillows.  

                                 PAZ
                            (to herself)
                        Cozy. 

           When a polite KNOCK at the door brings her attention to 
           Gerdana (the Book Smart one). 

                                 GERDANA
                        We’re going to start cooking, if 
                        you’d like to join. 

                                 PAZ
                        Thanks, but I’m not much of a cook.     

           Gerdana doesn’t smile at her joke. 

                                 GERDANA
                        It’s tradition here. Everyone cooks 
                        together. Everyone eats together.
                            (then)
                        Please. Join us.

           INT. KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           MONTAGE of the Ghosts and Paz preparing a large meal. 
           Chopping vegetables, rolling dough, setting the table. 

           MUSIC plays over, so we don’t hear them, but we see them 
           bonding. Smiling. Even Paz. Then - 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAFE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Paz and the Ghosts sit around a table in the living room, mid-
           feast, mid-conversation. MUSIC plays from an old stereo.

           Asti clears plates and refills drinks as everyone talks - 
           This feels customary, like - despite being a trained killer - 
           she’s still paying her dues. As she goes back into the 
           kitchen:  

                                 GERDANA
                        Asti’s our newest. She wanted to 
                        fight beside us after we freed her 
                        village. And Belar -- She’s been 
                        with us two years now.     

                                 PAZ
                            (re: Belar’s SCARS)
                        Can -- um... Can I ask...? 

                                 GERDANA
                        Bad things. By bad men. 

           Understatement, but yeah, Paz gets the picture.

                                 EZO
                        Don’t worry. She’s made sure to pay 
                        them back since.

           Paz looks to Belar. Belar doesn’t speak much - but her head 
           is always held high, as if her disfigurement is a badge of 
           honor, and her fierce eyes are all the beauty she needs. 

                                 PAZ
                            (to Gerdana)
                        How about you? 

                                 GERDANA
                        I was accepted to University, 
                        actually. A scholarship. In London.           

                                 EZO
                            (adding, like a proud mom)
                        At sixteen. 
                                 GERDANA
                        But I couldn’t leave. There was too 
                        much to be done here.

                                 PAZ
                        Handing back a first class ticket 
                        out of here? That’s a brave choice. 

                                 GERDANA
                        It was the only choice.

                                 PAZ
                        So you’re saints as well as 
                        soldiers? 

                                 EZO
                        Not me. I was just good at it. I 
                        don’t have a sad story. Or a noble 
                        story. I was strong. And mean. And 
                        fearless... And bored.              

           Gerdana smiles, knowing Ezo goes far deeper than that, but 
           doesn’t like people seeing her as anything but a badass.  

                                 PAZ
                        A born warrior. 

                                 EZO
                        “Warrior.” That’s a good word. A 
                        soldier fights because she’s 
                        ordered to. A warrior fights 
                        because she wants to.  

                                 SEYDA
                        Or has to.

           It’s the first thing Seyda’s said, so it weighs a bit more. 
           Everyone is quiet for a beat until -- 

           Asti re-enters with more PLATES OF FOOD, setting them down 
           and serving Paz first.  

                                 PAZ
                            (to Asti)
                        Thank you. 
                            (to everyone)
                        All this, and you guys can cook, 
                        too.  

                                 GERDANA
                        You helped. 

                                 PAZ
                        I chopped.
           There’s a brief moment, as the food is passed around, where 
           everything feels sublimely safe, and familial. 

           Paz can’t help but be reminded...

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        My brother used to do all the 
                        cooking. 

           The Ghosts trade slight glances.

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        Our parents passed away, and - 
                        Well, I think he was so tired of me 
                        feeding him hot dogs and Easy Mac 
                        that he learned how to do all the 
                        cooking, and cleaning, and... 

           For the first time since we’ve met Paz, long-overdue tears 
           well up in her eyes --

           -- and spill over. 

           She catches them as quick as they fall. 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           Seyda reaches out and puts a hand on Paz’s shoulder.

           And remember, they haven’t even formally shaken hands yet. 

           The Ghosts, especially Ezo, look surprised by her overt 
           compassion for this stranger. 

                                 SEYDA
                        I used to have a brother, too.  
                        You can cry. It’s not weak. 

           Paz looks to Seyda with grateful eyes, but composes herself. 

                                 PAZ
                        I’m fine. I’m okay. 

           She tries to laugh it off - or at the very least, lighten the 
           mood: 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        So. What’s for dessert? 

                                                                CUT TO:

           A COLD METAL TRAY WITH A FLY CRAWLING ON IT. Bringing us to -- 
           INT. TRUCK BED - SOMEWHERE HOT - DAY 

           -- the back of a covered truck bed, where Arnold (The Sick 
           Soldier) lies on his side, weak. 

           An empty beat-up plastic WATER BOTTLE and a PLATE with some 
           discarded crumbs by his side. 

           Next to him, Scrubs stares down at the same meal, only he 
           hasn’t eaten his yet: 

           A stale piece of flat bread on a metal plate, and a bottle of 
           water.   

           There aren’t any guards with them back here. It’s too hot. 

           So scrubs, despite his restraints, carefully scoots next to 
           his ailing buddy. 

           He takes the tiniest sip of water, if only to balm his 
           bleeding-chapped lips and feel the SLIGHTEST relief in his 
           throat...  

           But then hands the bottle to Arnold. 

                                 SCRUBS
                        Arnold. Wake up. Drink this. 

           No response. He nudges. 

                                 SCRUBS (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Drink this. You need the 
                        hydration. 

           Arnold opens his tired eyes and mumbles:

                                 ARNOLD
                        Don’t. 

                                 SCRUBS
                        Come on, buddy -- 

                                 ARNOLD
                        Stop. I’m gonna die, man.  

                                 SCRUBS
                        You don’t know that. We don’t know 
                        what’s gonna happen, okay? 

           Arnold is too weak to argue, and is so thirsty, with such a 
           fever, he parses his lips and lets Scrubs pour the entire 
           bottle into his mouth. 
                                 SCRUBS (CONT’D)
                        Good.  

           He rubs Arnold’s head like a child fading to sleep. 

                                 SCRUBS (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna be okay. 

           From the corner of the truck, Khan stares at Scrubs, both 
           admiring his selflessness and pitying his optimism. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Inside the safe house, Asti (the young one) cleans dishes in 
           the kitchen. In the living room, Nusa cleans and dismantles a 
           small cache of weapons while Gerdana plays chess against 
           herself.

           Through an open door, we see Seyda and Abergel, pacing and 
           talking intensely in a back room. 

           Paz sits, propped near a window - so tense, she’s making the 
           chair she’s sitting on nervous. 

           Ezo walks over with TWO GLASSES OF WHISKEY. Hands one to Paz. 

                                 PAZ
                        You’re allowed to drink? 

                                 EZO
                        Remember, we’re not Muslim, we’re 
                        Yazidi. We pray five times a day, 
                        but we can drink. We can dance. We 
                        just can’t eat lettuce - and our 
                        God is a Peacock Angel.  

           Paz wonders if she’s joking. She’s not. Paz politely smiles. 

                                 EZO (CONT’D)
                        You’re welcome to pray to Him too, 
                        if you’d like. 

                                 PAZ
                        Thanks but - I don’t pray. 

                                 EZO
                        Don’t you think now’s a good time 
                        to start? 

           Paz does a slight salute with her glass. Takes a swig.
                                 PAZ
                        You know, I’m the reason my brother  
                        joined the army. His whole life he 
                        just wanted to be a doctor. But he 
                        followed me here first. I’m the one 
                        who always ran straight into 
                        trouble. He’s the one who tried to 
                        fix it.

           She polishes her drink and stares into the empty glass. 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        The part I can’t get over is that I 
                        asked him if he was scared when he 
                        got here. He said “Why should I be? 
                        My big sis has my back.”  

                                 EZO
                        It’s not over. 

           Paz refuses to cry again - but -  

                                 PAZ
                        Every minute I wait... 

           POV: ACROSS THE LIVING ROOM - through the doorway, she sees 
           Seyda and Abergel leaning over a map on a table like two of 
           Churchill’s generals.

                                 EZO
                        They’re working on it. 
                            (off Paz’s concern)
                        Don’t worry you’re not in there. 
                        It’s not you. Abergel shares things 
                        with Seyda he doesn't share with 
                        us.

                                 PAZ
                        You mean they’re...

           A couple? 

                                 EZO
                            (laughing)
                        No. 
                            (actually)
                        I don’t think so. 
                            (then)
                        No. They’ll make a plan, like they 
                        always do. And we’ll succeed, like 
                        we always do. 
                                 PAZ
                        You must be pretty confident in 
                        her. 

                                 EZO
                        Seyda? The best part about Seyda is 
                        that you’d follow her into certain 
                        death, but she’s so good, you’ll 
                        never have to. She wanted to do 
                        things differently: Choose smaller 
                        battles. Control emotions. Fight 
                        smarter. Focus on those you want to 
                        save, not those you want to kill.

                                 PAZ
                            (with a smile)
                        Don’t be a hothead driven by 
                        vengeance and rage? 

                                 EZO
                        Seyda can be - what’s the word? -  
                        merciful. But to get to the people 
                        you want to save, you come across a 
                        few you have to kill. 
                            (matching Paz’s smile)
                        I try to make sure there’s time for 
                        both. 

                                 PAZ
                        Cheers to that. 

           Abergel and Seyda finally enter the room with their plan. 
           Time is of the essence. All eyes are on them.  

                                 ABERGEL
                        We found a way in. But I am going 
                        to warn you, you’re not going to 
                        like the sound of it.  

                                 EZO
                        Well, this is off to a fun start.  

                                 ABERGEL
                        Sheikk Hilal Road. Through East 
                        Hama.  

           Paz doesn’t follow, but the rest don’t seem enthused. 

                                 GERDANA
                        You have a plane chartered?  

                                 ABERGEL
                        We drive. 
                                 EZO
                        You’re crazy. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        I’m serious. 

                                 GERDANA
                        Sheikk Hilal? The deadliest road in 
                        Syria?

                                 EZO
                        The deadliest road in the world. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        I told you you wouldn’t like the 
                        sound of it. 

                                 SEYDA
                        But it’s not. 

           Seyda’s calm confidence brings the conversation back to 
           reality. She nods to Abergel:  

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        Tell them. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        One of my contacts on the inside 
                        says it’s been depopulated. No 
                        one’s foolish enough to drive it 
                        anymore. The checkpoints are thin. 
                        Missiles have gone where they’re 
                        needed more. My guy says it’s the 
                        safest place to penetrate right now 
                        in all of the North.

                                 EZO
                        But there still are checkpoints?

                                 ABERGEL
                        Only one we need to get past. 

                                 PAZ
                        So what’s your plan? 

           Paz says it with zero incredulity - she’s ready for anything, 
           just say the word. The others, not so much.

                                 SEYDA
                        We ambush them. Kill everyone at 
                        the checkpoint. Make it look like 
                        someone else did it.    
                                 ABERGEL
                            (to Paz)
                        Once we’re past, my contact will 
                        help get your brother safely to us, 
                        from the inside out. No one will 
                        have to fire another shot, if it 
                        all goes right.   

                                 EZO
                        That’s a big “if.” 

                                 ABERGEL
                        It’s a big plan. 

                                 GERDANA
                        I’m sure there’s more to it than 
                        that? 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Plenty. But that’s step one.

           Again, no one is enthused. 

                                 SEYDA
                        It’ll work. We can do it. We leave 
                        at sundown.    
                            (before Paz can talk)
                        We need the night. 

                                 EZO
                            (raising her hand 
                              sarcastically)
                        Just one question. How exactly are 
                        six women just going to roll up and 
                        kill a bunch of border guards 
                        before they ever get suspicious?       

                                 ABERGEL
                        A little sleight of hand...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ISIS PRISON CELL - SOMEWHERE AWFUL - EVENING

           Lights slap on and buzz to life. The ugly kind. Fluorescent, 
           caged in wire.

           We’re in a basement holding cell. Stone walls, iron bars. 
           It’s cold. Medieval. Cozy, if you’re the Man in the Iron 
           Mask.
           Our soldiers are spread about, Arnold (The Sick Soldier) 
           lying down, Scrubs and Khan (the Interpreter) against the 
           wall. HANDS TIED BEHIND THEIR BACKS. MOUTHS TAPED. 

           Rob stomps in with a morning-cup-of-coffee pep.  

                                 ROB
                        Alright, my sweeties. Them drugs 
                        should be kickin’ in nice and 
                        toasty right about now. Today we’re 
                        going to play a little game. A 
                        children’s game. Good fun, I 
                        promise.  

           The usual HENCHMAN with a CAMERA enters. 

           We’re pretty sure this isn’t ending well.  

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Did you know kids play “Duck, Duck, 
                        Goose” in Syria? They don’t have 
                        ducks here. And they definitely 
                        don’t have fuckin’ geese. But they 
                        have this damn game. Only they call 
                        it, “Bata, Bata, Bijea.”             

           The Cameraman finds an angle as another HENCHMAN props up the 
           boys, one by one, making them face each other in a circle.   

           Rob takes out his signature KNIFE. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        And it’s a great fuckin’ game when 
                        you think about it. In what other 
                        game does a player wield such 
                        power? Walking around with your 
                        peers huddled on the ground in 
                        fear. In complete control. Choosing 
                        mercy, mercy, mercy, and then 
                        striking, without warning.
                            (as he circles them)
                        Bata... Bata... Bata...  

           With each pass, he gently touches their heads with his hand. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Now, it’s starting to hurt my 
                        feelings that you chaps think I’m 
                        some sadist who puts you through 
                        these exercises for my own 
                        pleasure. That couldn’t be further 
                        from the truth. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Like the Karate Kid waxing on and 
                        waxing off, everything I do is to 
                        teach you a higher lesson. So 
                        what’s your lesson today? What’s 
                        the point of this little charade?
                            (more serious now)
                        March 30th, 2017. Taqba, northern 
                        Syria. A US drone strike kills 
                        eighty-four civilians. Thirty of 
                        them, children. And do you know 
                        what game the children were playing 
                        when their lives were so casually 
                        snuffed out? Starting to see where 
                        this is going? 

           This time around, he lightly POKES the spear of the knife 
           into their foreheads.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Bata... Bata... Bata... Bata... 

           They wince, or lean back, but they take it. 

           Beads of blood roll onto their faces. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        See, you call us terrorists. But 
                        we’re grown men, suited up, 
                        fighting a fucking war. Terror is 
                        being a civilian, huddled in fear, 
                        waiting for your turn to be stamped 
                        out. Terror is an enemy that 
                        doesn’t even show up to fight, but 
                        pushes a button, while an unmanned 
                        drone turns you to ashes from a 
                        world away. TERROR is making 
                        innocent children afraid of a blue 
                        fucking sky.            
                            (with much more force now, 
                              tugging their hair)
                        Bata... Bata... Bata... 

           Staring at Scrubs -- 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Bijea... 

           He instead tilts Khan’s head back and SLICES HIS NECK.  

           Khan tries to fight, but he’s a gazelle on the nature 
           channel.  It’s ugly.  

           Arnold lunges to fight, but he’s drugged and bound and sick, 
           so he collapses with a helpless grunt.
           The HENCHMAN pulls him away, as we switch to the --

           calmness:

                        Two more days. Say the word, and we 
                        can stop playing games.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAFE HOUSE - EVENING

           Paz stares out the window at the late afternoon sun, feeling 
           time pass slower than it ever has in her life. 

           Seyda approaches. 

                                 SEYDA
                        I’ve been in your position before, 
                        you know. 
                            (off Paz’s look)
                        I mean, I’ve had to wait, ready, 
                        eager to rescue someone I loved. 
                        But I promise, no matter how hard 
                        you stare at that sun, it won’t set 
                        any faster. 

           Paz returns her jaded stare to the low-hanging sun above the 
           mountains.  

                                 PAZ
                        What happened?

           Seyda doesn’t understand... 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        To the person you waited to rescue? 

                                 SEYDA
                            (choosing to be honest)
                        I was too late.

           Paz nods as one does when nothing in the world is reassuring.

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        But I wasn’t the fighter I am now. 
                        And I wasn’t as careful.       

           Paz turns her focus from the setting sun to study her 
           mysterious sister-in-arms for a beat. 
                                 PAZ
                        Well, I’m sorry. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Me too. 

           Paz has never seen Seyda even approach vulnerable, so she’s 
           unsure how tender to let this moment get. But there’s 
           something between them. A kinship of tragedy with a stranger 
           on the other side of the world. 

           Looking back to the sunset:           

                                 PAZ
                        Where you would you rather be right 
                        now? 

                                 SEYDA
                        Where would I rather be?  

                                 PAZ
                        You never play that game with 
                        yourself, when something fucked up 
                        is happening? Imagine if everything 
                        had turned out different? 

                                 SEYDA
                        Why did you join the army? 

                                 PAZ
                        Because I wanted to serve my 
                        country.
                            (seeing Seyda isn’t happy 
                              with such a pat answer)
                        Because I couldn’t get into 
                        college. Because they said women 
                        couldn’t fight in combat, and I 
                        wanted to prove them wrong. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Yet you deserted. You left it all 
                        behind.      

                                 PAZ
                        For a cause. 

                                 SEYDA
                        And when your cause is over? 

                                 PAZ
                        I don’t know. I guess I’ll be done 
                        fighting. 
                                 SEYDA
                        Well I joined my army when I was 
                        fourteen. I joined because half the 
                        women I know have been kidnapped 
                        into slavery. Half the men I know 
                        have been killed. You fight for 
                        some idea. For identity. For 
                        vengeance. We fight for existence. 
                        You ask where I’d rather be, but I 
                        don’t understand. We win a battle, 
                        it’s back to the fight. We free the 
                        enslaved, it’s back to the fight. 
                        And even when we get our vengeance, 
                        it’s back to the fight.             
                            (adding)
                        There’s nowhere I’d rather be. 

           Well, shit. There’s nothing Paz can say to that. 

           So she doesn’t.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

           TIME-LAPSE shots of the mountainous desert, as day flips like 
           a coin into night. MUSIC builds.        

           It’s go time. 

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - ISIS TERRITORY - NIGHT

           A TRUCK being driven by ASTI (the young one) with NUSA (the 
           big, strong one) in shotgun comes into frame on an isolated 
           highway. Driving QUICKLY, almost erratically. 

           HIGH BEAMS piercing the darkness.   

           Then it passes us, and we stay on the side of the road.  

           We feel like we’re lagging behind the action, when A SECOND 
           TRUCK speeds by us, hidden in the darkness: 

           HEADLIGHTS OFF, BRAKE LIGHTS REMOVED, literally CLOAKED in 
           THICK BLACK TARPS AND CURTAINS. The love child of Humvee and 
           a Ring Wraith.   

           And we go -- 
           INT. CLOAKED TRUCK - NIGHT 

           -- inside, where only the soft glow of a lantern illuminates 
           the covered rear cabin. The low-rent version of the green 
           “Lights-Out” setting in a military aircraft.       

           And the vibe is exactly the same. You’d think we were about 
           to descend on Bin Laden’s compound. 

           Ezo, Seyda, Gerdana, and Paz sit facing each other like 
           German Shepherds, poised and focused. Guns at their sides.  
           Occasionally swaying from the rough bumps of the road. 

                                 PAZ
                        I’ve been thinking about what you 
                        asked me.   

           Everyone looks to Paz, but it’s clear she’s talking to Seyda. 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        Before. About why I fight. 

           She struggles to finish, because this part’s hard to admit: 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        It was an escape. A way out, from 
                        everything. From having to face 
                        responsibility. From looking after 
                        the one person who ever needed me. 
                        But it all followed me. And now 
                        that I’m ready to face it...

           Seyda’s lived through the nightmare running through Paz’s 
           brain right now, and won’t let her punish herself any more.

                                 SEYDA
                        We’re not too late. 

           There’s an assuredness to Seyda’s tone. True belief, like a 
           sinner counting on absolution. Maybe this mission isn’t just 
           about Paz and her brother. 

           But before we start speculating on their thoughts --

           On the side of the road, THE SHELL of a US MILITARY TANK lies 
           on its side like an elephant carcass. 

           Hiding behind its underbelly is a REBEL VILLAGER with an    
           AK-47 who sees the HEADLIGHTS of the lead Ghost truck 
           approaching...
           INT. LEAD TRUCK - NIGHT

           Asti and Nusa see MUZZLE FLASHES crack off from the roadside.   

           POP-POP-POP - Bullets ping off the truck’s grill. 

           A stray CRACK is put in the windshield. 

           But Asti SLAMS on the gas and -- 

           EXT. DESERT NIGHT - ISIS TERRITORY - NIGHT 

           -- the truck WHOOSHES past as our Villager shoots in vain at 
           the passenger side.

           A SECOND REBEL runs into the road with a bigger toy:         
           A Shoulder-mounted ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER (RPG).  

           INT. LEAD TRUCK - NIGHT

           Picking up a WALKIE-TALKIE: 

                                 NUSA
                            (In Kurdish)
                        Right side. Two of them. 

           She checks the rearview to confirm, and sure enough... 

           EXT. DESERT NIGHT - ISIS TERRITORY - NIGHT 

           As the Rebel steadies the launcher on his shoulder --   

           POP-POP. With a hiss and a thud, a bullet finds each man. 

           A drive-by shooting from a truck they never saw.   

           The rebels drop, and BOTH TRUCKS screech to a halt. 

           The Cloaked Truck backs up to the scene.  

           INT. CLOAKED TRUCK - NIGHT 

                                 SEYDA
                            (to Paz and Gerdana)
                        Stay here.

           Seyda nods to Ezo who jumps out the rear with her.   

           IN THE ROAD: 
           Rifles ready, they inspect the TWO DEAD BODIES, and plant two 
           rounds in each for good measure.     

           Ezo inspect the surrounding area, making sure there aren’t 
           any more men.

                                 EZO
                            (calling out)
                        All clear. 

           IN THE CLOAKED TRUCK: 

           Seyda and Ezo rejoin, and the truck pulls out. 

           Slow at first, as if turning the corners of a haunted house - 
           waiting for something to jump out. 

           Hell, it even feels haunted out here.  

           SHELLS OF TANKS and BURNT-OUT CARS line the road like 
           skeletons in a pirate cave. This highway is a boneyard. 

           But after a moment, they pick up speed.

           BACK AT THE SITE: 

           With the trucks far in the distance, we PAN ACROSS the two 
           DEAD BODIES in the road. 

           As a PAIR OF SANDALS WALKS INTO FRAME.

           Not good.  

           EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

           ESTABLISH the desert at night. The crescent moon, barely 
           shining. Plenty of stars, but the world still looks black. 

           (MUSIC plays over).   

           A bird’s eye view of the trucks forging through the burnt-out 
           wasteland. Getting closer. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHECK POINT - DESERT ROAD - ISIS TERRITORY - NIGHT

           We’ve seen a checkpoint like this before. Not unlike the one 
           where The Wind was executed. 

           A few TRUCKS, headlights on, in a semi-circle. 
           A GATE that stretches across the road.

           No one’s standing outside. It’s dark and cold and no one much 
           drives this way these days. 

           But TWO GUARDS get out when they see the SWERVING HEADLIGHTS 
           approaching. 

                                 CHECK POINT GUARD #1
                            (in Arabic)
                        HEY! 
                            (waiving his arms)
                        Slow down! Stop the vehicle! 

           The Guard reaches for the RIFLE strapped around his shoulder, 
           aiming it when -- 

           The TRUCK finally SLOWS, seemingly respecting the checkpoint. 

           FOUR OTHER MEN get out of the idling trucks, making a total 
           of SIX very suspicious men with GUNS.

           And remember - for right now - we’re in the guards’ POV. 

           All we see is dust floating in front of TWO BRIGHT HIGH BEAMS 
           from a single truck. Then, we hear a VOICE:  

                                 ASTI (O.S.)
                            (in Arabic)
                        Help! Please! My father, he’s very 
                        sick. PLEASE.

           We walk with the first Guard to the drivers’ side. 

           And with the Second guard to the passenger side. 

           Flashlights illuminate. 

           Inside the truck - ASTI - who looks no older than a teenager, 
           is faux-crying, holding up her hands.

                                 CHECK POINT GUARD #1
                        What’s going on in there? 

                                 ASTI
                        Please! Sir, my father, he needs 
                        help... 

           They look to the PASSENGER SEAT, where a large body is 
           slumped over under blankets. 

           The guards look to each other. Both a bit on guard, and both 
           the slightest bit hesitant about handling some diseased 
           farmer right now. 
           As they look to each other, we QUICKLY JUMP -- 

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - ISIS TERRITORY - NIGHT

           -- TWO HUNDRED YARDS BACK, where the doors of our idling 
           CLOAKED TRUCK quietly open, and FIVE PAIRS OF BOOTS hit the 
           dirt and scatter with precision. 

           It’s Zero Dark Thirty back here. 

           EXT. CHECK POINT - DESERT ROAD - ISIS TERRITORY - NIGHT

           Back at the checkpoint, Asti does her best to stall - 

                                 ASTI
                        Do you have a first aid kit? 

                                 CHECK POINT GUARD #2
                            (leaning to the window, 
                              cautiously)
                        What’s wrong with him? 

           Both Guards are next to the open windows now. 

           Their FOUR COMRADES stand back, guns relaxed, but ready.  

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - ISIS TERRITORY - SAME TIME 

           QUICK FLASHES to the Ghosts, CLAD IN BLACK, splitting up like 
           a pack of wolves into the desert... 

           EXT. CHECK POINT - DESERT ROAD - ISIS TERRITORY - NIGHT

                                 CHECK POINT GUARD #1
                        You. Get out of the truck. 

                                 ASTI
                            (leaning over)
                        Baba, -- 

                                 CHECK POINT GUARD #1
                        NOT HIM. Just you.  

           Asti nods. And she should get an Oscar for the faux concern 
           she’s showing her not-father.   

           She turns to un-click her belt... 

           PULLS OUT A HANDGUN and PLANTS A BULLET IN THE GUARD’S 
           FOREHEAD.  
           On cue, NUSA springs up from beneath her blanket and -- 

           -- POP-POP. Goodnight, Guard #2. 

           Then, as we can probably predict, the WHIZZING OF BULLETS 
           from our sniping Ghosts rains down on the four remaining 
           halfwits -  

           BUT...

           This time, not everything is such a slam dunk. 

           A SERIES OF TRUCK LIGHTS TURN ON - like a stadium at night, 
           illuminating the road from behind the checkpoint.  

           There were FIVE OR SIX TRUCKS we didn’t know were there. 

           A lot of doors begin opening. 

           And a lot of men begin jumping out. 

           Shit.

                                 EZO
                        What the fuck is this? 

                                 SEYDA
                        No clue. 
                            (shooting)
                        Stay cool. 

                                 EZO
                            (shooting twice as fast)
                        I don’t stay cool. 

           WE JUMP AROUND to various positions as all Hell kicks off - 

           Everyone scatters, firing in the dark.    

           Nusa and Asti hold position for a moment, then desert their 
           vehicle to run back to the CLOAKED TRUCK.  

           Only MUZZLE FLASHES light up the night. It’s near-chaos to 
           the observer - but those involved seem to know where to aim. 
           BURSTS of fire. SCREAMS. Figures silhouetted in beaming 
           headlights.

                                 SEYDA
                            (calling out)
                        Back to the truck. Let’s go!  

           An IED EXPLODES and CHUNKS OF A MAN fly into the night sky.

           Okay... so there are IEDs out here, too. Great. 
                                 ISIS FIGHTER
                            (to his men) 
                        Stay on the road! 

           A SECOND WAVE of men comes running through the headlights.

           PAZ sees that this isn’t ending. 

           She digs in, between the truck and the guard post, guarding 
           the thin road access like the Greeks at Thermopylae.

           Finds Seyda as the others retreat safely:  

                                 PAZ
                        Go! I’ll be right there! 

           Seyda readies her rifle to help her, but Paz pushes it away.

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        GO! 

           And returns to her metronomic fire. Left to right. Right to 
           left. An oscillating fan dispensing hollow points.

           Seyda reluctantly retreats to the rear truck in the darkness, 
           where the Ghosts are mounting up. 

           Nusa revs the ignition.   

           And as Seyda climbs in, she looks at the encroaching force 
           and realizes Paz isn’t coming out of this. 

           Nusa shifts into gear - 

                                 SEYDA
                        Wait! 

           Bullets PING off their truck and CRACK the windshield. 

                                 EZO
                            (to Nusa)
                        Let’s go! 

                                 SEYDA
                        WAIT -- 

                                 EZO
                            (to Seyda)
                        We have to go NOW! 

           Nusa kicks it in reverse, then fishtails around, gunning it 
           back the way they came. 
           The enemy trucks posture to get around the barricade, but 
           Paz’s steady fire (and the IEDs lining the road) keeps them 
           at bay long enough for the Ghosts to get a head start.     

           We wonder why they don’t just run Paz over, but it becomes 
           clear...  

           These people like their enemies captured. Alive. 

           Like a pack of hyenas circling a wounded giraffe, the men  
           close in, keeping their cover as Paz doles out her remaining 
           rifle rounds.  

           Then her handgun. Emptying a clip... 

           Loading another one... 

           Getting sloppier with each round, as if every shot is 
           screaming “FUCK YOU.” 

           Finally, just CLICKS. Empty trigger pulls, accompanied by the 
           enemy’s SHOUTS - coordinating how to close in on her. 

           She’s finished. And she didn’t even leave one in the chamber 
           to take herself out. 

           FLASHLIGHTS click on all around her. 

           She spins like a cornered animal, taking aim with her 
           unloaded weapon... 

           Then finally drops to her knees, under SCREAMED COMMANDS she 
           doesn’t understand.

                                 PAZ
                            (to herself, or whoever’s 
                              listening:)
                        Fuck. 

           She puts her hands behind her head. 

           Game over. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           It’s later. Much later.

           Abergel sits in a chair, awaiting the Ghosts. From his face, 
           we guess he already knows what went down.  

           Seyda BURSTS in, livid:      
                                 ABERGEL
                        Before you say anything, -- 

                                 SEYDA
                        Fuck you!

                                 ABERGEL
                        You should consider yourself lucky. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Lucky? We almost died out there. 
                        Every one of us. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        And the “almost” part is why you 
                        should feel lucky.

                                 SEYDA
                        You said it was the easiest way in. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        It is.

                                 SEYDA
                        You said you had a man on the 
                        inside. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        I do. But -- look, he gives us the 
                        best information he can. He’s not 
                        in command.  

                                 SEYDA
                        It was stupid. The whole plan. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Did you have a better one? 

                                 SEYDA
                        That’s what we rely on you for. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        We took a gamble. And we lost. 

                                 SEYDA
                        WE took a gamble. YOU sat back and 
                        let trouble find us. Which seems to 
                        be a pattern with you lately. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Are you questioning my loyalty? 

                                 SEYDA
                        Maybe just your ability. 
           This just became personal. Abergel won’t stand to have his 
           loyalty OR ability questioned. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        You lost the American girl. After 
                        she already gave you everything you 
                        need to move on.

                                 SEYDA
                        So that’s it, then? She’s 
                        expendable? 

                                 ABERGEL
                        Your concern for her is admirable. 
                        Touching, even. But you and I are 
                        in the business of getting results. 
                        Not tilting at windmills.       

                                 SEYDA
                        We left her. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        You had to. 

                                 SEYDA
                        We failed. 

                                 ABERGEL
                        You lived.

           Abergel’s not apologizing. And even if he did, Seyda’s not in 
           the forgiving mood. Not for him. Not for herself. 

           She exits almost as abruptly as she entered. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAZ’S PRISON CELL - ISIS VILLAGE - DAY

           It feels like morning. But hot as high noon. 

           Paz is bound to a chair in a dusty, quiet cell, lit by a 
           square of sunlight beaming through an IRON-BARRED WINDOW in 
           the wall. 

           She’s sweaty, and tired. We have no idea how long she’s been 
           sitting here.    

           Arnold (the SICK SOLDIER) lies DEAD ON THE FLOOR.  A FLY 
           lands and crawls on his open eyes and mouth. 

           This is a nightmare. 
           Paz struggles, as if for the hundredth time, to loosen her 
           restraints in vain. She quits. Returns her look to Arnold.    

                                 ROB (O.S.)
                        Oh, him? 

           ROB enters the open doorway. And for the first time, Paz gets 
           a look at the monster she’s been hunting, in the flesh.  

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        He died, sadly. And to be honest, I 
                        was rooting for him to pull 
                        through.    

           Only something is VERY STRANGE:   

           HE ISN’T TALKING LIKE “ROB.”

           His accent is more like Anthony Hopkins than an East-End 
           grime rapper.    

           His cadence is calm. His volume, composed.

           Paz’s eyes say what we’re thinking: What the actual fuck? 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        They call me Rob. Who might you be?  

           If Rob really doesn’t know who Paz is, she’s not about to 
           give it away. 

                                 PAZ
                        No one important. 

                                 ROB
                        Now, now. What kind of self-esteem 
                        is that?

                                 PAZ
                        You sound different in person. 

                                 ROB
                        Never meet your heroes, they say. 

                                 PAZ
                        So what, then? This is all fake? 

           Rob casually looks back to the DEAD BODY in the corner. 

                                 ROB
                        Does it look fake to you?  
                            (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROB (CONT'D)
                        I’m offended you don’t grant me 
                        more depth than my on-screen 
                        persona. All opinions are 
                        trademarked and my own, and I 
                        believe my work speaks for itself, 
                        BUT - you’re a service member, you 
                        understand. We operate in 
                        recruitment industries. And it’s 
                        difficult to gather the masses --   
                            (dipping into “Rob” accent)
                        -- when you don’t sound like the 
                        masses. 

                                 PAZ
                        So, what are you, then?

                                 ROB
                        That’s the brilliant part. I’m 
                        whatever you need me to be, so long 
                        as you hate me. 

           Mission accomplished, but Paz remains cobalt cool.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Now, back to our friend in the 
                        corner. I swear, I didn’t even kill 
                        the poor lad, he just up and died 
                        on his own. Well - I suppose my 
                        neglect in treating his maladies 
                        may have expedited his departure, 
                        but now we’re into semantics. And I 
                        hate semantics.
                            (a beat)
                        This is all to say I’m short one 
                        soldier.     

                                 PAZ
                        Lucky you, then.  

                                 ROB
                        You have no idea. Imagine my 
                        exquisite surprise when I wake to 
                        the news that we’ve snagged 
                        ourselves another red-blooded 
                        Yankee playing cowboy in the 
                        desert. And not just that... She’s 
                        the SISTER of the charming young 
                        medic we’ve been having so much fun 
                        with. That’s not just luck. That’s 
                        divine intervention. 

           The penny drops. Paz knew she wouldn’t be so lucky. This 
           maniacal creep knows EXACTLY who she is and what she wants.
           She stays composed, despite his odious, smug smile. 

                                 PAZ
                        Where is he?

                                 ROB
                        Nowhere important. 

           Paz SPITS on Rob’s chest, wishing it had hit his face.

                                 PAZ
                        Where is he? 

           But Rob remains - as if determined to be seen as - calm. 

                                 ROB
                        It is touching that you came all 
                        this way to try and save him. But I 
                        don’t think you give your brother 
                        enough credit. He’s not as weak as 
                        he appears, you know. Just like 
                        your not as strong as you appear.

                        Not a great negotiator, either.  

                                 PAZ
                        What are you afraid of? 

                                 ROB
                        Do I seem afraid? 

                                 PAZ
                        Terrified. Of dishonor. Because if 
                        someone like me kills someone like 
                        you, you wouldn’t get into your 
                        precious Paradise.   

                                 ROB
                        Oh, you mean - because you’re... a 
                        woman?  

           He stifles a laugh - genuinely amused.    

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Just stories. To make the little 
                        Kurdish girls sign up to fight us.

                                 PAZ
                        So maybe it’s just me? Because I’m 
                        a trained soldier, not one of your 
                        innocent child brides? Because I 
                        shoot bullets bigger than your 
                        dick? Because you’re a fake, 
                        frightened coward, who knows if he 
                        lets me out of this chair for five 
                        seconds I would beat his skinny ass 
                        to death?      

           Rob leans close enough to smell Paz’s hatred. 

                                 ROB
                        Is this the part where I burst into 
                        an impotent rage? Got any more 
                        reverse psychology to dazzle me

                        If I’ve failed to be clear on that, 
                        I really must work on my messaging.

                        No, this. Right now. This isn’t 
                        about religion, or America, or 
                        fucking recruitment. You’re just a 
                        sick fuck who likes to torture 
                        people. 

           Rob doesn’t blink. It’s hard to hurt the feelings of someone 
           with no feelings.

                        One less than I was hoping for.

           Rob relishes finally having a worthy sparring partner, but 
           there’s something about her answer that changes his mood -

           He’s done playing around.

                                 ROB
                        You’re right. I’m not about to kill 
                        you. And there are no cameras in

                        They’re set up outside, instead.

           Paz’s stomach drops through the floor. And that brave poker 
           face finally folds its hand.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        If I may point your attention to 
                        the window...  

           TWO MASKED GUARDS storm in and --  

                                 PAZ
                        Wait, -- 

           -- CUT HER LOOSE FROM HER CHAIR. 

           Her hands are still bound behind her, but she’s lifted to a 
           standing position and MARCHED TOWARD THE BARRED WINDOW.

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        No-no-no, wait, ... 

           Her head is SLAMMED into the IRON BARS so her face protrudes, 
           staring out into whatever hellhole village she’s captive in.   

           And as she winces from the pain, the guards WEAVE A ROPE 
           THROUGH THE BARS and TIE HER HEAD IN POSITION.  

           They want her to see this.
           EXT. PRISON CELL - ISIS VILLAGE - DAY     

           Outside, maybe fifty yards from Paz’s cell, we find SCRUBS, 
           standing in a LARGE IRON CAGE fit for a circus bear.

           He’s wearing tattered burlap clothing, SOAKED head to toe 
           with gasoline.    

           His mouth is bound and gagged, his eyes are heavy. And he 
           wobbles, barely able to stand on his own.

           ISIS TROOPS and CAMERA MEN surround him, from a distance. 

           A TRAIL OF GASOLINE wets the sand for a hundred feet. 

           INT. PAZ’S PRISON CELL - DAY      

           Her face pressed against the bars, Paz screams: 

                                 PAZ
                        Diego! Diego, look at me!   

           She struggles with all her might, but the two guards hold her 
           in place, pressed against cold stone and iron.

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        DIEGO! 

           OUTSIDE: Scrubs hears the familiar sound of his sister’s 
           voice and wonders if he’s hallucinating. 

           His bleary eyes raise in search of her.

           IN THE CELL: Rob walks over and gets so close that his 
           whispering lips touch Paz’s ear.

                        Excuse me. I have to go play dress-
                        up.   
           And he EXITS, leaving PAZ pressed between the window’s bars, 
           staring at the altar of her brother’s sacrifice. 

                                 PAZ
                        DIEGO! Look at me, PLEASE. 

           AT THE CAGE: Scrubs finally sees his sister. And for the 
           briefest moment, there’s an illogical relief in his eyes.  

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        I love you. I’m so sorry. I’m so 
                        fucking sorry.   

           Paz has just enough slack to punitively SLAM her head against 
           the bars as she cries.

           Scrubs holds up a hand, in a motionless wave, and grips a 
           bar. 

           It’s the closest he can come to reaching out for her. 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                            (softer now, in shock)
                        I’m so sorry... I’m so sorry... I’m 
                        so sorry...  

           PAZ’S POV: We see Rob giving a speech to the cameras, but we 
           can’t hear it.    

           We stay inside, as Paz watches the worst moment of her life 
           from the best seat in the house. 

           The TORCH is lit. 

           Rob looks back to Paz. 

           Lowers it to the ground... 

           And it’s on. The fire accelerates toward the cage, where 
           Scrubs almost welcomes the relief from this Hell.

           CLOSE ON PAZ. From outside, looking back through the bars. 

           Her face staring at us, bound to witness. 

           We don’t hear any screams. 

           Just the frightening WHOOSH of a fireball -  

           And we see PAZ’S EYES clamp shut as she struggles against her 
           constraints.  

           Awful. Guttural. Sheer animal agony.  
           After a long beat - TOO long for our comfort - 

           Her eyes open. 

           But they focus only on Rob, in the distance. 

           Filled with a fire all their own.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           The Ghosts sit in the safe house, gathered around a TABLET at 
           the table which has just played the gruesome VIDEO.  

           Even for hardened women, they’re sick at the sight. 

           A moment of silence goes by - ultimately broken by Seyda. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Paz is still alive. 

                                 EZO
                        Not for long.

                                 SEYDA
                        For one more day. 

           It hits Ezo that Seyda isn’t saying this like it’s a 
           finality, but an opportunity.     

                                 EZO
                        You can’t be serious. 

                                 SEYDA
                        She saved us. 

                                 EZO
                        From the danger she put us in. 

                                 SEYDA
                        She didn’t put us there. 

                                 EZO
                        No. She asked us to fight a battle 
                        that has nothing to do with us. To 
                        save a soldier who was careless 
                        enough to get captured. And then 
                        she got captured herself.  

                                 SEYDA
                        And we promised to help her. 
                                 EZO
                        We promised to help our own people. 
                        Those girls? In prison? Those are 
                        our people. I can’t believe I’m the 
                        one saying this to you, but you’re 
                        acting crazy.  

                                 SEYDA
                        We can do both. 

                                 EZO
                        Not if we’re dead, we can’t. What 
                        happened to your whole philosophy? 
                        No emotions. No mistakes. Live to 
                        fight another day.    

                                 SEYDA
                        How long have we been looking for 
                        that prison? Our army couldn’t find 
                        it. Abergel couldn’t find it. And 
                        this runaway American girl falls 
                        into our lap with the Holy Grail - 
                        a THOUSAND young women we can 
                        return home. Getting to kill the 
                        men who take them. Who rape them. 
                        Who scar their faces when they’re 
                        finished with them.       

           CUT TO BELAR (with the scars) as her backstory instantly 
           comes into focus.   

                                 EZO
                        Right. So let’s take the gift she 
                        gave us and risk our lives over 
                        something that matters. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Not like that. We were going to 
                        die. And she saved us. Someone as 
                        loyal as you should understand... 

                                 EZO
                        I understand that if we go after 
                        her, and we fuck it up, then 
                        everything we do here is over. 

           The others affirm with their looks.  

           Seyda takes this in. Seemingly persuaded. 

                                 SEYDA
                        You’re right. 
           Ezo, despite her displeasure in being the logical one, is 
           satisfied. Until:

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        So let’s not fuck it up. 

           The group trades looks as Seyda EXITS, ultimately coming to a 
           silent conclusion:   

           Fuck it. We’re in. 

           A SONG PLAYS OVER, as we visit --

           INT. PAZ’S PRISON CELL - DESERT TOWN - NIGHT

           -- Paz’s prison cell, later that night. 

           TWO HENCHMEN enter to drag ARNOLD’S BODY out before it rots. 

           One takes out a WATER BOTTLE. 

           Paz salivates at the sight. 

           But alas, he’s only using it to SPLASH on the floor, 
           dispersing the caked, dried blood.    

           He tosses the empty plastic bottle when finished, and it 
           rolls halfway to Paz’s feet. 

           They leave. And she stares at the bottle, watching with 
           chapped lips as the final drops pat-pat-pat on the floor. 

           (SONG STILL PLAYS OVER AS WE JUMP TO:) 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The Ghosts sleep in their beds, RIFLES by their sides...  

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Seyda and Abergel sit over a MAP OF THE REGION, strategizing.    

           They’re weighing options. Frustrated. Like NASA engineers who 
           can’t solve a problem yet...

           INT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

           We see the SHELL OF A VEHICLE on the “Most Dangerous Road.”   

           Maybe one we saw already, maybe these are all over. 
           But we use it like a sun dial, showing the passing of time as 
           the SHADOW glides left to right.  

           Sunrise. High Noon. Afternoon... 

           A DAY HAS GONE BY. 

           The SONG FADES. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PAZ’S PRISON CELL - DESERT TOWN - AFTERNOON

           We’re back in the one-window cell. Stone-walled and hot.

           It’s almost deja vu. Paz sits, tied to the chair, head 
           slumped to the side. Sweaty. Pale. Lips so chapped, there’s a 
           50/50 chance she dies of thirst before being executed.

           But the lighting’s different. The sun is setting. 

           It’s closer to evening, when executions happen around here. 

           Rob walks in, HOLDING A LARGE SYRINGE.

                                 ROB
                        Good evening, love.        

           Paz doesn’t even look up.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        I do apologize, but this is going 
                        to sting a bit. 

           He unfeelingly PLUNGES the needle into her bicep.

           She tries not to wince, but, damn.

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Good girl. Now, I would love to say 
                        this numbs the pain, but in truth, 
                        you’re going to feel everything. 
                        This just keeps you nice and docile 
                        while it happens.

           Finished draining the plunger, Rob removes the needle.

           Paz stares up defiantly. 

                                 PAZ
                        I thought I wasn’t as strong as I 
                        look. 
                                 ROB
                        Don’t be flattered, everyone gets 
                        it. Makes for a better show.

           Paz starts laughing. At first for show, then uncontrollably. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                            (not taking the bait)
                        Well, it’s good to see you smiling 
                        again. 

           He turns to go. 

                                 PAZ
                        It’s just - this whole time I 
                        thought you’d scared them into 
                        submission. Broken their spirits. 
                        Turns out you’re such a limp little 
                        dick you can’t even keep a prisoner 
                        in line without drugging them.      

           Rob really is Teflon, though. He won’t even give her a 
           glimmer of the reaction she wants.  

                                 ROB
                        It really has been a pleasure. I’m 
                        going to go set up, and come back 
                        when you’re a little less chatty. 

                                 PAZ
                        Bring your duct tape, then. ‘Cause 
                        I’m gonna remind you you’re a 
                        fucking coward til the minute you 
                        kill me.      

                                 ROB
                        Oh, we’re not just gonna kill you. 
                        My friends are all gonna take a 
                        turn with you. Then we’re going to 
                        torture you. And THEN we’re going 
                        to kill you. 

                                 PAZ
                        Well at least I won’t feel the 
                        first part much.

           An infuriatingly polite smile from Rob, and he exits.

                                 ROB
                            (over his shoulder)
                        See you soon.

           Rob leaves, and Paz can’t help but betray her brave face for 
           a single moment. Enough for us to see: 
           She’s terrified.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PRISON / COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

           We tilt up on a BURNT IRON CAGE like it’s the obelisk from 
           “2001: A Space Odyssey.”     

           Waiting in the fading sun for its next victim. 

           We got a glimpse of it before from Paz’s window, but now we 
           get a better sense of the surroundings: 

           We’re in a VILLAGE at the edge of the desert - no more than a 
           dozen buildings reduced to rubble.  It’s impossible to 
           imagine people still live here.  

           The vast expanse of desert fills the background. 

           TRUCKS line what can generously be called the COURTYARD - the 
           open area near Paz’s prison where the cage sits.  

           But unlike last time, where only a few men witnessed and 
           filmed Scrubs’ execution... 

           This one has a proper audience. 

           20 ISIS SOLDIERS. Maybe 30. Hard to tell. But they’d 
           certainly fill the bleachers of a little league baseball 
           game. 

           And that’s not too strange a comparison, seeing as this is 
           just about the only form of recreation around here.

           They stand and sit - some on BENCHES, some on their TRUCKS, 
           but all congregated at the center of the square. 

           Ready for a show. 

           INT./EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DESERT VILLAGE - SAME TIME 

           TWO HUNDRED YARDS AWAY: Seyda and Ezo sit at the second story 
           window of an abandoned bullet-ridden building.  

           It’s a lot like the time we first met them. 

           They talk while looking through their RIFLE SCOPES, staring 
           at the gathering of MASKED ISIS HENCHMEN.     

           In Kurdish: 
                                 EZO
                        Shit. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Yeah. 

                                 EZO
                        This is bad. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Yeah. 

                                 EZO
                        There’s a lot of them. 

                                 SEYDA
                        I know why it’s bad. 

                                 EZO
                        We could go outside-in. Trap them 
                        in the middle. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Even we can’t shoot that fast. 

                                 EZO
                        Speak for yourself. 

           SEYDA’S RIFLE POV: We see the CROSSHAIRS plan their route, 
           dancing from center mass to center mass, meticulously 
           navigating a hypothetical path to --    

                                 SEYDA
                        Fuck. 

                                 EZO
                        Yeah. 

                                 SEYDA
                        There’s a lot of them. 

                                 EZO
                        Yeah. 

           A beat. Wheels spinning. 

                                 SEYDA
                        We might have to try something a 
                        little less subtle. 

           Off Ezo’s look - 

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. PAZ’S PRISON CELL - DESERT VILLAGE - AFTERNOON

           CLOSE ON PAZ’S EYES. 

           Drowsy. Lilting. Half-dollar pupils fighting to focus.   

           Paz inhales and licks her lips like a first-timer trying 
           Molly. If this were a cheesy 80s movie, we’d be in Slo-Mo.  

           Suffice to say: shit’s kicked in. 

           A MASKED SOLDIER enters.

           Paz turns her head three seconds slower than she means to. 

           The Masked Soldier holds a KNIFE - not quite as menacing as 
           Rob’s, but it’s pretty fuckin’ Crocodile Dundee.

           Paz doesn’t know who this asshole is, but she’ll be damned if 
           she lets anyone see her “nice and docile” like Rob wants her. 

                                 PAZ
                            (straining to lock eyes)
                        You up first?

           The MASKED SOLDIER looks to the doorway, then casually walks 
           to the barred window and glances outside. 

           Paz can barely turn her head to follow him...  

           When he quickly kneels behind her chair with his knife -- 

                                 MASKED SOLDIER
                        Abergel sends his regards. 

           -- and CUTS HER RESTRAINTS.

           Before she can make sense of what’s happening, or consider 
           who this mysterious savior is, the Masked Soldier exits. 

           But not before DROPPING HIS KNIFE ON THE STONE FLOOR. 

           Paz stares at it, then examines her newly freed hands.

           CLOSE ON THE KNIFE as we MATCH CUT TO -- 

           INT. ROB’S “OFFICE” - SAME TIME 

           -- the ROB’S KNIFE, being slammed into a DESK, burying an 
           inch of metal into the worn wood. 

           Rob sits in a small empty “office” somewhere inside the 
           prison, alone and isolated.   
           The kind of place where he finally feels free to release that 
           “impotent rage” he couldn’t in front of Paz. 

           He POUNDS his fists against the desk, PUNCHING down - the 
           wild tantrum of an 8th Grade bully. 

           Closing his eyes, he breathes his near-hyperventilation down 
           to a calm, meditative exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Eyes closed.

           Like a zealot finishing his self-flagulation, he feels purged 
           of his demons, and refocuses his calm stare to his knife. 

           Until he sees something out the open-air WINDOW and rises to 
           his feet.   

           ROB’S POV: Out the window, the MASKED SOLDIER walks briskly 
           away from the prison.  

           Rob cocks his head.    

           Something’s not right.   

           EXT. PRISON - COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

           Outside, by the cage, the THIRTY-ODD ISIS SOLDIERS mill about 
           and smoke cigarettes. Talking.  

           One carries CANS OF GASOLINE like Gunga Din.

           No sign of the Ghosts, or Rob, but we do finally see the 
           PRISON Paz is being held in, and it’s a bit bigger than the 
           one room. 

           It’s the biggest building in the “square,” one-story, but 
           enough space for 8 or 10 rooms, like a small town jailhouse. 

           A jailhouse Paz is currently -- 

           INT. PRISON HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           -- navigating, quietly as she can, blade in hand. 

           Walking through the hallway - dim even in the day. So quiet, 
           Paz can hear the individual conversations of men outside.  

           Every foot-dragged step is punctuated by a heavy breath.   

           Maybe because her adrenaline is dialed to “11.” Or maybe 
           because - let us not forget - she’s high as a kite.

           One moment, hyper-aware - the next, disoriented as a KO’d 
           boxer.   
           But she persists. 

           Turning a corner... 

           Finding nothing. 

           Trudging a few more paces... 

           Expecting a fight she can’t possibly win like this... 

           Until she comes to a DOOR. 

           Breathes. Steels herself. And OPENS it. 

           THE SETTING SUNLIGHT POURS IN, blinding Paz as she stumbles --

           EXT. PRISON / COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

           -- outside, where, in three clumsy steps, she finds herself 
           in the middle of the dirt road by the courtyard. 

           THIRTY ISIS SOLDIERS turn and stare immediately. 

           If there was a record playing, this is when it would scratch. 

           It’s comical, even. First man to aim at her, if he pleases, 
           gets a kill shot. 

           And poor Paz brought a knife to an Isis-execution-fight.    

           Until -- 

           WHOOSH. 

           Barreling past her, NEARLY KILLING HER where she stands, a 
           TRUCK WITHOUT A DRIVER accelerates toward the CROWD. 

           Various YELLING as the 30-odd Soldiers scramble, but --  

           BOOM! 

           Too late. 

           The truck SMASHES into an ISIS vehicle and it’s suddenly the 
           4th of July. Explosives packed to the gills, mushrooming on 
           impact.    

           We take a single second to focus on PAZ - who just as 
           comically - has zero reaction to what she’s seeing.  

           BACK TO THE CROWD. 

           They run, yell, take cover, aim weapons -- but at what?
           Until, like the Honor Killing in the desert, men start 
           DROPPING LIKE FLIES as GUNSHOTS scream into the courtyard. 

           EXT. VARIOUS BUILDINGS / ALLEYWAYS / COURTYARD - SAME TIME 

           We jump perspectives rapidly. 

           From every corner, from every angle, a GHOST comes out of the 
           woodwork to dispense death.

           Nusa (the big, bad one) throws that useful RPG (from the 
           roadside) on her shoulder and fires a grenade into the crowd. 

           Belar (with the scars) SNIPES from a rooftop with cold 
           efficiency as men scramble like roaches. 

           Asti (the young one) hides behind a wall and GRABS a fleeing 
           soldier, PUSHING A KNIFE into the bottom of his chin. 

           Gerdana (book smarts) lies prone-position beneath an ISIS 
           truck, dropping men as they head for their rides.    

           EXT. PRISON / COURTYARD - SAME TIME 

           Then there’s our two leaders - EZO and SEYDA - who pull up in 
           their CLOAKED HUMVEE CHARIOT, skidding to a stop next to Paz.  

                                 SEYDA
                            (jumping out)
                        Here. 

           She tosses Paz a HANDGUN. 

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        Get in. 

           Paz would be disoriented regardless, but the drugs make her 
           wonder if what she’s seeing is real.

           Ezo jumps out the passenger side, raises her rifle, and fires 
           at what’s left of the crowd.

                                 PAZ
                        What are you doing here? 

                                 SEYDA
                        Something stupid.

           Seyda aims her rifle and joins Ezo. The scene is insanely 
           loud and chaotic, but Paz just remains, dazed and stoic. 
                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           She gestures for Paz to jump in the humvee for cover. 

           But Paz is staring at something.

           POV: In the distance, at the rear of the prison, ROB PULLS 
           OUT INTO THE ROAD, IN A TRUCK OF HIS OWN.   

           He stares at Seyda and Ezo... 

           ... At PAZ... 

           Then PEELS OUT in the opposite direction, heading for the 
           desert road.

           Ezo spins and FIRES at his truck, but he’s turned a corner. 

           EXT. VARIOUS BUILDINGS / ALLEYWAYS / COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

           Back among the alleys and rubble buildings, the tide of the 
           fight is beginning to turn. 

           The soldiers who are still alive are beginning to wise up. 
           And maybe there were a few more that weren’t part of the 
           crowd. 

           Our Ghosts, in their various positions, are feeling the heat. 

                                 ASTI
                            (for help)
                        Seyda!

           And A PIERCING WHISTLE from Gerdana, tucked beneath a truck. 
           “Backup, please!”

           EXT. PRISON / COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

           Seyda sees the look in Paz’s eyes. Her tormenter - the Devil 
           himself - driving into the desert. GETTING AWAY.  

           Ezo has already BOLTED to help her friends. 

           Seyda assesses. Then: 

                                 SEYDA
                        Go.
                            (intentionally echoing Paz 
                              from before:) 
                        We’ll be right there.
           Paz doesn’t have it in her to smile right now, but she 
           acknowledges the sacrifice, and steps toward the Humvee.

           AND COLLAPSES. 

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        Paz. 

                                 GERDANA (O.S.)
                            (in the distance)
                        SEYDA! 

           Seyda helps Paz to her feet, but realizes there’s a giant 
           fucking fire fight she needs to be a part of. 

                                 SEYDA
                            (shit)
                        Wait in the truck. I’ll be right b-- 

                                 PAZ
                        NO.  

           Paz leans against the truck for support: 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        I got this. 

           She looks into Seyda’s eyes. There’s no time for debate, so 
           Seyda is either going to let Paz jump into this truck or not.     

           And she does. 

           With a nod, Seyda runs off to rescue her friends.

           And Paz mounts the truck like a drunk mounting a horse. 
           Inelegant, but damned determined.

           She focuses (a bit too hard) to the find the gearshift - and 
           pulls it. 

           It’s on.

           The SOUND of a ROARING ENGINE pulls us to -- 

           INT./EXT. ROB’S TRUCK - DESERT ROAD - AFTERNOON

           -- ROB, flooring it across the bumpy desert road in the 
           sunset.

           He checks his rearview: vast, empty track, until... 

           The shimmer of a lone Humvee. 
           Someone is following him. 

           INT./EXT. PAZ’S HUMVEE - DESERT ROAD - AFTERNOON

           Paz stares dizzily at the RPMs red-lining the gauge. 

           FROM ABOVE, we watch her TRUCK SWERVE all over the road, 
           flirting with the countless IEDs that probably line it.

           Her vision is blurred. Her hands fight to keep their grip on 
           the wheel. 

           But FUCK. THIS. GUY. - She’s not giving up. 

           In fact - she’s gaining. 

           INTERCUT WITH ROB’S TRUCK: 

           That glint in the rearview is now the hungry grill of a 
           humvee chomping on Rob’s ass. 

           The trucks are a length apart. 

           Paz grabs the HANDGUN Seyda gave her. Raises it... 

           Now remember, aiming a gun while driving a truck on a bumpy 
           road would be hard for Chris Kyle - 

           Let alone a tired, tortured and drugged prisoner of war. 

           The two trucks become parallel... 

           Paz FIRES TWO SHOTS. 

           Nothing. 

           The trucks dance, back and forth. Gaining, retreating... 

           EXT. VARIOUS BUILDINGS / ALLEYWAYS / COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

           Back in THE BATTLE, the Ghosts prove they aren’t invincible. 

           NUSA takes a bullet to the shoulder and collapses. Alive, but 
           DAMN, that hurts...   

           Gerdana barely has time to RELOAD A CLIP and aim before -- 

           EXT. DESERT ROAD / PAZ’S TRUCK / ROB’S TRUCK - AFTERNOON

           BANG-BANG-BANG - Paz tries for Rob’s tires as the trucks 
           barrel down the highway.  
           Nothing. 

           Maybe this gun isn’t doing the trick. 

           She REVS the gas and RAMS Rob’s truck. 

           Just a bit, from the side. 

           No dice. 

           Rob gains a bit of distance.  Paz catches up. 

           Tries again. Ramming the rear of Rob’s truck. 

           Not getting it done. 

           Fine -- one more try.

           She slams the gas, gets PERFECTLY parallel to Rob’s truck -- 

           AND SLAMS INTO HIM, SIDEWAYS.

           Bingo. 

           Both trucks seemingly ATTACH, veering off the road together 
           in perfect lockstep - bumping, slamming, scraping - until -        

           BOOOOOOM!

           An IED EXPLODES beneath them - sending BOTH TRUCKS flipping 
           on their sides, like hands accepting a sacrament.

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - AFTERNOON

           The trucks GRIND TO A HALT in the DUST. On their side. 

           Wheels still spinning. Underbellies busted. Tires burned. 
           Windshields cracked like spider-webs.

           A passerby would assume everyone involved is dead.  

           But no one’s out here to make that judgment. Just the empty 
           desert, two beat-up trucks - 

           And the innocuous DING of a door ajar. 

           Rob crawls out of his truck. Banged up a bit, but alive. 

           INSIDE PAZ’S TRUCK: That stupid DING is the only sound 
           bringing Paz back to reality. 

           She’s disoriented. Even more so now. Upside down, caged 
           inside an upended smoking death trap. 
           A few coughs. A steady drip of BLOOD from her forehead... 

           And she realizes she’s still alive. 

           WITH ROB: As he rises from his hands and knees like a wide 
           receiver who got his bell rung.            

           He inspects himself. Dinged up, but intact. 

           Looks at the empty expanse around him - then HEARS COUGHING. 

           Refocusing, he limps toward -- 

           PAZ’S TRUCK: Where Paz is crawling out of the crunched open 
           window, upside down.     

           She flops onto her belly and drags herself across the sand 
           like a wounded snake, inching away from the smoking humvee.  

           When she sees Rob. 

           Reaching for her gun she realizes - It’s in the humvee. 

           Wonderful. 

           The cut in her head is flowing down her cheek, matting her 
           hair to her face. She drags her legs like anchors. 

           It’s bad.

           Rob’s SILHOUETTE stands over her in the orange setting sun. 

           Paz belly-ups and stops, taking a much-needed breath.  

                                 ROB
                        What’s a matter, sweetie? Cat 
                        finally got your tongue?

           And it has. 

           Paz can hardly move, let alone verbally spar with this 
           asshole right now. 

           But she tries - chapped lips mumbling something, shakily.  

           But it’s inaudible. The way a person follows a prayer in 
           church.   

           ROB UNSHEATHES HIS KNIFE. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        Sorry? 
           Paz takes a breath, as if needing a second wind just to make 
           a sound come out of her mouth. 

                                 PAZ
                        I said... 

           POP!

           ROB’S KNEE SHATTERS - nearly tearing his leg in half. 

           Blood mists the air, and he SCREAMS as he collapses.

           Paz is as surprised as he is. 

           INT./EXT. GHOST HUMVEE - DESERT ROAD - SAME TIME 

           A thousand yards away, WAY too far to accurately make a shot 
           like that, SEYDA stands out the open roof of a second Humvee - 

           - having just discharged her rifle, despite the shaky ride 
           and bumps in the road.  

           Ezo stands next to her with BINOCULARS, assessing the damage. 

           Nusa drives. 

                                 EZO
                        You missed. 

           It’s just like the moment we met them. 

           Seyda grins. Ezo grins back.   

           EXT. PAZ’S HUMVEE - DESERT ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 

           It’s eerily similar to the Ghosts’ introduction:  

           A wounded man crawling in the sand. 

           Wheels SCREECHING up to the sight.   

           And the BOOTS OF THE GHOSTS dropping onto the ground, 
           surrounding our bad guy. 

                                 ROB
                            (desperately hiding pain)
                        I don’t think we’ve met yet. 

           God, Rob’s a stubborn motherfucker. 

           But the Ghosts don’t play along. 
           They aim their rifles at him like a firing squad while Nusa 
           helps Paz to her feet.  

           Rob stares back with a fearless defiance. Credit where 
           credit’s due - he’s not about to beg for mercy. 

           The others look to Paz as she’s propped up by Nusa, waiting 
           for her command on what to do with this piece of shit. 

           Without a word, Paz gently pushes Nusa’s support away. 

           She puts every ounce of strength into standing on her own. 

           And takes a single step. 

           Followed by another. 

           The Ghosts watch with honor as Paz pushes her drugged, bloody 
           body beyond her limits - 

           She kneels on the ground, and with a hand growing less shaky 
           by the second, picks up ROB’S DROPPED KNIFE from the sand. 

           Like magic, she rises with twice as much vigor as she knelt. 

           She’s finding her strength.

           She trades nods to Seyda - thank you for saving my life. But 
           I got it from here...  

           Rob winces from the agonizing pain in his leg, but doesn’t 
           make a sound. He looks up as Paz casts a shadow on him. 

                                 ROB (CONT’D)
                        So this is the part where the bad 
                        guy dies, huh? 

                                 PAZ
                        Oh. I’m not just gonna kill you, 
                        Rob. 
                            (a beat)
                        My friends are all gonna take a 
                        turn with you. And THEN I’m gonna 
                        kill you.  

           The Ghosts can’t help but smile. 

           Rob’s face FINALLY betrays the cowardly fear he’s hiding. But 
           only for a moment. He straightens up, as if this is his final 
           act of performance art: 

                                 ROB
                        See you in Hell, then. 
                                 PAZ
                        Count on it. 

           As Paz bends down with Rob’s knife, THE SCREEN GOES BLACK. 

           BUT WE HEAR THE SOUNDS. 

           Meat being stabbed. 

           Rob’s FULL-THROATED SCREAMING. 

           Wherever she’s cutting him - it ain’t his neck. 

           THEN - SILENCE. 

           FIVE LONG SECONDS, OVER BLACK. 

           UNTIL...

           INT. HALLWAY - MILITARY BASE - DAY  

           That now-familiar PAIR OF POLISHED SHOES, clicking down the 
           hallway to meet --     

           INT. GENERAL’S OFFICE - MILITARY BASE - DAY

           -- General Burgess, who sits at his desk as the door knocks. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                            (busy with paperwork)
                        Yes. 

           The door opens. The Corporal doesn’t even know what to say: 

                                 CORPORAL
                        Sir... 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                            (seeing his concern)
                        What? 

           INT. HALLWAY - MILITARY BASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Now TWO pairs of shoes click with purpose down the hall. 

           The Corporal fills General Burgess in as we INTERCUT VARIOUS 
           SHOTS: 

                                 CORPORAL (V.O.)
                        It was sent this morning... With a 
                        note inside... 
           INT. MAILROOM - MILITARY BASE - DAY

           In A CROWDED MAILROOM, a PRIVATE cautiously takes a PACKAGE 
           (a brown box big enough for a microwave) from the X-Ray 
           scanner...  

           He cuts the tape and opens it. 

                                 CORPORAL (V.O.)
                        Addressed to you. 

           Looks inside.  Holy Shit.

           INT. HALLWAY / RESTRICTED ROOM - MILITARY BASE

           The two men reach a RESTRICTED ROOM at the end of the 
           hallway, guarded by a SOLDIER. 

           The General -- a tough man, mind you -- reels instantly. 

                                 GENERAL BURGESS
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Displayed on a sterile table in the center of the room, 
           surrounded by SOLDIERS and PROFESSIONALS IN MEDICAL SCRUBS:

           ROB’S HEAD.

           Bloodied, bruised, half-rotten from five hot days in a pile 
           of packing peanuts.

           The Corporal nods to a MAN IN SCRUBS, who hands the general 
           the aforementioned NOTE.  

           A strip of paper with six words, hand-written:  

           “SORRY - COULDN’T WAIT                                               
           FOR YOUR MEN.” 

           Off the General - 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PESHMERGA MILITARY BASE - DAY

           For the first time, we see the sprawling (albeit a bit 
           rustic) MILITARY BASE belonging to the Peshmerga army our 
           Ghosts hail from. 

           Hundreds of TROOPS (both men and women) doing training 
           drills. Mechanics fixing trucks. 
           And a DUSTY SOCCER FIELD being used to train a group of YOUNG 
           WOMEN. Not for soccer, mind you. For war. 

           We glide over the tents and buildings until we land on a -- 

           INT. HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

           -- hospital tent.  More “M.A.S.H.” than Walter Reed.   

           A bunch of little YAZIDI GIRLS run up to the window with a 
           smile, checking in on their favorite patient: 

           PAZ. Recovering, with a few remaining stitches and a brace on 
           her leg, but looking much better now.

           She waves and smiles to the curious girls, when -   

                                 SEYDA (O.S.)
                        So... 

           She looks back to find Seyda standing by her cot. 

                                 SEYDA (CONT’D)
                        We’ve all been talking about what 
                        to do with you. And it occurred to 
                        me I never asked you.

                                 PAZ
                        Well. I finished what I thought I 
                        wanted. And I can’t go home. And I 
                        deserted my army, so there’s that.    

                                 SEYDA
                        A soldier without a country. 

                                 PAZ
                        Right. 
                            (a long beat)
                        So. I hear there’s a prison you 
                        need help liberating. 

           Paz curls the slightest smile as she says: 

                                 PAZ (CONT’D)
                        Back to the fight?

           Seyda smiles. Nodding with pride. 

                                 SEYDA
                        Back to the fight. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT./INT. “THE DUNGEON” - ISIS PRISON - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY  

           ESTABLISH a medieval-looking prison atop an isolated mountain 
           in the desert.  

           We find ourselves floating omnisciently through the walls - 
           through the cells, the hallways, the rooms. 

           It’s grim. 

           WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS (some of them children) crammed into 
           tiny cells. Sleeping on the ground in dark rooms. 

           ISIS Guards watching over them lecherously.

           We float past the disgusting scene until we reach -- 

           EXT. YARD - “THE DUNGEON” - ISIS PRISON - DAY 

           -- the outside yard - walled in by IRON BARS.     

           The unforgiving sun beats down on a constellation of WATER 
           BUCKETS, where TEENAGE GIRLS are washing laundry on their 
           knees.  

           We float past their faces. Innocent. Precious. Doomed.    

           It’s heartbreaking. 

           Until we reach a SPECIFIC GIRL near the edge of the bars. 

           With UNFORGETTABLE EYES.  Like EMERALDS. 

           The Wind was right. His daughter did end up in a place worse 
           than Hell. 

           But maybe not for long. 

           She stands, holding a wet garment she’s washing, and 
           approaches the bars.

           HER POV: In the distance, beyond the base of the mountain, 
           DUST GATHERS ON THE ROAD. 

           Someone is approaching.    

           (MUSIC begins over...)  

           EXT. DESERT MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 

           CLOSE ON PAZ, standing out the roof of an open HUMVEE like 
           Washington crossing the Delaware.  
           Air whipping her hair. 

           PAN TO FIND Seyda right beside her.  

           THEN ANOTHER TRUCK COMES INTO FRAME, joining like a bird to a 
           flock... 

           Ezo, rifle by her side. 

           Then Asti, Nusa, Gerdana, Belar... 

           Then MORE. 

           As WE PULL BACK, MORE AND MORE TRUCKS come into frame. 

           Like ships of an armada, overtaking the road. 

           FIFTY TRUCKS, maybe more. 

           WOMEN. MEN. SOLDIERS.    

           Riding like cowboys. 

           Bringing Hell with them. 

           (MUSIC SWELLS). SMASH TO BLACK. 

           END OF FILM.
