                  "Love is simply the name for the desire and pursuit of 
           the whole." - Plato, The Symposium

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        The Ancient Greeks believed humans 
                        once had four arms, four legs, and 
                        a single head made of two faces. 

           NEW SLIDE: Classical Greek illustration of a TWIN-BEING. 

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        We were happy. Complete.

           A HEART encircles the twin-being. Both faces smile.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Too complete, as fate would have 
                        it, for the gods who - fearing our 
                        wholeness would quell our need for 
                        worship - cleaved us in two...

           NEW SLIDE: Twin-being split. Twin cries of despair.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        ...leaving our split-selves to 
                        wander the earth in misery, forever 
                        longing...

           We ZOOM IN on the FACE of a split-being CRYING. The face 
           MORPHS into an ICONIC CRY-FACE FROM ART. 

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        ...longing... 

           We ”animate” through FAMOUS ART CRY-FACES...

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        ...longing... 

           The ART FACES morph into CLASSIC MOVIE CRY-FACES...

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        ...for the other half of our soul.

           From Cleopatra to Sally Albright. So many tears.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        It is said that when one half finds 
                        its other...

           NEW SLIDE.
           Scene from a CLASSIC MOVIE: lovers’ eyes finally meet.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        ...there is an unspoken 
                        understanding, a unity - and each 
                        would know no greater joy than 
                        this.

           A CLASSIC KISS. Music swells.

           MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKERS - MORNING

           Two seniors joined as one by the lips.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Of course, the Ancient Greeks never 
                        went to high school.

           BELL RINGS. The seniors break apart like it was nothing.

                                 SENIOR GUY
                        Good hangout.

                                 SENIOR GIRL
                        Whatever.

           Both pull out phones, part ways.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Or they’d realize...

           Sound of the MORNING BELL dissolves into...

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - TICKET BOOTH - SAME

           ...the BLAST of a TRAIN WHISTLE... growing LOUDER...

           CLOSE ON the FACE OF A GIRL, 17, pressed against a LAPTOP 
           KEYBOARD, her body curled around a copy of PLATO’S SYMPOSIUM, 
           fast asleep inside a frosted TICKET BOOTH. She jerks awake.

                                 ELLIE
                        Crap.

           This is ELLIE CHIU.

           She bangs out a line on the keyboard, presses SAVE, bolts out 
           of the booth.

           On her computer screen we see (and hear in voiceover):
                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        We don’t need the gods to mess 
                        things up for us.

           A PASSING TRAIN wipes frame...

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - MOMENTS LATER

           ...leaving Ellie on the RIGHT SIDE of the platform, waving a 
           signal flag.

           SUPER: “THE HALF OF IT”

           The station is otherwise empty.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - MORNING

           SERIES OF SHOTS:

           - ELLIE’S HEAD POPS OUT OF A SWEATER, spray of foam, 
           toothbrush.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        If you ask me, people spend far too 
                        much time looking for someone to 
                        complete them.

           - SHE SLAPS TWO FROZEN SWANSON CHICKEN PIES ON THE COUNTER

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        How many people find perfect love? 
                        Or if they do...

           - STARES AT A COMATOSE CAT, A SHOT OF INSULIN AT THE READY. 
           Is it... dead?

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        ...make it last?

           The cat BOLTS.

                                 ELLIE
                        Goddammit, Schrodinger!

           She gives chase... past an ALTAR for HER DEAD MOTHER. We 
           linger on a PHOTO OF HER MOTHER: young, laughing, striking 
           the same pose as the STATUE of BOB’S BIG BOY just behind her.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        More evidence of Camus’ theory that 
                        life is irrational and meaningless.
           - A PRINTER spits out a page on which is written:

           “...Camus’ theory that life is irrational and meaningless.”

           A HAND grabs the page, signing “Trevor Carson, AP English”. 

           CUT to ANOTHER PAPER. On its last page:

           “We don’t need the gods to mess things up for us.”

           The hand signs - in new penmanship - “Todd Ball, English”

           REVEAL ELLIE signing, then tossing papers onto a stack.

           - ON COVERS GENTLY BEING PULLED OVER EDWIN CHIU, 50’s, 
           snoring in a LA-Z-BOY.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        And that, my friends, is some A+ 
                        love philosophy right there.

           Ellie tiptoes around him.

           - CHECKS OFF A LIST BY THE DOOR: “Breakfast” (check) “Take 
           Vitamins” (check) “Shoot Cat” (check) “Sunscreen” (check) 
           “Stay Away From Boys” (check) “Have Good Day” (check)

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Or A-, if Mrs. G is in a bad mood.

           Ellie grabs her bookbag. The door slams behind her.

           CUE OPENING CREDITS

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN - MOMENTS LATER

           A dilapidated BILLBOARD IN THE SHAPE OF AN ARROW announces: 
           “It’s Happening In SQUAHAMISH!”

           The arrow points to an empty field.

           Ellie speeds past on her bike.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - MORE TOWN - LATER

           The road continues past a small CATHOLIC CHURCH. Outside, a 
           Man with a SIGN: “JESUS IS COMING. ARE YOU READY?”

           FATHER SHANLEY, 90’s, stands in the doorway bellowing: 
                                 FATHER SHANLEY
                        “Outside are the dogs the sorcerers 
                        the immoral persons and everyone 
                        WHO LOVES AND PRACTICES LYING!”

           Ellie flies by.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - CARSON GRAVEL - LATER

           A giant granite sign heralds “CARSON GRAVEL. We’re more than 
           just gravel!” A showroom gleams in the background.

           Ellie huffs up a hill. A TRUCK rips by, a trio of OBNOXIOUS 
           TEEN BOYS heckle from the flatbed:

                                 OBNOXIOUS TEENS
                        ELLIE CHIUUU! Chugga-chugga-chugga-
                        chugga, Chugga chugga... CHIU CHIU!

           They tear off, laughing.

           Ellie presses on toward the peak...

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - CONTINUOUS

           ...and coasts down the other side. 

           We lift up to see this former mining town in its faded glory.

           A SWELL OF OFF-KEY SINGING from a STUDENT CHOIR.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - CHOIR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A handsome, pained DEACON FLORES brings it to a close.

                                 DEACON FLORES
                        Fantastic. God feels your worship.

           Hidden in the corner: Ellie at a piano, adjacent to the BAND. 
           She sneaks a term paper into the folds of a hymnal, sends it 
           down the reed section.

           On Ellie’s phone: “Todd B. venmoed you $20.”

                                 DEACON FLORES (CONT’D)
                        How do you imagine God gets His 
                        message through?

           Hymnals travel the room. Venmo notifications roll in.

           As the Deacon sermonizes, we see kids on their phones. 
           One SHY BOY OBOIST types out: “Wanna go to OKTOBER FLING?”...

           ... which appears on a FLAG GIRL’S SCREEN. She forwards...

           ...to three of her friends who roll eyes...

           ...one posts a SCREENSHOT with caption “#nerdalert”.

           Snickers throughout the room.

                                 DEACON FLORES (CONT’D)
                        Is there a problem?

                                 WHOLE CLASS (EN MASSE)
                        No, Deacon.

                                 DEACON FLORES
                        As I was saying...

           Shy Boy Oboist melts into his seat, beet-red.

           Ellie’s eyes travel past him into the CHOIR, where a group of 
           rich kids (QUADDIES) buzz around a TALL HANDSOME BOY, 17. 
           This is TREVOR CARSON. Gravel money.

           Trevor drapes his arm around A GIRL, 16, glued to her 
           hymnal... which hides her phone. THIS IS ASTER FLORES.

                                 DEACON FLORES (CONT’D)
                        Turn to page 116...

           He lifts his baton. Aster reluctantly shuts her hymnal, 
           prepares to sing as the music starts.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        In case you haven’t guessed, this 
                        is not a love story. 

           Ellie’s eyes stay on Aster. Aster’s voice rings out pure...

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        Or not one where anyone gets what 
                        they want.

           ...and travels out the window, where we hear...

                                 COACH (O.S.)
                        ARE YOU MEN, OR ARE YOU LOSERS?
           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - TRACK - SAME TIME

           ...a PACK OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS stampede in a CLOUD OF DUST. 
           One BROAD-SHOULDERED BOY lags behind, staring through the 
           window at Aster, transfixed. This is PAUL MUNSKY, 17.

                                 COACH (O.S.)
                        MUNSKY!

           He tosses a last glance over his shoulder... starts running.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY

           Your basic school hallway jungle between bells. The populars, 
           the not-so-populars... high-fives, side-eye, dismissals.

                                 MRS G (O.S.)
                        Notice the lack of fire and 
                        brimstone in No Exit. No torture 
                        devices necessary...

           Unnoticed in the swirl of activity is Ellie, staring at a 
           poster labeled “SENIOR RECITAL SIGN-UPS - MANDATORY.”

                                 MRS G (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We are the source of our own hell.

           She signs her name resignedly - the only solo on the sheet.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - MRS. G’S CLASSROOM

           In chalk on A BLACKBOARD:

           “Hell is other people. -- John-Paul Sartre, NO EXIT.”

           BELL RINGS.

           MRS GESELSCHAP, 60’s, sinks back into her chair.

                                 MRS G
                        500 words on Sartre’s use of 
                        thwarted desire. Monday.

           Students stream out, Ellie the last to leave.

                                 MRS G (CONT’D)
                        Six different takes on Plato. 
                        Impressive.

                                 ELLIE
                        (innocent) Just the one.
                                 MRS G
                        Sure, sure. That’s what I tell the 
                        bartender.

                                 ELLIE
                        How come you’ve never turned me in?

                                 MRS G
                        And have to read the actual essays 
                        they’d write? (makes face)

           Mrs. G slides over an APPLICATION FOR GRINNELL COLLEGE.

                                 ELLIE
                        You know I’m going to “E-Dub.”

                                 MRS 
                        It’s a damn shame.

                                 ELLIE
                        It’s a damn “full-ride.” I can live 
                        at home. Plus, I get to stay in 
                        lovely Squahamish.

                                 MRS G
                        Hell-quamish.

                                 ELLIE
                        It’s not that bad.

           Mrs. G shoots her a look.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, it’s not that good either. 
                        But it’s what’s happening.

                                 MRS G
                        I spent four of the best years of 
                        my life at Grinnell.

                                 ELLIE
                        And look at you, back home in Hell-
                        quamish.

                                 MRS G
                        You’re right. Stay away from the 
                        liberal arts.

           Ellie laughs and stuffs the application in her bookbag.

                                 ELLIE
                        Try not to get fired over the 
                        weekend.
                                 MRS G
                        Are you kidding? Everyone in this 
                        town fears God. You know who God 
                        fears? (smug) The Teacher’s Union.

           Ellie shakes her head fondly, and is gone.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD OUT OF TOWN - AFTERNOON

           Ellie pedals home from school.

           That SAME TRUCK from morning hurtles by. 

                                 OBNOXIOUS TEEN BOYS
                        Chugga-chugga-chugga, Chugga-chugga-
                        chugga... CHIU CHIUUUUU!

           Ellie keeps pedaling.

           Moments later.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           Ellie pedals faster.

                                 PAUL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey!!

           FASTER.

                                 PAUL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        HEY!!! HOLD UP!

           A BREATHLESS PAUL appears in frame. He grabs onto Ellie’s 
           saddlebag, bringing her down.

                                 ELLIE
                        What is wrong with you??

                                 PAUL
                        Sorry I-

           He dry-heaves from exertion. Still coughing, he digs into his 
           KNAPSACK... pulls out a bratwurst. Stuffs it into his mouth 
           and keeps rummaging. 

           Ellie sighs. She knows what this is.

                                 ELLIE
                        $10 for 3 pages. $20, 3 to 10. Not 
                        in the over-10 page biz-
                                 PAUL
                        It’s not- I’m not tryna to cheat-

                                 ELLIE
                        Nobody is. Which class is it for?

                                 PAUL
                        It’s not- It’s uh...

           He pulls out an ENVELOPE and offers it to her.

                                 ELLIE
                        What’s this?

                                 PAUL
                        A letter. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Who writes letters these days?

                                 PAUL
                        I thought it’d seem romantic? Also 
                        she doesn’t have Facebook. Maybe 
                        you could make me sound smart? 

                                 ELLIE
                        Who’s “she”?

           She opens it, curious...

           INSERT: THE LETTER. “Dear Aster Flores...”

           She shoves it back.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t help you.

                                 PAUL
                        I just need a few words. Good ones.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’m not writing to Aster Fl- to 
                        some girl. It’d be wrong. A letter 
                        is personal. It’s supposed to be 
                        authentic.

                                 PAUL
                        That would be awesome!

                                 ELLIE
                        No, I can’t be you being authent-

           Gives up. Mounts her bike.
                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Get a thesaurus. Use spell-check. 
                        Good luck, Romeo.

           Pedals off.

                                 PAUL
                        I can pay more for authentic!

           She’s gone.

           He hurls his KNAPSACK to the ground. Takes a sheepish bite of 
           his bratwurst.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EVENING

           Close on a TV playing the last scene of CASABLANCA.

           Reverse on Ellie and Edwin Chiu, in twin La-Z-Boy recliners, 
           eating pot pies. Ellie keeps one eye on the screen, the other 
           on a laptop where she writes three papers at once.

           The lights flicker.

                                 ELLIE (IN MANDARIN)
                        Did you call the power company?

                                 EDWIN (IN MANDARIN)
                        They don’t understand my accent.

                                 ELLIE
                        Did you try?

                                 EDWIN
                        Sssshh. Best part.

                  HUMPHREY BOGART (ON TV)
           I think this is the beginning 
           of a beautiful friendship.
                                                     EDWIN (CONT'D)
                                              I think this is beginning of 
                                              beautiful friendship.

           Edwin shoots his daughter a sheepish look. She sighs, 
           affectionate.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’ll call tomorrow.

           Father and daughter take synchronized bites of pie.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - NIGHT

           A train hurtles past. 
           The station deserted save for a lone Ellie - in the ticket 
           booth - pounding away on her keyboard.

                                                              ON BLACK:

           “The god of love lives in a state of need. -- Plato. Again.”

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN - MORNING

           Ellie bikes to school, phone pressed to ear.

           Hold music plays. Ellie sighs.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MORNING

           Ellie skirts through the fray, still on phone.

                                 ELLIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Account 467838.

                        Please re-enter your selection.

           She spies PAUL out of the corner of her eye LOOKING TO GET 
           HER ATTENTION. She dodges down an arterial hallway...

                                 ELLIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Bill... Extension.

           ...but can’t merge into the dense crowd. Paul pulls closer. 
           Ellie presses herself against the wall and slides away.  

           HOLD MUSIC continues.

           INT. CHAPEL - NOON

           Ellie alone in the Chapel, playing a dirge-like solo to 
           accompany the HOLD MUSIC.
           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

           A weary Ellie braves the afternoon hallway crowd, phone still 
           pressed to ear. Spins to avoid PAUL on the far end of the 
           hallway with his teammates...

           ... SLAMMING right into TREVOR AND HIS QUADDIES, who walk 
           through her, oblivious. Books, papers, bag go flying. 

           She scrambles to gather her things.

                                 ASTER
                        These hallways are murder.

           Aster has stooped down. To help.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        It’s a whole natural selection 
                        situation waiting to play out.

           Ellie is struck dumb. Say something, say something...

                                 ELLIE
                        I’m Ellie Chiu.

                                 ASTER
                        (amused) Yes, I know. You’ve only 
                        been playing my dad’s services for 
                        like four years. You’re his 
                        favorite heathen. He can’t handle 
                        mediocre accompanists - even if 
                        they are saved.

           They stand. Aster glances at the book she picked up.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        “Remains of the Day”. Loved it. All 
                        that barely repressed longing.

           She pops it on top of Ellie’s stack... and is gone.

                                 ELLIE
                        (groaning) “I’m Ellie Chiu?”

                                 CUSTOMER SERVICE (OVER PHONE)
                        Yes I know. Your bill is 3 months 
                        overdue, Mrs. Chiu. If we don’t get 
                        a minimum payment of $25, your 
                        power will terminate at month’s 
                        end.

           Close on Ellie’s face, desperate...
           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - OUTSIDE BOY’S LOCKER ROOM - 5PM

           A roughed-up Paul emerges out of the locker room. Brightens 
           at the sight of Ellie.

                                 ELLIE
                        One letter. $25. After that you’re 
                        on your own.

                                 PAUL
                        YES!

           He pumps his fists, and heads towards Ellie for a hug, or 
           chest bump or... they settle on an awkward hand shake.

           INT. CHAPEL - LATE AFTERNOON

           Ellie reads Paul letter, slouched in the last pew of the 
           Chapel. Paul sits across the aisle.

                                 ELLIE
                        “Dear Aster, I think your really 
                        beautiful. But even if you were 
                        ugly, I’d want to know you. Cuz you 
                        are smart and nice too. It’s hard 
                        to find all those things in one 
                        girl. But even if you were only two 
                        of those things, I’d be into it. 
                        But your like all three. Just to be 
                        clear.”

           She looks up at Paul: What is this?

                                 PAUL
                        She’s like - all three.

                                 ELLIE
                        Thanks for clarifying.

           She goes back to the letter.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        “About me. I am kind of cute. Some 
                        people think I’m the cutest one in 
                        my family! Those people being my 
                        grandma. Who’s dead now. Never mind 
                        about my dead grandma. All I am 
                        trying to say is that I like fries. 
                        I like dipping them in my 
                        milkshake. Is that weird? It’s 
                        actually really tasty! Would you 
                        like to try that with me some time? 
                        Let me know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I work part time and I have a 
                        truck! Let me know. Whenever. 
                        Thanks, Paul Munsky. (Second-string 
                        running back. Football.)”

           Beat. 

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        So what you’re trying to say is--

                                 PAUL
                        I’m in love with her.

                                 ELLIE
                        Have you ever spoken to her?

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not good with words.

                                 ELLIE
                        But you know you “love” her.

                                 PAUL
                        I know I think about her when I 
                        wake up, and when I’m doing 
                        sprints, and when I’m eating my 
                        mom’s brats, and when I’m saying my 
                        prayers and when I’m--

                                 ELLIE
                        That just means you’re stubborn. 
                        Not that you’re in love. 

                                 PAUL
                        No, it’s love. Love makes you 
                        screwy. Don’t you get screwy?

                                 ELLIE
                        No.

           She goes back to the letter, skimming it.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        (to self) This whole section is - 
                        that fry thing does sound good - 
                        (crossing out) dangling modifier...

           Paul takes her in.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh. I get it.

                                 ELLIE
                        Get what?
                                 PAUL
                        You’ve never been in love.

           Ellie looks at him. Shoves the letter into his ribs.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

                                 ELLIE
                        You want a letter about love? I’ll 
                        write you a letter about love.

           She grabs her bag.

                                 PAUL
                        One that’ll make her fall in love 
                        with me. Not storm off in huff. 
                        Like you’re doing right now.

           She’s gone.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - NIGHT

           ONSCREEN: “Wings of Desire” by Wim Wenders.

           Edwin watches, rapt. Ellie handwrites furiously. She looks 
           up, momentarily stumped. Notices the screen.

                                 ELLIE
                        This isn’t even American. How are 
                        you going to learn English?

                                 EDWIN
                        Sssh. Best part.

                  WOMAN (ON TV, IN GERMAN)
           Longing for a wave of love 
           that would stir in me. That’s 
           what makes me clumsy.
                                              Longing for a wave of love

                                              what makes me clumsy.

           Ellie considers this. Writes “Longing for a wave of love...”

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - LOCKERS - MORNING

           An exhausted Ellie shoves a letter toward Paul.

                                 PAUL
                        You sealed it. (off Ellie’s glare) 
                        I’m sure it’s good.

           Ellie leaves.
                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        (calling after her) Thank you.

                                 ELLIE
                        Venmo me.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD OUT OF TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Another day, another...

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Hey!

           Not this guy again. Ellie pedals faster. 

           Paul appears in the background, flushed from exertion.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        She wrote back!

           Ellie jerks to a stop.

           INSERT: ASTER’S RESPONSE:

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “I like Wim Wenders too. Wouldn’a 
                        plagiarized him though.”

           Off Ellie’s astonished reaction. Who is this girl?

                                 PAUL
                        Who’s this Wim Wenders dude? And 
                        why’d you cheat off him?!

                                 ELLIE
                        I didn’t cheat off him-

                                 PAUL
                        I looked up “plagiarize”-!

                                 ELLIE
                        I kinda cheated off him-

                                 PAUL
                        I PAID you-!

                                 ELLIE
                        But this is good!

                                 PAUL
                        How?

           Yeah, how?
                                 ELLIE
                        It’s uh... like a game. She’s like 
                        challenging us. In a good way.

                                 PAUL
                        So we’re still in... the game.

                                 ELLIE
                        Yup. Uh. We are. So. Yay.

           She offers a weak fist bump. Which misses. With an awkward 
           wave, she pedals off.

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll Venmo you?

           But Ellie’s already speeding down the hill.

                                 ELLIE
                        Game on, Aster Flores. Game. On.

           A PIANO SOLO commences...

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “Dear Aster. Okay. You got me.”

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - DUSTY ROAD - DAY

           Ellie is a DISTANT SPECK, biking towards CAMERA.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “I sometimes hide behind other 
                        people’s words.”

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EVENING

           Ellie and Edwin in La-Z-Boys watch another classic movie.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “For one thing, those people are 
                        published. For another...”

           Father and daughter each toss back a YAKULT.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “...I know nothing about love.”

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - DAY

           A PASSING TRAIN WIPES THE SCREEN...
                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “I’m 17. I’ve lived in Squahamish 
                        my whole life.”

           ...leaving ELLIE and her SIGNAL FLAG on the platform alone.

           INT. CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

           Ellie and Paul argue from separate pews.

                                 PAUL
                        This is such a downer!

                                 ELLIE
                        It’s not a downer!

                                 PAUL
                        Dating is supposed to be fun. Ask 
                        her to hang out!

                                 ELLIE
                        What exactly is “hanging out”?

                                 PAUL
                        You know. Hanging out.

                                 ELLIE
                        But like what do you do?--

           A couple guys from the team ENTER. Paul and Ellie immediately 
           separate, pretend not to know each other.

                                 FOOTBALL DUDE
                        Munsky! What’s doing?

                                 PAUL
                        Nothing.

                                 FOOTBALL DUDE
                        We were gonna confess. Wanna go to 
                        Joey’s and hang out instead?

                                 PAUL
                        Yup.

           They leave Ellie behind.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - TICKET BOOTH - EARLY MORNING

           Ellie scrunched in her ticket booth, writing.

                        “I keep my head down.”

           Paul huffs, lagging behind.

           EXT. MUNSKY SAUSAGE SHOP - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Paul empties the garbage.

           Angle on ELLIE from her ATTIC BEDROOM watching him.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “I’m a simple... guy. Which is to 
                        say...”

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - DUSTY ROAD

           Ellie is now almost at the CAMERA.

                        “If I knew what love was, I would 
                        quote myself.”

           Ellie rides past.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - LUNCHROOM - NOON

           Close on Aster’s face absorbing this last line. Around her: 
           the faded sounds of teens grandstanding.

           The PIANO SOLO ends.

           INT. CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

           Ellie bent over the piano for a quiet moment, just breathing.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Psssst.

           Her head jerks around.
                                 PAUL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        In here!

           She stares at THE CONFESSION BOOTH.

           INT. CONFESSION BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Ellie slides into one side of the booth; Paul’s in the other.

                                 ELLIE
                        Isn’t this sacrilegious?

                                 PAUL
                        I used to hide here when my 
                        brothers got too rowdy.

           He slides a LETTER under the scrim.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        She wrote back.

           Ellie opens the letter.

                        “Dear Paul...”

           INT. SQUAHAMISH - CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING

           Weekly mass through Aster’s eyes. Dream-like and mundane. The 
           sounds of her father’s homily in the background.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)

                        muscles to yawn?

           Close on Aster’s face, smiling, stifling said yawn.

                        “This is the sort of weird fact I

           Trevor uses the mirror app on his phone to groom himself.

                        “...or showing anything that I

           He adjusts his screen to see how he and Aster look together.

                        “Assuming I know how I feel.”

                        words too.”

           Aster’s attention drops back to her phone. On it: a 
           downloaded version of REMAINS OF THE DAY.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “Far better than my own.”

           Aster shuts her locker to reveal one of the QUADDIE GIRLS 
           holding a CARDIGAN. Exactly like the one she is wearing. And 
           that of her two friends.

                        “Not ‘like them’ as in ‘I like you’

                        Oh! You mean right now.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           ASTER WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, FLANKED BY QUADDIE GIRLS, ALL 
           IN CARDIGANS. Trevor throws an arm around all of them.

                        Can I text her now?
                                 ELLIE
                        It’s too soon.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m gonna do it.

                                 ELLIE
                        If you want her to think you’re 
                        like everyone else.

           Paul stops. Sighs. Types something on his phone.

           CHA-CHING. Ellie looks at her phone.

           VENMO NOTIFICATION: “Paul M. venmoed you $25”

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “I never really thought about the 
                        oppression of fitting in before.”

           We see a MONTAGE of letter snippets while:

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD OUT OF TOWN

           Ellie gathers speed on her bike.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “The good thing about being 
                        different is that no one expects 
                        you to be like them...” 

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Wait for me!

           Paul huffs to catch up with Ellie. Ellie sighs.

           Aster reads a letter hidden in her textbook.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “...Doesn’t everyone think they’re 
                        ‘different’ but pretty much we’re 
                        all different in the same way...”

                                 TREVOR (O.S.)
                        Babe. Taco Time?

           Trevor’s at the door of the class. Aster slams her book shut.
                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “...Some of us are more different 
                        than others. You might be 
                        surprised...”

           A PAGE from the letter FALLS TO THE FLOOR, unseen, as Aster 
           hurries to meet him.

           INT. GIRLS’ BATHROOM - SQUAHAMISH HIGH - DAY

           Ellie scrubs bike grease from her hands. 

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “...Well, you are surprising.”

           Door opens.

           Through the MIRROR:

           TWO QUADDIE GIRLS enter stalls.

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #1
                        The one in Tukwila has a Gap Body.

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #2
                        I LOVE Gap Body!

           Ellie can’t quite get the grease out of her nails.

           Door SWISHES. ASTER HAS ENTERED. She moves to the back wall, 
           where she leans, waiting for a stall. 

           Her eyes meet Ellie’s through the mirror. Ellie’s snap down.

           Aster takes in the back of Ellie. The wiry frame. Keys 
           CLIPPED to belt loop. INK STAIN through back pocket.

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #2 (CONT’D)
                        ... it has like 15 dressing rooms.

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #1
                        It’s totes the better Gap.

           On Ellie face: puzzled. Is this how normal girls talk? 

           Aster smiles. Ellie blushes. The two girls share a moment.

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #1 (CONT’D)
                        Trev checked in at Dick’s Burgers!

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #2
                        Aster is so lucky.
                                 QUADDIE GIRL #1
                        Totes lucky. His family owns half 
                        of Squahamish.

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #2
                        Hers doesn’t even own their house.

           Aster, red-faced, slips out of the bathroom.

           Ellie watches her go. Turns to look at the stalls.

           DUAL FLUSHES.

           Close on the STALL DOOR HINGE being shifted with a BIKE TOOL. 

           MOMENTS LATER

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #2 (CONT’D)
                        HEY. What’s wrong with this door??

           The stall doors rattle, unyielding.

                                 QUADDIE GIRL #1
                        What the--? HEY!

           Rattle, rattle, rattle...

           EXT. OUTSIDE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ellie slips out of the bathroom.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “What’s surprising is: people don’t 
                        see what they’re not looking for.”

           She merges anonymously into the fray... walking right through 
           Aster casting a furtive glance across the hall at Paul.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “The obvious unseen.”

           RECORD SCRATCH as ELLIE IS SUDDENLY YANKED INTO...

           INT. MRS. G'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           ...a classroom. She looks blankly at Mrs. G... who holds up a 
           trampled stray page of a LETTER. Guilt floods Ellie’s face.

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Mrs. G stares at Ellie, post-confession.
                                 MRS G
                        Ellie. What you’re doing is wrong.

                                 ELLIE
                        I know.

                                 MRS G
                        This is a girl’s heart you’re 
                        playing with. Not just a money-
                        making venture for you. 

           Ellie looks away... and Mrs. G sees the truth. More gently:

                                 MRS G (CONT’D)
                        I wondered why all the rich kids’ 
                        essays got so bad all of a sudden.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’ll be back to my usual business 
                        soon enough. I mean this can’t go 
                        on much longer.

           She slinks out. Mrs. G watches her go, concerned.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “I’ve been thinking about what you 
                        said about ‘seeing’ and ‘not 
                        seeing.’”

           INT. VIOLA'S - DAY

           Aster waits on a table of demanding customers at an upscale 
           restaurant. She is accommodating, poised.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “I had a painting teacher once tell 
                        me that the difference between a 
                        ‘good’ painting and a ‘great’ 
                        painting...”

           While the customers bicker, her eyes land on a painting on 
           the wall: a reproduction of Klimt’s ”The Maiden.”

           Her eyes take in the artistry of the painting.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “...is typically five strokes. And 
                        they are usually the five boldest 
                        strokes in the painting. The 
                        question of course...”

           We see a touch of longing in her gaze.
                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “Is which five strokes?”

           CLOSE ON THE PAINTING.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “I get it.”

           PULL OUT TO SEE: Ellie - in her token booth - staring at the 
           same painting on her phone screen.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “After one’s slaved away at making 
                        a “pretty good” painting, the last 
                        thing you’d want to do is...”

           The SOUND of a HUGE RIP...

           EXT. MUNSKY SAUSAGE SHOP - BACK ENTRANCE - DAY

           ...OF A BURLAP SACK as raw sausages pour out.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “...make a BOLD STROKE and 
                        potentially...”

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “...ruin everything. That’s why I 
                        gave up painting.”

           Wider to reveal THE SACK BEING RIPPED BY PAUL. 

           Next to him, ELLIE HOLDS UP HER PHONE displaying an IMAGE OF 
           THE PAINTING, explaining.

           Paul wipes sweat off his puzzled brow.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “Still... I wonder if that is how 
                        I’m living my life.”

           INT. CARSON GRAVEL SHOWROOM - DAY

           ASTER writes a letter, in the folds of her hymnal.

                        “It’s a ‘pretty good’ life.”

                        Babe? Which one.
           Trevor holds up two very similar jean jackets. A photo shoot 
           for a Carson Gravel ad campaign awaits him.

                                 TREVOR (CONT’D)
                        Right one, right? Great.

           Aster goes back to her letter.

           In the background, Trevor throws an arm around his dad.

           PHOTO FLASH.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

           FLASH of WHITE as a FREEZER DRAWER opens.

           Ellie considers a BEEF PIE and a CHICKEN PIE. Beef... or 
           Chicken.

                                 ELLIE (V.O.)
                        “Perhaps. But how well do you 
                        really know Squahamish...?”

           EXT. SIDE OF AL’S BIG BEEFY - AFTERNOON

           Aster rounds the corner, tentative. Consults A LETTER with 
           geographic coordinates.

           CRAPPY GRAFFITI lines the side wall of Al’s Big Beefy. 

           Up high, in freshly sprayed BIG BOLD LETTERS:

           “ANY FIVE STROKES...”

           An ARROW points toward the expanse of graffitied wall. 
           Another points to a CAN OF SPRAY PAINT hidden in the weeds.

           Aster laughs. A cautious glance around... she PICKS UP the 
           can and SPRAYS ONE BOLD STROKE. Exhilarated. Sneaks away.

                                 ASTER (V.O.)
                        “...Your move...”

           Dissolve to ELLIE now SPRAYING ANOTHER STROKE... 

           Alternate between the two...

                        “And thus was abstract art born.”

           Aster is startled... and takes off running. BIG BEEFY AL runs 
           into frame, shaking his fist.

           Dissolve into the wall NOW PAINTED GREY.

           Bzzz. Aster glances down at her phone.

           INSERT: MESSAGE FROM TREVOR: “Don’t let me eat carbs today”

           Aster deliberates. Clicks IGNORE.

                        “...you’ll never know if you could

                        So when does the “dating” start?

                                 ELLIE
                        (a little dreamy) This is dating.

                        No, dating is... BURGERS. And 
                        FRIES. And SHAKES. And maybe 
                        ANOTHER ORDER of FRIES. And... I’m 
                        gonna text her.

           Sound of a TEXT SENDING. Startling Ellie.

           Ellie grabs Paul’s phone.

           EXT. COWFIELD - SAME TIME

           On ASTER’S PHONE: 
           “[A BURGER, FRIES, SHAKE and another FRIES emoji] tonite? I 
           have [truck emoji]! [smiley emoji]!” 

           Aster stares at her phone. She is flanked by Quaddie Girls 
           cheering on their boyfriends...

           Who are “mudding” their trucks through a HUGE MUD PUDDLE.

           BACK TO ELLIE/PAUL AT SAUSAGE SHOP:

           Ellie and Paul stare at his phone. “Thinking” dots appear.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh my god.

           “Thinking dots” disappear.

           Paul hurls a GARBAGE CAN to the ground. 

                                 PAUL
                        GODDAMN IT.

           Ellie starts typing.

                                 ELLIE
                        (writing aloud) “Sorry. My little 
                        sis hacked into my phone. Can we 
                        take this onto a safer platform? 
                        Kik Messenger? My handle’s.... 
                        SmithCorona.”

           Thinking dots reappear.

                                 PAUL
                        Who’s Smith Corona?

                                 ELLIE
                        Some guy.

           Dots disappear. 

                                 PAUL
                        Crap!

           BACK TO COWFIELD:

           A TRUCK STUCK in the mud, wheels spinning.

                                 TREVOR
                        I’M KING OF THE MUD! Babe! Did you 
                        get that? Caption it MUDDING KING!

           Off Aster’s face, considering...
           BACK TO THE SAUSAGE SHOP:

           DING. From Ellie’s bookbag.

           Ellie and Paul scramble for Ellie’s phone.

           ELLIE’S SCREEN:

           StarFlower: “Does the burger offer still stand?”

                           ELLIE
                                                          PAUL
           YES!
                                              YESSSSS!

           Paul chest bumps the wall.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        We did it!

           Off Ellie’s face realizing: Paul is going on this date.

           EXT. WALLY’S DINER - EVENING

           A truck pulls into the parking lot of a small-town diner.

                                 ELLIE (OVER PHONE)
                        She prefers abstract to 
                        representational. And if she brings 
                        up Remains of the Day, talk about 
                        how the movie loses out by not 
                        spending more time on the Nazis--

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Relax, I got this.

                                 ELLIE (OVER PHONE)
                        But--

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        It’s a date, not a book report.

           INT. WALLY’S DINER - EVENING

           Aster slides a copy of REMAINS OF THE DAY across the booth.

                                 ASTER
                        I got two of them signed when he 
                        came to Powell’s books last year. I 
                        drove all night to get there.

           Her face is lit, shy, expectant.
                                 PAUL
                        Oh. Uh. Super cool!

                                 ASTER
                        You’ve probably read it. But I 
                        thought you’d like one.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Totally. I love... Nazis!

           Aster is confused.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I mean the ones in the book.

           Close on his phone in his lap, connected to...

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - TICKET BOOTH - SAME TIME

           ...Ellie’s phone. Ellie listens, horrified.

                                 PAUL (OVER PHONE)
                        More of those Nazis, am I right?

           She groans.

           BACK TO DINER:

           Milkshakes arrive. Paul sips, nervously.

           Aster, flustered, tries again. 

                                 ASTER
                        Speaking of Nazis, thanks for 
                        meeting me here. My dad is... not a 
                        Nazi exactly... but he can be a 
                        little strict. And people talk.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh. Yeah. Talk. UGH.

           Silence.

                                 ASTER
                        But it’s nice to make a new friend.

                                 PAUL
                        Friend. Yeah. Good.

           He has sucked down his milkshake. Toys with the straw.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        They use ReddiWhip.
                                 ASTER
                        Oh.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s from a can. But it’s okay.

           More silence. Awkward. So awkward.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - TICKET BOOTH - SAME TIME

           It’s all over Ellie’s face: this is a disaster.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN - EARLY MORNING

           Ellie bikes up the hill, Paul trying to catch up.

                                 PAUL
                        It wasn’t that bad.

                                 ELLIE
                        What about that date wasn’t bad? 
                        You have nothing in common-

                                 PAUL
                        Not yet but-

                                 ELLIE
                        Game over.

                                 PAUL
                        We can’t give up-

           Paul has in fact given up and is heaving behind some shrubs.

                                 ELLIE
                        Look. You and Aster Flores? NOT 
                        GONNA HAPPEN.

           HOOONK. The truck of OBNOXIOUS TEENS cruises by.

                                 OBNOXIOUS TEENS
                        (heckling) CHUGGA CHUGGA CHUGGA, 
                        CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA... CHIU CHIU!

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        HEY!

           Paul jumps out from the side of the road and STARTS CHASING 
           AFTER THE TRUCK.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Who you calling Choo-Choo?
           Obnoxious Teens freeze.

                                 ELLIE
                        (embarrassed) Paul, let it go...

                                 PAUL
                        What kind of wusses say dumb stuff 
                        then drive away? I’M GONNA GET YOU!

           They tear off, shakily, Paul bearing down on them.

           He hurls a rock. From far off: “OW!”

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        YOU BETTER RUN!

           Turns back to see Ellie staring at him.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        WHAT?

           Her eyes wide as saucers.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - EARLY EVENING

           Ellie patches some wires in the signal panel. Paul hovers.

                                 ELLIE
                        Aster Flores thinks you’re into 
                        abstract art... and repressed 
                        British literature and-

                                 PAUL
                        Cool!

                                 ELLIE
                        None of that is you.

                                 PAUL
                        It could be. I started reading that 
                        Remains of the Day book.

                                 ELLIE
                        Really?

                                 PAUL
                        Fell asleep a few times... but I’m 
                        still reading it! That’s gotta 
                        count for something.

                                 ELLIE
                        There are no points for effort.
                                 PAUL
                        Why not? Isn’t that what love is? 
                        The effort you put into loving 
                        someone?

           Is that true?

                                 ELLIE
                        Well, whatever love is... we just 
                        blew it with Aster Flores.

           DING. On Ellie’s phone, A MESSAGE:

           “Starflower: So that was... weird?”

                                 PAUL
                        YESSS! (then to Ellie) I can do 
                        this. We can do this.

           He wants this so bad...

                                 ELLIE
                        (sighs) Okay.

           Joy floods Paul’s face.

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll pay you double.

                                 ELLIE
                        You don’t have to pay me.

                                 PAUL
                        Don’t be weird! Why else would you 
                        do this? I got savings!

           Off Ellie’s conflicted expression...

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - TICKET BOOTH - EARLY MORNING

           Ellie draws A GAME PLAN on A WHITE BOARD in her ticket booth. 
           Paul outside the booth, jogging in place.

                                 ELLIE
                        Your next date is two weeks away.

                                 PAUL
                        Two weeks?

                                 ELLIE
                        You told her you’re slammed with 
                        football training.
                                 PAUL
                        I did?

                                 ELLIE
                        Yes. Also you’re in a debate on 
                        who’s the better Hepburn-

                                 EDWIN (O.S.)
                        WHO THERE?

           From the APARTMENT WINDOW ABOVE, Edwin wields a kitchen 
           sprayer.

                                 ELLIE
                        Sorry to wake you, Baba. School 
                        project.

                                 PAUL
                        Hi Ellie Chiu’s dad!

           Edwin shoots Paul a suspicious glance. Retreats.

                                 ELLIE
                        (whispering) We don’t have time to 
                        school you on everything Aster 
                        thinks “you” are, so we have to be 
                        selective. Deep vs. broad-based 
                        learning.

                                 PAUL
                        Hunh?

                                 ELLIE
                        We spy on her, then cram you on her 
                        Greatest Hits.

                                 PAUL
                        (loud whisper) Oh. Cool.

                                 ELLIE
                        Are you ready for this?

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.

                                 ELLIE
                        ARE you READY For This?

                                 PAUL
                        YES! SIR YES SIR!

                                 ELLIE
                        Ssshh! So in No Exit, three people 
                        are trapped in hell...
           Cue “Rocky”-themed training MONTAGE MUSIC...

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN - MORNING

           Paul jogs alongside Ellie on her bike.

                                 PAUL
                        That’s nuts. He can’t stand these 
                        people, a door opens for him to 
                        leave - but he doesn’t leave?

                                 ELLIE
                        He’s trapped in hell. It’s a 
                        metaphor for existence.

                                 PAUL
                        My Nana hated Minnesota. She left.

                                 ELLIE
                        Your Nana is not one of the great

                        My Nana’s not trapped in hell 
                        either!

           Ellie groans and pedals faster.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Where you going?

           He picks up the pace...

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - TRACK - AFTERNOON

           ...until he is now running on the track, passing teammates 
           left and right. 

                                 COACH
                        What the hell’s gotten into Munsky?

           Paul breaks into the lead. Under his breath:

                                 PAUL
                        SAR-TREE... SAR-TRA... SARTRE! VAN

           CLOSEUP: ELLIE’S HAND UNDERLINES “HEPBURN” ON A WHITEBOARD
           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EVENING

           Edwin alone in his La-Z-Boy. An untouched pot pie next to 
           Ellie’s lounger. THE PHILADELPHIA STORY plays on TV:

                                 JOHN HOWARD/GEORGE KITTREDGE (ON TV)
                        “You’re like some marvelous, 
                        distant, well, queen...”

           He shoots a glance toward the window.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - TICKET BOOTH - SAME TIME

           Outside, the same scene plays on Ellie’s laptop. 

           Ellie, in booth, draws a diagram with “Katherine Hepburn” in 
           the middle; “Cary Grant”, “Jimmy Stewart” and “John Howard” 
           surround her. Paul eats a sausage, outside the booth.

                                 KATHERINE HEPBURN/TRACY LORD (ON TV)
                        “I don’t want to be worshipped. I 
                        want to be loved.”

                                 ELLIE
                        The key thing about “The 
                        Philadelphia Story” is that it’s a 
                        plea for tolerance...

                                 PAUL
                        Check this out. 

           He holds up a sausage wrapped in a corn tortilla.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I’m calling it “Taco Sausage.” 
                        Wanna bite?

           She raps his knuckles with her marker.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

                                 ELLIE
                        Pay attention! So tolerance...

                                 PAUL
                        Two hand foods. One great taste!

           Angle on EDWIN peering down at them from the window.

                        Conversation is like ping pong. I 
                        hit one, then you--

           Paul SLAMS the ball back. It flies wildly.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        WHAT THE--?

           Pan the anxious faces of Quaddie Girls... to land on Aster.

           Pull back to reveal PAUL seated with TEAM DUDES... further 
           still to ELLIE, in back row alone, taking notes.

           The SLASHING HAPPENS! Girls SCREAM! Aster GUFFAWS!

           Paul and Ellie lock eyes, excited. More data!

                                 PAUL

           He turns back.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN - MORNING

           In the distance: Ellie on her bike quizzes Paul, jogging  
           alongside. Two distant specks headed toward CAMERA.
           INT. PHARMACY

           ASTER drops a TUBE OF TOOTHPASTE in her cart and moves on. 
           ELLIE and PAUL’S HEADS poke around the aisle.

           Brandishing a marker, Ellie maps out a “GOOD COP/BAD COP” 
           interrogation scene for a confused Paul.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - HALLWAY SIDE ROOM

           Ellie and Paul usher Trevor into a closet off the hallway.

                                 ELLIE
                        We’re writing a profile on the 
                        student we most admire!

           This checks out for Trevor.

                                 TREVOR
                        Cool, cool.

                           ELLIE
                                                          PAUL
                                              Does Aster like tacos?
           So what are your views on 
           women in the workplace?

           Ellie and Paul confer sotto voce behind Trevor’s back.

                                 ELLIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 PAUL
                        What are you doing?

                                 ELLIE
                        I’m good cop.
                                 PAUL
                        If you’re good cop, how come you’re 
                        not smiling?

                                 ELLIE
                        I’ll SMILE when you follow the plan 
                        I CAREFULLY--

                                 TREVOR
                        (thinking aloud) I’m surprised more 
                        kids haven’t asked to interview me.

           An oblivious Trevor stares at his reflection.

                                 PAUL
                        Ooo, can I play good cop now?

           Ellie sighs.

           Ellie listens to the game. Pumps her fist. Gets a text from 
           Aster: “Cute smile.” Bittersweet. 

           End TRAINING MONTAGE MUSIC.

           EXT. OUTSIDE FLORES HOME - EVENING

           Through a large dining room window: the Flores’ at dinner. 

           Across the way, inside THE CAB OF A TRUCK, Ellie and Paul are 
           on a “stakeout.” Ellie takes notes. Paul’s stomach GROWLS.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re not hungry?

                                 ELLIE
                        Not if it’s not time to eat.

                                 PAUL
                        That’s weird.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW: The Deacon says a loooong grace. Mrs. 
           Flores notices Aster’s collar is askew. Aster adjusts it. 
           Mrs. Flores winks at her daughter.

           Ellie’s face shows a touch of yearning. Paul sees it.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 ELLIE
                        I don’t want to try a taco sausage.

                                 PAUL
                        Why Squahamish?

           Ellie looks at Paul. What kind of question is that?

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Your dad seems so unhappy here. And 
                        you also seem kinda unhappy.

           Ellie unbuckles her seat belt.

                                 ELLIE
                        I gotta go.
                                 PAUL
                        Wait--

                                 ELLIE
                        You’re not taking this seriously, I 
                        have a ton of work to do--

                                 PAUL
                        I just think you’re so, like, 
                        smart, too smart to--

                                 ELLIE
                        ...waste my time trying to win you 
                        some girl who’ll probably never--

                                 PAUL
                        ...it just seems weird--

                                 ELLIE
                        ...You’re weird!

                                 PAUL
                        ...No, I mean, yes--

                                 ELLIE
                        Enjoy your “happy” life in 
                        Squahamish!

           She’s about to slam the truck door. Paul springs across the 
           front seat, catches the door before it closes.

                                 PAUL
                        The thing about No Exit is it’s 
                        like how what I really want is to 
                        run my own shop - one with new 
                        recipes - and FYI, “TACO SAUSAGE” 
                        IS REALLY EFFIN GOOD - but I’m just 
                        the fourth son, and my family has 
                        made the same dogs for 49 years, 
                        and doesn’t matter that we’re going 
                        out of style or broke - it’s Nana’s 
                        recipe, and if my Ma can’t have her 
                        Nana, at least she can keep making 
                        her sausages, and if I break away, 
                        I’d break her heart, and it’s her 
                        heart or mine so... I stay.

           Paul is breathless. It’s more words than he’s ever said.

           Ellie slowly gets back into the truck. Exhales.

                                 ELLIE
                        We had to go where my dad could get 
                        a job. 
                                 PAUL
                        He studied trains?

                                 ELLIE
                        Engineering. PhD, no less.

                                 PAUL
                        So he became... the Station Manager 
                        at Squahamish?

                                 ELLIE
                        To start. Plan was to be promoted 
                        to “System Engineer” or... anything 
                        “Engineer”. Squahamish was a 
                        jumping off point. (beat) Turns out 
                        speaking good English trumps a PhD. 
                        Or one from China, anyway. And my 
                        dad...

                                 PAUL
                        Has a hard time speaking.

                                 ELLIE
                        (bristling) He’s not bad.

                                 PAUL
                        I have a hard time speaking too.

           They watch the Flores family start dessert.

                                 ELLIE
                        True. What’s your excuse?

           Tension broken. Paul grins. He starts the engine.

                                 PAUL
                        How do you feel about pot roast?

                                 ELLIE
                        I should get back to the station.

                                 PAUL
                        We gotta eat.

           Ellie’s stomach GROWLS.

           INT. MUNSKY DINING ROOM - EVENING

           It’s mayhem. The six members of Paul’s family: COLLEEN (MA), 
           BILL (PA), brothers GREG, PETE, TOMMY, and sister LENA 
           function like one chaotic organism. 

           Paul and Ellie stand off to the side, unnoticed.

                        afford to move out and pay rent!

           Ellie glances at Paul.

                                 ELLIE
                        Half a chicken pie?

                                 PAUL
                        Yup.

           They slip out.

           Cue opening strains of GUITAR SOLO (tentative title “Life Is 
           As Sweet as It Can Be.”)

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EVENING

           Ellie in her La-Z-Boy, pot pie in hand, eyes glued nervously 
           to the TV. (On screen: another classic. “City Lights?”)  

           Widen to reveal Paul CURLED ON THE FLOOR next to her, also 
           eating a pot pie.

           Widen further to reveal EDWIN, in his La-Z-Boy, glaring.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN - MORNING

           Ellie biking at 75% speed with Paul keeping up.
           INT. SHITTY REC ROOM SOMEWHERE - DAY

           We’re back at the ping pong table.

                                 ELLIE
                        Match energy. Match strokes. Then 
                        just say one thing.

           Paul nods, deliberate and slow. Ellie serves.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Where were you born?

           Paul hits the ball back, gently.

                                 PAUL
                        Here in Squahamish. What about you?

                                 ELLIE
                        Okay good! That wasn’t so hard!

                                 PAUL
                        But where were you born?

                                 ELLIE
                        I don’t need talking practice.

                                 PAUL
                        Just seems like a really short 
                        conversation.

           Damn. He has a point.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        I was born in Suzhou. China.

                                 PAUL
                        When did you come here?

                                 ELLIE
                        At five. What do you like about 
                        Squahamish?

                                 PAUL
                        I’ve never been anywhere else.

           Beat.

                                 ELLIE
                        Me neither.

           The ball continues between them.
           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EVENING

           Back in the apartment watching another classic film. 

           Paul offers Edwin and Ellie a taco sausage. They decline.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

           Ellie is at the piano while the Deacon delivers a homily.

           Father Shanley awakes with a jerk.

                                 FATHER SHANLEY
                        OUTSIDE ARE THE DOGS AND THE 
                        SORCERERS--

           Aster’s mouth twitches upward. Ellie smiles.

           Aster turns to look at Paul... who breaks into a goofy smile.

           Ellie’s eyes drop to the piano keys.

           INT. MRS. G’S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           Ellie tries to avoid Mrs. G’s gaze on her way out. Then turns 
           back.

                                 ELLIE
                        You know what it’s like to finally 
                        meet someone your age who gets you?

           Ellie slinks out.

           INT. CONFESSION BOOTH - AFTERNOON

           Ellie and Paul back in the booth, arguing.

                                 PAUL
                        You should send some emojis!

                                 ELLIE
                        I’m not sending her emojis!

                                 PAUL
                        Oh! Do Pineapple, Owl, Caterpillar 
                        with glasses!

                                 ELLIE
                        What does that MEAN? That doesn’t 
                        mean ANYTHING!

                                 PAUL
                        Glasses make the caterpillar look 
                        smart!

           This deep debate rings out over the empty chapel.

                        Favorite food?

                                 ELLIE
                        Braised pork over rice. Yours? Let 
                        me guess...

                           PAUL
                                                     ELLIE (CONT'D)
           Taco sausage!
                                              Taco sausage.
                                 PAUL
                        Does braised pork have five-spice 
                        powder?

                                 ELLIE
                        How do you know five-spice powder?

                                 PAUL
                        Kinda creeped in your cabinets.

           Ellie shoots him a look.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I’m always looking for new spices.

                                 ELLIE
                        Giving up on the taco sausage?

                                 PAUL
                        No way! I’ve been writing to the 
                        paper in Wenatchee for months now. 
                        If I could just them to taste it...

                                 ELLIE
                        Wenatchee’s lips to God’s ears.

                                 PAUL
                        I hope so. You gotta try it!

                                 ELLIE
                        What does your family think?

                                 PAUL
                        They haven’t tried it.

           She sees he’s bummed.

                                 ELLIE
                        “Taco sausage” has a nice ring.

                                 PAUL
                        Right?

           He brightens. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

                                 ELLIE
                        Yeah?

                                 PAUL
                        What was your mom like?
           Beat.

                                 ELLIE
                        Young. Funny. Dead.

                                 PAUL
                        Before she died.

                                 ELLIE
                        Young. Funny. (beat) Fun.

           Paul’s listening intently.

                                 PAUL
                        She sounds cool.

                                 ELLIE
                        She was the light in our family.

           Now Ellie’s embarrassed. 

                                 PAUL
                        Bet she would have tried the taco 
                        sausage.

           Back to convo lessons.

                                 ELLIE
                        What do you like about Aster?
                                 PAUL
                        She’s pretty and smart and she’s 
                        never mean and she smells like 
                        fresh ground flour. Why?

                                 ELLIE
                        Just wondering.

                        Why else could I like her?

                                 ELLIE
                        I don’t know. (thinking) How her 
                        eyes look right into yours... How 
                        she twirls her hair when she’s

                        stops being so... PERFECT for just 
                        a few moments. How she has at least 
                        five different voices. How you 
                        could live in an ocean of her 
                        thoughts  and feel like she knows 
                        you, like really KNOWS--

           Ellie stops mid-sentence. Paul is staring at her.

                                 PAUL
                        I am so stupid.

                                 ELLIE
                        (nervously) I just mean-

                                 PAUL
                        I am so dumb. A real dummy.

                                 ELLIE
                        I mean, don’t think I actually-

                                 PAUL
                        What you just said? That’s what you 
                        say when you love someone.

                                 ELLIE
                        No! I was just talking-

                                 PAUL
                        No, it is. And you don’t even care! 
                        I love her and I can’t... UGH!

           He slams his paddle onto the table. Ellie exhales in relief. 
           Then realizes: Paul’s miserable. 
                                 ELLIE
                        You try harder than anyone I’ve 
                        ever met - with the possible 
                        exception of my dad with my mom - 
                        to show a girl you love them... And 
                        if love isn’t the effort you put 
                        in: then what is it?

           Paul looks up.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah?

                                 ELLIE

           Sound of a TOASTER OVEN DOOR OPENING.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EVENING

           CLOSE ON PAUL’S HAND pulling out three broiled sausages.

           Everyone in their respective positions in front of the TV. 
           Each with a “taco sausage” before them.

           Ellie watches Edwin glare at his sausage, take the tiniest 
           bite... His brows shoot up. He takes another.

           Ellie, now curious, bites into her sausage. Eyes widen.

                                 ELLIE
                        This is... insanely delicious.

           Paul’s face breaks into smile of unbearable sweetness.

           LATER:

           Edwin has fallen asleep.

           Ellie and Paul, still watching TV, drink Yakults.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you know Yakult.

                                 PAUL
                        They sell ‘em for a quarter in the

                                 ELLIE

                        so my dad can cook real food for a 
                        couple nights.

           Paul shoots her a thoughtful glance.

           ON THE TV: A train pulls out of a station.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        (to TV) Do not run after her train. 
                        Do NOT... Do NOT... Ugh.

                                 PAUL
                        It’s sweet.

                        It’s trite.

                                 PAUL
                        It shows he cares.

                                 ELLIE
                        It shows he’s a moron. Who outruns 
                        trains? Bet that girl’s thinking: 
                        thank god I got away before wasting 
                        my life on that idiot.

           Beat.

                                 PAUL
                        She looks sad.

                                 ELLIE
                        Then she’s a moron too.

           Paul sniffles.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - TICKET BOOTH - LATE NIGHT

           INSERT: ELLIE’S SCREEN:

           MESSAGE FROM smithcorona: “No secrets. Am just a good guy... 
           And you should be with a good guy.”

           The song “Life Is as Sweet as It Can Be” wraps up...

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - ELLIE'S ATTIC BEDROOM - NIGHT

           ... as we reveal that it’s Ellie singing the song, playing 
           her mom’s old guitar.

           The last bars drift out her window to...
           EXT. MUNSKY SAUSAGE SHOP - BACK ENTRANCE - SAME TIME

           ...the back of Munsky Sausage Shop, where Paul has stopped 
           garbage duty to look up and listen. Moved.

           The song ends.

           The light in Ellie’s window goes off.

           EXT. WALLY’S DINER - EVENING

           Paul’s truck is in the parking lot.

           IN THE TRUCK

           Paul toys nervously with the zipper on his down vest.

           Sound of a BIKE SCREECH outside.

           Ellie throws herself into the cab, breathless.

                                 ELLIE
                        Sorry, mandatory meeting about 
                        Senior Recital. I’m a little, like 
                        a lot, freaking out about it, but 
                        whatever. Okay. ASTER. If she 
                        brings up immigration, you’ve been 
                        talking about the recent--

                                 PAUL
                        I know.

                                 ELLIE
                        When in doubt, if the name is 
                        Italian, probably an artist, if 
                        French, probably a--

                                 PAUL
                        Hey.

           What?

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh. Sure.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m probably gonna crash and burn. 
                        But thanks for sticking it out with 
                        me anyway.
                                 ELLIE
                        Well. Not like you didn’t pay me.

                                 PAUL
                        Well. Thanks.

           Paul starts to go.

                                 ELLIE
                        Hey.

           What?

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not gonna crash and burn.

           She gives him a thumbs up. His face lights into a huge grin.

           He’s gone. She exhales anxiously.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        You’re totally gonna crash and 
                        burn.

           She starts worrying the zipper on her down vest.

           INT. DICK'S DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Paul sits across from Aster. It’s awkward.

                           ASTER
                                                          PAUL
           So I was wondering--
                                              How about that immigration 
                                              bill--

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, go ahead.

                                 ASTER
                        No, you.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh uh. The immigration bill?

                                 ASTER
                        Un hunh?

                                 PAUL
                        Uh. Right?

                                 ASTER
                        (confused) Right?
                                 PAUL
                        Yup.

           They lapse into silence.

           INTERCUT WITH THE CAB OF PAUL’S TRUCK

           The conversation plays over Ellie’s phone, linked to Paul’s.

                                 ELLIE
                        Come on, Paul.

           BACK TO THE DINER

           The waitress drops off their order.

                                 ASTER
                        We don’t have to talk about... 
                        serious things.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh. Okay.

           More silence.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        What were you about to say?

                                 ASTER
                        Oh, uh. It’s still cool that 
                        we’re... friends?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah. Cool. Friends.

           Now even more awkward.

           BACK TO THE TRUCK

           Ellie pulls out her phone.

           BACK TO THE DINER

           Bzzz. Aster looks at her phone.

                                 ASTER
                        Oh. You messaged me.

                                 PAUL
                        (confused) ...Yup.

           ON ASTER’S PHONE: Message from smithcorona: “I get nervous 
           when you’re close.”
           Aster looks back at Paul. Smiles.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Yup...?

           While Aster’s head is buried in her phone, Paul peers out at 
           Ellie, mimes: What is going on? 

           ON PAUL’S PHONE: Message from Ellie: “Pretend to be on your 
           phone.”

           The next series of messages appear as chat bubbles super-
           imposed on the screen.

           ASTER/STARFLOWER: “I’m just a girl.”

                    ELLIE/SMITHCORONA: “You’re not just a girl.”

           ASTER/STARFLOWER: “What are you?”

                    ELLIE/SMITHCORONA: “Also... not just a girl.” 

           Aster laughs. Looks up at Paul.

           He gives her a wide, goofy smile. And a thumbs up.

           Aster’s not sure how to react.

           Ellie groans.

           ASTER/STARFLOWER: “You’re strange. But cute”

           Ellie is out of her depth.

                    ELLIE/SMITHCORONA: “You have...” (pause) “really 
           classic bone structure.”

           Aster’s lips twitch up.

           ASTER/STARFLOWER: “... Thanks.”

           Ellie flushes. She tries again.

                    ELLIE/SMITHCORONA: “I think you are...”

           She deletes it.

                    ELLIE/SMITHCORONA: “You are...”

           Delete. She takes a breath.

                    ELLIE/SMITHCORONA: “What I mean to say is...”
           BACK IN THE DINER

           Paul can take it no longer... and STANDS. Flushed with 
           conviction.

           Aster looks up from her screen, startled.

           BACK IN THE TRUCK

                                 ELLIE
                        What?? No! BAD. Sit!

           BACK IN THE DINER

                                 PAUL
                        I don’t want to be just friends.

                                 ASTER
                        Oh!

           The whole diner’s watching.

                                 PAUL
                        I think you are pretty and funny 
                        and smart and your laugh is like... 
                        an ocean of thoughts... or five 
                        oceans of thoughts... or five 
                        voices or...  (exhales) I LIKE YOU.

                                 ASTER
                        (flushed) I don’t know what to say.

                                 PAUL
                        Me neither. I’m not a good talker.

           He’s so earnest. She smiles.

                                 ASTER
                        That’s okay.

           He reaches for her hand. She lets him.

           BACK TO THE TRUCK:

           Ellie slips out of the truck. Her work is done here.

                                                              PULL OUT:

           EXT. ROAD BACK TO SQUAHAMISH - NIGHT

           We follow her tiny bike light as it heads into the night.
           INT. CLOTHESTOWN - DAY

           A jubilant Paul high fives MANNEQUINS.

                                 PAUL
                        What up haters! Who rocked their 
                        second date? #86 Pauuuul MUNSKY!

           Ellie picks through a row of ON SALE CARDIGANS. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        And now his best girl is gonna rock 
                        THE SENIOR RECITAL!

                                 ELLIE
                        It’s a piano solo.

           She pulls a cardigan over her hoodie.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re gonna be AWESOME!

                                 ELLIE
                        I’m gonna be puking.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re always playing for an 
                        audience.

                                 ELLIE
                        On the side. Not on stage. Alone.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re gonna crush it. OH. Did I 
                        tell you that some food guy from 
                        the paper in Tukwila wrote me? He 
                        musta heard about me from the guy 
                        in Wenatchee. He says he likes how 
                        I described my sausage and wants to 
                        try it! Boom! It’s Munsky time!

           He shadow boxes... anything. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Hey! Look at you.

           She pulls a pleated skirt over her jeans.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        So... what did you and Aster talk 
                        about?
                                 PAUL
                        I dunno. We got milkshakes and 
                        fries and held hands and it was... 
                        quiet and... nice.

           He relives that moment.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Then she had curfew so we walked to 
                        her car... and I kissed her.

           Ellie fiddles with a zipper.

                                 ELLIE
                        How does that happen?

                                 PAUL
                        What?

                                 ELLIE
                        The kiss.

                                 PAUL
                        (shrugs) I kissed her.

                                 ELLIE
                        You don’t ask first?

                                 PAUL
                        No one asks first.

                                 ELLIE
                        Then how do you know she wants to 
                        be kissed?

                                 PAUL
                        (thinks) She gives you a look.

                                 ELLIE
                        A look?

           He fixes Ellie with a “look.” She is confused.

                                 PAUL
                        (sighs) It’s a LOOK. And when you 
                        see the look? You make your move... 
                        or you come off like a real putz.

           This is Greek to Ellie.
                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        And now we’re going out on a date 
                        date - not a friend date - when she 
                        gets back from some youth group in 
                        Sacramento!

           He reaches out for a high-five. Notices her motley outfit. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        There are dressing rooms, you know.

                                 ELLIE
                        I’ll just get this.

                                 PAUL
                        Really?

                                 ELLIE
                        Yeah?

           She sounds less certain than usual. Paul takes her in.

                                 PAUL
                        Without the jeans and flannel 
                        shirt... 

           Ellie straightens.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You look weird.

           She slumps.

                                 ELLIE
                        Gee thanks.

                                 PAUL
                        It just doesn’t look like you. All 
                        girl-ed up.

                                 ELLIE
                        I know.

           She’s deflated.

                                 PAUL
                        Go to the dressing room. I’ll toss 
                        you some things.

                                 ELLIE
                        You’re a dude-

                                 PAUL
                        I have a sister. Go.
           He starts browsing with intention.

           LATER

           Ellie comes out of the dressing room in a fitted blue shirt 
           and skinny slacks. She looks... good.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        (amazed) You look better than I 
                        thought you could.

                                 ELLIE
                        Gee. Thanks.

                                 PAUL
                        I mean you look like you. But 
                        better.

                                 ELLIE
                        Dreams do come true.

           Despite the snark, she seems... almost happy.

           Cue a rendition of “In Your Eyes” by Peter Gabriel...

           INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - ASSEMBLY HALL - EVENING

           ... played onstage by A TRIO of OBOES.

           FROM THE WINGS

           Ellie peeks out at the PACKED HOUSE of students and their 
           families. Every seat taken... save for two in the second row 
           marked “PARENTS OF ELLIE CHIU”.

                                 EMCEE
                        Well our next Senior needs no 
                        introduction!

           A chant picks up: “Trev! Trev! Trev!”...

           And with that, TREVOR IS ON STAGE, electric guitar flung over 
           his back, a BACKING BAND behind him.

                                 TREVOR
                        WHAT UP, SQUAHAMISH MOOSE!

           The crowd is on its feet.

                                 TREVOR (CONT’D)
                        YOU KNOW WHO I AM. I KNOW WHO I AM. 
                        LET’S DO THIS.
           He launches into a cover of “Bizarre Love Triangle”. It’s 
           terrible. The audience is enthralled.

           BACKSTAGE

           Ellie slumps at a piano. A STAGE MANAGER pokes her head in.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Ellie Chiu? You’re up next.

           Great. Ellie heads to the bathroom.

           The Obnoxious Bullies sneak in and fiddle with the piano.

           IN THE AUDITORIUM

           Paul slips in from the back, pulling off a Munsky Sausage 
           apron.

           To chants of TREV! TREV! TREV! Trevor strides off-stage with 
           his band... passing a lone Ellie, rolling her piano on.

                                 EMCEE
                        Next we have (consults sheet again) 
                        Ellie Chiu? Let’s give it up!

           FROM THE AUDIENCE

                                 OBNOXIOUS BULLIES
                        Chugga-chugga-chugga- CHIU CHIU!

           Paul glares into the crowd. Spies an empty seat.

           ONSTAGE

           Ellie looks out into the audience... just in time to see Paul 
           settling in her “parent’s” seat. Paul gives her a thumbs up. 

           She takes a breath. Starts to play. It is WILDLY DISCORDANT.

           She stops. THE PIANO IS HORRIBLY OUT OF TUNE.

           The Obnoxious Bullies cackle at their prank.

           The audience is restless. 

           Ellie is frozen.

                                 PAUL
                        Crap.

                                 BACKUP BAND DUDE
                        (catcalling) NEXT!
           Audience laughter. Paul glares at Backup Band Dude... Notices 
           his guitar.

           ONSTAGE

           Ellie gathers her sheet music and prepares to flee when A 
           GUITAR SLIDES ACROSS THE STAGE and STOPS IN FRONT OF HER.

           Paul gestures from the side: Play it.

           Ellie looks at the guitar. At the crowd. Back at Paul. 

           She sits down on the bench. Closes her eyes. Starts to play 
           “Life is As Sweet as It Can Be.” Her voice starts shaky... 
           then steadies... finishing pure and clear and strong.

           It is dead silent in the auditorium.

           AND THEN THE CROWD GOES WILD.

           Ellie is startled. What is happening?

           IN THE AUDIENCE

           Paul beams. Doesn’t even notice Trevor next to him.

                                 TREVOR
                        When did Ellie Chiu get kinda hot?

           Paul stares at Ellie. When indeed?

           ONSTAGE

           A flushed Ellie takes it all in.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - LATER

           A TRAIN whips past, leaving:

           Ellie holding the signal flag, still smiling.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey!

           Paul’s truck has pulled up, filled with friends.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Get in!

           Smiling people wave her over. Ellie deliberates.
           INT. CARSON MCMANSION - NIGHT

           A high school party in full swing.

           Ellie trails Paul’s crew, backpack squarely on shoulders.

                                 ONE PERSON
                        The Chinese girl came!

                                 RANDOM PARTY PEOPLE
                        CHINESE GIRL!

           Red Solo Party cups are raised.

           A GIRL FROM MATH CLASS runs up.

                                 GIRL IN MATH CLASS
                        Ellie Chiu! I just wanted to say 
                        that we’ve had math together all 
                        four years, and I’ve always wanted 
                        to tell you that I like your nails.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh. (embarrassed) Yeah, I can’t get 
                        the bike grease out.

                                 GIRL FROM MATH CLASS
                        They look badass! Want to play 
                        Drinkers from Catan?

                                 ELLIE
                        Sure?

                                 GIRL FROM MATH CLASS
                        It’s like Settlers but...

           She pulls Ellie into the fray. Ellie looks back at Paul, who 
           gives her a thumbs up.

           LATER

           Paul moves along the periphery, clearing stray cups and 
           trash, as he keeps on eye on ELLIE LAUGHING WITH HER PEERS, 
           having the time of her life. 

                                 ELLIE
                        I will trade you Wheat for Rye.

                                 SENIOR GUY
                        Bourbon it is.

           A senior guy hands Ellie a full cup. Paul intercepts.
                                 PAUL
                        Hey, thanks.

           Ellie gives him a hard look.

                                 ELLIE
                        I want you to know (pause) that I 
                        can tell I have been drinking 
                        spirits (pause). Because I have to 
                        pee far more often than would be 
                        indicated by plain punch. So don’t 
                        think I haven’t been monitoring the 
                        situation.

           Triumphant look.

                                 PAUL
                        Cool, cool. So how many cups have 
                        you monitored?

           Ummmmmmmm...

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Time to get you home.

                                 ELLIE
                        Okay.

           She throws up on him.

           INT. PAUL'S BASEMENT ROOM - LATER.

           A slightly disheveled basement repurposed as a boy’s room.

           We can hear Ellie and Paul’s voices coming from behind the 
           closed bathroom door. 

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        It’s okay.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        I think I’m done now.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Okay.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        No wait...
                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Okay.

           Beat.

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        I’m good.

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Okay.

           Bathroom door opens.

           Paul carries Ellie over his shoulder into the bedroom.

                                 ELLIE
                        Are you taking me home now?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah.

                                 ELLIE
                        Okay.

           She passes out.

           He lays her gently on the bed.

           Sets her backpack against the bed... out spills SEVERAL 
           SEALED LETTERS to various food critics around the state. 
           Addressed in “his” writing.

           Paul stares at the letters. Then at Ellie.

           He settles in an armchair in the corner, awake.

           Night falls.

           INT. PAUL'S BASEMENT - MORNING

           A ray of SUNSHINE lands on a sleeping Ellie. A muffled 
           BUZZING from her backpack. She stirs.

           On the bed stand, a full glass of water and two aspirin.

           She reaches for them.

           From upstairs:

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY (O.S.)
                        He’s at practice, but you can leave 
                        it in his room.
                                 ASTER (O.S.)
                        It’s just a silly thing I thought 
                        he’d like.

           Ellie does a SPIT TAKE.

           ON HER PHONE are FIVE UNREAD MESSAGES. The first: “Home early 
           from Sacramento. Walk tomorrow?”

           She falls out of bed in a frantic attempt to groom, clean, 
           calm herself because ASTER FLORES IS ON HER WAY DOWN.

           In her haste, she wakes Paul’s laptop, which starts playing 
           an episode of “The Family Guy.”

                                 ELLIE
                        Ugh.

           She can’t get it to stop.

           Above, a door opens. Colleen and Aster descend the stairs.

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY (O.S.)
                        ...we went as far as Sekiu once, 
                        but never made it all the way to 
                        California. You’re quite the world 
                        traveler!

           Colleen and Aster enter, just as Ellie manages to pause “The 
           Family Guy.”

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, it’s Paul’s Chinese friend! 
                        Didn’t hear you come in.

                                 ELLIE
                        Hi Mrs. Munsky. Just leaving some 
                        books...

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY
                        Aster is about to leave something 
                        too-

           A LOUD GRINDING FROM UPSTAIRS.

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY (CONT’D)
                        Tommy! Hands off the grinder!

           Colleen hustles back upstairs.

           Aster smiles, a bit guarded.

                                 ASTER
                        Hi.
                                 ELLIE
                        Hi.

                                 ASTER
                        So you and Paul-

           Paul’s laptop wakes - a particularly inane moment from “The 
           Family Guy” punctuates the silence.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        Is that “The Family Guy?”

                                 ELLIE
                        Yup. I was watching that.

                                 ASTER
                        Are you two...?

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh god no! No, no! He is totally 
                        one hundred percent into you!

                                 ASTER
                        (surprised) You know about us?

           Beat.

                                 ELLIE
                        He wanted to do some extra reading, 
                        so I lent him some books.

                                 ASTER
                        He’s doing extra reading?

                                 ELLIE
                        For you.

                                 ASTER
                        That’s... sweet. 

                                 ELLIE
                        It is.

           The tension is broken.

                                 ASTER
                        (confessing) On our first date, I 
                        kept talking about books... I think 
                        I almost drove him away. God, I can 
                        be such a nervous idiot.

           What?
                                 ELLIE
                        You could never be an idiot. I mean 
                        Paul would never think that. He’s 
                        way into you.

           Aster takes this in, smiling.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I should get back to the station.

           She notices a SMALL CANVAS PRINT in Aster’s hand.

                                 ASTER
                        (self-conscious) Just something 
                        silly I made on my trip.

           Ellie reaches for it. It’s reminiscent of the mural they 
           made. But clearly the stirrings of Aster’s own voice.

                                 ELLIE
                        I like this stroke off to the side. 
                        Lonely. And hopeful.

           Aster looks at her own painting.

                                 ASTER
                        Yeah.

           Ellie hands it back.

                                 ELLIE
                        He’ll love it.

           She starts to go. Aster looks up from her painting.

                                 ASTER
                        Can I come with?

           To the station?

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        I already lied to my dad about 
                        where I’d be. I have the day.

           Off Ellie’s uncertain expression...

                                 ELLIE (O.S.)
                        Yellow, then Green. Green!

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - DAY

           CLOSE ON the side of a train slowing... then starting to 
           speed up... then jerking to a stop. 
           Then finally pickup speed to WHIP BY, leaving... Aster on the 
           platform, laughing, clearly having botched the signal flags.

                                 ASTER
                        You get to do this every day?

                                 ELLIE
                        Twice. 5:40am and 9:40PM weekdays. 
                        12:10PM and 7:20PM weekends. Give 
                        or take an hour.

                                 ASTER
                        That is AWESOME!

                                 ELLIE
                        (wry) It’s a real blast.

                                 ASTER
                        It’s so master-of-the-universe.

                                 ELLIE
                        A teeny-tiny universe.

                                 ASTER
                        At least you rule something.

           Ellie takes the flags and ducks into the booth. Aster points 
           at some ELECTRIC SIGNAL LIGHTS.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        What about those?

                                 ELLIE
                        My dad doesn’t trust them.

           Ellie finishes stowing the flags.

           An awkward beat. What next?

                                 ASTER
                        Want to get out of here?

           Ellie glances up at the apartment window.

           Aster smiles, winningly.

           CUE ROADTRIP MUSIC.

           INT. ASTER’S FORD FIESTA - LATER

           From a car window: “IT’S HAPPENING IN SQUAHAMISH!” whips by.

           Aster cranks up the radio.
                                 ELLIE
                        Where we going?

                                 ASTER
                        My favorite secret place.

           Ellie peers back out the window as Squahamish recedes in the 
           distance. She closes her eyes. Feels the wind in her hair.

           EXT. ABANDONED MOUNTAIN ROAD - LATER

           The Fiesta slows to a stop at the end of a dirt road.

           It is lush and foggy and deserted.

           Ellie gets out of the car.

                                 ELLIE
                        This is your favorite secret place?

                                 ASTER
                        Almost.

           Aster pulls out a duffel bag and starts down the trail.

           EXT. SECRET HOT SPRINGS - LATER

           The two girls push through some brush... into A BILLOW OF 
           STEAM rising from a HOT SPRINGS SWIMMING HOLE. It’s pristine.

                                 ELLIE
                        Woah.

                                 ASTER
                        Right?

           Aster strips down and dives in. Re-emerges, glistening. 

           Ellie looks anywhere but Aster.

                                 ELLIE
                        Are these deciduous trees?

                                 ASTER
                        (amused) I wouldn’t know.

           Aster turns to give her privacy. 

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        We didn’t have trees like this in 
                        Sacramento. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        Everything’s reversed there. Things 
                        die off in summer, turn green in 
                        winter.

                                 ELLIE
                        Is that where you grew up?

                                 ASTER
                        Born there. Moved here. My life 
                        story.

           She hears Ellie slip into the spring. Turns to find her still 
           in a t-shirt. Glasses fogged. And...

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        Is that long underwear?

                                 ELLIE
                        Yes.

           Aster’s mouth twitches. Then suddenly she hauls her body - 
           naked - out of the spring.

                                 ASTER
                        I almost forgot.

           Ellie averts her eyes wildly. 

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        There’s no cell service here, so...

           She digs a SMALL RADIO out of her duffel, switches it on.

           A THROWBACK CLASSIC ROCK SONG pours out.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        It’s like nothing can reach us 
                        here.

           Nothing but Foghat. Ellie relaxes slightly into the water. 

           EXT. CHIU APARTMENT - SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - SAME TIME

           Edwin looks out the window to see Paul peering up.

                                 EDWIN
                        Ellie not here.

                                 PAUL
                        I have something for you.

           Paul lifts up a sack of fresh pork. And Chinese spices.
           Edwin lowers the spray hose.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - LATER

           Edwin shows Paul how to season the meat with five-spice 
           powder. They work silently and companionably.

           EXT. SECRET HOT SPRINGS - SAME TIME

           Ellie on the side, watching Aster do a slow backstroke.

                                 ASTER
                        Catholic school was the worst.

                                 ELLIE
                        The nuns?

                                 ASTER
                        The girls. Like Lord of the Flies 
                        but with Lisa Frank.

                                 ELLIE
                        Ah. Miss Piggy’s head on a stick.

                                 ASTER
                        (smiles) The “beast” reimagined as 
                        a sparkly unicorn.

                                 ELLIE
                        Instead of a naval officer, Taylor 
                        Swift’s yacht saves the day.

           Aster laughs, slows to tread water. Takes Ellie in.

                                 ASTER
                        I don’t think I’ve hung out with 
                        another girl and not talked about 
                        boys before.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh. Sorry.

                                 ASTER
                        Don’t be. It’s nice.

           Aster seems thoughtful.

                                 ELLIE
                        (blurts out) Paul’s cool.

           Beat. Then Aster shifts gears too.
                                 ASTER
                        He’s... confusing. When I’m with 
                        him, I feel... safe. He’s a... 
                        sweet guy. Then he writes these 
                        things that feel... not safe.

                                 ELLIE
                        Not safe.

                                 ASTER
                        They just make me wonder... 

           She trails off, a million unspoken thoughts.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        I should marry Trev.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh.

                                 ASTER
                        Should I?

           Ellie doesn’t have an answer.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        (sighs) God doesn’t know either, if 
                        it’s any consolation. Or He’s not 
                        telling.

                                 ELLIE
                        I don’t believe in God.

                                 ASTER
                        That must be so nice.

                                 ELLIE
                        No. It’s not. It’s... lonely.

           It’s the most real thing she’s ever said.

                                 ASTER
                        Yeah.

           She lets it sink in.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        I wish I knew what I believed. I 
                        overheard Trev once talking to my 
                        dad about our future wedding - he 
                        hasn’t even asked me yet - he’s 
                        just so sure. And maybe that’s 
                        love? I’ve been asking God to give 
                        me a sign. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        If this is what love is, I’ll 
                        accept it and be grateful. But if 
                        it’s supposed to be something 
                        bigger, something more... And then 
                        Paul’s letter appeared in my 
                        locker. And I’ve never felt so... 
                        understood.

           She glances at Ellie, embarrassed.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        Silly, right?

                                 ELLIE
                        No. It’s not silly.

           A moment of real connection.

                                 ASTER
                        You know what is silly?

           Aster wades slowly toward Ellie... removes her glasses... 
           Then PANTSES her. They tussle. Shrieking. Laughing.

           LATER

           Heads together in the center of the hole, floating, staring 
           into the sky. Ellie more relaxed than we’ve ever seen her.

                                 ELLIE
                        Gravity is matter’s response to 
                        loneliness.

                                 ASTER
                        Who said that?

                                 ELLIE
                        ...I don’t know.

                                 ASTER
                        Well then you said it.

           Is this true? They float.

           FROM THE RADIO: “If You Leave Me Now” by Chicago.

                                 ELLIE
                        (exhaling) My mom loved this song.

           They listen.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        She said every song, movie, story 
                        has a best part.
           Beat.

                                 ASTER
                        Was that the best part?

                                 ELLIE
                        Do you think it’s the best part?

           Aster bites her lip. Listens more intently.

                                 ASTER
                        Was that it?

                                 ELLIE
                        You asking or saying?

           Suddenly the swell of the bridge:

                                 CHICAGO (FROM RADIO)
                        “A love like ours is love that’s 
                        hard to find. How could we let it 
                        slip away?”

                                 ASTER
                        That’s it.

                                 ELLIE
                        Yeah.

           It is. 

                                 CHICAGO (FROM RADIO)
                        “...when tomorrow comes and we both 
                        regret/the things we said today. If 
                        you leave me now...”

           They listen, floating.

           The last bars of the song fade out.

           Both stare into the sky, smiling.

           The last light is slipping away. But this moment is perfect.

           INT. ASTER'S FORD FIESTA - NIGHT

           It’s dark as Aster’s car wends its way back to Squahamish.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - LATER

           Ellie gets out of the car and starts toward the station.
                                 ASTER
                        Hey!

           She turns back.

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        Hope you find something good to 
                        believe in.

           They share a smile. Aster drives off. 

           Ellie casts a nervous glance up at the apartment.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ellie peeks in.

           Edwin, in his lounger, eating a sausage, watches a movie.

           Everything seems weirdly fine.

                                 EDWIN (IN MANDARIN)
                        Paul made a braised pork sausage. 
                        Pretty tasty. Yours is in the 
                        microwave.

           Ellie pulls a covered plate out of the microwave.

                                 EDWIN (IN MANDARIN) (CONT’D) 
                        He asked you to call him later.

           Ellie shuts her bedroom door behind her.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - ELLIE'S ATTIC BEDROOM - LATER

           Ellie lies on her bed, a dreamy smile on her face. She 
           notices the moon out her window.

           EXT. MUNSKY SAUSAGE SHOP - BACK ENTRANCE - SAME TIME

           Close on a garbage can lid going on tight. 

           Paul wipes his hands on his apron.

                                 ASTER
                        Hey.

           Aster has been watching him.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh. Hey!
                                 ASTER
                        Do you believe in God?

                                 PAUL
                        (confused) Of course.

                                 ASTER
                        Yeah.

                                 PAUL
                        I got your painting. It was pretty.

           Beat.

                                 ASTER
                        Thanks.

           Suddenly, Aster kisses him... as if to feel something. Paul, 
           startled, kisses back.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - ELLIE'S ATTIC BEDROOM - SAME 
           TIME

           From her high vantage point, Ellie sees them kiss. Draws the 
           blinds. No longer dreamy.

           She sinks into her desk. Pulls a stack of papers toward her. 

           A Grinnell application falls open. 

           The cat jumps onto her lap.

                                 ELLIE
                        How are you not dead?

           She looks at the application. Sighs. 

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Not like I’ll send it in. But...

           She cracks it open and starts filling it out.

           EXT. MUNSKY SAUSAGE SHOP - BACK ENTRANCE - SAME TIME

           Aster and Paul finish their kiss. It wasn’t bad but... both 
           seem a little confused.

                                 PAUL
                        Big game this week. Training.
                                 ASTER
                        Good luck! I’ll see you after it’s 
                        over.

                                 PAUL
                        Have a good week!

           Paul watches Aster leave. 

           Looks over at the train depot.

           The back door flings open.

                                 TOMMY MUNSKY
                        Hey Paulie! You marrying the 
                        garbage out there? 

           With a last glance at Ellie’s window, he heads in.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - EARLY MORNING

           Shots of the town, waking. Superimposed over the images, the 
           following messages:

           “star*flower: Good luck at the game tonight!”

           “smithcorona: Thx!”

           On a different part of the screen:

                     “Ellie: Good luck. That was from Aster”

                      “Paul: You’ll be there tonite, right?”

                     “Ellie: Can’t wait to see buncha guys in a pile 
           sniffing each other’s butts”

           And with that we cut to...

           EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - EVENING

           A bunch of guys in a pile sniffing each other’s butts.

           From the BENCH, Paul scans the crowd. Locates Ellie far up. 
           Waves. 

           Aster - seated closer - waves back. 

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        In the closest Big Game we’ve seen 
                        in years, the Squahamish Moose down 
                        by 5! But it’s looking grim.

                        Fourth down, their own twenty yard 
                        line, less than a minute on the 
                        clock. 

           Paul turns to the Coach.

                                 PAUL
                        Put me in.

                                 COACH
                        We’re going for the field goal.

                                 PAUL
                        I can do this.

           Coach looks at him.

           MOMENTS LATER FROM THE STANDS

           Ellie watches Paul run onto the field. She worries her 
           zipper, more invested than she expected.

           BACK ON THE FIELD

           The Quarterback takes the snap... is about to get sacked... 
           throws the ball wildly. It lands in one player’s hands, 
           slips... into an opposing player’s hands, slips... into 
           PAUL’S HANDS. Players dive from all sides, but he breaks free 
           and starts running... and running... and running...

           ... until he makes it into the endzone.

           TOUCHDOWN.

           CROWD GOES WILD.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        A 24 YEAR LOSING STREAK SNAPPED! 
                        CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? WHAT NEXT, SUN 
                        IN JUNE?

           Paul looks into the stands. Everyone is cheering. Even Ellie.

           He breaks into a wide grin.

           LATER INSIDE THE STADIUM

           Paul pushes past fans, searching for Ellie.

           AT ANOTHER PART OF THE STADIUM

           Aster searches for Paul.

           BACK TO PAUL
           Paul stops a random student.

                                 PAUL
                        Have you seen Ellie?

                                 RANDOM STUDENT
                        Who?

                                 PAUL
                        Never mind. 

           Where could she be? And suddenly, he knows.

           EXT. BASEMENT OF STADIUM - MOMENTS LATER

           A bottle of YAKULT falls from a VENDING MACHINE. 

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Hey.

           Ellie turns, her arms full of Yakult.

                                 ELLIE
                        All hail the pride of Squahamish!

                                 PAUL
                        Thanks! You didn’t have to get me a 
                        Yakult.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh did you want one of these too? 
                        Just kidding! Of course you can 
                        have one. One.

                                 PAUL
                        I don’t want a Yakult.

                                 ELLIE
                        Even better.

                                 PAUL
                        I need to talk to you--

                                 ELLIE
                        I don’t have a hand free. Could--?

           Paul sighs, opens one of the Yakults. Then “feeds” Ellie.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        So good.

                                 PAUL
                        HEY.
                                 ELLIE
                        What?

           She has a Yakult mustache. Paul struggles to find the words. 
           Then takes her by the shoulders... and LAYS ONE ON HER.

           Ellie’s eyes bug out. Yakults topple to the floor.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

                                 PAUL
                        YOU DON’T WANT ME TO KISS YOU?

                                 ELLIE
                        NO!

           A lone Yakult rolls to a stop.

                                 PAUL
                        (crushed) Is there someone else?

           A gasp at the door: ASTER STANDS THERE, mouth agape.

                                 ELLIE
                        Aster! This... not what it looks 
                        like!

           But she’s gone.

           Paul stares at the stricken look on Ellie’s face. Light bulb.

                                 PAUL
                        No...

                                 ELLIE
                        Paul...

                                 PAUL
                        You...

           He starts to back away.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You... You’re a... 

           He wants to pound the wall. He can’t look at her.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        (quietly) You’re... going to hell.

           He leaves. 

           Leaving Ellie, standing in a pile of crumpled Yakult.
           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - LATER

           Ellie slows to a stop. This night could not get worse.

                                 TREVOR (O.S.)
                        I’m onto you, Ellie Chiu.

           Or maybe it can. Trevor pulls out of the shadows.

                                 TREVOR (CONT’D)
                        I know why you’re always hanging 
                        around. Popping up everywhere.

           She’s so tired. It’s time to confess.

                                 ELLIE
                        It was just supposed to be--

                                 TREVOR
                        You’re in love with me.

           Record scratch. Then, sighing:

                                 ELLIE
                        Yes, Trevor. I’m in love with you.

                                 TREVOR
                        I get it.

           He leans in to kiss her... and gets SMACKED in the face with 
           a STREAM OF WATER.

           Edwin, at the apartment window, armed with a hose.

                                 EDWIN
                        Get out! Get out!

                                 TREVOR
                        This is cashmere fleece!

           He hops into his fancy black truck and tears off.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - LATER

           Ellie enters the apartment, passes her father, goes into her 
           room and shuts the door.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - NIGHT

           The lights go out on this murky night. It starts to rain.

                                                              ON BLACK:

           Cue “Long dark night of the soul” MONTAGE:

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD INTO TOWN - EARLY MORNING

           Ellie bikes through the rain. 

           Truck approaches... then passes, leaving her alone.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - ASSEMBLY HALL - MORNING

           An assembly to honor the football team. Folks clap Paul on 
           the back. He looks miserable.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH HIGH - LUNCHROOM - NOON

           Aster picks at her lunch while the Quaddie table cheers Trev 
           on as he manages to drink a Dr. Pepper without his hands. She 
           looks miserable.

           INT. MRS. G'S CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

           A concerned Mrs. G watches Ellie pass by, also miserable.

           INT. MUNSKY KITCHEN - EVENING

           Paul at a computer as his brothers spar in the background.

           He types “homo” into a browser. Clicks on a link “How do you 
           know if you are gay?”

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY
                        Paulie! Garbage duty.

                                 PAUL
                        Got it, Ma.

           He shuts down the computer, heads out.

           The screen pops back on. His mom’s eyebrows shoot up.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - EVENING

           Edwin and Ellie in their usual La-Z-Boys eating dinner.

           Laughter erupts from a CLASSIC COMEDY on screen.
           Edwin shoots a worried glance at his silent daughter.

           INT. CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY

           Angle on Aster in the confession booth.

                                 ASTER (O.S.)
                        Bless me father for I have sinned. 
                        It’s been 34 days since my last 
                        confession. I… had feelings for 
                        someone who wasn’t my boyfriend. 
                        And I didn’t tell you. Or my 
                        boyfriend. Or even God. I just kept 
                        it for myself. I was selfish. Maybe 
                        love is... selfish. It’s like 
                        having this secret that’s stashed 
                        in you, until one day someone else 
                        has that same secret, and suddenly 
                        this thing you didn’t even know you 
                        held feels full and amazing and 
                        real… But it turns out it’s a lie. 
                        And you’re left lonelier than ever. 
                        I know now that what I was feeling 
                        wasn’t love, or the right kind of 
                        love. It was… I don’t know what it 
                        was. But I believed in it. And I 
                        know not to believe in it anymore. 
                        And I’ll do whatever Hail Mary’s 
                        you deem fit. But whatever 
                        punishment you give me, it can’t be 
                        worse than this feeling. Because 
                        even now... he’s still the only 
                        person I want to talk to. And it’s 
                        like he doesn’t even really exist.

           Aster slips out of the booth.

           Pull out to reveal ELLIE, on the other side, heartbroken.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - EVENING

           A train whips by.

           Leaving a soaked Ellie, alone, on the platform.

           End Montage. 

                                                              ON BLACK:
           NEW SLIDE:
           “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not 
           boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, etc, 
           etc. - 1 Corinthians 13:4-8”
           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - MORNING

           Out of a patch of weeds, the first crocus.

           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - MORNING

           SLAM. 30 POUNDS OF GROUND PORK land on the kitchen counter.

           Paul wipes his hands on his apron, over an ill-fitting suit.

                                 PAUL
                        See you next month, Mr. Chiu.

           He starts to leave.

                                 EDWIN
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL
                        Sir?

           Edwin hesitates.

                                 EDWIN
                        Did you and Ellie... break up?

                                 PAUL
                        We weren’t... together.

                                 EDWIN
                        She just seems so sad.

           Paul doesn’t know what to say, starts to leave. Then turns 
           back, knowing exactly what he wants to say.

                                 PAUL
                        You don’t see her.

                                 EDWIN
                        See... what?

                                 PAUL
                        HER. What she is. What she could 
                        be. You don’t... UGH.

           Paul slumps against the wall.

           Edwin is quiet.

                                 EDWIN (IN MANDARIN)
                        When Ellie’s Ma died, I lost my 
                        mind. I didn’t move for days. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDWIN (IN MANDARIN) (CONT'D)
                        When I finally “woke”, I found 
                        Ellie in the booth, doing the 
                        switch. She looked up at me. Just 
                        13. So serious. And I... smiled. 
                        After that, she took over. And I 
                        let her.

           He smiles now, remembering.

                                 EDWIN (CONT’D)
                        It was a good way to know where she 
                        was every morning. Every night.

           He looks at Paul, eyes soft. Now in English:

                                 EDWIN (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever love someone so much, 
                        you don’t want anything about her 
                        to change?

           Off Paul’s face absorbing this thought.

           Sound of EASTER MASS BEING SUNG...

           INT. SQUAHAMISH CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING

           Close on a LIT PASCHAL CANDLE.

           Angle on the CONGREGATION singing.

           Angle on FATHER SHANLEY, heavily guided by DEACON FLORES, 
           presiding over the mass.

           Angle on Ellie playing the piano.

           Easter Sunday Mass finishes without a hitch.

           Deacon Flores exhales.

           And then as if awakening:

                                 FATHER SHANLEY
                        “OUTSIDE ARE THE DOGS AND THE 
                        SORCERERS AND THE--”

           Deacon Flores wrestles him back.

                                 DEACON FLORES
                        And to close our Easter services, a 
                        few readings from the 
                        congregation...

           IN THE CONGREGATION
           Paul slides onto a pew next to his mother.

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY
                        You’re late.

                                 PAUL
                        Had to grind something.

           She eyes him suspiciously.

           FROM THE PIANO

           Ellie peers out and locates Paul... then a somber Aster. 

           FROM THE PULPIT

                                 DEACON FLORES
                        Our final reading today is from 
                        Trevor Carson.

           Trevor stands in the audience, clears his throat.

                                 TREVOR
                        “Love is patient, love is kind. It 
                        does not envy, it does not boast, 
                        it is not proud...” Which is why I 
                        am in love with this little lady.

           He gestures to a startled Aster sitting one row over.

                                 TREVOR (CONT’D)
                        And why she’ll make me a fantastic 
                        wife. Aster, will you?

           Wave of approval ripples through the crowd.

           Aster, frozen, gives the barest of nods.

           The congregation bursts into applause.

                                 ELLIE
                        NO!

           Gasps.

           Ellie is suddenly aware that she’s STANDING.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I just... uh... I uh.

           So many eyes on her.
                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to say, uh... love 
                        isn’t...

           Aster is staring at her, eyes narrowed. 

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        ...isn’t uh...

                                 DEACON FLORES
                        Thank you, Ellie. Everyone, let’s-

                                 PAUL
                        Love isn’t pretending.

           ANGLE ON PAUL STANDING.

           Another collective gasp. What is going on?

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I know because I’ve been 
                        pretending. Only for a few weeks. 
                        But it SUCKS.

                                 ELLIE
                        Paul-

                                 PAUL
                        And I’ve been thinking about how 
                        much it would suck to have to 
                        pretend to be - not you - your 
                        whole life.

           He’s careful not to look at Ellie. But he’s speaking to her.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I always thought there was one way 
                        to love. One right way. But there’s 
                        more. So many more than I knew. And 
                        I never want to be the guy who 
                        stops loving someone... for loving 
                        the way they want to love.

           His voice has never been stronger. Ellie’s eyes are full.

                                 DEACON FLORES
                        Thank you, Paul, that was... odd. 
                        Now let’s give Trev our-

                                 ELLIE
                        I also have been pretending.

           Again, gasps. This is getting exciting. The Deacon slumps.
                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been uh, pretending-

                                 TREVOR
                        I think I know where this is going. 
                        Ellie, I’m flattered. But you and I-

                                 ELLIE
                        You know, Trev, I have been writing 
                        your papers for the last four 
                        years. 

           Startled gasps. More than a few guilty faces.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        And if you’ll forgive me, I’m just 
                        gonna rewrite you one last time.
                        Love isn’t patient and kind and 
                        humble. Love is messy and horrible 
                        and selfish and... 

           She can feel Aster’s confused gaze.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Bold.

           A flicker of recognition on Aster’s face.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not finding your perfect half. 
                        It’s the trying and reaching and 
                        failing - it’s the effort you put 
                        in (nod to Paul) - when there’s no 
                        guarantee of success. Love is being 
                        willing to ruin your good painting 
                        for a chance at a great one.

           Ellie looks directly at Aster.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Is this really the boldest stroke 
                        you can make?

           Silence.

                                 ASTER
                        You.

                                 ELLIE
                        Yeah.

           Every breath is held as Aster walks slowly toward ELLIE. She 
           stops in front of PAUL. Eyes still on Ellie - she SLAPS Paul.
           As Aster leaves, the congregation breaks into MAYHEM.

           ANGLE ON DEACON FLORES AND FATHER SHANLEY

                                 DEACON FLORES
                        Everyone please take your seats!

                                 FATHER SHANLEY
                        “OUTSIDE ARE THE DOGS AND...”

           ANGLE ON TREVOR

                                 TREVOR
                        Wait. I’m the good painting?

           ANGLE ON PAUL AND HIS MOTHER

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY
                        Mommy wants you to know in case you 
                        are gay... Mommy still loves you.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not gay, Ma.

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY
                        Thank god!

           She hugs her son hard.

                                 PAUL
                        I might want to change our sausage 
                        recipe, though.

                                 COLLEEN MUNSKY
                        Are you insane?!

           She WHACKS him with her handbag.

           ANGLE ON MRS. G SURVEYING THE CHAOS HAPPILY

                                 MRS G
                        Now that’s some divine 
                        intervention.

           ANGLE ON ELLIE AT THE DOOR

           She catches Paul’s eye. The two friends share a nod.

           DIRECT HIT from his mom’s handbag. 

                                 PAUL
                        Ow!

           Ellie slips out, grinning.
           INT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - CHIU APARTMENT - LATER

           Ellie enters the apartment.

           Bags of freshly folded dumplings sit on the counter. Edwin 
           has been hard at work.

           She rinses her hands and joins her father.

                                 ELLIE
                        This is a lot of dumplings.

                                 EDWIN
                        It’s six days. 18 meals. To Iowa.

           Ellie stares at her dad, astonished.

                                 EDWIN (CONT’D)
                        We didn’t come to this country so 
                        you could be like me. We came here 
                        so you could be like your mother.

           Ellie flushes. A lovely beat as father and daughter fold 
           dumplings, neither looking at the other.

                                 ELLIE
                        You don’t mean “dead”, right?

                                 EDWIN
                        God, I hope not.

           The cat wakes up and stretches.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT

           Outside, it’s grey and rainy. And beautiful.

                                                              ON BLACK:

           New slide: “Love is messy and horrible and selfish... and 
           bold. - Ellie Chiu”

           EXT. VIOLA'S - A FEW MONTHS LATER

           A sunny late August day. 

           A GROUP OF GRADUATES in cap and gown burst out of Viola’s.

           As they clear out, a shift of WAITSTAFF exit, laughing. Aster 
           is the last out. She stops when she sees...

           ELLIE, leaning against her bike, waiting. 
           Aster hesitates, waves her friends on.

           She starts to walk. Ellie falls in next to her.

                                 ELLIE
                        You haven’t been to choir practice.

                                 ASTER
                        I’ve been busy.

                                 ELLIE
                        Yeah?

                                 ASTER
                        (beat) You need four portfolio 
                        pieces for art school, so...

                                 ELLIE
                        Art school? That’s great!

                                 ASTER
                        Nothing’s great yet, but we’ll see. 
                        What’s going on with you?

                                 ELLIE
                        Well, I’m headed east to Grinnell. 
                        They took me late acceptance, so--

                                 ASTER
                        Good for you, Ellie. Take care.

           She starts to cross the street.

                                 ELLIE
                        Aster. (beat) I’m sorry. 

           Aster slows to a stop, still not turning.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        It was just supposed to be one 
                        letter. But then writing you turned 
                        out to be the closest I’ve ever 
                        come to being... heard. (beat) I 
                        never meant to hurt you.

           A flicker of pain crosses Aster’s face. Then:

                                 ASTER
                        Sometimes I wish... “you” existed.

                                 ELLIE
                        I know. I’m sorry.

           A Bronx cheer arises from a distant sports bar. Then silence.
                                 ASTER
                        Deep down I probably knew the 
                        truth. (beat) I mean you really 
                        didn’t put enough emojis in his 
                        texts...

           Beat.

                                 ELLIE
                        I don’t know what they mean!

                                 ASTER
                        Like a puppy or a sausage-

                                 ELLIE
                        Really. I should have sent you a 
                        SAUSAGE EMOJI?

                                 ASTER
                        (beat) Fair point.

           Truce. They smile at each other. Then, looking away:

                                 ASTER (CONT’D)
                        For what it’s worth, it’s not like 
                        it never crossed my mind if things 
                        were different. Or I was different.

           Beat.

                                 ELLIE
                        You could never be different.

           Aster looks back sharply.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        (lightly mocking) “Am I sure I’m 
                        different? How do I know I’m sure?”

                                 ASTER
                        I can be sure!

                                 ELLIE
                        “I mean, what does God think...?”

                                 ASTER
                        Oh my god-!

                                 ELLIE
                        Just on and on and-

                                 ASTER
                        You watch: in a couple years, I’M 
                        GONNA BE SO SURE.
                                 ELLIE
                        GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

           They smile at each other. Ellie mounts her bike.

                                 ASTER
                        Find something good in Iowa to 
                        believe in, heathen.

           Just a flicker of something unspoken.

           Ellie starts to ride off... then to hell with it. She drops 
           her bike, strides back toward Aster... and KISSES HER.

           Aster is startled. But starts to kiss back.

           Ellie breaks the kiss.

                                 ELLIE
                        See you in a couple years.

           She gets on her bike and rides off.

           Aster watches her go, breathless. Starts laughing.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH - ROAD OUT OF TOWN - SAME TIME

           Ellie flies down a stretch of road on her bike, grinning, 
           free. She lets out a WHOOP.

           Behind her, the town fades into the distance.

                                                              ON BLACK:
           New slide: “[emojis of pineapple, owl, caterpillar with 
           glasses] - various sources”

           Sound of a TRAIN WHISTLE.

           INT. TRAIN - LOCOMOTIVE CAB

           An astonished ENGINEER over headset:

                                 ENGINEER
                        We’re stopping... in Squahamish?

           The train slows into the station with a LOUD EXHALE.

           EXT. SQUAHAMISH TRAIN DEPOT - MORNING

           Close on a LARGE RUCKSACK being lifted onto Ellie’s back.
           Paul hands her a COOLER stuffed with frozen dumplings.

           From the Token Booth, Edwin waves, then quickly looks away.

                                 PAUL
                        I’ll keep him busy tasting new 
                        ketchups.

                                 ELLIE
                        Nice writeup in the Town Crier.

                                 PAUL
                        Right? Munsky Sausages is gonna 
                        blow up! Might get to Iowa before 
                        you do...

                                 ELLIE
                        Better get going then.

           They smile at each other.

           It’s time to board.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        Here.

           She types something, presses send on her phone.

           DING. Paul looks down at his.

                                 PAUL
                        That caterpillar does look smart.

                                 ELLIE
                        Too smart to be standing on a 
                        platform, crying, like some wussy.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m not crying!

                                 ELLIE
                        (mouthing) Wussy... Wussy...

           She’s on the train.

           Paul swallows.

           INT. TRAIN - PASSENGER CAB - MOMENTS LATER

           Ellie sinks into a seat next to the window. 

           Turns to look at Paul. She mouths one last “wussy.”
           As the train starts up, a flash of trepidation crosses her 
           face. Paul sees it.

           And starts to JOG ALONGSIDE THE TRAIN.

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh no... don’t... no...!

           The train gathers speed... and so does Paul, grinning like a 
           maniac.

           And now Ellie is laughing. Hard.

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        (under her breath) You moron.

           The train pulls away, Paul running after it... a DISAPPEARING 
           SPECK Ellie watches until it is gone.

           When she turns back, there are tears in her eyes.

           The ELDERLY LADY across the aisle smiles.

                                 ELDERLY LADY
                        How sweet! Is that your boyfriend?

                                 ELLIE
                        No...

           Then simply:

                                 ELLIE (CONT’D)
                        He’s my friend.

           Like it’s the best thing in the world.

           She knows it. We know it. And as the train hurtles onward...

           Somewhere, someone is listening to “If You Leave Me Now.”

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                 THE END.
