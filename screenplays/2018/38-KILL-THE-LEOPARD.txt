           EXT. RIVER SHORE - SUNSET

           SIMON SAVERO (a balding, baby faced 35) stares out towards 
           the sunset. Before him is an industrial river bank, a city 
           skyline shimmers in the distance. He reaches into a coat too 
           big for him and removes a cigarette and lighter.

           BASHFUL (a bulky 45 year old who knows how to handle himself) 
           approaches Simon from behind. He wears an outfit identical to 
           Simon’s. Dark suit. White tie.

                                 SIMON
                        Pretty.

                                 BASHFUL
                        They’re all waiting. 

           Taking a deep drag of his cigarette, Simon nods. 

                                 SIMON
                        You think this is our last sunset?

                                 BASHFUL
                        Huh?

                                 SIMON
                        Pop always used to say... ‘Drink it 
                        in. You never know when it’s your 
                        last.’

           Simon looks to his hand. It’s shaking. He flicks his 
           cigarette into the river, taking a final look at the skyline.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You never know.

           He turns his back to the city and begins walking towards a 
           run down WAREHOUSE. An 18 wheeler with its trailer doors open 
           is parked outside. SIX OTHER HENCHMEN stand around the truck.

           BASHFUL, GRUMPY, HAPPY, SLEEPY, DOPEY, and SNEEZY. Six of 
           Simon’s SEVEN Dwarves (hold on tight- DOC is coming.)

           The Henchmen load into the trailer. Simon is last.

           His cohorts look at him attentively. OIL DRUMS are strapped 
           to one side of the truck. Wires are connected to the tops, 
           timers all reading 00:00:00.

           Doc tosses Simon a machine gun. Simon turns back to the 
           sunset for one final moment. 

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go skin a cat. 
           He slams the truck doors shut as the truck roars to life and 
           begins to drive towards the city.

           EXT. CITY SKYLINE - DUSK

           A crowded downtown skyline. Metal and glass angrily glimmer 
           in the last moments of sunlight. 

           Closing in on a single building, elegant at its base with 
           several of the top floors clearly under construction. This is 
           the ENSO BUILDING. 

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        It is October first. One year to 
                        the day since the now infamous Enso 
                        building became ground zero in a 
                        vigilante showdown that resulted in 
                        the shocking, public death of 22-
                        year-old Bailey Gallagher and 
                        sixteen other people, not to 
                        mention millions of dollars of 
                        property damage. 

           Pulling back- the city scape is on a large TELEVISION 
           MONITOR, displaying the news.

           INT. ASYLUM - SECURITY ROOM - DAY - INTERCUT FLASHBACK

           A SECURITY GUARD sits in a small bay of monitors- the news 
           continues to play. Smaller screens show two PRISON GUARDS 
           escorting an Older Man in a suit towards a metal detector.

                                         G O R D O N

           This is GORDON GALLAGHER (60), eyeing the security cameras 
           glaring at him. Two armed GUARDS stand on the opposite side.

           Removing shoes, watch, and phone, he places them into a bin. 

                                 GUARD
                        The visitor will stay within the 
                        bounds marked by the yellow lines. 
                        Any attempt to breach the bounds 
                        will result in detainment. 
           Gordon reaches into his jacket and removes a folded piece of 
           paper. He places it in the bin. The Guard eyes it. 

           Gordon steps through the metal detector. 

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Visitors are banned from bringing 
                        electronic devices. Your 
                        conversation with the prisoner will 
                        be monitored by prison staff. 

           He slips back into his shoes. The second Guard is reading the 
           unfolded piece of paper. He looks up to Gordon with 
           recognition, then hands the paper back to him.

           INT. 28TH FLOOR - DUSK

           A CONSTRUCTION CREW packs up their gear after a day of 
           painting walls. In the foreground, a RADIO blasts the news.

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        Amid public outcry, construction 
                        holdups and rumors of mafia 
                        pressure, Richard Enso of the Enso 
                        corporation has made good on his 
                        promise to reopen the building. 

           MIKE MCGRATH (40, scrappy looking- think 90s Bruce Willis) 
           lights a cigarette next to the pinned NO SMOKING sign. He 
           stands at the edge of the site- looking through a window hole 
           with no glass.  

                                 MIKE
                        Can someone turn that shit off?

           Mike looks around. His eyes go to a YOUNG CONSTRUCTION WORKER 
           with a YELLOW BANDANNA around his neck. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! New guy! What are you, deaf?

           The New Guy- Yellow Bandanna clicks the radio off.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)

           HAPPY (wearing a trucker hat and flannel) navigates the truck 
           into the city, crossing over a suspension bridge. He grabs 
           the radio from the dashboard.
                                 HAPPY
                        Over the bridge.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING LOBBY - DAY - NEWS FOOTAGE

           THOMAS ENSO (60) stands before a handful of microphones in an 
           informal press conference.

                                 THOMAS ENSO
                        This building is a symbol. Any 
                        symbol can have positive or 
                        negative connotations. Since last 
                        year this building has been a 
                        terrible scar on the city. And this 
                        renovation is all about healing 
                        after what happened. 

           INT. LEOPARD’S LAIR - DUSK

           Dozens of flat screen monitors hang in an otherwise pitch-
           black room,  displaying the city skyline, Richard Enso, the 
           weather, a traffic report. 

           On a central screen, the Female Newscaster is seen standing 
           in front of the Enso Building. 

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER
                        It’s been a year since a confirmed 
                        sighting of the vigilante known as 
                        The Leopard. His involvement in the 
                        death of Bailey Gallagher and 
                        hundreds of others over the last 
                        five years has some speculating 
                        that he may have given up.

           Several of the screens change to handheld camera phone 
           footage shot from the ground looking up to the Enso Building. 

           Several windows are blown out. Smoke billows out into the 
           night sky. Spotlights shine in holes on the building. 

           A moment passes before figures appear at the edge of a blown 
           out window. A WOMAN falls out of the building, plummeting 
           thirty floors. This is the death of BAILEY Gallagher.

           Pulling back- the silhouette of a MAN standing before the 
           dozens of screens in the darkness. This is THE LEOPARD.  
           The Female Newscaster now sits across from an ACADEMIC.

                                 ACADEMIC
                        Hundreds. And while these people 
                        haven’t died by the Leopard’s hand, 
                        it’s the 21st century chicken and 
                        egg. Yes. He stops the “bad guys” 
                        but if blowing up a building is 
                        what it takes... Is it worth it?

           INT. YOUTH CENTER - DUSK

           LOUIS PRATT (35) watches the same program from behind his 
           desk. He moves from behind the desk to grab his jacket, 
           revealing that he is in a WHEELCHAIR.

                                 LOUIS
                             (to himself)
                        Idiot...

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER
                        Ms. Gallagher and dozens more were 
                        being held hostage by Richard 
                        Rabideau, who called himself Red 
                        Rabbit. Though the night ended in 
                        tragedy for the hostages burned 
                        alive in the building, The Leopard 
                        was able to capture the Red Rabbit.

           A MUGSHOT of Richard Rabideau appears on screen next a file 
           photo of him wearing a Red Rabbit Mask.

                                 FEMALE NEWSCASTER (CONT’D)
                        He is currently serving a thirty 
                        year sentence at Moosehead Bay. 

           He wheels out of his office and to a basketball court. Young 
           children are playing basketball. 

                                 KID
                        Hey Mr. Pratt!

           A basketball comes flying his way. Louis catches it and 
           deftly shoots- making a basket with ease. 

           INT. ASYLUM - CELL BLOCK - DAY - INTERCUT FLASHBACK

           Gordon stands at the start of a long hallway. Either side is 
           concrete walls with glassed-off gaps. Two yellow lines on the 
           floor carve an unmistakable boundary. 
           At the end of the hallway is a single CHAIR facing the wall. 
           Gordon walks down the corridor, passing glassed-off CELLS, 
           each containing an INMATE. 

           He finally reaches the chair.  

           On the opposite side of the bullet proof glass sits RICHARD 
           RABIDEAU (40) with his back to Gordon, his face unseen. He 
           wears a bright red jumpsuit. 

                                 RABIDEAU
                        Rabbit, rabbit. I was wondering if 
                        you’d ever come down here. I’m 
                        impressed. It only took you a year. 
                        That might be a new record. They 
                        should make you president of the 
                        grief brigade. 

           Gordon’s hands are shaking. He clenches them into a fist. He 
           reaches into his coat and produces the pieces of paper.

           Mike McGrath exits from the freight elevator, pulling on his 
           jacket. He slows at the sounds of voices. He turns the corner 
           into the lobby of the Enso building. A CROWD of a hundred is 
           gathering around a makeshift stage and podium.

           REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN crowd in the front. Cops and a few 
           SECURITY GUARDS are stationed around the perimeter. The rest 
           are civilians.

           Mike notices a young WOMAN at the edge of the crowd. This is 
           JACKIE WHITE (26). He approaches her. 

                                 MIKE
                        Excuse me, miss? Miss?

           She turns, alarmed.

                                 JACKIE
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry- can I trouble you for a 
                        cigarette?

                                 JACKIE
                        I don’t smoke.

                                 MIKE
                        Huh. Okay. That’s a real shame... 
                        Enjoy the show.
           Mike heads towards the rotating glass doors.

           EXT. ENSO BUILDING - NIGHT

           He reaches into his coat and takes out his pack of 
           cigarettes. He preps one up. 

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        Hey. Can I get one of those?

                                 MIKE
                             (without looking)
                        Sorry pal, can’t help you.

           Mike finishes lighting his cigarette and looks in the 
           direction of the voice-- there’s no one there. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Thanks anyway.

           He looks down. Louis begins turning away from Mike in his 
           wheelchair. He begins to navigate the rotating glass doors. 
           Mike rolls his eyes in annoyance.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey. 

           Louis turns.

           Chagrined, Mike offers Louis the pack. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Seriously?

                                 MIKE
                        You want one or not?

           Louis rotates himself in his chair and wheels up next to 
           Mike, taking the pack and helping himself. 

                                 LOUIS
                        You going in there?

                                 MIKE
                        What? No. No. I work here. Just 
                        someone’s bad idea of a circus 
                        anyway. 

                                 LOUIS
                        How’s that?
                                 MIKE
                        Fuckin’ politics. Mayor’s gonna 
                        smile, Enso’s gonna smile. It’s a 
                        whole PR wheel, you know? They’re 
                        just trying to grease their own 
                        wheels. Don’t mean a god damn 
                        thing.

                                 LOUIS
                        Bailey Gallagher’s dad is gonna say 
                        something.

           Mike raises an eyebrow.

                                 MIKE
                        I didn’t know that.

                                 LOUIS
                        I wonder what he’s gonna say. You 
                        know? Hard. Losing a kid like that. 

           Mike thinks on it.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. See ya.

           Louis flicks the cigarette and wheels himself towards the

           Across the street, a Woman holds the hands of two SMALL 
           CHILDREN as they weave their way through the city. 

           Mike turns back to Louis and grabs the grips on the back of 
           his chair.

                                 MIKE
                        Lemme help you.

           The crowd is growing. Mike releases Louis.

                                 LOUIS
                        Thanks. 

                                 MIKE
                        Don’t mention it. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Hey, I’m Louis. 
                                 MIKE
                        Mike. 

           Applause starts up. Mike comes to a slow.  

           In the distance, Thomas Enso approaches the podium. Louis 
           watches with rapt attention. Mike glances across the crowd, 
           taking it all in. His eyes rest on Jackie for a moment, then 
           to the far corner, where Gordon Gallagher stands. 

           ON THE STAGE:

                                 THOMAS ENSO
                        Thank you. My name is Thomas Enso. 
                        This is my building, as many of you 
                        know. Tonight... Despite what the 
                        media has said. Tonight is not a 
                        celebration. It’s a commemoration. 
                        To remember the lives that have 
                        been lost in the wake of mad men 
                        with crazed agendas. Over the past 
                        year, this site has become the 
                        symbol for our pain. And tonight, 
                        as the building resumes its 
                        operations, I hope we can all begin 
                        to heal.

           IN THE CROWD:

                                 MIKE
                             (to Louis)
                        Building ain’t even done. Top four 
                        floors are missing windows. Bet he 
                        don’t mention that. 

                                 THOMAS ENSO
                        Over the past year, I’ve come to 
                        know many of the people affected by 
                        October 1st. And while I can 
                        understand their pain, I can never 
                        profess to truly know it. So I want 
                        to introduce Mr. Gordon Gallagher. 

           Applause erupts again. 

           ON THE STAGE:

           Gordon politely shakes Enso’s hand. He reaches into his 
           jacket and removes the paper from his pocket. He holds it in 
           his hand. 

                                 GORDON
                        I want to talk about my daughter. 
           Gordon pauses. He closes his eyes.

           Gordon stands behind the yellow line, holding the paper in 
           his hand. Shaking.

                                 GORDON
                        Bailey Grace Gallagher. Was born 
                        June 11th, 1993. She was a 
                        certified scuba diver. Excelled in 
                        mathematics. Coached softball in 
                        the summer. And she was my 
                        daughter. She had so much potential 
                        to do good. She was the light of my 
                        life. And one year ago that light 
                        was snuffed out. A lunatic. Who 
                        wore a mask. Paraded around the 
                        city. And set fire to this 
                        building. With her in it. 

           Gordon looks up.

           Rabideau is standing- inches away from him, face pressed up 
           against the glass. His face is covered in BURNS.

                                 RABIDEAU
                        I didn’t realize we’d be getting 
                        intimate today.

           The 18-wheeler truck pulls up to a security booth. A lone 
           guard cranes his head out.

                                 HAPPY
                        Got a delivery.

                        Should be there. Windows. 

           The Guard looks over a chart, scowling.

                        You’re not supposed to be here 
                        until tomorrow. 
                                 HAPPY
                        Sure. I understand. Why don’t you 
                        just give em a call up top and see 
                        what they have to say?

           The Construction worker with the YELLOW BANDANNA stands in 
           the freight elevator. The doors open.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           Two SECURITY GUARDS sit in a room that is wall-to-wall 
           monitors, covering dozens of angles throughout the building. 
           There’s a KNOCK on the door.

                                 SECURITY GUARD 
                        Who the hell?

           He looks at one of the monitors. On the other side of the 
           locked door, YELLOW BANDANNA looks up to the camera. 

                                 BANDANNA
                        Hey, guys! We’re having problems 
                        with the phones on 26. We’re pretty 
                        sure the problem is on your end. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                             (to the other)
                        You noticed any problems?

           The Security Guard rises and goes to the door. He inputs the 
           code to unlock the door, revealing Yellow Bandanna. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 BANDANNA
                        You guys weren’t getting my calls, 
                        I called from upstairs!

           At that moment- a TELEPHONE rings. The Second Security guard 
           moves to pick it up. In a FLASH, Yellow Bandanna pulls out a 
           GUN and fires- 

           EXT. ENSO BUILDING - LOADING BAY - SAME

           The Guard has a phone wedged into his shoulder. Happy smiles 
           at him politely. It rings. Rings. Riiiiiings.
                                 BANDANNA (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 GUARD
                        Yeah, I got a delivery at the bay, 
                        but there’s nothing on my books 
                        about after-hours.

           Blood drips down the security monitors. Two dead bodies lie 
           on the ground next to Yellow Bandanna, who speaks clearly and 
           politely in a more white-collar accent. 

                                 BANDANNA
                        Yeah, that was a last second 
                        delivery, we put a rush on the 
                        windows for the opening ceremony. 

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Guess they’re a little late for 
                        that.

                                 BANDANNA
                        I guess they are. 

           Yellow Bandanna hangs up the phone-- and from here on out, 
           he’ll be referred to as DOC- Simon’s Seventh Dwarf.

                        Back up into Bay 4. 

           He hits the buzzer and the rail rises. Happy gives him a 
           polite smile. 

                                 HAPPY
                        You have a great night.

                        knife or the gun, or the bullets 
                        that kill anyone.  Because he’s 
                        just a man. A dangerous man, but 
                        ultimately- a sick one.

           Rabideau stands inches away from Gordon, staring him right in 
           the eyes. 

                                 GORDON
                        For all his destruction and 
                        violence, I believe Richard 
                        Rabideau, the Red Rabbit, is a sick 
                        man, made-

                        What’s the going rate on copper 
                        these days?

                                 RABIDEAU
                        You look at building permits, 
                        there’s lots of little details you 
                        can find. All public record. 
                        Copper...  Smaller pipes on the 
                        third, fifth, seventh floors. All 
                        the odd floors with little teeny 
                        sprinkler pipes. I guess Enso’s a 
                        gambling man. Bet on even, 
                        should’ve bet odd. But it’s the 
                        little details that always get you. 
                        They were trapped, trapped like 
                        little mice, your Bailey and the 
                        others. And they went up, up, up 
                        because there was nowhere else to

                        But most of all, I blame all of 
                        you. We have created a culture that 
                        accepts a parade of violence by 
                        vigilantes in masks. We’ve accepted 
                        a status-quo that results in the 
                        death of hundreds.

                        much as she was the center of my

                        And then they reached the 26th 
                        floor, and it was all those little 
                        mice, little Bailey, myself, my 
                        cans of gasoline... And a Leopard. 
                        The smoke came and the fire too. 
                        And he had his choice. He could sit 
                        on the 26th floor and help the mice 
                        out of the burning building... Or 
                        he could catch the rabbit. So the 
                        mice jumped... And catch the rabbit 
                        he did. 

           Gordon has tears in his eyes.

                        He could have saved them. Maybe not 
                        all of them. But one or two or ten. 
                        Maybe he would have chosen Bailey. 
                        Maybe she would have gotten on her 
                        knees... And begged for him. But

                        blaze of glory. Shine so bright.

           Gordon steps back, and then begins to walk away, back the way 
           he first entered.

                        neither will you. Do you want to 
                        know why?

           Gordon stops. A devilish smile appears on Rabideau’s face.

                        It’s up to us to take control. 

           Elevator doors open. Mike notices.

           CRASH GATES drop from the ceiling, covering the exits. 
           There’s gunfire seeming to come from all corners. Mike turns 
           towards the exit-

                                 MIKE
                        Jesus Christ!

           Mike pulls Louis out of his chair and down onto the ground. 
           He looks up, just in time to catch a COP pulling his gun, 
           only to be gunned down. Chaos unleashed via gunfire in 
           darkness.

           Next to Mike, a news crew from the hits the floor. Mike eyes 
           the camera lying on its side on the ground.

           The stack of screens all flicker to the same image- the live 
           feed from within the Enso building.

           The image flickers to two pale ANCHORS sitting at a desk.

           The silhouette of the Leopard looms in front of the screens.

           BANG. BANG. BANG. 

           Silence. 

           Profusely sweating with a shake in his knee, Simon rises to 
           the podium where Gordon was moments ago. 
                                 SIMON
                        Um... Okay... So we have wired 
                        several hundred pounds of 
                        explosives to the base of the 
                        building. Any law enforcement 
                        entities that attempt to breach the

                        Don’t test me on this. 

           On the ground, Mike eyes the dead police officer in the 
           corner. His gun is still in his hand. 

           INT. LEOPARD’S LAIR - NIGHT

           The shadowy Leopard watches the two Anchors listening to 
           Simon’s commands. 

                                 SIMON (V.O.)
                        My associates and me, we’ve come 
                        for one thing. And if we get it, 
                        everything will be fine. As Mr. 
                        Gallagher there was saying, it’s 
                        time we adjust the status quo. Mr. 
                        Leopard- I’m speaking to you now.

           The image flickers to the live feed of the camera in the Enso 
           building- from the floor peering up towards Simon. 

                                 SIMON

                        until you surrender yourself. Okay. 

           More gunfire erupts, followed by screams. The image returns 
           back to the anchors, wide-eyed.

           Police cars pulls up onto the curb- the streets around the

           Sleepy grabs the news camera off the floor and smashes it 
           with his foot. He proceeds to smash all three of the news 
           crew cameras.
           Holding a plastic bin, Dopey walks around the crowd. 

                                 DOPEY
                        Cell phones, anything with a

                        to blow yourself up, you’ll turn it 
                        all in. 

           The crowd of fifty or so hostages begin to turn in their 
           electronic devices. 

           Simon walks among the crowd. 

                                 SIMON
                        You. Stand up. You. You. You. 
                        Stand! You. You.

           He begins pointing out people. JACKIE among them.

           Mike watches from the floor as Simon point to him. Mike 
           points at himself to confirm. 

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, you. And the guy in the wheel 
                        chair. Lady, you too.

           Mike looks over to Louis and begins to help him into his 
           chair. 

                                 DOPEY
                        To the elevators- move!

           All in all it’s a group of about FIFTEEN rounded up together. 
           The Six Dwarves begin to wrangle the herd of HOSTAGES. Mike 
           pushes Louis, taking in the situation.

                                 MIKE
                        These guys did their homework.

                                 SNEEZY
                        Quiet. Just move. 

           As the hostages make their way in a line, Simon stops by 
           Gordon. He looks him up and down.

                                 SIMON
                        Hey. You wanna come with us?

                                 GORDON
                        Why would I want to come with you?
                                 SIMON
                        So you can watch the Leopard die. 

           Not the response he was expecting. Slowly, he stands up and 
           joins the other rounding out for SIXTEEN hostages. 

           Mike looks over his shoulder at the dozens of people left in 
           the lobby, staring at them like deer in headlights.

           The Elevator swallows the hostages whole.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           The Freight Elevator is huge. One side holds the hostages 
           packed in the corner. On the opposite end are the captors- 
           machine guns leveled across the space. 

           Painful silence. 

           Mike watches the escalating numbers tick. 14... 15... 16... 
           The elevator stops. 

           Behind the captors, the freight doors open. BASHFUL, SLEEPY, 
           DOPEY and SNEEZY step out onto the 16th floor. 

                                 SNEEZY
                        Okay, come on. One at a time. 

           The hostages stand frozen for a moment-- then one by one they 
           begin to file out. 

                                 SLEEPY
                        One, two, three, four, five, six, 
                        seven, eight.

           Eight strangers walk out in single file. Gordon steps out to 
           be the ninth- Simon grabs his arm.

                                 GORDON
                        Why don’t you stay with me. 

           Gordon steps back towards the remaining hostages. Mike 
           watches as the four captors lead the eight hostages into the 
           belly of the sixteenth floor. 

           A frightened WOMAN looks over her shoulder at him- they have 
           a second of eye contact.  The elevator doors close. 

           On the captor side, it’s SIMON, GRUMPY, and HAPPY. 

           The elevator keeps going up. 17... 18... 19...
           These are THE HOSTAGES: MIKE, JACKIE, GORDON, LOUIS, and 
           three others. BILL (50s) is sweating through his shirt. ISLA 
           (70) has long grey braided hair. JOHN (22) looks terrified. 

                                 MIKE
                        Why don’t you guys point the guns 
                        down? Are you afraid of some old 
                        lady? 

           Simon looks at Mike, squinting through his mask. He looks 
           towards Grumpy and nods. 

           Silently, Grumpy steps towards Mike and smashes the butt of 
           his gun into Mike’s nose. Isla screams as Mike falls to his 
           knees, gushing blood. 

                                 GRUMPY
                        You want to make it through this, 
                        you shut up! 

           He turns towards John and points the gun at him.

                                 GRUMPY (CONT’D)
                        Keep staring. I’ll cut those eye 
                        lids right off.  

           John’s eyes snap to the ground. 

           The elevator doors open on 26. 

                                 HAPPY
                        Everyone out. 

           The hostages pass Mike who bleeds on the floor. Grumpy steps 
           towards him. Mike looks up. 

           Grumpy has a roll of duct tape in his hands.

                                 GRUMPY
                        You got it?

           The seven hostages are lined up in a row. Louis, (on the 
           floor, out of his wheel chair) Jackie, Gordon, Isla, Bill, 
           John, and bleeding Mike. Their hands are duct taped behind 
           their backs.

           Grumpy searches Mike, and pulls out his pack of cigarettes.
                                 GRUMPY
                        Jackpot.

                        Do something.

           Bashful picks on the other end. The eight hostages are tied

           Simon turns towards the row of hostages. He looks over each 
           of their faces. No one makes eye contact. Except for BILL.

                                 SIMON
                        What’s your name?

                                 BILL
                        Bill... Bill Berlo.

                                 SIMON
                        You have kids, Bill? Got a wife or 
                        a husband?

           Bill nods.

                                 BILL
                        Don’t hurt me.

           Simon looks at him sympathetically. 

                                 SIMON
                        It’s outta my hands, Bill. This is 
                        bigger than us. 

           Grumpy grabs Bill by his collar and begins to drag him 
           towards the other side of the room-- where the windows have 
           not been installed. 
           The hostages begin to yell in protest- Happy fires a warning 
           shot into the air then turns his gun on them.

           Screaming in terror, Bill is dragged towards the open panels. 

                                 BILL
                        No! No! Please! Please!

           Grumpy gives him a shove. Bill goes over the edge. The 
           hostages all exclaim in horror. 

                                 LOUIS
                        JESUS CHRIST!

                                 JACKIE
                        No, no, no, no. 

           Then there is silence. Simon turns back to the hostages. 
           They’re crestfallen. This is going to get really bad. 

           Simon looks out the window and down to the ground below. The 
           small dot of Bill’s body can be seen on the street. He nods 
           to himself, a little shaken. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Why are you doing this?

           Simon kneels down to Louis’s level. 

                                 SIMON
                        Because I owe him.

           Their eyes are locked. Simon is dead serious. 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Roving spotlights aimed from flashlights light up the side of 
           the warehouse. A dozen COPS appear out of the darkness, 
           lining up along the sliding doors.

           Looking in through a dusty pane of glass, a COP eyes the 
           inside of the door- it’s chained shut. 
           EXT. WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - FLASHBACK

           A Cop in a welding mask cuts through the chain. It falls on 
           the ground, the doors slide open. Guns and flash lights 
           raised, the Cops enter the darkness.

           INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME MOMENTS - FLASHBACK

           The Cops reach the center of the warehouse. It’s a mess. The 
           floor is littered with torn-open plastic bags. Powder cakes 
           everything. It’s like a sugar factory. 

           Several BIG MEN lie unconscious on the ground. 

           A cough echoes off screen. The Cops turn their attention to a 
           corner- flash lights pointed. 

           Under a small MOUNTAIN OF COCAINE shifts the body of SIMON 
           SAVERO- almost completely covered. His face is caked with 
           white powder and smeared blood. His face is a pulpy mess.

                                 COP
                        Holy shit. 

           Simon coughs.

                                 SIMON
                             (weakly)
                        It’s not mine. 

           FLASH. 

           INT. JAIL - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Still covered in powder and sporting two black eyes, SIMON 
           stands for a mugshot. 

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)

                        was arrested last night by Metro PD 
                        in a drug sting. 

           INT. PRISON CELL BLOCK - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Simon is led down the rows of cell blocks wearing a red jump 
           suit and holding his pillow and blanket. 
                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Police say they found Savero under

                        substances. Conflicting reports 
                        indicate the vigilante known as The 
                        Leopard was involved, but police 
                        have yet to confirm-

           INT. PRISON CELL - DAY - FLASHBACK

           The prison bars close behind Simon. 

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Mr. Savero has been charged with 
                        possession with the intent to 
                        distribute, racketeering and minor 
                        weapons charges. He’s currently 
                        being held without bail. 

           Simon gulps. Before him is his 300 pound CELL MATE.

                                 SIMON (O.S.)
                        Pop, you gotta get me out of here. 

           INT. PRISON - VISITORS AREA - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Simon sits behind a glass panel, phone to his ear. Opposite 
           him is DON SAVERO (80) looking worried. 

                                 DON SAVERO
                        It’s being worked on. We’re 
                        appealing. These things take time.

                                 SIMON
                        Well grease the wheels, will you?

                                 DON SAVERO
                        It all takes time. We’re all 
                        working to get you out of this 
                        place.

                                 SIMON
                        Work. Faster. 

           Don Savero gives him a sad nod. 

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        What about... The guy who put me in 
                        here?
                                 DON SAVERO
                        I’ve got feelers out. He wages war 
                        on my family, we’ll wage war on 
                        him. You have my word, Simon.

           Simon nods. That’s all he can ask for from here.

                                 DON SAVERO (CONT’D)
                        You’re a sweet boy, Simon. You’re 
                        smarter than this. You were 
                        supposed to be better than me. I 
                        hoped that you would... I’d hope 
                        you’d be able to rise above this. 

                                 SIMON
                        ... Yeah. I know.

                                 DON SAVERO 
                        It’s my failing. That’s my failure 
                        as a father.

                                 SIMON
                        Don’t say that.

                                 DON SAVERO
                        They treating you alright in there?

           Simon hesitates. 

                                 DON SAVERO (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 SIMON
                        It’s fine. Food sucks. 

                                 DON SAVERO
                        Yeah. That’s prison. 

           DOn Savero puts his hand up against the glass.

                                 DON SAVERO (CONT’D)
                        We’ll get you out. Just hold on.

           A BUZZER rings. 

           INT. PRISON CELL BLOCK - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A GUARD slowly walks along the cell block, happily whistling 
           to himself.

           Muffled CRIES can be heard echoing through the darkness.
                                 SIMON (O.S.)
                        NO! NO! GET THE FUCK OFFA ME!

           The Guard keeps his stride, whistling as he takes out his 
           night stick. He passes Simon’s cell and hits the bars with 
           the stick. 

                                 GUARD
                        Keep it down in there. 

           There’s just enough light to see the shadowy outlines of 
           Simon trying to kick at the giant that is his cell mate- 
           keeping him at bay.

                                 SIMON
                        No! NO!

           The BUZZER rings again.

           INT. PRISON - VISITORS AREA - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Simon’s left eye has swollen itself shut. His lip is split. 
           He sits at his station. On the other side of the glass is an 
           empty chair. 

           He waits. 

           A door opens and on the visitors side, Simon’s LAWYER sits 
           across from him. They pick up their phones. 

                                 SIMON
                        You gotta get me out of here.  

                                 LAWYER
                        The appeals have been filed, at the 
                        very least we should be able to 
                        transfer you to a medium-security 
                        prison while we sort through the 
                        paper work-

                                 SIMON
                        Medium security? OUT! OUT. OUT. 
                        OUT. WHAT DON’T YOU GET ABOUT OUT! 

                                 LAWYER
                        I understand. 

           Simon has tears in his eyes. 

                                 SIMON
                        I don’t know if I’m gonna make it. 

           His Lawyer shifts uncomfortably. Simon wipes his eyes. 
                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Pop? Pop was supposed to be 
                        here. 

                                 LAWYER
                        Um... He died, Simon. 

           Dead silence. 

                                 LAWYER (CONT’D)
                        He and some associates were out for 
                        The Leopard. The Leopard found them 
                        first. 

                                 SIMON
                        He killed him?

                                 LAWYER
                        No. Your father had a heart attack. 
                        He um... He died about eight hours 
                        later at St. Michaels... He was... 
                        He was eighty, you kn-

                                 SIMON
                        I know how old he was. 

           In shock, Simon nods, staring off into the distance.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        So... They’re going let me out for 
                        the funeral, right? That thing, the 
                        pass thing?

                                 LAWYER
                        Furlough, right. We can apply for 
                        it, but it’s usually not... In the 
                        current circumstances, I think we 
                        should stick to the agenda of 
                        getting you transferred. It’s a 
                        different battle and-

                                 SIMON
                        You’re telling me... I should miss 
                        my father’s funeral? 

                                 LAWYER
                        Yeah. 

           Slowly, Simon hangs up the phone and stands.

           INT. PRISON CELL BLOCK - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Simon walks to his cell in a daze. 
           INT. PRISON CELL - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Simon crawls onto the top bunk, pulling himself into the 
           fetal position. He closes his eyes. 

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           WAREHOUSE. NIGHT. THE LEOPARD DODGES GUNFIRE. 

           Simon opens his eyes. Tears stream out. 

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           WAREHOUSE. DON SAVERO LIES ON THE GROUND, WIDE EYED AND 
           CLUTCHING HIS CHEST.

           Simon blinks again.

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           DON SAVERO’S EYES CLOSE. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           SIMON’S EYES OPEN. He sits up and hops off the top bunk, 
           walking over to the small toilet in the corner. 

           He begins to pee. 

           Behind him, his Cell Mate rises, towering over him. 

           Simon’s eyes rise. He’s calm. Cool. Collected. The Cell Mate 
           puts a hand on Simon’s shoulder. 

           In a FLASH, Simon turns around and runs his fist directly 
           into the Cell Mate’s throat. The Cell Mate falls straight 
           back onto the ground, choking. 

           INT. PRISON CELL BLOCK - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           The Prison Guard walks along the cell block, whistling.

           He passes Simon’s cell. Simon is sitting on the bottom bunk. 
           His Cell Mate lies on the floor. Simon looks up at the Guard.

                                 SIMON
                        He fell. 

           HOLD on Simon’s face. Anger simmers under a placid surface.
           EXT. ENSO BUILDING - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT

           Red and blue lights flash. Paramedics cover Bill’s crushed 
           body in the middle of the street. 

           The medic looks up at the Enso building. 

           INT. 28TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Mike shifts uncomfortably, hands tied. 

                                 MIKE
                             (a whisper)
                        We gotta get out of here. 

                                 JACKIE
                        He’ll come for us. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m not waiting around for-

                                 GRUMPY
                        NO TALKING!

           EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           THE LEOPARD appears out of the shadows on a rooftop across 
           from the Enso building. He takes a knee and begins to 
           assemble a harpoon gun. 

           INT. 30TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Tarps flutter on an abandoned floor of the Enso building. 
           Most of the windows have yet to be put in. Construction 
           materials and tools are piled off to one side. 

           Pushing into the drywall... 

           WHAP!

           A metal spike pierces through the drywall. The tip of the 
           spike separates and flattens out into three forks, fastening 
           themselves against the wall. 

           The spike is connected to a black rope, leading out the open 
           floor and into the night... The slack of the rope is taken up 
           as it’s pulled taut. 
           EXT. ENSO BUILDING - NIGHT

           In the darkness, the shadow that is The Leopard climbs along 
           the rope. 

           INT. 28TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           The row of hostages fidget uncomfortably.

                        Excuse me!

           Happy looks to her. 

                                 ISLA (CONT’D)
                        I have to pee. 

                                 HAPPY
                        What?

                                 ISLA
                        Do you need me to spell it?

           Happy sighs.

                                 ISLA (CONT’D)
                        Well it’s inconvenient for both of 
                        us, isn’t it? What, you want me to 
                        go here? On these people?

           Happy starts to walk away.

                                 JACKIE
                        Hey! Help her!

                                 GRUMPY
                        Let her sit in it. 

                                 MIKE
                        There’s a bathroom right down the 
                        hall behind us. There’s no doors on 
                        the stalls yet. Plumbing works.

                                 GRUMPY
                        What did I tell you about talking?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m just saying, alright?

           Grumpy and Happy exchange glances, then Happy goes to Islas 
           side and lifts her to her feet.
                                 ISLA
                        Thank you.

                                 HAPPY
                        Lets go. 

           Mike watches as Isla is walked off. His attention turns to 
           the scene in front of him. There are only two men watching 
           them now. Grumpy and Simon.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - 26TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Isla walks in front of Happy as they walk down a long, under 
           construction hallway. They reach a doorway with no doors. 
           Sure enough- rows of toilets. No stalls. 

                                 HAPPY
                        Go.

           Isla sneers and walks into the bathroom. She looks to Happy.

                                 ISLA
                        You’re going to watch me?

           Happy frowns. He turns sideways, keeping her in his 
           periphery. Isla begrudgingly accepts the compromise.

           In the hallway: 

           A metal clanging chimes out. Happy looks down the hall. 

           A spray-paint sized CAN is rolling down the middle of the 
           hallway. Happy squints at it. 

                                 HAPPY
                        Guys-

           The can ERUPTS with MUSTARD YELLOW SMOKE. Plumes instantly 
           fill the hallway. Happy raises his gun- 

           WHUMP.

           The Leopard grabs Happy from the front and tags him into the 
           plume of yellow. He instantly disappears. 

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - 26TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           Simon whips around at the sound. He looks to Grumpy.

                                 GRUMPY
                        Get ready. 
           Simon reaches down into a DUFFLE BAG. He takes out a device 
           that with an antenna that looks like an cell phone from the 
           80s. He grips a hand around it, twisting a switch.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - BASEMENT - SAME MOMENTS

           A GREEN LIGHT illuminates on the countdown of the BARRELS OF 
           EXPLOSIVES. Next to it is the word ARMED. 

           INT. ENSO BUILDING- 16TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           Bashful, Sleepy, Dopey and Sneezy turn their guns towards the 
           other batch of hostages.

                                 DOC (V.O.)
                        Cat’s out of the bag, people.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - 26TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - SAME

           Sitting on the toilet, Isla blinks. The yellow smoke plumes 
           in the hall. She catches just a glimpse of The Leopard.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - 26TH FLOOR - SAME

           Grumpy points his machine gun towards the hostages, but his 
           eyes are on the hallway. 

                                 SIMON
                        Mr. Leopard! We’ve all seen this 
                        movie! On the count of three I blow 
                        away another hostage!

           Mike’s eyes are on Grumpy. 

                                 MIKE
                             (low)
                        We can take em.

           He trades glances with the other hostages. 

                                 SIMON
                        We have hostages on two floors. If 
                        anything happens here, the other 
                        eight hostages die. You understand?

                                 MIKE
                             (frantic)
                        Get ready--
                                 JOHN
                        Man- shut up-

                                 SIMON
                        I’M NOT FUCKING AROUND! YOU THINK 
                        YOU KNOW ME? YOU DON’T KNOW SHIT! 
                        ONE! TWO!

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        ALRIGHT. 

           Metal clangs. Silence. 

           Eyes ablaze, Mike makes fierce eye contact with his fellow 
           hostages. Eyes on Gordon. Eyes on John. Eyes on Jackie. 

           Louis and Jackie both are looking at one thing. The plume of 
           yellow smoke. The sprawling shadow reaching towards them. 

                                 SIMON
                        Hands!

           The shadow’s hands go up. It moves closer. From around the 
           corner, The Leopard appears, seen clearly at last. 

           Silence.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Take off the mask. 

           The Leopard reaches towards the back of his head. He 
           unfastens a clip at the base of his neck and begins to remove 
           his helmet, revealing the face of-

           -A total stranger. He’s just some guy, about 40. Raccoon-eyed 
           makeup around the eyes.  Simon scowls at him.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Who the hell are you?

           He begins to laugh. Grumpy eyes Simon in his periphery. 

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        You’re just- what? Some... Some 
                        nobody? I always figured you’d at 
                        least be... Somebody. 

           BANG!

           Simon shoots The Leopard square in the chest. He goes flying 
           onto his back. Jackie screams- and MIKE takes the opportunity 
           and rises to his feet, hands still tied behind his back, 
           launching himself straight into Grumpy like a linebacker. 
           Grumpy’s GUN goes off- first clipping Mike on the outside of 
           his shoulder, and then hitting Gordon square in the GUT. 

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - SECURITY ROOM - SAME MOMENTS

           Doc watches the mayhem unfold on the security camera feed. 

                                 DOC
                        Get up there! Get up there now! 

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - 26TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           Simon turns his gun towards Mike. John launches himself up 
           into Simon- knocking him over. 

           THE DETONATOR goes flying, hitting the ground 20 feet away 
           from LOUIS. He starts crawling for it. 

           Mike wrestles for the gun, hands still tied. The duct tape 
           starts to get loose, and Mike gets a free hand-

                                 MIKE
                        FUCKIN! MOTHER! FUCKER!

           Louis frantically squirms towards the detonator on the 
           ground. 

           Simon pulls out a KNIFE, slashing at John and cutting him. 
           John pushes himself back off of Simon.

           Mike slams an elbow down onto Grumpy- HARD.

           Simon crawls towards the gun cast to the side-

           BANG!

           Everyone stops.

           Mike stands a few meters away, gun pointed at Simon. Silence, 
           except for the sound of Gordon choking on blood. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Get up. 

           Simon rises. His ear piece is dangling around his ear. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Give me your knife.

           Simon frowns. He reaches into his belt and pulls out a knife. 
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Throw it over there. 

           Simon throws it onto the ground towards Jackie. She begins to 
           pull it towards herself with her feet.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey Lou. 

                                 LOUIS
                        ...Yeah?

                                 MIKE
                        Keep an eye on that detonator, huh?

           There’s squawking coming in from Simon’s ear piece. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Those your boys?

                                 SIMON
                        Yeah.

                                 MIKE
                        Give it here. 

           Simon removes the cord to his earpiece and unclips the walkie 
           from his belt and slides it on the floor over to Mike.

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        -SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING, GOD DAMN 
                        IT!

                                 MIKE
                        Knock knock. 

           A beat.

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Who’s there?

           Mike looks around. Louis is on the ground holding the 
           detonator. Jackie has cut herself free and is removing her 
           jacket, putting pressure onto Gordon’s gut shot. 

                                 MIKE
                        I... I wasn’t expecting the tee up 
                        for the joke, so I got nothing in 
                        that department. What I do have is 
                        a detonator and your friends. 

                                 DOC (O.S.)
                        They’ve only got two guns. Go ahead 
                        and rush them-
                                 MIKE
                        HEY! I will blow this place the 
                        fuck apart!

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Let me talk to Simon. 

           Mike looks at Simon.

                                 MIKE
                        Simon. 

           He holds the walkie up at Simon.

                                 SIMON
                        I’m here.

                                 BASHFUL
                        What do you want us to do?

                                 SIMON
                        Come get me. 

           BANG. 

           Mike shoots Simon, sending him down. 

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Hello? HELLO?

           Mike blinks- surprised as what he’s done. It’s a moment of 
           REAL violence. It shakes him.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Why did you do that?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh shit. 

           Mike looks towards the hallway.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey. Kid. KID!

           John looks up. 

                                 JOHN
                        John!

                                 MIKE
                        John, fine! There’s two cameras. 
                        One in the corner and one in the 
                        hall. Bash em in. Do it now. 
           Mike beelines towards the hallway.

                                 LOUIS
                        HEY! Where are you going? HEY!

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mike reaches the hallway and finds Happy unconscious on the 
           floor. He grabs Happy’s gun off the ground and goes to a door 
           labeled EMERGENCY EXIT. 

           He opens it, looking down into a massive

           STAIR WELL

           Floors below, he can see figures moving. He SLAMS the door.

                                 MIKE
                        Shit, shit shit. 

           He runs back to the main section of the 26th floor, darting 
           to a pile of construction materials. He pulls back sheets of 
           tarp, uncovering boxes, pipes and cinder blocks. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, kid! John! Give me a hand!

           John goes to him and helps him pick up a GIANT PIPE- about 8 
           feet long and 5 inches in diameter. They carry it together 
           back into the hall. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Hey these guys are all shot!

                                 MIKE
                        We’re all gonna be shot in a 
                        second! Help me!

           Back at the door to the stairwell, Mike and John drop the 
           pipe on the ground, pressing the open end against the door. 
           It almost reaches across the entire hallway- about three 
           inches to spare. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        There’s at least those four others 
                        down there, and I think there’s 
                        another in the security booth. 

           Mike yanks on the door- it collides with the pipe- only 
           giving an inch or so of space to crack. 

                                 ISLA (O.S.)
                        Excuse me.
           Mike and John look over their shoulders. Isla peeks her head 
           out of the bathroom. 

                                 ISLA (CONT’D)
                        Wouldn’t they take the elevators?

           John and Mike’s eyes widen- 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           John and Mike SPRINT down the hallway together- at the end of 
           hall is an elevator- the floor lights above illuminating- 

           The two men crash into the elevator doors and Mike instantly 
           begins clawing at the slit in the elevator. 

                                 JOHN
                        How do you stop it?

                                 MIKE
                        There’s a sensor to make sure it’s 
                        not going to hit anything--

                                 JOHN
                        Does it work?

           The elevator door opens into the shaft. The Elevator is 
           rushing upwards at an alarming rate- 19... 20... 

                                 MIKE
                        FUCK!

           Mike swings his body out into the elevator shaft- feet still 
           on the ground, like Singing’ in the Rain. 

           Closed eyes open. 

           The elevator has stopped two floors lower. Dripping with 
           sweat, Mike eyeballs John and nods.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Someone grab a two by four. 

           On this side of petrified, John obeys. 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           A plank of wood sits lodged into the cracked elevator door, 
           reaching out into the darkness of the shaft. 
           INT. 26TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           Isla holds Jackie’s coat over Gordon’s gunshot wound. Louis 
           pulls himself into his wheelchair, careful not to knock over 
           the explosives detonator. 

           Jackie is cradling the Leopard- resting his head in her lap. 
           She murmurs to him softly. 

           John and Mike re-enter. 

                                 MIKE
                        I bought us some time.

                                 ISLA
                        We don’t have much time. This man’s 
                        been shot. 

           Mike looks over at Gordon. He’s bleeding badly. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Why did you do that?

                                 MIKE
                        Do what?

                                 LOUIS
                        Why did you shoot that guy? They 
                        got what they wanted, they were 
                        going to let us go!

                                 MIKE
                        If it weren’t for me we’d all be 
                        road kill. Wake up dude, we’ve seen 
                        faces, we know names- you think 
                        these guys were going to let us go?

           Louis didn’t think of that.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Alright. Glad that’s settled. 
                        Doesn’t matter now anyway. 

                                 LOUIS
                        You didn’t have to shoot him-

                                 MIKE
                        It doesn’t matter! Look. They 
                        control the elevator so if we let 
                        it up, they can box us in anyway. 
                        Our best bet is the stairs-
                                 JOHN
                        We should stay here. Fuck those 
                        guys, we got guns, we got a 
                        detonator-

                                 JACKIE
                        A detonator is good when you want 
                        to trigger a bomb from far away. 
                        Unless we’re going to blow 
                        ourselves up, that threat’s good 
                        for a limited time. 

                                 MIKE
                        Is he dead?

                                 JACKIE
                        No. Just... Out. 

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Hey. 

           Mike’s attention turns to the walkie sitting on the floor. 

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey idiots. Come in. 

           Mike picks it up. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Don’t provoke them. 

           He takes a breath, eyes locked with Louis’s.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey ass-hat, it’s the idiots, over. 

           Louis looks at him wide eyed and mouths very fucking clearly: 
           WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Tell me if this is funny to you. 

           A moment. 

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           A shaky, frightened voice takes over the frequency. Mike’s 
           cockiness shifts. This is unexpected.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, who is this?
                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        I’m... Elaine Curtis. They... Um. 
                        They told me that... If you don’t 
                        do what they say, they’re going to 
                        kill me. 

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Tell him about your son.

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Uh- uh- my... I’ve got a 6-year-old 
                        son named Nate. He’s my little guy. 

           She’s sobbing. 

                                 ELAINE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want him to have to grow up 
                        without me with him. I just- I 
                        don’t want that. He’s only six! 
                        Please, just do what they ask.

           Mike is taking this seriously now.

                                 MIKE 
                        Elaine. It’s gonna be fine. You’re 
                        gonna see Nate really soon. 

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                        Don’t let them do this to us. 
                        Please. 

                                 MIKE
                        What do you want?

           A beat.

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Is the Leopard up there?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Alive?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        You put him and Simon in the 
                        elevator and send it down to the 
                        sixteenth floor. And we’ll be gone. 
                        And no one else has to die. You got 
                        five minutes.
           Silence. Eternal. Fucking. Silence. 

                                 JOHN
                        So like... We’re gonna take that 
                        deal, right?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. We’re gonna take that deal. 

           Mike begins walking towards Jackie and The Leopard- pistol in 
           his hand. 

                                 JACKIE
                        No. No, no-

                                 MIKE
                        Move- 

                                 JACKIE
                        Wait-

                                 MIKE
                        Fuckin’ move!

           Mike pushes Jackie away from The Leopard’s body. He turns and 
           starts to drag it. The familiar clack-click of a gun echoes 
           through the room. 

           Jackie stands with her legs shoulder width apart, gun in two 
           hands, as if she’s on the firing range. 

                                 JACKIE
                        We’re not doing that. 

                                 MIKE
                        Sweetheart, you know how to use 
                        that thing?

           BANG. 

           She fires a round off into the wall behind Mike. John hits 
           the deck. Isla yelps. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Yeah. I do. Sweetheart. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Okay- can we just all calm down? 
                        The gun thing- I really- we don’t 
                        need to do this with guns. 
                                 MIKE
                        If we don’t do this, they’re going 
                        to start killing people down there. 
                        People like us.

                                 JACKIE
                        That’s their problem. We’re up here 
                        and they’re down there and right 
                        now we have cards. 

                                 MIKE
                        I understand you’re upset. I 
                        understand you’re scared- 

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m not scared- 

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. That’s fine. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Guys- seriously, can we just-

                                 MIKE
                        HEY! SHUT UP! We’re talking!

                                 JACKIE
                        You want to give away all our 
                        leverage.

                                 MIKE
                        No. I don’t care about either of 
                        these guys... But I don’t want 
                        anyone else to die, because of him. 

           Mike shakes his head emphatically. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Not on my fuckin watch. Nuh-uh. 
                        He’s got it coming to him. 

           Mike walks towards GRUMPY’S body. He reaches down-

                                 JACKIE
                        HEY!

           Slowly, Mike reaches into Grumpy’s pocket and retrieves his 
           stolen pack of cigarettes. 

                                 MIKE
                        Do something. 

           He lights a cigarette and sits on the floor, back to a wall. 
           Eyes on Gordon, he shakes his head, taking a deep breath. 
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Hell of a speech this clown gave 
                        earlier. “It’s time for us to take 
                        responsibility” huh? All I been 
                        hearing about all year is the 
                        ‘tragedy of Bailey Gallagher, 
                        Bailey Gallagher, pretty twenty 
                        year old Bailey Gallagher.’ 
                        America’s sweetheart and all. You 
                        know what names you don’t hear?

           Mike inhales his cigarette. 

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           MIKE (a little more put together) his WIFE, SON (10) and 
           DAUGHTER (5) drive together. The children are animatedly and 
           inaudibly talking. Mike is laughing. They all move in slow 
           motion.

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           Mike stares ahead, eyes transfixed with pain. 

                                 MIKE
                        Paula McGrath. Ian McGrath. Jane.

           INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           In slow motion, Mike looks over to his wife. 

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        They didn’t deserve to die.

           His smile melts into a blank stare. A single BRIGHT LIGHT is 
           hurdling straight for the passengers side- so big it looks 
           like an oncoming train. Mike reaches out to his wife-

           SLAM!

           The SOUND smashes back in like thunder as the car spins out 
           into a full 360- the roof supernaturally caves in.

           And then all is quiet. 

                                           M I K E
           INT. WRECKED CAR- SAME MOMENTS

           Mike blinks awake. Blood spills from his shattered nose. He 
           looks down. His wife’s fingers are twitching. He looks up. 
           The roof of the car is so caved in he can barely move. 

           He turns towards the back seat- his face devolves into a 
           scream- 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Mike puffs on his cigarette- eyeing the Leopard’s body.

                                 MIKE
                        It was a high speed chase. The 
                        suspects were two guys. Arnold Pace 
                        and James something. They had 
                        robbed a bank. And in comes “The 
                        Leopard.” In his fucking... Armored 
                        tank thing. Just trying to be stop 
                        the bad guy.

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Mike has a neck brace on, lying on a stretcher. He’s 
           inaudibly screaming as he’s lifted into an ambulance. Three 
           bodies are laid out on the pavement- the sheets covering them 
           are cruelly seeping blood. 

                                 MIKE (V.O.)
                        Just being the hero.

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           Louis, Jackie, Isla and John watch Mike in silence. He stubs 
           his cigarette out on the ground.

                                 MIKE
                        You know what the front page 
                        headline was the next day? 
                        “Mysterious Leopard brings bank 
                        robbers to justice.” Bank robbers. 
                        That money was federally insured. 
                        The only ones getting screwed were 
                        the corporations... So I’m sorry. 

           He looks up at Jackie.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I really am. I understand. But the 
                        old man was right. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Tonight is about looking each other 
                        in the eye and saying “enough.” How 
                        many people get to die because of 
                        him? Tonight I say enough. 

           Mike stands, gun in hand, and walks towards The Leopard. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        We got about two minutes. Hey- kid. 
                        Help me out with this guy. 

           Jackie steps over The Leopard’s body. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m not letting you take him. 

           Flabbergasted, Mike stares at her.

                                 MIKE
                        What the hell is it with you?

           A phone rings. An awkward beat.

                                 ISLA
                        Am I the only one who hears a 
                        telephone?

                                 LOUIS
                        No. I hear that. 

                                 JOHN
                        Where’s that coming from?

           In the far corner of the floor is a set of corded phones, 
           awaiting their proper installation. 

           John goes to them. He picks up one. The phone keeps ringing. 
           He picks up another. Another. Another.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

                                 NEGOTIATOR (V.O.)
                        This is Captain Frank Hobbes. I’d 
                        like to speak to someone in charge 
                        to negotiate releasing some of the 
                        hostages.

                                 JOHN
                             (to phone)
                        Um. Hold please.

           He puts the phone to his chest.
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Cops.

                                 LOUIS
                        Thank Christ. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Tell them to come get us. 

                                 MIKE
                        Gimmie the phone-

                                 JACKIE
                        You stay where you are. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Guys-

                                 ISLA
                        I’ll take it. 

           John hands the phone to Isla.

                                 ISLA (CONT’D)
                        This is Isla Bloom.

                                 NEGOTIATOR (V.O.)
                        ...Uh... Ma’am, are you one of the 
                        captors?

                                 ISLA
                        No, I was a hostage.

                                 NEGOTIATOR (V.O.)
                        Say again, you were a hostage?

                                 ISLA
                        I might still be. Things are a 
                        little foggy right now. We’re all 
                        sorting it out up here.

                                 NEGOTIATOR (V.O.)
                        Are you under duress?

                                 ISLA
                        It’s very complicated.

                                 NEGOTIATOR (V.O.)
                        We’d like to send in a medical team 
                        so that we can attend to the 
                        wounded. Will they allow that?
                                 ISLA
                        I can’t speak for them, none of 
                        them are here. Um. There are 
                        several men very wounded. Mr. 
                        Gallagher has been shot in the 
                        abdomen area, I’m very worried 
                        about him.

                                 NEGOTIATOR (V.O.)
                        Ma’am, to be clear-

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Hey. Idiot. 

           The Walkie comes in loud. 

           Jackie and Mike lock eyes.

                                 JACKIE
                        Don’t pick it up. 

                                 MIKE
                        I’m picking it up. 

           Her eyes widen- an expression somewhere between pleading and 
           warning. Don’t. 

           He does. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m here.

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Where’s our package?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorting it out, pal, but you 
                        gotta give me more time. 

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Come here. 

           A moment. 

                                 MIKE
                        NO, NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT-

                                 ELAINE (O.S.)
                             (a little distant)
                        NO! NO PLEASE! PLEASE!

           She begins shrieking. Voices can be heard yelling.
                                 MIKE
                        NO- NO- WAIT- WAIT!

           Mike runs towards the Leopard and grabs him by his foot. He 
           begins to DRAG the Leopard towards the elevators and-- 

           BANG BANG. 

           Mike goes down. 

           Isla drops the telephone at her feet. 

                                 NEGOTIATOR (V.O.)
                        Ma’am? Hello? Hello? 

           The walkie lies on the ground in a growing pool of blood. 

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        Bye Elaine. You can stop this. All 
                        you have to do is put Simon and The 
                        Leopard in the elevator. And it all 
                        stops. 

           Jackie picks up the walkie. 

                                 JACKIE
                        He’s still alive. And when he wakes 
                        up, he’s going to beat you all to 
                        death with his bare hands. I’d 
                        leave while you still can. 

           Jackie snaps the walkie into the off position. John, Isla and 
           Louis stare at her. 

                                 LOUIS
                        What the hell did you just do?

                                 JOHN
                        We’ve got to get out of here. 

                                 JACKIE
                        We’re not leaving him. I’m not 
                        leaving him. 

                                 ISLA
                        ... Then we hide. 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - LATER

           Jackie, John and Louis are in the hallway. John diligently 
           ties up Happy’s unconscious body.  

           Jackie hands Louis the pistol.
                                 JACKIE
                        Just point and shoot, okay? Try not 
                        to hit me. 

           She carefully rolls the pipe aside to allow the door more 
           give. She pokes her head down into 

           THE STAIRWELL. 

           It’s empty. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        It’s clear. 

                                 JOHN
                        How are we going to do this?

                                 JACKIE
                        We use the elevator they can see 
                        where we are. If we go down the 
                        stairs we can hide on a lower 
                        floor. Maybe even get past them, 
                        back down to the ground.

                                 JOHN
                        How are we going to... Move our... 
                        People?

           Jackie eyes Louis. 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           John pushes the unconscious Leopard in Louis’s wheelchair. 
           Louis sits on the ground by the door, guarding the pipe. 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           Isla kneels over Gordon’s body. She checks for a pulse.

                                 JACKIE
                        Is he alive?

                                 ISLA
                        I can’t tell.

                                 JACKIE
                        Is he breathing?

           Isla puts her face close to his. 

                                 ISLA
                        Yes. 
           Jackie is on her knees by Mike’s body. She takes off her 
           outer shirt and begins to rip it. She ties a tourniquet 
           around Mike’s shoulder and waist, leaving her in a tank top. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Put his feet up. It’ll help the 
                        blood to keep moving. Tie that 
                        tighter on him.

                                 ISLA
                        Shouldn’t we bring them too?

                                 JACKIE
                        We’ll try. Come on. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           The stairwell is dark and seemingly endless. Jackie and Isla 
           hold the wheelchair. Louis clutches onto John’s back.

                                 ISLA
                        We have a long way to go.

                                 JACKIE
                        All downhill from here, right?

           The wheelchair, loaded with The Leopard- goes down the first 
           step with Jackie and John guiding it. They almost instantly 
           lose control and it stumbles down a second step. 

           Straining, they lean the wheelchair backwards until The 
           Leopard’s head is practically on the stairs.

                                 LOUIS
                        Put me down, put me down-

           John puts Louis down and grabs the edge of the chair, 
           steadying it. It teeters on the edge of another step. The 
           Leopard balances precariously.

           John ambles in front of the chair and helps to guide it down 
           from the front.

                                 JOHN
                        This guy must weigh 200 pounds.

                                 JACKIE
                        Shhh. They might be guarding the 
                        stairs.

           John leads, carefully stepping backwards down the stairs as 
           he guides the wheelchair. 
           Jackie does her best to keep it steady as the wheels slam 
           down each step. One. After. The. Other. 

           Isla follows behind them. Louis hangs onto the railing, 
           pulling himself down the stairs without the use of his legs. 

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           An empty hallway. A door clicks and slowly opens. John pokes 
           his head out through the crack. 

                                 JOHN
                        Okay.

           The door swings open and the foursome emerge from the stair 
           case onto the  22nd floor- which is completely furnished and 
           finished- not under construction at all.

           Jackie pushes The Leopard in the chair. Isla and John follow. 
           Louis drags himself out of the doorway and into the hallway. 
           Exhausted, he stops.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           Louis waves him on.

                                 LOUIS
                        I’ll be right there. 

           They wheel The Leopard down the hall. Louis takes a deep 
           breath, dripping with sweat. 

           He looks up. 

           At the end of the hallway is a small SECURITY CAMERA. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Fuuuuuuuuuuck.

           Louis continues crawling along the carpet as quickly as he 
           can. He reaches the door his companions went through and 
           closes it behind him.

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A small office kitchen. Louis pulls himself into the room as 
           John struggles to lean The Leopard against the wall.

                                 LOUIS
                        There are cameras. 
                                 ISLA
                        What?

                                 LOUIS
                        In the halls.

                                 JOHN
                        Did they see us?

                                 LOUIS
                        If someone was watching the 
                        monitors they saw us, yeah.  

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll just take them out-

                                 LOUIS
                        NO. No, no. If they see they’re out 
                        they’ll know we are here. 

                                 JACKIE
                        They might know that already. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Look. The security station controls 
                        everything. The cameras. The 
                        monitors. The elevators. The.. 
                        The.. LIGHTS, I bet. If we get 
                        control of that... We get control 
                        of everything. The lobby. We can 
                        just... Walk out. 

                                 JACKIE
                        But whoever is in there is going to 
                        have a gun. Guns. 

                                 JOHN
                        We got two guns.

                                 JACKIE
                        What we don’t have is a small army 
                        of trained... Whatever these guys 
                        are. You really ready to shoot 
                        someone?

                                 JOHN
                        Me? Imma let you do all that. 

                                 ISLA
                        Are there cameras in the stairwell?

                                 LOUIS
                        I didn’t see any. 
                                 JACKIE
                        So if we can make it down the 
                        stairs, we could make it down to 
                        the security station without anyone 
                        knowing. 

                                 JOHN
                        If. 

                                 JACKIE
                        If. 

           She looks at The Leopard.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        What about him?

                                 LOUIS
                        I’ll stay with him. Here. I can’t 
                        do any more stairs. Neither can he. 

           Jackie nods. Acceptable. She looks to Isla, then to John. A 
           70 year old and a 20 year old. And her. 

                                 JACKIE
                        So it’s us three... Okay. 

           Jackie hands Louis her gun. 

                                 JOHN
                        Lady, I ain’t running at no armed 
                        dude with no gun!

                                 JACKIE
                        If someone comes up here, how is he 
                        going to protect himself-

                                 JOHN
                        That’s another IF!

                                 LOUIS
                        It’s fine.

           Louis wheels himself to the kitchen counter and takes out a 
           carving knife from a rack.

                                 ISLA
                        What? You’re going to run over 
                        their feet while you stab them?

                                 LOUIS
                        If they didn’t see us come in here, 
                        we’re hidden. On a random floor. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        They’d have to check the entire 
                        building. You have to move quick. 
                        And either make no noise at all... 
                        Or make a lot of noise so I know it 
                        didn’t work.

           That shuts everyone up. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Okay.

           The trio heads towards the door.

                                 LOUIS
                        Be as quick as you can in that 
                        hallway. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Take care of him. 

           A beat. Jackie looks to John. Then to Isla. They all give 
           each other reaffirming looks: we’re fucking in it together.

           The door swings open and out they go.

           Now it’s just The Leopard and Louis, brandishing a cleaver in 
           his hand and his eyes on the unconscious vigilante. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I will. 

           Cut to black. 

                                          L O U I S

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           The door to a SHIPPING CONTAINER swings open. LOUIS is on his 
           feet. He and another HENCHMAN (19) stand at the opening. 
           Behind them are dozens of boxes.

                                 LOUIS
                        Come on. Help me.

           Louis walks over to the boxes and begins to pile them into 
           the back of the shipping container. 

                                 HENCHMAN
                        You sure this is the right one?
                                 LOUIS
                        Look, this is simple. We pile the 
                        boxes in the container. We switch 
                        the serial numbers. We go home. 
                        I’ve done this ten thousand times.

                                 HENCHMAN
                        Cool.

                                 LOUIS
                        Where’d they find you.

                                 HENCHMAN
                        Around.

                                 LOUIS
                        Around. You look like you’re 
                        twelve.

                                 HENCHMAN
                        Fuck you.

                                 LOUIS
                        Fuck you. I’m just saying. You kids 
                        keep getting younger. They draft 
                        you outta high school for this gig?

                                 HENCHMAN
                        Just need something that pays. I 
                        got my mom.

                                 LOUIS
                        Everyone’s got someone.

           They keep stacking boxes.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Look. None of my business... But 
                        I’d advise... Keep your head down. 
                        Work the docks. Work this shipping 
                        stuff. You really want to help your 
                        mom? Don’t agree to do anything 
                        where they give you a gun.

                                 HENCHMAN
                        Bet it pays better.

                                 LOUIS
                        A lot better. But you’ll end up in 
                        some cock knocker’s gang war where 
                        a total psycho is banging it out 
                        with an assault rifle. Having a gun 
                        puts a target on your back. Keep it 
                        safe. Stick to drugs. 
           CLANG.

           Louis reaches into his jeans and pulls out a HANDGUN.

                                 HENCHMAN
                        I thought you said stay away from 
                        guns.

                                 LOUIS
                        That’s you, not me. Just stay here. 
                        Probably ain’t nothing.

           Louis steps out of the container and into the belly of the 
           warehouse.

           Hundreds of shipment containers are stacked along each other. 
           Gun aimed into the darkness, Louis walks down a narrow 
           opening between two containers. 

           Another CLANG. Louis turns.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Kid?

           His voice echoes back to him.

           He takes a breath.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Come on you mother. I’m ready 
                        for yo-

           Out of the darkness, a hand grabs Louis by the shoulder and 
           violently YANKS him into oblivion.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Louis opens his eyes. He’s staring straight down to pavement. 
           He looks up. His ankles have wire wrapped around them- 
           suspending him in mid-air. Louis spins, upside down.

           Spinning, he comes face to face with the masked LEOPARD.

                                 LOUIS
                        Oh God, no. Don’t kill me.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        You work for the Saveros. 

                                 LOUIS
                        I just move weight for him! It’s 
                        like stocking the vending machines, 
                        no big deal!
                                 THE LEOPARD
                        You sell drugs to children.

                                 LOUIS
                        I DON’T SELL SHIT! I’m just a- I’m 
                        just a dumb guy! Man!

           The Leopard reaches back and produces Louis’s gun. He puts 
           the barrel against his face.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Okayokayokay-

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Just a dumb guy. With a gun.

           The Leopard grabs Louis by his collar and pulls him close to 
           his mark.

                                 THE LEOPARD (CONT’D)
                        Get off the streets. I’m not going 
                        to tell you again.

           The Leopard begins to walk away. Louis grits his teeth.

                                 LOUIS
                        I can’t wait until someone gets the 
                        drop on you. You dressed-up faggot!

           The Leopard stops. He turns. He slowly walks back to Louis, 
           removing a blade from his wrist.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Wait wait wait-

           He lashes out- cutting the suspension wire clean through. 
           Louis lets out a blood-curdling scream as he falls a single 
           story down to the ground below.

           Cut to black on the sound of his bones snapping in half.

           INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Sporting two deep black circles around his eyes, Louis 
           regains consciousness. His skin is practically green. He has 
           a neck brace on. He’s sitting upright in a hospital bed. 

           A heart monitor beeps rhythmically. 

           He looks at his palms, turning them over. IVs plugged into 
           the back of his hands. He moves his fingers. He looks down to 
           his feet, clearing his throat. 
           He looks to the night stand next to him. There’s a plate of 
           untouched hospital food. A plastic fork and knife. He grabs 
           the fork. He presses it against his chest. 

           A wince of pain.

           He pushes the fork into his hip. He winces again. 

           Pulling back the covers reveals the braces on his legs. They 
           are covered in stitches, gauze- that yellow iodine stain, 
           these are Frankenstein legs, reassembled flesh.

           He pokes the fork into his thigh. He pokes his thigh again. 
           Deeper. 

           He pushes until he bleeds.

           Louis removes the fork, looking at the blood on tip.

                                 LOUIS
                        Oh, God.

           Leaning as far forward as he can, he jabs the fork into his 
           knee. He jams the fork into both of his legs in a panic. 

           The hear rate monitor goes wild. Fork stuck in his leg, Louis 
           leans back and begins to cry.

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Louis looks at the knife in his hand. Then to The Leopard. 
           And back down to the knife. He breathes. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - LATER

           John, Isla and Jackie descend the stairs together. 

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - BASEMENT - SAME MOMENTS

           The drums of the explosives are continuing to count down. It 
           switches from 1:00:00 to 00:59:59. 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           One of the many phones in the corner is ringing off the hook.

           SIMON opens his eyes. 
           INT. 8TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           John, Jackie and Isla exit the stairway to the 8th floor. Gun 
           in hand, Jackie leads them down the hallway. 

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - SECURITY ROOM - SAME MOMENTS

           Doc sits in the security room, blinking.

                        Um... Hello? Guys?

                        What’s up?

                                 DOC
                        I got three bogies on the 8th 
                        floor.

                                 BASHFUL (O.S.)
                        8th floor? Where you are?

                                 DOC
                        Yes! Where I am....

           Doc examines the screens.

                        They’ve got guns. Someone get down 
                        here right now before they blow 
                        this whole thing. NOW. NOW.

                        On it. 

           INT. 8TH FLOOR - SAME MOMENTS

           Turning a corner, the trio stops. 

           A long stretch of hall. At the end of which is a white door 
           with the words SECURITY on it. A dead security guard lies by 
           a closed door. 

                                 JOHN
                        That’s it.

                                 JACKIE
                        No shit.

                                 JOHN
                        What do we do?
                                 JACKIE
                        Maybe they don’t know we’re here 
                        yet-

           The door to the security open swings open and DOC meets them 
           head on with a machine gun, firing wildly into the hall-

           Isla gets SHOT square into the chest- falling into the wall 
           behind her, blood spraying everywhere.

           John gets hit in the arm, dropping the gun as he dives for 
           the adjacent hallway. Jackie jumps the opposite way at the t-
           intersection, unscathed. 

           BANGBANGBANGBANG.

                                 JOHN
                        RUN! RUN!

           Jackie looks around the corner as Doc reloads- she stands, 
           takes aim-

           POP. One shot.

           She hits Doc square in the head from all the way down the 
           hall. It’s fucking magical. John stares at her incredulously.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Is this the part where you tell me 
                        you’re an international assassin?

           Jackie drops to her knees in sheer panicked exhaustion.

                                 JACKIE
                        No. I just don’t want to die 
                        tonight.

           He nods.

                                 JOHN
                        So... 

           Jackie is locked in place. Unmoving. Isla’s body is splayed 
           and bloody behind her. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I don’t want to look at her.

                                 JOHN
                        We just gotta... Gotta... Oof. 

                                 JACKIE
                        You okay?
                                 JOHN
                        Hard to see.

                                 JACKIE
                        You’re going into shock.

                                 JOHN
                        Sounds right. We gotta get the hall 
                        down that hallway, press some 
                        buttons and fuck some shit up. And 
                        then...  And then lets go home.

                                 JACKIE
                        Do you need help walking.

           He nods.

                                 JOHN
                        Yes’um 

           She rises, helping John to his feet. Clutching his bleeding 
           arm, they walk down the hallway together.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - SECURITY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           John slumps down into the office chair. He looks over the 
           monitors. 

                                 JACKIE
                        You know what you’re doing?

           He shrugs.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m young. This is a computer. It 
                        works itself out.

                                 JACKIE
                        Do they have anything like... 
                        Rigged to blow up?

           He nods to himself, scanning the interface. 

                                 JOHN
                        Note to self, don’t blow us up.

           He starts to click.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Disabling cameras. This is the 
                        lobby. The security doors. 
                        Parking... Elevators... Unlock. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Unlock. Disable. Open... Okay. So I 
                        can-

           His eyes go to a wedge of a monitor.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Oh... No.

           The bottom of the square reads 16. It’s a large conference 
           room littered with eight dead bodies. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        That’s... 

                                 JACKIE
                        They killed them. 

           Jackie puts her hand to her mouth in horror.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        They just killed them. 

                                 JOHN
                        Um... Jack... Where are the... 
                        Where the guys with guns at?

           She blinks. Indeed- the dead bodies are not guarded 
           whatsoever. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Get up, get up, get up-

           Jackie pulls John to his feet and yanks him back into 

           THE HALLWAY

           They’re running- Jackie tugging on John to keep up. 

           They turn a corner-

           BANG!

           Jackie screams as JOHN gets shot in the head. 

                                 DOPEY
                        GET HER!

           She doubles back the other way, sprinting as fast as she can. 
           The sounds of her captors are closing in. She gets to the end 
           of the hall and takes a hard right as DOPEY and SNEEZY round 
           the corner behind her. 

           Panicked, she runs down anonymous white hallways of a 
           seemingly endless corporate labyrinth. 
           She turns a corner.

           Another. 

           Another. 

           She’s lost in there. 

           Ahead of her is the elevator- the doors are opened. She 
           sprints towards it- running and sliding like it’s home plate. 

           She lunges back and slams the ground floor button. The doors 
           start to close. Tears streaming down her face, she points the 
           gun down the hallway, waiting for the doors to close.

                                 JACKIE
                        Come on come on come one please-

           Sneezy rounds the corner- Jackie starts to unload. The doors 
           start to close for her- finally trapping her in

           THE ELEVATOR.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh god. Thank God. Thank you. Thank 
                        you.

           She drops the gun and falls into her tears. The numbers on 
           the elevator go down. 7... 6... 5... 

           Her thumb hits the stop button. The elevator stops. 

           Ashen. She sits in silence for a moment. Her eyes go up to a 
           button. The one that says 24. 

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Louis pokes his head out of the kitchen, looking into the 
           empty hallways.

           Behind him, The Leopard rises to his feet. Louis looks back 
           to him.

                                 LOUIS
                        ...Hi.

           Leaning against the wall, The Leopard removes his padded 
           glove with his teeth. He digs his fingers into his kevlar 
           vest, yanking out the bullet with a groan. 

           The bullet is crushed and did indeed pierce his skin, but 
           didn’t go all the way in. It’s tipped with his blood. The 
           Leopard looks around, disoriented. 
                                 THE LEOPARD
                        What happened?

                                 LOUIS
                        That’s... Uh... I don’t quite know 
                        how to answer that.

           The Leopard nods. He feels his face.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        My mask.

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah. You... Took it off.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Is everyone out of the building?

                                 LOUIS
                        Do you remember me?

           This sobers The Leopard even further.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        I wouldn’t have thought you 
                        would... Just asking... But we 
                        actually met before. 

           Taking it in The Leopard clocks his surroundings, the 
           details. That wheelchair.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        I grew up in Chapel Hill.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Okay.

                                 LOUIS
                        Chapel Hill. Bad area... Real bad. 
                        No Mom. Shitty Dad. All those 
                        cliches. Started doing odd jobs to 
                        make ends meet. And then the jobs 
                        got odder. And then they got 
                        badder. And then I was shipping 
                        drugs and passing notes for the 
                        Saveros. Mobbed up, I guess. I 
                        wasn’t anyone important, and my 
                        heart wasn’t in it. In comics and 
                        shit I’d just be the nameless 
                        henchman. But I was a criminal. 
                        Never killed nobody. Could’ve. 
                        But... When I lost my legs, I lost 
                        the streets. And I had to figure 
                        something else out. I got clean. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                        Quick. Started working at St. Joe’s 
                        Youth Center. I didn’t think they’d 
                        even consider letting me work. But 
                        they took me in. Said I’d be the 
                        cautionary tale. Show the kids that 
                        mobbed up doesn’t mean you get to 
                        be Scarface. When you took away my 
                        legs... That... I don’t know. It 
                        kinda made shit start to work out 
                        for me. For once. So... Fucking 
                        weird saying this. But... Thank 
                        you.

           A long, long beat.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Okay. 

           The Leopard begins to limp towards the door.

                                 LOUIS
                        Where are you going?

           He stops in the doorway.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Stay here. I think you’re... Safe.

                                 LOUIS
                        Wait-

           The Leopard turns. Louis reaches into the pouch in the back 
           of his wheelchair. He produces The Leopard’s HELMET. The 
           Leopard looks at him warily and takes it.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        What’s your name?

                                 LOUIS
                        Louis. Louis Pratt.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        St. Joe’s. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah.

           The Leopard dawns his mask. His presence suddenly shifts into 
           an elemental being.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Give em hell. 
           He disappears down the hallway. Louis wheels himself back 
           into the kitchen. He looks at the shelves. They are stacked 
           with snacks. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Jackie’s finger looms over the button panel. She hits a 
           number. The indicator above starts to rise. 5... 6.... 7... 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           SNEEZY AND BASHFUL turn the corner from the hallway into the 
           core of the blood soaked room. Simon sits up against the 
           wall, as if waiting for them.

                                 SIMON
                        Hiya, fellas. 

           Bashful and Sneezy go to him. 

                                 BASHFUL
                             (into his earpiece)
                        Doc. Hello? Anyone?

                                 SNEEZY
                        How you feeling, boss?

                                 SIMON
                        I’ve been better. 

                                 SNEEZY
                        We gonna stick to our exit 
                        strategy?

           Simon shakes his head. 

                                 SIMON
                        Is he dead yet?

           Sneezy and Bashful glance at each other.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Then we’re not done. 

           Grimacing, Simon rises to his feet, working with the pain of 
           his shot up body. 

           The telephone rings. 

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?
                                 BASHFUL
                        Phone.

           Simon looks over to the pile of phones in the corner.

                                 SIMON
                        That’s kinda funny. 

           Loopy, Simon hobbles over to the phones. He picks up one. The 
           phone keeps ringing. He picks up another. Still ringing.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        What the fuuuuuck...

           Another. The phone stops ringing. He puts it to his ear. 

                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        Hello? Ma’am? This is Captain 
                        Hobbes again. We’d like to speak to 
                        someone in charge so we can provide 
                        medical assistance and maybe bring 
                        some food and water in. How about a 
                        pizza? Would you folks like that?

           Simon drops the phone on the ground. 

                                 SIMON
                        Come on. They didn’t take him far. 

           He looks down at the ground. There’s a trail of blood spatter 
           all the way down the hall.

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’ Pocahontas.  

           Simon, Sneezy and Bashful disappear into the stairwell, 
           leaving the bloody mess behind. 

           Pulling back to reveal: Gordon Gallagher’s eyes are opened. 

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jackie slowly opens the door. The Leopard is not where she 
           left him.

           Louis sits by the kitchen table, eating from a bag of 
           pretzels. He blinks- surprised to see her. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Hi.

                                 JACKIE
                        Where is he.
                                 LOUIS
                        He woke up.

                                 JACKIE
                        He’s okay?

                                 LOUIS
                        He’s kinda hard to read.

                                 JACKIE
                        Where is he?

                                 LOUIS
                        Uh- I don’t uh- know what happened 
                        to you since the last time I saw-

                                 JACKIE
                        They’re dead, Louis. They’re- I 
                        think there are more still in the 
                        building-

                                 LOUIS
                        Why the hell did you come back?

                                 JACKIE
                        ... I had to.

                                 LOUIS
                        Shut the door.

           She does.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Put a chair against it.

           She grabs the dinky kitchen chair and places it by the door, 
           bracing it against the handle. 

           Louis raises his index finger to his lips.

           She nods, gripping her gun. She kneels down. 

           Her attention goes to the floor. There’s a blood trail all 
           around them leading to under the door.

           At that moment: the sound of a door opening. Muffled voices. 
           Through the wall, a low murmur. A metal cla-click clearly 
           registers above the low din. Louis widens his eyes.

           Jackie looks to the door handle. It twists ominously. 
           Creaking- a push against the door. The chair slides against 
           the carpet just a little, but doesn’t give. 

           More murmurs.
           BRRRRRRRRAPPP!

           MACHINE GUN FIRE blasts through the walls in a vicious line- 
           Jackie drops to the ground- plaster and insulation falls 
           everywhere as the wall is ripped to shit. 

           The spray of bullets suddenly goes upwards, making an 
           intentional spike to the ceiling.

           The gunfire stops. It’s replaced by screaming.

                                 SIMON (O.S.)
                        NO! NO! I’LL KILL YOU, YOU FUCK! 
                        YOU FUCK!

           Sounds of intense struggling are coupled with a body banging 
           into the wall, cracking it around the bullet holes. 

           Jackie sits up- slowly. She looks clean through one of the 
           bullet holes. She catches glimpses of Simon, surrounded by 
           yellow smoke, shooting into nothingness, screaming like a mad 
           man. Bleeding. 

           The Leopard appears to his right- Simon turns, pulling the 
           trigger to his gun- BANG BANG BANG!

           He hits The Leopard nearly point blank. The Leopard manages 
           to reach him, punching him so hard, Simon spins straight into 
           the wall and bounces off it, finally falling to the ground.

           The Leopard collapses with him.

           Jackie covers her mouth, tears welling in her eyes. She turns 
           and catches the scream in her throat. 

           Louis’s face has been blown off. His body lies limply in his 
           wheelchair. Yellow smoke seeps in through the bullet holes.

           Jackie rises. She limps down the hallway. Stepping over 
           Bashful, Sneezy and Simon’s bodies until she finally reaches 
           The Leopard, collapsed on the ground.

           Crying, she turns him over. Blood is pouring out of his suit. 
           She reaches to the back of his neck and unclasps his mask, 
           removing it.

                                 JACKIE
                        Wake up. Wake up, please. Don’t do 
                        this to me. Please. Wake up. 

           She cradle shim close.
                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        I love you. You hear me? I love 
                        you.

           BELLS RING. 

           Cut to black. 

                                          J A C K I E

           INT. CHURCH - DRESSING ROOM - MORNING - FLASHBACK

           Dressed in a wedding gown, Jackie sits in front of a mirror. 
           Church bells ring. Bridesmaids flutter around. A knock. 

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Jackie? Jackie?

           Jackie looks up. 

                                 OLDER WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Sean needs to talk to you.

                                 JACKIE
                        Now?

           She nods. Jackie rises.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Ladies- can you... 

           The Bridesmaids take it in and quickly file out- leaving 
           Jackie alone in the room. The Older Woman closes the door for 
           a moment. 

           It reopens. Jackie turns, putting her hands over her eyes- 
           beaming.

                                 JACKIE
                        Close your eyes! We’re not supposed 
                        to see each other!

           SEAN (30) comes in. His eyes are red. He’s jittery. He 
           doesn’t close his eyes.

                                 SEAN
                        Jackie. 

                                 JACKIE
                        I’m listening, I just don’t want to 
                        see you, it’s bad luck-
                                 SEAN
                        Jack.

           She hesitates- then drops her hand, seeing him in the mirror. 

                                 SEAN (CONT’D)
                        ... I can’t do this.

                                 JACKIE
                        You can’t do what?

                                 SEAN
                        I can’t do this. I can’t do today. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Um... Okay. Look. I’m nervous too. 
                        I know the whole thing has been a 
                        lot with the meals and the 
                        playlists and the fucking linens, 
                        but we’re here- this is the fun 
                        part now!

                                 SEAN
                        No- I... I’m not doing it.

           Jackie sobers up. 

                                 JACKIE
                        You’re not doing it, like... You 
                        don’t want to get married to me?

                                 SEAN
                        I just can’t. 

                                 JACKIE
                        You don’t want to. 

           Silence.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Can you do me the... Fucking 
                        courtesy of saying what you mean 
                        for once?

                                 SEAN
                        I do not love you.

           Jackie hesitates. A smile comes over her face. A smile with 
           tears.

                                 JACKIE
                        What, uh- what have we been doing 
                        for... For five years, Sean? What 
                        has this been? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACKIE (CONT'D)
                        I mean, are you trying to prove 
                        some point? Are you- are you- are 
                        you sleeping with someone else? We 
                        made promises to each other, Sean. 
                        Where did all of that go? Why did I 
                        move? Why did I leave my life 
                        behind for you? Why did I sit 
                        through those awful dinners with 
                        your pompous father? Why did I help 
                        your sister buy a car? Why did I 
                        cut back on drinking? Why did I 
                        swallow your cum? Those are 
                        promises, Sean. Those are all 
                        promises that you make when you’re 
                        an adult and you decide to spend 
                        your life with someone- I mean- why 
                        did you even ask me to marry you? 
                        What the fuck are you doing, Sean?

                                 SEAN
                        I’m sorry. I just... I don’t want 
                        this. I just wasn’t sure... 

                                 JACKIE
                        Fuck you. FUCK YOU! You god damn 
                        child!

                                 SEAN
                        Okay. 

           Sean turns and walks away. Jackie stands- she follows him out 
           and into 

           THE CHAPEL

                                 JACKIE
                        Fuck you! Sean! Shame on you! You 
                        fucking coward! Sean!

           He’s out the door- and into the world. Jackie watches him 
           walk quickly down the front steps of the church. Behind her, 
           the entire wedding party and guests have assembled, ready for 
           the big show.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        SEAN! 

           She watches him go. Wedding guests start to rise, unsure of 
           what to do.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        SEAN. 
           EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Still wearing her wedding gown, Jackie sits on a lawn chair 
           on a well designed roof patio, drunkenly singing to herself. 
           Her makeup has run down her face- she’s had a rough day.  

           She rises and begins to walk towards the edge of the roof. 
           Looking down, it’s a long way to the street. Thirty floors. 

           Part of her lace veil is still in her hair. The wind blows- 
           whipping it into the air. She grabs for it- missing. 

           She watches it flutter through the night sky, frowning sadly. 

           From what feels like miles away- a small POP. 

           Past the fluttering veil- she sees a shadowy figure running 
           along a rooftop, maybe half a block away. Behind him, more 
           figures. There’s yelling. It almost sounds like laughter- it 
           could be a party.

                                 JACKIE
                        At least someone’s having fun 
                        tonight. 

           She sighs, watching the commotion out of the corner of her 
           eye. The shadowy figure LEAPS- diving off the rooftop and 
           down to the street. 

           Jackie screams. 

           The shadowy figure hits a fire escape on his way down, then 
           collapses into a dumpster. 

           Silence. 

           Jackie bolts. 

           EXT. CITY STREET- NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Jackie races across an abandoned street and into an alley. 
           Her eyes go to the dumpsters in the corner- a man is hanging 
           half in-half out. The Leopard. 

           She pushes a hand on his shoulder.

                                 JACKIE
                        Hey-

           He groans.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh- shit. 
           Behind her, THREE MEN appear at the mouth of the alley. 

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! There’s a guy! He fell off the 
                        roof! Can you call someone?

           The three Men approach her. They pass Jackie by and go 
           straight to The Leopard, dragging him out of the dumpster. He 
           hits the ground with a thud.

                                 THUG 1
                        What about her?

           The Men eye her. Jackie notices the guns in their hand. 

                                 JACKIE
                        Oh- wait. Hey- I’m just... I’m 
                        really drunk right now, I should 
                        probably go- excuse me-

           One of the Men grabs her by her wrist-

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Please- let go-

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Hey-

           From the floor, The Leopard kicks out his feet- stamping his 
           heel straight into one of the attackers knees. A gun goes 
           off. Jackie screams as The Leopard launches himself between 
           her and the three goons. 

           With violent efficiency The Leopard takes all three of them 
           down. Elbows. Feet. Head butts. It’s like knocking over 
           dominos with these guys. 

           Cowered against the wall, Jackie watches The Leopard. All is 
           quiet. He takes a breath, then turns his attention to her.

                                 THE LEOPARD (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

           She nods frantically, drunk and in shock.

                                 THE LEOPARD (CONT’D)
                        Why are you dressed like that?

           Jackie blinks.

                                 JACKIE
                        What?
                                 THE LEOPARD
                        The Police will be here soon. Tell 
                        them what you saw. 

           He starts to walk away.

                                 JACKIE
                        I was supposed to get married 
                        today. He... He left me. 

           The Leopard stops. He looks over his shoulder. 

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        You deserve better. 

           And then he’s gone. 

           Jackie sits in the alley, three unconscious guys at her feet, 
           a wedding dress partially muddied. Her eyes full of wonder. 

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The yellow smoke is clearing. Bullet holes, blood, dead 
           bodies. And Jackie. Sitting in the middle of it all, cradling 
           The Leopard. 

           INT. 26TH FLOOR - NIGHT

           MIKE opens his eyes to the sound of the ringing telephone. 
           Groaning, he rolls onto his stomach. 

           To his surprise, Gordon Gallagher is sitting on the edge of 
           the building, his feet dangling out the gap where the window 
           should be. 

           The phone is still ringing. Mike looks at the line of wires. 
           Gordon is holding the handset in his lap. Slowly, Mike rises 
           and walks.

                                 MIKE
                        Mind if I join you?

           Gordon has a cigarette between his lips. He’s pale, ashen, 
           looks like total shit. He shrugs. Free country. Mike sits 
           next to him.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        You seem like you wanna answer 
                        that.

                                 GORDON
                        I don’t know. 
           Mike nods. Gordon picks up.

                                 GORDON (CONT’D)
                        Hello.

                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        This is Captain Frank Hobbes. Who 
                        am I speaking to?

                                 GORDON
                        This is Gordon Gallagher.

                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        ...Jesus. Mr. Gallagher, are you 
                        safe?

           Gordon looks around. He and Mike are the only other guys 
           alive there. 

                                 GORDON
                        I think? There’s just me and some 
                        other guy.

                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        A hostage?

                                 GORDON
                        Are you a hostage?

                                 MIKE
                        Sure.

                                 GORDON
                        Sure. 

                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        Can you verify the location of your 
                        captors?

                                 GORDON
                        Hold on. 

           He puts the phone to his chest. 

                                 GORDON (CONT’D)
                        You know where anyone is?

           Mike shakes his head. 

                                 GORDON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know. I’m actually shot 
                        quite badly. In my stomach. It’s... 
                        Well it was quite painful, but 
                        right now I don’t feel anything.
                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        What floor are you on, sir?

                                 GORDON

                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        And it’s just the two of you?

                                 GORDON
                        Far as I know. 

                                 NEGOTIATOR
                        Sit tight, Mr. Gallagher. We’re 
                        sending SWAT and medical in. 
                        They’re going from bottom to top. 

                                 GORDON
                        Alrighty. 

           Gordon hangs up. The two men sit in silence. Gordon looks 
           over to Mike and blinks.

           Mike is holding the DETONATOR. 

                                 MIKE
                        Hey can I get one of those?

           Gordon realizes he’s talking about the cigarettes and offers 
           him the pack.

                                 GORDON
                        I think they’re yours anyway.

           Mike grins at this as he lights up. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. 

           He takes a deep drag.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        My wife got me to quit smoking. I 
                        picked it back up after she died. I 
                        feel bad about that. 

           Gordon nods. 

                                 GORDON
                        24th floor, huh?

                                 MIKE
                        Uh-huh.
                                 GORDON
                        Then this is where she died. I 
                        guess that was symbolic for him... 
                        Bailey. I mean. This is where she 
                        died.

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry.

           Silence.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I been thinking... About pulling 
                        this trigger. Just... The Leopard. 
                        These psychos. Us. Put everyone out 
                        of their misery, you know?

                                 GORDON
                        What’s stopping you?

                                 MIKE
                        I’ve been thinking about your 
                        speech.

                                 GORDON
                        Oh.

                                 MIKE
                        They killed my kids. My wife. For 
                        no reason. And I’ve been thinking 
                        about your speech up here, and I 
                        just really wonder if you believed 
                        any of that shit you were saying.

           Gordon nods.

                                 GORDON
                        I went to see Richard Rabideau. 
                        Before my speech. I went to his 
                        cell. Wanted to look him in the eye 
                        and tell him what I thought. Face 
                        the monster.

           Mike’s surprised by this.

                                 GORDON (CONT’D)
                        When I got there, you know what I 
                        saw? He wasn’t the Devil. Evil 
                        incarnate. He wasn’t even scary. He 
                        wanted to be. But really he’s just 
                        a... Sick man.

           Gordon nods, evaluating what he’s saying as he speaks.
                                 GORDON (CONT’D)
                        A sick person made sicker by all--- 
                        THIS. This shit. Your friends will 
                        stab you in the back to get ahead 
                        of you. We drug ourselves to keep 
                        our heads in the stratosphere. 
                        Corruption. Greed. And at the end 
                        of the day, we have a lot of nasty 
                        people who only think about 
                        themselves. And very few who think 
                        about others... And if that’s not 
                        enough to drive you to be sick.. 
                        Well, we might be the crazy ones 
                        for tolerating it. 

           He locks eyes with Mike.

                                 GORDON (CONT’D)
                        We used to be so much better. I 
                        think we really did. So. Yeah. I 
                        guess. I do believe all that shit.

           Mike nods, looking down at the detonator.

                                 MIKE
                        Even so. If you could blow them the 
                        fuck away, just to get yours. 
                        Wouldn’t you? For Bailey?

           Mike lifts up the detonator. He hands it to Gordon. 

           Gordon hesitates. 

           He takes it. Holds it. Closes his eyes. Then opens them. He 
           puts the detonator down on the ground next to him.

                                 GORDON
                        I’m not going to be a part of the 
                        problem. Not anymore.

           Mike takes this in, then nods.

                                 MIKE
                        Me either.

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Jackie leans against the wall, eyes partially closed- 
           exhausted. The Leopard’s head is in her lap. He stirs. She 
           opens her eyes.

                                 JACKIE
                        Hey.
           He groans, struggling to sit up.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t try to move. 

           Turning onto his side, he grips his gut, letting out a deep 
           moan of pain. Jackie helps him to his knees. He takes a 
           breath. Blood runs out of his mouth. He’s in bad shape.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        Thank God you’re alive. I thought I 
                        lost you. 

           Sshe kisses him. The Leopard looks into her eyes.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        What are you doing?

                                 JACKIE
                        It’s okay. You’re okay. We’re okay. 
                        I’m not going anywhere.

           She tries to kiss him again. He stops her.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Stop.

           She’s surprised.

                                 JACKIE
                        What’s wrong?

           He shakes his head and pushes her away, struggling to get up 
           on his own.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        You don’t know me.

                                 JACKIE
                        I... I met you. I was in a wedding 
                        dress. In the alley. Don’t you 
                        remember me? You... I never got to 
                        thank you for what you said to 
                        me... It made all the difference.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Okay. 

           He bends down and picks his mask off the ground. Jackie looks 
           at him, confused.

                                 JACKIE
                        What are you doing?
                                 THE LEOPARD
                        I’m done now. You’re safe.

           He begins to walk away.

                                 JACKIE
                        Wait!

           He stops.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        I... Look. I feel like things 
                        happen for a reason. My fiance 
                        ruined me, and six hours later you 
                        pick me back up. That’s not an 
                        accident.  One man ran out of my 
                        life, and another came crashing in. 
                        That’s a sign... And... I don’t 
                        care, call it a school girl crush, 
                        but... I can’t just let you walk 
                        away when I have to believe it 
                        means something more. 

           He sighs.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        It doesn’t. 

                                 JACKIE
                        But-

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        Lady. I am a god damn woman.  

           Silence.

                                 JACKIE
                        What?

           Jackie shivers. She looks at the Leopard. His jaw is square, 
           hair chopped short, and has a hardened edge to his... Their 
           face... But suddenly Jackie sees it. The Leopard isn’t a Man 
           at all. She is an androgynous woman, built like a brick wall.

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        You don’t love me. You don’t like 
                        me. You don’t even know what gender 
                        I am. You have trauma and you 
                        haven’t dealt with it. I’m going to 
                        be very clear with you now so that 
                        you can start putting your life 
                        back together. You don’t need me. 
                        You need a therapist. I do not love 
                        you. I will not love you. 
           She puts on her mask and continues walking down the hall. 
           Jackie’s face burns with embarrassment.

                                 JACKIE
                        I... I killed people for you. 

                                 THE LEOPARD
                        I didn’t ask for that.

           The Leopard keeps walking.

                                 JACKIE
                        I let people die so that I could 
                        save you... That’s... That’s a 
                        promise. That’s a promise we made. 

           She’s whispering to herself.

                                 JACKIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s a promise. 

           Her eyes go to the ground. A handgun is at her feet. She 
           picks it up and aims it at The Leopard. 

           She pulls the trigger with a CLICK- 

           The Leopard stops. She turns back towards Jackie. A moment, 
           then she shakes her head, turns and keeps walking, 
           disappearing around the corner. 

           INT. ENSO BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

           A SWAT team enters the building in slow motion. 

           Laced boots pass over dead cops lying on the floor. They make 
           their way towards the elevators and the stairs. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - SAME MOMENTS

           Flashlights point up the stairway as the SWAT team climbs up 
           the staircase.

           The SWAT guys cruise down the labyrinth of white hallways, 
           passing over the bodies of JOHN and ISLA. 
           INT. 22ND FLOOR - HALLWAY - SAME

           Jackie walks down the hallway in a daze. The SWAT team 
           appears in front of her- she raises her hands above her head 
           as the crowd around her and pass her by.

           They pass over SIMON’s dead body. 

           INT. 22ND FLOOR - KITCHEN - SAME

           Louis is limp in his chair as the team enters the kitchen.

           Drenched in blood, Mike and Gordon sit next to each other. 
           The SWAT team approaches them from behind. 

           The explosive detonator lies untouched on the floor.

           INT. ENSO BUILDING - BASEMENT - SAME

           A BOMB SQUAD works on the barrels of explosives. The timers 
           are counting down. 00:00:07. They begin cutting wires. The 
           timers reset to 88:88:88. 

           INT. 28TH FLOOR - PRE-DAWN

           Five SWAT guys reach the under-construction 28th floor. There 
           is a SPEARED HOOK through a wall. A rope attached to it. 

           One of the SWAT examines it. 

           He turns towards the shadows, shining his flashlight on 

           THE LEOPARD. 

           Swat’s eyes go wide. He raises his gun. 

           Without the ambient sound, it’s a surreal moment. The Leopard 
           disappears, then reappears. She begins to disable the five 
           SWAT guys, dodging their bullets, performing take-downs. 

           For once, The Leopard performs in her full glory- until all 
           five are down. 

           She steps towards the open window, hooks a metal gear onto 
           the rope, getting ready to zip-line out of the building. 

           She turns back towards the belly of the building.

                        Several weeks after the climactic

                        with this statement:

           EXT. ENSO BUILDING - DAY

           Thomas Enso stands in front of the building at a podium. Half 
           a dozen microphones are pointed his way.

                                 THOMAS ENSO

                        irrecoverably associated with the 
                        senseless death of innocent people.

                        capture of the individual known as 
                        The Leopard.

           A television plays the news. Thomas Enso’s image is replaced 
           with the News Anchor.

                        Word of the reward has quickly 
                        spread, devolving into violence in 
                        the streets as people accost those 
                        they have reason to believe is The 
                        Leopard. 

           A CITIZEN appears on the screen.

                        Word got out The Leopard is a

                        I’m not tryina be rude or nothing.

           Handheld footage shows a burly woman being attacked. Someone 
           in the background is shouting.

                                 BYSTANDER

                        The city is undergoing what some

                        attempt to find and unmask the 
                        vigilante once and for all.

                        people’s friends died, and it’s 
                        about justice. He thinks he’s doing 
                        us good, then he should turn 
                        himself in. Get that reward money 
                        himself.

           Mike frowns and turns the radio off. 

                                 MIKE
                        Bunch of idiots. 

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Gordon steps out of the grocery store with two bags of 
           groceries in his arms. An ANDROGYNOUS MAN sprints past him- 
           his clothes are torn and he’s bleeding. Two others catch up 
           to him and run him into the ground.

                                 ONLOOKER
                        He’s The Leopard! That’s him! 

           Gordon watches as the fight crawls across the street in open 
           traffic- car horns honk at the people clawing at each other. 

                                 RABIDEAU (V.O.)
                        The Leopard will never win, you 
                        know. 

           INT. LEOPARD’S LAIR - NIGHT

           The Leopard’s mask sits on a table. A BAT shatters it.
           INT. ASYLUM - CELL BLOCK - DAY

           Gordon is on his way out of the asylum. Rabideau sits naked 
           in his cell.

                                 RABIDEAU
                        Do you want to know why?

           Gordon stops. He sighs. 

                                 RABIDEAU (CONT’D)
                        Resentment. Greed. Pain. Grief. 
                        Revenge. What do these things have 
                        in common? They breed. 

           Rabideau begins to giggle.

                                 RABIDEAU (CONT’D)
                        They breed like rabbits. And no 
                        matter how hard he tries, the 
                        streets will run with blood that 
                        he’s spilled. Someone’s pain will 
                        turn to anger and that anger will 
                        breed to violence, and that. Is a 
                        blood red rabbit. 

           Gordon hesitates- then continues walking. 

                                 RABIDEAU (CONT’D)
                        And that’s how I will win. Without 
                        having to step foot out of this 
                        cell. Red Rabbit.

           INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

           Mike is stopped at a red light. On the sidewalk next to him, 
           a HOMELESS MAN has a sandwich board sign that reads THE END 
           IS NIGH. He turns. The other side reads KILL THE LEOPARD.

           Mike drinks in that image.

                                 RABIDEAU (V.O.)
                        Red Rabbit.

           A honk. Mike snaps out of it, drives through his green light.

           EXT. GROCERY STORE - SAME MOMENTS

           Gordon watches as the young men tear at each other.

                                 RABIDEAU (V.O.)
                        Red Rabbit. 
           Gordon frowns and turns the other way. 

           He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the signal to turn. He 
           looks up, and freezes. 

           Across the street stands The Leopard in civilian clothes. Her 
           attention is on a cell phone at her hand. She pockets the 
           cell phone and looks up. 

           She recognizes Gordon. Gordon recognizes her. The Leopard’s 
           attention goes to the commotion taking place behind Gordon. 

           Gordon gives her the slightest of nods. The Leopard simply 
           averts her eyes. The signal changes. The two walk towards 
           each other, passing on the street. 

           When he gets to the other side, Gordon looks over his 
           shoulder. He sees The Leopard walking away from him. The 
           crowd thickens. 

           The Leopard blends into it, just another face in the crowd.
