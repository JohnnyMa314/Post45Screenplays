                                    AT RISK

                      Based upon the novel by Alice Hoffman

           FADE IN: 

           A page from a dinosaur book. An illustration of a 
           Tyrannosaurus Rex and a triceratops basking peacefully near 
           an enormous pond. 

           A small hand carefully begins to copy a section of the 
           landscape onto a sheet of construction paper. Practical 
           colors - grey, green, brown. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        My dad once told me, when the 
                        dinosaurs died, it happened 
                        quickly, a giant asteroid that 
                        might have looked like an exploding 
                        star. I wanted to know, at the end, 
                        did they know that it was coming? 
                        Did they help each other? Were they 
                        scared? 

           The hand belongs to CHARLIE FARRELL, ten years old. Charlie 
           is small for his age, some might say fragile. He hangs the 
           drawing - the beginning of a mural - on a classroom wall. 

           TITLE: AT RISK

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - DAWN

           A small white bungalow isolated on a marsh. A flock of egrets 
           take flight, shocking the weeds behind them. 

           Charlie speeds his bike past the marsh. 

           EXT. POND - ESTABLISHING 

           Trees and mud surround a pond. 

           Charlie drops his bike and hurries towards the pond. He lines 
           up jars for collecting specimens. He takes in the world 
           around him with unusual focus. 

           CLOSE ON: the dark surface of the pond, a few bugs buzzing. 

           CLOSE ON: a patch of yellow flowers, a bee circling. 

           CLOSE ON: the shell of a turtle slowly emerging from the 
           pond. 

           The turtle is enormous, almost five feet long and ancient 
           looking. Charlie is transfixed. 
           His best friend, SEVRIN STAFFORD - also ten but stockier, 
           louder, less observant than Charlie - pedals up.

                                 SEVRIN
                        You said you’d stay for the whole 
                        game. 

           Charlie glances up, annoyed by this distraction. He looks 
           back at the pond, but the turtle is gone. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie and Sevrin ride their bikes, speeding up when they 
           pass the bungalow. 

           EXT. MORROW/FARRELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Charlie and Sevrin ride down the quaint streets of Morrow, 
           Massachusetts. 

           Sevrin turns left, Charlie turns right, rides up to a lovely, 
           drafty two story house. 

           It’s late August, everything still green but on the precipice 
           of changing. 

           CAPTION: MORROW, MASSACHUSETTS, 1986. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A PINK GYM BAG, dropped on the floor. 

           CLOSE ON: The dregs of a Tylenol bottle, poured into a cup. 

           CLOSE ON: A wasp buzzing around a light fixture. 

           INT. FARRELL BASEMENT DARKROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON: A PICTURE of LAUREL SMITH submerged in developer. 
           It slowly comes into focus: a pretty WOMAN sitting outside, 
           her eyes closed, the marsh behind her. 

           POLLY FARRELL, early 40s, slight and focused, lifts the 
           picture, hangs it next to another in which the woman (LAUREL 
           SMITH) looks startlingly older, her hair heavy, as though she 
           is drenched in water. 

           Stomping from upstairs makes this picture drop. 
                                 POLLY
                        Shit. 
                           (calling upstairs)
                        Guys!

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 

           Polly steps into the kitchen. Her daughter AMANDA, 13, 
           crouches on the floor, a spaghetti strainer over her head.

           Charlie stands on the counter, trying to catch the wasp with 
           the inside of a water glass. 

                                 AMANDA
                        The moron brought a bee in here. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        A wasp. Its species has been on the 
                        planet since before we were. 

                                 POLLY
                        Charlie, down. IVAN. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She’s got a zillion eggs in her 
                        abdomen. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You really are disgusting. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shut up, metal mouth.

           Polly hands Amanda Tylenol. 

                                 POLLY
                        Drink this. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not missing my meet. 

                                 POLLY
                        Of course not. IVAN! 

           IVAN FARRELL - 40s, lanky, dazed - gallops down the stairs. 

                                 IVAN
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 POLLY
                        A wasp. 
           She gestures towards it, he looks up at the tiny buzzing 
           creature. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What breed, Dad? 

                                 IVAN
                        Polistes fuscates. You can tell by 
                        the gold markings. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Her abdomen is full of eggs. 

                                 IVAN
                        You bet it is.  

                                 AMANDA
                        Dad, dad, dad! 

                                 POLLY
                        Can you just kill it? 

           Ivan puts the pasta strainer on his head. Amanda laughs. 
           She’s got a great smile, and really embarrassing BRACES.

                                 IVAN
                        Protective measures. 

                                 POLLY
                        That’s a good look. 

           Ivan gives Polly a quick kiss, which she reciprocates before 
           pushing him away. 

                                 IVAN
                        Your hero approaches the wasp. 

           Ivan hops up on the counter. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You won’t kill it, right? 

           Ivan carefully catches the wasp and gently guides it to the 
           door, where it flies away. Charlie turns to his sister and 
           mother. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        See? 
           INT. CAR/EXT. MORROW - LATER

           Polly drives past Morrow’s quaint town square, Amanda in the 
           front seat, Charlie in the back, paging through his dinosaur 
           book. 

           The radio is on, a news story about a car bomb in Tehran. 
           Then a story about Madonna’s single “True Blue” remaining 
           number one. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           Anxious parents and restless kids filter into bleachers. A 
           judges table is set up with score cards and staffed with 
           volunteering members of the PTA. 

           Charlie reads his book as Polly steers him towards the 
           bleachers. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Charlie)
                        Can you put that away? 

           Charlie doesn’t answer. Polly looks at him a moment, then 
           turns and watches COACH EAGAN, 40s, talk intently to a group 
           of adolescent gymnasts, including Amanda, who listens with 
           calm focus. 

           POLLY takes a picture: SNAP. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re going to embarrass her. 

                                 LINDA (O.S.)
                        Polly! 

           LINDA GLEASON waves from her perch in the top row of the 
           bleachers. She’s the principal of Cheshire, devoted with a 
           streak of mischief. Kids love her, parents sometimes find her 
           a bit much.  

           Polly and Charlie squeeze past packed bleachers and find two 
           seats next to Linda. 

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        I’m hearing strange things about 
                        you. The occult? 

                                 POLLY
                        Laurel has nothing to do with the 
                        occult.  
                                 LINDA
                        One detail - one. 

                                 POLLY
                        My lips are sealed. 

           Polly loads more film, tilts her camera towards Charlie, an 
           effort to engage him. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                           (to Charlie)
                        I can show you how to focus it? 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I’m reading. 

           She shoots a look to Linda.

                                 LINDA
                           (to Charlie)
                        Do I get a hello? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi Principal Gleason. 

                                 LINDA
                        Please. Call me Linda until after 
                        Labor Day. 

           Polly snaps more pictures: Amanda flying through a graceful 
           cartwheel: SNAP. Amanda, poised on the balance beam: SNAP. 

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Can you get Kris? 

           Linda’s daughter, KRISTY, pulling herself over the parallel 
           bars: SNAP. 

           Amanda nervously clasping hands with JESSIE EAGAN, her best 
           friend and the coach’s daughter: SNAP. 

           Amanda takes a deep breath as she stands before the parallel 
           bars. Polly puts her camera down, nervous for her. Amanda 
           grabs the higher bar and flips over it with seeming ease. 

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - LATER

           “Hungry Like the Wolf” plays. Amanda finishes her floor 
           routine,  a series of cartwheels, back flips, leaps. She’s 
           incredibly good.  
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone in the gym stands and claps as Amanda, sweaty and 
           pleased and really wiped out, is handed a trophy.

                                 CHARLIE
                           (begrudging admiration)
                        Not so bad. 

                                 LINDA
                           (to Polly)
                        He’s a tough guy to please. 

           Amanda bows, then quickly leaves the gym. 

           INT. CHESHIRE HALLWAY - LATER

           Charlie watches Polly talk to a few MOTHERS as Coach Eagan 
           approaches. 

                                 POLLY
                        She’s totally relentless. She’s 
                        saving her allowance to study with 
                        this Olympian, Bela - 

                                 MOTHER #1
                        Karolyli?

                                 POLLY
                        That sounds right. 

           The other women look at Polly with some envy. Jessie, who has 
           changed out of her leotard into a summery dress, pokes 
           Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you know that tyrannosaurs 
                        lived 83 million years after the 
                        brontosaurus? 

                                 JESSIE
                        That’s pretty cool. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                           (to Jesse)
                        Jess! Get a move on. 

           Jessie begrudgingly heads to her father, hugs Polly. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Jessie)
                        She still in there? 
                                 JESSIE
                        I think she’s in the shower. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                           (to Polly)
                        You should be proud. She picked 
                        herself right up after that weak 
                        start. 

           Polly glances towards the locker room, concerned. 

           INT. DEXTER’S SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A cozy, family owned New England seafood restaurant. Aging 
           waiters wear alligator shirts. Polly and Ivan have ordered 
           beer, fries, lobsters Charlie pokes at and Amanda doesn’t 
           touch. 

           Amanda’s got a small cluster of roses next to her and she 
           looks exhausted.

                                 AMANDA
                        -He knows he shouldn’t put me on 
                        the parallel bars first because 
                        that’s my weakest event -

                                 POLLY
                        - Well, he seemed impressed to me - 

                                 IVAN
                        - Of course he was impressed. I’ll 
                        go punch him in the face if he 
                        isn’t impressed by my daughter. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Ha ha funny Dad. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Ivan)
                        You’d have to show up to do that. 
                           (to Amanda)
                        Are you eating? 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Charlie and Amanda)
                        Your mother doesn’t understand the 
                        concept of a deadline - 

                                 POLLY
                        Oh really?

                                 AMANDA
                        He starts classes Monday, mom -
                                 POLLY
                        - I am fully aware of his packed 
                        schedule, thank you very much.  

                                 IVAN
                        Oh yeah? Fully aware? Or medium 
                        aware? 

           The kids crack up at this. Polly bristles. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Mom, everyone I know thinks she’s 
                        creepy. 

                                 POLLY
                        She can creep you out all she 
                        wants. The advance on this project 
                        paid for your gymnastics camp.

           Amanda gets up. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Why do you always need to know 
                        that?

           Ivan watches Amanda walk off, amused. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Ivan)
                        Don’t gloat. She’ll turn on you 
                        next. 

                                 IVAN
                        Pol. 

                                 POLLY
                        I’m serious. 

           Charlie looks between his parents, assessing the tension 
           between them. Polly takes a few frustrated bites of her food. 
           Gets up.

                                 IVAN
                        That’s probably not the best -

           But Polly’s already headed in Amanda’s direction. 
           INT. TWO STALL BATHROOM - LATER

           Polly enters the bathroom. The decor is old and dark. 
           Amanda’s sneakers visible in one of the stalls. 

                                 POLLY
                        Amanda? 

           Polly catches her reflection in the mirror. She never thought 
           she’d be this way - a nagging mother. A beat. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Amanda - honey? 

           Another beat. Polly knocks on the stall door. Amanda opens it 
           for her. She’s doubled over, throwing up. Polly quickly 
           steadies her. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It was that stupid lobster. 

                                 POLLY
                        You just worked too hard. 

           Polly kneels down, feels her daughter’s forehead. She’s got a 
           fever, a high one. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie tries to sleep as his parents fight. 

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        - all I’m saying is stop beating 
                        yourself up - that’s all -

                                 POLLY (O.S.)
                         - that’s easy for you to say, you 
                        don’t even show up and you’re still 
                        father of the year- 

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                        -Oh Polly, stop it -

           Charlie sits up, pulls his dinosaur book out from under his 
           pillow and starts to read. 

           EXT. POND - DAWN 

           CLOSE ON: The pond, the turtle sleeping on a rock. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           CLOSE ON: Earthworms slithering.  

           CLOSE ON: A felled bird’s nest, crushed abandoned eggs. 

           Charlie sits, taking notes in his SPECIMEN LOG. 

           Charlie turns his attention back to the turtle, which has 
           woken and is wriggling its head out of its enormous shell. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - DAY

           Charlie fries French Toast. He’s made a mess - egg shells, 
           empty milk carton, a heap of bread crusts.

           Ivan sits at the kitchen table, working. A bag of groceries 
           unpacked on the kitchen table. 

           Polly gallops down the stairs, an empty glass in her hand and 
           a washcloth under her arm. 

           She puts the cup in the sink and stares at the mess.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m gonna clean it. 

                                 POLLY
                        Right. 

                                 IVAN
                        We are! 

           He tries to kiss her, she ducks under his arm. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 POLLY
                        You know what. 

           Charlie offers a plate of French Toast to Ivan. Ivan hands it 
           off to Polly, she takes it, chews, grins. A conciliatory 
           moment. Then:  

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        You get the Tylenol and Gatorade? 

                                 IVAN
                        No gatorade at Lawson’s. 

                                 POLLY
                        That’s all you tried? Just one damn 
                        store?
                                 IVAN
                        I’ll go back out. 

                                 POLLY
                        Don’t bother. 

           She grabs her purse. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                           (to Charlie)
                        You. Stay with Amanda. 

           Polly heads out. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m meeting Sevrin - 

                                 POLLY
                        Sevrin can wait. 

           The door slams behind her. Ivan stands there. 

                                 IVAN
                        She’ll cool off. 

           Charlie dumps maple syrup on his french toast, and his 
           father’s. Ivan starts to eat. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

           Charlie holds a glass of gatorade in one hand and knocks on 
           Amanda’s door with the other. 

           No answer. He pushes the door open. The room is completely 
           dark.

           INT. AMANDA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Leotards strewn across the floor, pictures of Bruce 
           Springsteen plastered on the wall. Amanda sleeps. 

           INT. AMANDA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie stands on tip toes in front of Amanda’s closet, looks 
           up at an PURPLE JAR stuffed with dollar bills. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Mom? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s me. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Charlie puts the gatorade on Amanda’s night stand. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        She says you have to. 

           He sits next to his sister’s bed. She takes a sip. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE/MARSH - DAY

           Polly’s car parked outside the house, another car (Betsy 
           Stafford’s), a beat-up Datsun, behind it. 

           INT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - SAME

           CLOSE ON: Polly squinting through her camera as Laurel, who 
           we see through Polly’s lense, gives a reading in a sparse 
           living room, carefully modulated light. 

                                 LAUREL (O.C.)
                        - I would like for you to imagine 
                        we are surrounded by white light. 
                        Please take a deep breath and 
                        imagine that. 

           Laurel’s voice has a slight accent. She is of indeterminable 
           age, very pretty, long hair. There’s something other-worldy 
           and exotic about her. More Snow White than the witch.  

                                 WOMAN 
                        Do you see her yet? 

           Polly SNAPS a picture. And another picture. She’s in her 
           element, eager and unobtrusive, completely focused and 
           captivated by Laurel. 

           BETSY STAFFORD, a sharp-featured writer in her 40s, also 
           Sevrin’s mother, takes notes in a nearby wicker chair.

           INT. DR. REARDON’S OFFICE - SAME

           ED REARDON, 50s, trim and serious, finishes examining Amanda. 
           Polly digs through her purse, trying to distract herself. 

                                 ED REARDON
                           (to Amanda)
                        One more deep breath. 
                           (beat)
                        All done. 

           Amanda slides off the exam table and collects her clothes 
           from Polly.
                                 AMANDA
                        When can I go back to practice? 

                                 ED REARDON
                        Don’t worry, I can tell just by 
                        looking at you: you’re better than 
                        Mary Lou Retton. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Not yet. But I will be. Once I go 
                        to Oklahoma. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        What’s in Oklahoma? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Bela Karolyi. He trains all the 
                        Olympians. He’s the best coach, 
                        he’s from Romania, but they let him 
                        become an American. 

                                 POLLY
                        Get dressed, you. 

           Amanda exits. Polly looks after her, worried. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t keep dragging her back 
                        here. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        We’ll get to the bottom of this. 

           Ed squeezes her shoulder. She looks up at him - she trusts 
           him implicitly. 

                                 POLLY
                        Thanks. 

           EXT. MORROW/MARSH - SUNSET

           Charlie and Sevrin ride their bikes through the reeds. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        No way a turtle that size could get 
                        in that pond. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It was! I swear.  

           They approach Laurel Smith’s house. Someone has sprayed 
           graffiti - a bright, jagged Casper the Unfriendly Kike - 
           across the porch. The boys slow down, take this in.
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SEVRIN
                        I bet she’ll catch those kids and 
                        turn them into ghosts.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        My mom never said anything about 
                        ghosts.  

           He starts pedaling again, turns back to Sevrin. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Are you coming? 

           INT. ASTRONOMY INSTITUTE/AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           Ivan gives a lecture to thirty freshman, all of whom pay 
           attention to him - he’s an engaging, irreverent professor. 

                                 IVAN
                        The Supernova of 1604, most often 
                        referred to as Kepler’s Supernova, 
                        the brightest exploding star 
                        visible to the naked eye in the 
                        last three hundred years. We’ll get 
                        to that later - what I want to 
                        focus on with all you smart 
                        fantastic people, is the event that 
                        started it all. The Big Bang. I 
                        know, you know what the Big Bang 
                        is, but there’s more to it than you 
                        think - 

           A knock on the door. A SECRETARY comes in, speaks quietly to 
           Ivan. After a moment, Ivan turns back to the class. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        And with that cliffhanger, excuse 
                        me for a moment. 

           INT. ASTRONOMY INSTITUTE/IVAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Ivan’s in his office on the phone. It’s an organized mess, 
           papers scattered everywhere. 

           Ivan carefully hangs up the phone. Sits there for a long 
           moment. What he has just been told has not yet sunk in. 

           EXT. POND - DAY 

           CLOSE ON: The pond, fish darting under water. 
           CLOSE ON: A small frog gulping on a lily pad. 

           CLOSE ON: A stone skimming the far side of the pond, where 
           the turtle once was.  

           Sevrin throws another stone into the pond. Then another. Then 
           another. Fish dart away. The frog leaps off its lily pad. 
           Then Charlie notices -

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop!

           The turtle slowly emerges - enormous. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s him. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Holy cow. 

           The boys watch. Sevrin creeps closer. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t scare him. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        I’m not. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        I told you. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Maybe someone was dumping 
                        radioactive waste. Maybe he’s a 
                        mutant. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah right. The one who got away. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Cowabunga! 

           Sevrin throws another stone. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop it! 

                                 SEVRIN
                        I’m not gonna hit him, I want to 
                        see what he does. 

           The turtle ducks back underwater. Charlie watches for a 
           minute, miffed. 
                                 SEVRIN (CONT’D)
                        I bet tyrannosauruses hung out 
                        here. Attacked a brontosaurus right 
                        where we’re sitting. 
                           (off Charlie’s look)
                        It could have happened. A giant, 
                        bloody attack. 

           INT. LAWSON’S STORE - LATER

           Charlie and Sevrin examine medicine bottles and eat Devil 
           Dogs. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        If he’s actually a cryptodire we’ll 
                        be the first kids in the history of 
                        Massachusetts and maybe the world 
                        to document an animal that’s been 
                        alive since the time of the 
                        dinosaurs. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Do you think we’ll get rich? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Maybe. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Maybe we’ll get rich from the book 
                        our moms are doing. I’ll buy a 
                        motorcycle, then a yacht. 

           Charlie picks up a medicine bottle. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you think newts need vitamin A? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        I haven’t gotten my allowance yet. 

           Charlie takes five dollars out of his pocket, shows it to 
           Sevrin. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I stole it from my sister. 

           LAUREL SMITH enters the store, wearing a colorful dress she 
           made herself. 

           Sevrin yanks Charlie’s arm. Two TEENAGERS whisper to each 
           other. 
                                 SEVRIN
                        Look. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t stare. 

           Laurel selects two cans of PAINT. She sees the boys staring.

                                 LAUREL
                        What is so interesting? 

           They freeze for a minute. Then they turn and run. 

           EXT. MORROW - SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER

           Sevrin and Charlie pedal furiously. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Go go go go go! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is she following us? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Go! 

           EXT. MORROW - DUSK

           Charlie and Sevrin ride their bikes, backpacks bulging. 

           EXT./INT. STAFFORD DINING ROOM - LATER

           Sevrin’s house is smaller than Charlie’s, less orderly. 
           Betsy’s at the stove, making dinner. Charlie and Sevrin bang 
           in, his dog FELIX barking with joy at their arrival. 

                                 BETSY
                        How bout you guys helping out? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        We had an exhausting day. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        A crytodire of a day. 

                                 SEVRIN 
                        A mutant of a day. 

           The boys burst into laughter, head downstairs to the -
           INT. STAFFORD BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

           - basement, where there’s a terrarium of newts that Charlie 
           starts to feed. Also - books all over the floor, devil dog 
           wrappers, half-drunk bottles of yoo-hoo, a video game console 
           Sevrin plops in front of. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Are you gonna play or what? 

           Charlie begrudgingly joins him. The video game is obnoxiously 
           loud. After a moment, Betsy comes down. 

                                 BETSY
                           (to Charlie)
                        Your mom called. 

           Betsy gives them both lemonade, gives Sevrin a kiss on the 
           head that he ducks away from. 

                                 BETSY (CONT’D)
                        Charlie, did you hear me? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tell her I’ll stay for dinner. 

                                 BETSY
                        Well, you’re gonna be happy because 
                        they need to go to Boston so you’re 
                        staying here. 

           Charlie turns. A beat. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I want to go to Boston. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        I want to go to Boston too. 

                                 BETSY
                        Tough, because you’re stuck with 
                        me. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Sleepover!!!

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Can we camp? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Camping!!

           Sevrin dashes around in excitement. Charlie does, too. 
           EXT. STAFFORD BACKYARD - NIGHT.

           Charlie and Sevrin lie on the grass in sleeping bags. They 
           pass yoo-hoo back and forth and stare up at the sky.

                                 CHARLIE
                        See that? That’s Pisces. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        How can you tell? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        My dad showed me. 
                           (beat)
                        That’s the milky way. That’s where 
                        the last supernova exploded. No one 
                        knew it was going to explode, it 
                        just did. 

           EXT. STAFFORD HOUSE - MORNING

           Charlie blinks into sunlight. He can hear Betsy and Sevrin  
           inside - arguing about Sevrin cleaning his room before his 
           dad comes. 

           Charlie stands outside the house for a moment, then rolls up 
           his sleeping bag. A beat.

           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie bikes up to his house. No car. His parents aren’t 
           back yet. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie makes himself lunch - two devil dogs and a cheese 
           sandwich. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Charlie has fallen asleep watching David Letterman. After a 
           moment, headlights cross Charlie’s  face. 

           Ivan comes in, looks at Charlie for a moment. Charlie sits 
           up. His father looks exhausted, and his eyes are red. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I would have come with you to 
                        Boston. 
           Ivan sits on the sofa next to him. He says nothing. 

           Polly and Amanda come in. Amanda runs upstairs, and Polly 
           follows. 

           EXT./INT. FARRELL HOUSE - NIGHT

           The Farrells eat ice cream. 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Polly)
                        Your father called. And Betsy 
                        Stafford. 

                                 POLLY
                        Jesus, they’re relentless. 

           Ivan puts a pill next to Amanda’s bowl. She hesitates, then 
           takes it. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Mom? 
                           (a beat)
                        What about school? 

           Ivan glances at Polly. 

                                 IVAN
                        We’ll figure that out. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m going though. 
                           (beat)
                        I’m going, right? 

                                 POLLY
                        Of course you are. 

           Charlie looks to Ivan. He doesn’t have a clue what they’re 
           talking about, but he can tell his dad’s upset. 

           Ivan starts clearing the bowls. 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Charlie)
                        You finished with that, buddy? 

           Charlie nods. Ivan dumps the bowls in the sink. 
           EXT. BOSTON - DAY

           Honking cars, throngs of family, music blasting from open 
           windows. 

           INT. FARRELL CAR - SAME

           Charlie looks out at an imposing building - Boston Children’s 
           Hospital. 

           Polly, Ivan, and Amanda stand near the entrance, talking in 
           hushed voices. 

           Ivan gestures towards the car. Polly shakes her head, leads 
           Amanda into the hospital. 

           INT. BOSTON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE - DAY

           Charlie and Ivan move through a throng of kids and parents to 
           stare at a T-Rex behind glass. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dad. This is for kids. 

                                 IVAN
                        There’s some cool stuff here. 

           Ivan feeds the T-Rex a nickel. His hands shake. Quickly, 
           comically, the T-Rex ROARS.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s not what it really sounds 
                        like. 

                                 IVAN
                        You’re right. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How can we find out what they 
                        really sound like? 

                                 IVAN
                        That’s a good question. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dad. When we get back, can I show 
                        you the cryptodire? 

                                 IVAN
                        The what? 
                                 CHARLIE
                        I told you. The turtle that could 
                        have been alive since the time of 
                        the dinosaurs. If we study him, 
                        maybe we can find out how they 
                        survived and the dinosaurs didn’t. 
                           (beat)
                        Maybe they helped each other, the 
                        turtles? Maybe they hid? 

           Ivan sits down on an empty bench, motions for Charlie to join 
           him.

                                 IVAN
                        Sit down for a minute. 

           Charlie sits, begrudgingly. Waits for his father to say 
           something. Fidgets. After a moment: 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Amanda’s sick. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know. 
                           (off Ivan’s silence)
                        How sick? 

                                 IVAN
                        It’s pretty bad. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is it cancer? Sevrin’s aunt has 
                        cancer. She’s OK though. 

           Ivan is trying hard to stick to the facts, to stay completely 
           unemotional. 

                                 IVAN
                        It’s a virus. It’s called AIDS. 
                           (beat)
                        She got it from a blood 
                        transfusion. Before they tested for 
                        contaminated blood. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who is they? 

                                 IVAN
                        Doctors, buddy. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why didn’t they test for it? 

           Ivan puts his arm around Charlie and squeezes tight. 
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Dad? 

           He squirms out of his father’s embrace. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Could we actually get lunch? 

           INT. BOSTON MUSEUM OF SCIENCE GIFT SHOP - LATER

           A cashier rings up a new dinosaur book and a sew-on GLOW IN 
           THE DARK DINOSAUR PATCH. Charlie puts ANOTHER PATCH on the 
           counter. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        For Sevrin. 

           EXT. BOSTON CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL/FARRELL CAR - DAY 

           Polly and Amanda get in the car. Amanda’s listening to her 
           walk man. Charlie looks at her, trying to figure out if she 
           is different. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        Some scientists think that when the 
                        asteroid hit there was so much ash 
                        in the sky the world was dark for 
                        years.  

           Ivan reaches for Polly’s hand. She lets him take it for a 
           minute, then pulls her hand away. 

           SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           -Amanda looking out the window, headphones on her ears. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        Some scientists think that the 
                        asteroid was caused by a collision 
                        of the star system and the sun. 

           -The tall buildings of Boston getting farther away.

           -Charlie’s dinosaur book - a Brontosaurus cranes his neck up, 
           reaches for some leaves. 

           -Charlie’s dinosaur book - a T-Rex rips into the carcass of a 
           stegosaurus. 

           -Charlie’s dinosaur book - a black, spinning asteroid barrels 
           towards the earth. 
           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - POLLY AND IVAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ivan sits in bed alone, reading through pamphlets the 
           hospital has given him. Underlining. Reading again. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        They’d been getting closer and 
                        closer, inching together for 
                        centuries. 

           INT. FARRELL BASEMENT DARKROOM - LATER

           Polly turns on the light. Looks around. The photos hanging, 
           her equipment in the corner. The that she’s been trying so 
           hard at, and now it means nothing. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        Then the crash happened in minutes.  
                        There’s evidence it left a crater 
                        six miles wide. 

           INT. FARRELL BASEMENT DARKROOM - LATER

           Polly takes pictures of Laurel down, piles them in the 
           corner. 

           Polly packs her gear away. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - LATER

           Charlie lies in bed reading. The door cracks open, a sliver 
           of light crossing his face. Amanda stands in the doorway, 
           small in her nightgown. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Are you up? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m up. 

           Amanda edges through the dark to Charlie’s bed.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I had a dream I was the last 
                        dinosaur in the world. A T-Rex. I 
                        couldn’t find anyone else to eat. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Did you see one of those 3-D shows 
                        at the museum? 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Nah. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I wish I got to go to the museum 
                        instead of that disgusting 
                        hospital. Or a movie. Or even 
                        Fenway Park. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dad hates Fenway Park. He only 
                        likes to watch it on TV. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, remember last time he wore 
                        ear plugs? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And Mom made us bring boring turkey 
                        sandwiches. 

                                 AMANDA
                        And Dad bought hot dogs behind her 
                        back. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you feel? 

                                 AMANDA
                        They’re crazy. I’m fine. I’m great. 

           Charlie and Amanda look out the window. The stars are bright. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That star’s Sirius, I think. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Is that the one you wish on? 

           Charlie shrugs. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I wish I could study with Bela. And 
                        I guess I wish we could win the 
                        meet in Concord but we probably 
                        will so I don’t have to wish it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I bet you will. 

           Amanda smiles. 

                                 AMANDA
                        What about you? 
                                 CHARLIE
                        I wish it was just the beginning of 
                        summer. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Fourth grade is a good grade. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why? 

                                 AMANDA
                        It’s way more fun. You get to study 
                        frogs. 
                           (beat)
                        My throat hurts. Don’t tell mom. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Here. 

           Charlie reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lifesaver. He 
           flinches when their hands touch - hers is freezing. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You can’t catch it from touching me 
                        or anything. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not an idiot. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Well...I just wanted to see if you 
                        had fun. 

           Amanda gets up. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I got you a present. 

           Charlie digs through his backpack, hands her the dinosaur 
           patch he bought for Sevrin. It glows faintly in the dark.

                                 AMANDA
                        What’d you do, put poison on it? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        If you don’t want it I’ll just take 
                        it back. 

           She looks at it carefully. Holds it up to the light.

                                 AMANDA
                        I can put it on my gym bag. Thanks, 
                        beetle brain. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re welcome, metal mouth. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Just remember, no backsies. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No backsies. 

           EXT. BRADLEES PARKING LOT - DAY

           Polly circles for a parking spot. A Madonna song blasts from 
           the tape deck. Amanda in the front seat, Charlie reading his 
           dinosaur book in the back. 

           A car backs out and Polly almost crashes into it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Good going, mom. 

           INT. BRADLEES - MOMENTS LATER 

           A zoo of parents, children, shopping carts full of notebooks, 
           folders, loose leaf. Awful elevator music plays. 

           Charlie follows Polly, who carries an armful of dresses for 
           Amanda.

                                 POLLY
                        Aren’t these back in style? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Give me a break...Mom! This. This 
                        is what I need. 

           She holds up a bra. 

                                 POLLY
                        I just bought you two. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Evelyn Crowley has like ten. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I need new jeans. 

                                 POLLY
                        We just got you a pair. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Last year. 
                                 POLLY
                        Meet us in aisle 7. With the school 
                        supplies. 
                           (to Amanda)
                        Sweetie, look, what do you think of 
                        this. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Mom! Are you serious? That’s for 
                        like a five year old. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don't know what kind to get. 

                                 POLLY
                        You like Levis. 

                                 AMANDA
                        This one’s stupid, but I like both 
                        of these. I like the color. 

                                 POLLY
                        Take them both. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Really?! 

                                 POLLY
                        Put them in there. 

           Charlie walks away. 

           INT. BRADLEES - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie wanders to the pants aisle. He pulls jeans from a 
           stack. They are much too big for him. He looks up and sees 
           Betsy Stafford, nearby, also picking out clothes. She sees 
           him too. He freezes - he knows his mother hasn’t been calling 
           her back. 

           INT. BRADLEES - MOMENTS LATER

           Betsy follows Charlie and Polly down a school supplies aisle, 
           stopping to grab notebooks, pens, etc. 

                                 BETSY
                        All I’m saying is, it wouldn’t have 
                        killed you to let me know, I called 
                        to remind you, twice - 

                                 POLLY
                        -I said I’m sorry - 
                                 BETSY
                        -It’s just irresponsible, Pol. We 
                        have three clients lined up, all 
                        wonderfully suggestible, and you 
                        don’t even show  -

                                 POLLY
                           (to Charlie)
                        Can you grab loose leaf for you and 
                        your sister? 

           Charlie grabs five loose leaf. 

                                 BETSY
                        - if you’re playing at being a 
                        photographer, just tell me - there 
                        are five or six people I could have 
                        hired - 

                                 POLLY
                        Amanda’s been sick.

                                 BETSY
                        So call me! Show a shred of 
                        responsibility - I mean, I can’t 
                        believe you would leave me alone 
                        with her -

                                 POLLY
                           (to Charlie)
                        Meet me at the register, Charlie, 
                        OK? 

           INT. BRADLEES - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie watches through the shelves as Betsy and Polly 
           quietly speak. 

                                 BETSY
                        That can’t be right -

                                 POLLY
                        It’s what they’re saying. 

                                 BETSY
                        You’ve got to get a second opinion. 
                        Polly, you’ve got to -

                                 POLLY
                        - I know -
                                 BETSY
                        Don’t worry about the book. Don’t 
                        worry about anything until all this 
                        is over - 

           INT. BRADLEES - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie loads school supplies, oversized pants, and a giant 
           sweatshirt onto the conveyor belt. Nearby, Amanda talks to a 
           GIRL (SUE SHERMAN) we recognize from the gymnastics team. 

           Polly approaches, adds Amanda’s dresses, jewelry, and a nail 
           polish set to Charlie’s pile. 

                                 POLLY
                        Can you tell your sister that it’s 
                        time to go? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s Sue Sherman. She has a 
                        German Shepard that’s bigger than 
                        she is. Smarter, too. 

           Polly almost cracks a grin. Watches the two girls talk for a 
           minute. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - KITCHEN 

           Charlie’s on the phone, which rings and rings. He watches 
           Polly and Amanda prepare to paint their nails on the kitchen 
           table with brand new polish. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mom? 
                           (beat)
                        Sevrin’s not answering the phone. 

                                 POLLY
                        He’s probably at his dad’s. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        He brings him back on Sunday 
                        afternoons. 

                                 POLLY
                        He doesn’t always, Charlie. 

           Charlie dials again. It rings and rings again. Charlie hangs 
           up. 

           Amanda holds out extremely bright polish. 
                                 AMANDA
                        What about this one? 

                                 POLLY
                        You may like Cyndi Lauper, but 
                        that’s just...no...I draw the line 
                        there. 

           Polly and Amanda both laugh. Charlie looks at them a moment. 
           The doorbell rings. Charlie opens the door: Ed Reardon.

                                 ED REARDON
                        Hey, kiddo. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi. 

           Charlie silently lets him in. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - LATER

           Charlie makes macaroni and cheese. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE/AMANDA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie watches as Reardon talks quietly to Polly. Amanda’s 
           sleeping and it’s afternoon. 

                                 POLLY
                        Charlie, can you give us a minute? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I made dinner. For when dad comes 
                        home. 

                                 POLLY
                        I thought we’d order pizza if your 
                        sister’s up for it. And make ice 
                        cream sundaes. How does that sound? 

           This does not sound like his mother at all. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        That sounds pretty good to me, kid. 

           Polly sits down on Amanda’s bed, smooths her daughter’s hair. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - BASEMENT

           Charlie tugs on the light, which shines dimly.

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie looks through the pictures. There are a few of Amanda 
           from the gym meet. 

           Then a stack of images of Laurel. In some she looks young. In 
           some she looks older. In one she’s drenched, as though she is 
           drowning. In one there’s a faint scar on her forehead. In one 
           her hair stands on end, as though she’s been struck by 
           lightning. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie digs through his mother’s equipment, hesitates for a 
           minute, then puts the camera in his backpack. 

           EXT. ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

           Charlie rides to the pond. 

           EXT. POND - LATER - SERIES OF SHOTS

           Charlie sits and waits for the turtle. 

           The turtle emerges slowly. Charlie pulls out Polly’s camera. 
           SNAP. He walks closer. 

           He struggles with the weight and girth of the camera. SNAP. 
           The turtle ducks back under water. 

                                 LAUREL (O.C.)
                        Be very quiet. Then he’ll let you 
                        take his picture. 

           Charlie turns, sees Laurel Smith watching him. She’s on her 
           bike, groceries in a handmade basket. Charlie just stands 
           there, terrified. 

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        You are Polly’s son? 
                           (off his silence)
                        I didn’t mean to scare you. 

           Charlie doesn’t say anything. After a long moment, Laurel 
           rides away. 

           EXT. ROAD - LATER

           Charlie bikes quickly, breathing hard.

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL TEACHER’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           A cramped lounge, one couch and a few rows of seats that have 
           been hastily assembled for the occasion. 

           We recognize a few of the mothers from the gymnastics meet. 

           Ed Reardon and Linda Gleason sit at the front of the room 
           with a SUPERINTENDANT, who is taking notes. 

           Polly and Ivan slip in, sit in the back, There’s a noticeable 
           bristle as they take their seats, which Polly and Ivan pick 
           up on.  

                                 LINDA
                        If you’re truly worried, we can 
                        provide additional precautions. 
                        Your children can wear plastic 
                        gloves, which I’ll keep in my 
                        office, but as Dr. Reardon just 
                        explained, it’s not necessary - 

                                 MOTHER #1
                        What if her saliva gets on the 
                        water fountain? 

                                 ED REARDON
                        I’ve already explained that. It 
                        can’t be spread through saliva.

                                 LINDA
                        Guys, please, work with me here. 
                        I’ve been your principal for 
                        fifteen years, you know me. I love 
                        my kids. I’ve got four of my own, I 
                        understand how you’re feeling, I 
                        promise you. 

                                 FATHER #2
                        And you would allow your children 
                        to go to school with this girl? 

                                 LINDA
                        My youngest is still a student 
                        here, so yes. 

           Ed makes eye contact with Polly, gives her a little nod, 
           trying for some sort of silent comfort. Ivan notices. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        We’ve been through the statistics - 
                        your children have a better chance 
                        of getting hit by a car in his or 
                        her own backyard -
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 IVAN
                        - Jesus, that’s what you’re giving 
                        them? Statistics? 

                                 POLLY
                        Ivan -

                                 ED REARDON
                        We’re learning more every day - 

                                 IVAN
                        This is unbelievable.

           Ivan pushes his chair back, leaves. A beat. Polly gets up, 
           follows. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Ivan hurries down the hall. 

                                 POLLY
                        Ivan!

           Ivan doesn’t slow down. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL BATHROOM STALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Polly sits on a toilet seat that is much too small for her, 
           taking deep breaths, on the verge of hyperventilating. Then 
           she cries, she can’t stop. 

           She hears the door open. Footsteps follow. Polly tries to 
           collect herself. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Polly crosses to the sink, splashes water on her face. The 
           toilet flushes. One of the mothers - also a parent from the 
           gym meet - comes out. A beat. The woman leaves quickly 
           without saying a word to Polly or washing her hands. 

           EXT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Polly crosses the parking lot, sees Linda standing outside 
           her car, smoking. She walks towards her.  

                                 LINDA
                        Are you all right? 
                           (beat)
                        Sorry. What a thoughtless question. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Linda takes out a pack of cigarette and tries to light one. 
           Her hand shakes. After a moment, Polly helps her light it. 

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        I should have picked a smaller 
                        school. One with two or three 
                        students in it. 

                                 POLLY
                        Ivan shouldn’t have attacked him 
                        like that. 

                                 LINDA
                           (re the cigarettes)
                        You want one? 

                                 POLLY
                        Why not? 

           She takes a cigarette, they smoke for a moment. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        It really is OK for her to stay?  

                                 LINDA
                        Does she want to? 

                                 POLLY
                        More than anything. 

                                 LINDA
                        There’s your answer. 

           A beat. Ivan’s walking towards them. 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Polly)
                        I jogged around the building twice. 
                        Got all the rage out. 

           Polly doesn’t laugh. Linda offers him a cigarette, he shakes 
           his head. 

                                 POLLY
                        Oh come on, Ivan. We went through a 
                        pack a day before the kids. 

                                 IVAN
                        Before being the operative word. 

           Polly gives him a look. He takes Polly’s cigarette, takes a 
           long drag. His eyes fill. Polly takes the cigarette back, a 
           beat, a moment, their hands touch. And then they pull away. 
                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                           (to Linda)
                        Are you really on our side or is 
                        this some kind of hoax?

                                 LINDA
                        I’m on the side of my students. And 
                        Amanda’s one of my students. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Ivan)
                        I told you. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie watches out the window as his parents’ car pulls up. 
           They’re arguing quietly, Ivan worried that Amanda could pick 
           up a virus if she goes to school. After a moment, Ivan gets 
           into the car and drives away. 

           INT. FARRELL BASEMENT DARKROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie pushes open the basement door, walks tentatively down 
           the stairs. Polly’s sitting with one small light on, looking 
           through pictures of Amanda from the gym meet. She looks up, 
           wipes her eyes.  

                                 POLLY
                        Charlie. Jesus. You scared me. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where did Dad go? 

                                 POLLY
                        He had work to do. 

           A beat. Polly stacks the pictures, gets up. Charlie glances 
           at the corner, her equipment missing. She doesn’t seem to 
           notice. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mom? 
                           (off her silence)
                        Can that woman Laurel really talk 
                        to people after they die? 

                                 POLLY
                        No, Charlie. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        But Sevrin said one of the people 
                        who died was struck by lightning 
                        and when Laurel spoke to her she 
                        looked like she was struck by 
                        lightning. 
                           (beat)
                        And in one of the pictures she was 
                        talking to a woman who drowned and 
                        it looked like she was drowning.  

           Polly looks at him for a moment. Puts the pictures away. 

                                 POLLY
                        It has to do with lighting.  

           She brushes past Charlie, turns out the light. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I told you not to come down here, 
                        there’s mold and mice.  

           He stands there on the stairs. After a beat, turns the lights 
           back on. Looks at the pictures of Laurel again. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - MORNING.

           Charlie watches TV while he eats breakfast. His jeans are too 
           big and his shirt is too small. Upstairs, his sister and 
           mother argue. 

                                 TV NEWSCASTER
                        On the heels of two bombings in 
                        Paris, investigations continue into 
                        the ringleader behind the hijacking 
                        of Pan Am 73 - 

                                 AMANDA (O.S)
                        - because no one has their parents 
                        come to practice! Mom!! 

                                 POLLY (O.S.)
                        You have two choices, leave early, 
                        or one of us comes- 

                                 AMANDA (O.S.)
                        - you can’t do this to me! 

           Ivan switches off the TV.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was watching that. 
           Ivan pours a bowl of cereal.

                                 IVAN
                        Eat at the table. 

           Amanda stomps downstairs carrying her gym bag, wearing one of 
           the dresses from Bradlees. Polly follows. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        You look stunning. Gorgeous. 
                        Beautiful. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Mom said I can go to practice. By 
                        myself. 

           Ivan turns to look at Polly. 

                                 POLLY
                        Ivan, I swear to god - 

                                 AMANDA
                        No one has their parents at 
                        practice. Charlie, tell them. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s true, dad. 

           EXT./INT. POLLY’S CAR - DAY

           Polly, hair barely brushed, waits while Ivan hugs Amanda 
           goodbye. 

           Charlie gets into the car. Leans forward to the radio. Polly 
           blocks his hand. 

                                 POLLY
                        I’m putting on a tape. 

           INT. FARRELL CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Bruce Springsteen on the tape deck. Almost a calm drive. 
           Charlie grips his dinosaur book, looks out the window. 

           INT. CAR/EXT. CHESHIRE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Polly breaks hard. Charlie sees a mob of ANGRY PARENTS 
           protesting outside the Cheshire School. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mom. 
                                 POLLY
                        Jesus Christ. 

           Amanda sees them. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Is that because of me? 

           Polly backs up roughly, takes a sharp right turn away from 
           the school. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Mom, no!

           EXT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL - SAME

           A group of parents stand in front of the school, talking 
           loudly, handing out flyers. 

           Linda does her best to ignore them, putting on a show of 
           welcoming students.

                                 ANGRY PARENT 
                        You think we won’t reach out to the 
                        Board of Ed? We won’t be quiet 
                        about this. 

           Linda sees Polly drive by. 

           INT. FARRELL CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Polly drives. 

                                 POLLY
                        You’re not going in there. Either 
                        of you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        But I have to go to school!

                                 POLLY
                        Not there. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I want to go to school!

           Polly keeps driving. Amanda tries to grab the steering wheel. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you crazy? 
                                 AMANDA
                           (to Polly)
                        I hate you!

           Amanda starts to cry. A long beat. Polly pulls over, stops 
           the car. Tentatively touches her daughter’s shoulder. 

                                 POLLY
                        Amanda. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I want to go to school. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because you’re crazy. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Buzz off. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Buzz away. 

           Amanda looks at her mom, wipes her eyes. On Polly, incredibly 
           torn.  

           EXT. SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie watches the protesters continue to hand out flyers, 
           scream at Linda. 

           Linda sees Amanda, makes eye contact, keeps the protesters 
           occupied while Amanda dashes to the school. 

           EXT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Polly walks towards the protesters, furious. Linda intercepts 
           her.  

                                 POLLY
                        You said it would blow over. You 
                        promised it would blow over. 

                                 LINDA
                        It will. 

                                 POLLY
                        Yeah? When? 

                                 LINDA
                        She’s staying. I’ll leave before 
                        she does, you know that, right? 
           Linda tries to put her arm around her friend. 

                                 POLLY
                        If she had something else - cancer, 
                        a brain tumor - they’d be sending 
                        us pies and casseroles. 

           Polly shakes Linda’s arm off. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        How can they be scared of a child? 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie walks through a rush of kids. Looks for Sevrin, 
           doesn’t see him. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie watches as Amanda reaches Jessie, who hugs her. They 
           hurry to their lockers.

                                 AMANDA
                        My mom wanted to walk me inside. 

                                 JESSIE
                        Oh god. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t look sick, do I? 

                                 JESSIE
                        No. Your dress looks fantastic. 

           They both open their lockers, dump books in. There’s a mirror 
           in Amanda’s locker door. She catches her reflection. Checks 
           out her braces. Grimaces. A beat. 

           EXT. MORROW ROAD

           Polly drives, protesters crowding her rear view mirror. She 
           speeds up, almost drives through a stop sign, and slams 
           quickly on the breaks. She grits her teeth.

           EXT. DR. REARDON’S OFFICE

           In a lot behind pediatrics, Polly watches through her window - 
           and through Reardon’s - as he examines a child.
           INT. CHARLIE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           The blackboard says, “Welcome to Fourth Grade.” 

           A pretty young teacher, MISS LEVY, takes attendance. 

                                 MISS LEVY
                        Sam Woodward? Raise your hand, Sam- 
                        Laura Miller, great! Matthew 
                        Morris, hi Matthew!...Charlie 
                        Farrell... 

           The seats next to Charlie are empty.

                                 MISS LEVY (CONT’D)
                        And - all right - Scott Zeifer, hi 
                        Scott! 

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - DAY

           Amanda practices on the parallel bars. Coach Eagan 
           approaches, stares up at her. 

                                 AMANDA
                        What am I doing wrong? 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Nothing. 

           Amanda jumps down, trying not to show how winded she is.

                                 COACH EAGAN (CONT’D)
                        If you’re ever tired, or don’t feel 
                        well, I want you to let me know. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not an idiot. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Nope. You’re a champion. Champions 
                        don’t let themselves feel pain. 
                        That’s why I’m worried.

           Amanda takes this in, nods. Eagan gestures to Sue Sherman, 
           who is practicing back flips. 

                                 COACH EAGAN (CONT’D)
                        She still can’t get those right. 
                           (off Amanda’s silence)
                        Why, do you think? 
                                 AMANDA
                        She’s not tucking in her legs 
                        enough. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Bingo. Tell her that, will you? She 
                        won’t listen to me. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I don’t think she’ll listen to me 
                        either. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Your call. 

           A couple girls have stopped practicing. Eagan notices. 

                                 COACH EAGAN (CONT’D)
                        What are you all looking at? This 
                        isn’t a show, ladies! Get back to 
                        work. 

           Eagan walks off and starts to yell at Sue and Evelyn. Amanda 
           stands there, still catching her breath, watching him. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Amanda changes in a bathroom stall. She’s thinner than she 
           used to be. She can hear three girls - EVELYN CROWLEY, Sue 
           Sherman, and Kristy Gleason - whispering. 

                                 EVELYN (O.C)
                        Do you think she sat on the toilet 
                        seats? 

                                 KRISTY (O.C.)
                        I’m never, ever, peeing in there 
                        again. 

           On Amanda. Wanting to show them that she’s there, stand up 
           for herself. She stays where she is. 

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM HALLWAY - LATER

           Charlie waits nervously outside of the locker room as Evelyn, 
           Sue, and Kristy dart out. They glance at him and whisper to 
           each other. 

           Charlie watches them leave. Amanda pushes through the locker 
           room door. 
           Amanda has sewn the dinosaur patch on the side of her gym 
           bag. Charlie notices.

                                 AMANDA
                        What’s wrong? 

           Charlie looks at the ground, pulls at the hem of his too- 
           tight shirt.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sevrin’s not in school. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Did you call him? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yesterday. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Don’t be a baby. Go over to his 
                        house. 

           EXT. STAFFORD HOUSE - LATER

           Charlie rides his bike onto the Stafford’s front yard. Sevrin 
           tosses a frisbee and Felix fetches.

           Felix charges at Charlie and knocks him down, licking his 
           face.

                                 SEVRIN 
                        Felix, get off him! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Your dog has a gallon of saliva in 
                        his mouth. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        That’s cause I don’t let him 
                        slobber on me anymore. 
                           (to Felix)
                        Get off him. Fatso. Get. 

           Charlie pets Felix.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Where have you been? 

           Sevrin throws the frisbee. Felix fetches.

                                 SEVRIN
                        My mom switched me to Camden. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        The prep school? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Private school. 

           Sevrin ties Felix to the fence. 

                                 SEVRIN (CONT’D)
                        They have a swimming pool. I might 
                        get to play on the soccer team. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        But why? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        My cousins go there. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh. 
                           (a beat)
                        We can investigate the turtle 
                        Saturday. 

                                 SEVRIN
                           (quietly)
                        I’m not allowed. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        But it’s Saturday. 

           Sevrin kneels down next to Felix, pets him. He looks really 
           upset. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the big deal? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        I can’t be friends with you. Cause 
                        of Amanda. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What did she do? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Cause she’s, you know... My mom’s 
                        scared I’ll get it. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Didn’t you tell her that’s 
                        scientifically impossible? 
                           (off Sevrin’s silence)
                        Didn’t you tell her that? 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 SEVRIN
                        She’s really serious. She’ll ground 
                        me for my whole entire life. 

           Betsy opens the door. If she sees Charlie she does not 
           acknowledge it. 

                                 BETSY 
                        Sevrin! 

           And then she’s back inside. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        I have to go.

           Sevrin walks towards the house. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        There’s no proof. There’s no 
                        scientific evidence. 

           Sevrin’s actually crying. He unties Felix, walks towards the 
           house with his dog. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        I’m really sorry. 

           Charlie gets on his bike.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And you know what else? A 
                        tyrannosaurus can’t attack a 
                        brontosaurus. They lived 83 million 
                        years apart. 

                                 BETSY (O.S.)
                        SEVRIN!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Good luck making the soccer team. 

           Charlie pedals away. He won’t look back.

           EXT. POND - LATER

           Charlie sits at the pond, the turtle visible. Charlie walks 
           closer, takes out his notebook, jots down a few observations, 
           trying not to cry. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           INT. FARRELL UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Charlie tiptoes to bed. The door to his sister’s room is 
           open. Polly holds Amanda. Ivan changes her sheets. His sister 
           looks small and weak. 

           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE -  ANOTHER DAY

           Polly and Amanda get into the car. Charlie stands next to his 
           bike, his backpack on. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Are you coming? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I want to ride my bike. 

           This barely registers with Polly. She gets into the car, 
           drives off. Charlie watches the car turn the corner. Gets on 
           his bike. 

           EXT. POND - DAY

           Charlie takes pictures of the turtle with Polly’s camera. He 
           tries to make himself as quiet as possible, like Laurel said. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        Sometimes I think about how turtles 
                        survived the second extinction 
                        event, which was bad for the 
                        dinosaurs but good for us.

           It starts to rain, but Charlie doesn’t notice. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        Maybe because they didn’t need 
                        friends.

           Charlie gets lost in the wonder of studying the turtle. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        Maybe because they were solitary, 
                        they evolved that way. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Charlie enters, camera in his backpack. Polly’s talking on 
           the phone, taking meatloaf out of the oven. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 POLLY 
                           (into phone)
                        I don’t know, Dad. Ask Ivan, he’s 
                        the scientist. No, you don’t need 
                        to drive down. Don’t. Because I’m 
                        asking you not to - 
                           (to Charlie)
                        Can you tell your sister dinner’s 
                        ready? 

           Charlie goes upstairs. 

           INT. FARRELL UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/AMANDA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie climbs the stairs. Madonna’s. “True Blue” blasts from 
           Amanda’s room. 

           Charlie knocks on Amanda’s door. No answer. Charlie opens the 
           door to see Amanda lying on her gymnastics mat, exhausted. 
           She scrambles to her feet and pretends to start a cartwheel.

                                 AMANDA
                        I said I’m practicing gymnastics!

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s just me. 

           Amanda pushes him out and slams the door. 

           INT. AMANDA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Amanda sits there, breathing heavily. She turns the music 
           even louder. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Charlie, Polly, and Amanda silently eat meatloaf. Charlie 
           watches as his sister mashes her food around her plate, 
           trying to make it look like she’s eaten. She’s gotten 
           thinner. Polly gets a couple of pills from the cabinet. 

                                 POLLY
                        Your father wanted you to take 
                        these. 

           Amanda pushes the pills away. 

                                 AMANDA
                        He’s never even home. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 POLLY
                        Just take them, will you 
                        sweetheart? 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Polly finishes drying the dishes. Looks out the window - Ivan 
           isn’t coming. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie lies awake, headlights illuminate his window. The 
           sound of the car door opening and closing. 

           INT. FARRELL UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie tiptoes down the steps. His father sits at the 
           kitchen table, reading through a printed stack of papers. 

           Charlie roots through the nearly empty fridge, pours himself 
           some milk. It’s spoiled. Charlie throws it in the sink. Sits 
           down next to Ivan, looks through a couple of his papers:  - 
           alternative therapies for AIDS, the creation and destruction 
           of T-cells.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is this for Amanda? 

                                 IVAN
                           (beat, nods)
                        There has to be some sort of 
                        antidote, a chemical reaction that 
                        creates T-cells as the virus 
                        destroys them.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Can I read it? 

                                 IVAN
                        Knock yourself out. 

           Ivan’s eyes are red. Charlie looks through the papers, he 
           doesn’t quite understand it. 

           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE - MORNING 

           A colder day, the leaves have almost all turned. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - SAME

           Charlie’s at the stove on a step stool, helping Ivan make 
           pancakes. Amanda and Polly set the table as they fight. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m not eating till you let me go! 

                                 POLLY
                        Sweetie, please. 

                                 IVAN
                        This isn’t helping your case. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Charlie, tell them! 

                                 CHARLIE
                           (torn)
                        It’s true. 

                                 AMANDA
                        See! You can’t go to a sleep over 
                        and not sleep over! 

           Ivan puts four pills next to Amanda’s plate. Drops medication 
           into her orange juice. 

                                 IVAN
                        Take these. Now. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I take them, I sleep over, I take 
                        them, I sleep over - 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Ivan)
                        What’s one night? 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Polly)
                        One night too many. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Everyone else is! Don’t do this to 
                        me! 

           Charlie takes the spatula and scrapes the pancakes onto a 
           plate. 

                                 POLLY
                        Ivan, come on - 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 IVAN
                        - I said, after dinner. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You hate me! 

                                 POLLY
                        We love you. 

           Amanda throws her pills into the trash. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Sweetie, you need those - 

                                 IVAN
                        You can go to Jessie’s but you 
                        can’t sleep over. Period. 

           Amanda grabs her plate and throws it on the floor. It 
           shatters, surprising Charlie - he’s never seen his sister act 
           this way. He hurries to the shards, begins picking them up. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going. 

           Amanda’s off- running through the house, crying, wheezing, 
           throwing everything that’s in her way. This takes more 
           strength than she has.

                                 AMANDA
                        -you’re ruining my life, you’re 
                        ruining my life, you’re ruining my 
                        life, you’re ruining my life, 
                        you’re ruining my life- 

                                 POLLY
                        Amanda - 

                                 IVAN
                        Leave her be. 

                                 POLLY
                        It’s one night - 

                                 IVAN
                        We decided this - 

                                 POLLY
                        - you’re never even here.  

           Polly slams her coffee cup into the sink, heads out the front 
           door, after Amanda. Charlie throws the pieces of the plate 
           into the trash. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie’s still cleaning. He watches out of the window as 
           Polly calms Amanda down. 

           EXT. MORROW ROAD - DAY

           Polly drives Amanda towards Jessie Eagan’s house. 

           EXT. EAGAN HOUSE - DAY

           From the car, Polly watches Amanda hurry towards Jessie, who 
           throws her arms around her. 

           INT. DR. REARDON’S OFFICE - LATER

           Ed Reardon hands Polly a coffee, sits down across from her. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        I hope it’s not terrible. Monica 
                        usually makes it. 

                                 POLLY
                        Thanks again. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        What are you thanking me for? 

                                 POLLY
                        Meeting on a Saturday. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        It’s really no problem. 

           Polly takes a sip. The coffee is pretty bad, but she tries to 
           hide it. She thinks for a moment. Speaks in a long blurt. 

                                 POLLY
                        When she got the transfusion. Who 
                        said it was fine, who signed the 
                        papers? Ivan keeps everything, all 
                        our taxes, all the medical files. 
                        It’s all in a mess in his fucking 
                        office. 
                           (off his silence)
                        Please. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        You don’t want to go down this 
                        path, Polly. 
                                 POLLY
                        It’s not a path. It’s simple 
                        information.

                                 ED REARDON
                        I did. The surgeon makes the call 
                        but the primary care physician 
                        signs off. So if you’re looking for 
                        someone to blame, look no further. 

                                 POLLY
                        The parents have to sign off. Which 
                        one of us did? 

                                 ED REARDON
                        What can I do to help?  

                                 POLLY
                        The parents have to sign off. Which 
                        one of us did? 

                                 ED REARDON
                        Polly, I really don’t remember. 

           Polly puts the coffee down, puts on her coat. 

                                 POLLY
                        She hasn’t been breathing great. Do 
                        you think you could come see her 
                        tomorrow? 

                                 ED REARDON
                        Of course. 

           Polly heads to the door. 

           INT. PHARMACY - LATER

           Ivan loads organic vitamins and supplements onto the counter.  
           He waits, blinking away exhaustion, as the CASHIER rings him 
           up. 

           Charlie watches. 

           EXT/INT. DEXTER’S RESTAURANT - LATER

           Charlie watches lobsters floating in a tank. 

           Ivan waves at the a young HOST, who waves back and makes his 
           way to the front of the restaurant.
                                 IVAN
                        Two of us tonight. 

                                 HOST
                        Let me see what I’ve got for you. 

           He heads back into the fray of families, stops to talk to a 
           WAITER, who gestures towards Charlie and Ivan. 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Charlie)
                        What are you thinking about, buddy? 
                        Gonna splurge on a lobster? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t like how you can see their 
                        eyes.  

           The host comes back.

                                 HOST
                        I’m sorry, sir, we don’t have any 
                        space tonight. 

           There is definitely space in the restaurant. 

                                 IVAN
                        There’s a table right there.  

                                 HOST
                        We have a large party coming, sir, 
                        and unfortunately don’t have space 
                        to seat you.  

           A few people are already looking at them. 

                                 IVAN
                        Are you kidding me? 

                                 HOST
                        I’m very sorry, sir. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on, Dad. 

           Charlie grabs his dad’s arm, steers him towards the door. 

                                 IVAN
                        Are you fucking serious?  

                                 HOST
                        We have to ask you to leave, sir. 
                                 IVAN
                        You know what? To hell with you. 
                        I’ve been a loyal patron ten years. 
                        Ten goddamn years. Are you fucking 
                        kidding me? 

                                 HOST
                        I’m sorry, sir - 

                                 IVAN
                        And you can tell your manager to go 
                        to hell. Louie. I know him. His kid 
                        was one of my students. To hell 
                        with all of you - 

           INT. FARRELL CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Ivan drives in darkness. 

                                 IVAN
                        Did you see the look on that kid’s 
                        face?  

           Charlie looks over at his dad. He’s smiling? He’s laughing.

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        He just kept repeating himself. I’m 
                        sorry sir, I’m sorry sir. 

           Ivan keeps laughing. Charlie doesn’t know what to do. After a 
           moment, Ivan stops. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, buddy. You must think I’m 
                        pretty crazy. 
                           (beat)
                        Can I ask you a question?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I guess. 

                                 IVAN
                        At school, are the kids saying 
                        anything to Amanda? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        They just don’t talk to her. Except 
                        for Jessie. 

                                 IVAN
                        Are they saying anything to you? 

           Charlie shakes his head. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is she going to die? 

           Ivan keeps driving. After a moment: 

                                 IVAN
                        We all are, bud, at some point. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not a baby. 

                                 IVAN
                        I know you’re not. 

           Charlie looks out the window, the pitch black sky, so many 
           stars.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did turtles survive the cretaceous 
                        period because they could hide? 

                                 IVAN
                        They were adaptable. The bigger 
                        carnivores weren’t used to foraging 
                        for food, but turtles were. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is that why their life span is so 
                        much longer? 

           Ivan’s lost in thought, he doesn’t answer. Charlie doesn’t 
           press it. 

           EXT. MORROW/MARSH - EARLY MORNING

           Charlie rides his bike past Laurel Smith’s house. A new 
           insult has been sprayed across her porch. 

           EXT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL - LATER

           Charlie rides his bike up to the school. Two WOMEN are 
           collecting signatures on a petition. 

                                 MOTHER #5
                        -We only need 200 signatures to 
                        request her resignation - 

                                 MOTHER #3
                        - We already have a hundred twenty 
                        seven - 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           Charlie watches one parent sign the petition. Another mulls 
           it over. They don’t notice him.  

           INT. CHESHIRE HALLWAY/GYM - ANOTHER DAY

           Charlie watches Amanda struggling in gym practice. Jessie 
           sits close to her. 

           INT. LUNCHROOM - ANOTHER DAY

           Bustling with kids: screaming, yelling, throwing food. 
           Charlie eats his lunch alone. 

           INT. FOURTH GRADE CLASSROOM - DAY

           The young teacher, Miss Levy sits on her desk while the kids 
           finish math quizzes.

           Thanks to a seating chart prominently displayed on the black 
           board, Charlie now has kids on either side of him. 

                                 MISS LEVY
                        3, 2, 1, and...time’s up! Is 
                        everybody done? 
                           (off their silence)
                        Is everybody done? 

                                 KIDS 
                        Yes, Ms. Levy. 

                                 MISS LEVY
                        Pass your papers to the left. 
                        That’s right, Bobby, pass yours 
                        back a row. 

           Charlie tries to hand his paper to a little girl, who 
           hesitates. Doesn’t take it. 

                                 MISS LEVY (CONT’D)
                        Is there a problem, Donna? 
                           (off Donna’s silence)
                        Donna, please take Charlie’s paper. 

           An overweight kid, BILLY, pipes up. 

                                 BILLY
                        -she doesn’t want to get diseased. 

           Charlie turns around. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re a fat, stupid slob. 

                                 MISS LEVY
                        Charlie! 

                                 BILLY
                        Everyone is gonna die and it’s all 
                        his stupid sister’s fault- 

           Charlie picks up his notebook and HURLS it at the kid.

           INT. LINDA GLEASON’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM

           Charlie enters. The secretary is gone, her desk empty. Paper 
           scraps scattered on the table, filling the waste baskets. 

           INT. LINDA GLEASON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 

           Charlie opens the door. Linda stands by the window, smoking 
           the last of a pack of cigarettes. She sees Charlie, tries to 
           put out the cigarette, and burns her finger.

                                 LINDA
                        Shit! Don’t tell anyone the 
                        principal’s been cursing. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No one was out there. 

                                 LINDA
                        She quit. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why? 

                                 LINDA
                        Ha. Some days I don’t blame her. 

           She empties the ashes into the trash can. 

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t smoke. Ever. It’s a horrible 
                        habit. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why do you do it? 

                                 LINDA
                        I have a horrible habit. Here- this 
                        is the better chair. 
           She takes the note that Charlie hands her. Holds out two 
           lollipops.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Take your pick. 

           Charlie takes one.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        Good choice. 

           She unwraps the other. Skims Charlie’s note.

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        People can be very stupid. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like those people outside? 

                                 LINDA
                        Yeah. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why don’t they like you? 

           Linda lets out a short laugh.

                                 LINDA
                        When you run a place a long time, 
                        you find out a lot about people.
                           (beat)
                        People are scared when they 
                        shouldn’t be and they’re not when 
                        there’s really something to be 
                        scared of. 
                           (beat)
                        You knew that, didn’t you? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I guess. 

                                 LINDA
                        I’ll tell you what - I have an 
                        idea. I just hope that it’s a good 
                        one. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - ANOTHER DAY

           Kids filter in noisily, fill up the pews. Miss Levy leads 
           Charlie and his classmates in. Linda’s at the podium, 
           conferring with a tall woman (ELLEN SHAPIRO) in a business 
           suit. 
           Charlie sits down. The KID following him hesitates. 

                                 MISS LEVY
                        Make space, guys. 

           The KID nervously sits next to Charlie. Charlie glares at 
           him. Miss Levy smiles at Charlie. A kid next to Charlie 
           snickers. 

                                 LINDA
                        As some of you upper graders may 
                        have guessed from my special guest, 
                        we’re not going to be talking about 
                        the Spring trip. Until we have some 
                        unity as a school, we’re not going 
                        to be having a spring trip. You can 
                        tell your parents I said that. 

           Charlie looks around. Kids are already whispering to one 
           another.  

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        This is Dr. Ellen Shapiro. She’s a 
                        pediatric AIDS specialist, and 
                        she’s come all the way from Boston 
                        to speak to all of you.  It’s been 
                        a scary few weeks, and I’m sorry 
                        for that. I hope it will seem a 
                        little less scary after Ellen talks 
                        to you today. 

           Linda switches a slide. The screen reads “FACTS ABOUT 
           ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME.” 

                                 LINDA (CONT’D)
                        The way this is going to go is, Dr. 
                        Shapiro is going to walk you 
                        through these facts and pictures 
                        here. We’ll have time for questions 
                        after. 

           The kid sitting next to Charlie covers his eyes. There is 
           murmurs and gossip in the rows behind and in front of him. 

                                 ELLEN SHAPIRO
                        Hi everyone. First: how many of you 
                        know what a sperm looks like?  

           A few uncomfortable giggles. Charlie gets up.  

                                 MISS LEVY
                        Charlie! 

           Charlie doesn’t answer. He just runs.
           INT. CHESHIRE LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie runs through the library, to the...

           EXT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           ...playground, where Amanda’s on the swings, swinging back 
           and forth, gracefully, like on the parallel bars. Charlie 
           watches for a moment. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        You want to see something amazing? 

           She looks up, surprised to see him. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Insect amazing or actually amazing? 

                                 MISS LEVY (O.S.)
                        Charlie! Back inside. 

           Miss Levy walks towards them, anxious. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let’s run. 

           Charlie and Amanda take off...

           EXT. MARSH - DAY

           The road near Laurel Smith’s house. Charlie and Amanda run. 
           Amanda stops to catch her breath. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you OK? 

           Amanda nods, smiles. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Sometimes I feel normal and 
                        sometimes I’m just really tired. 
                           (a beat)
                        Where are we going, beetle brain? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’re almost there. 

           EXT. POND - DAY

           Charlie and Amanda approach the pond. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        We have to be really, really quiet. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Is this where you go? To get your 
                        specimens? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just wait. 

           Charlie reaches the edge of the lake. He drops a stone into 
           the lake. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. We won’t hurt you. 

           The turtle comes out. He seems even bigger than before. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh my gosh. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Isn’t he amazing? 

                                 AMANDA
                        He looks like a zombie lizard. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No he doesn’t. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m just joking. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I think he would have been friends 
                        with a stegosaurus. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah, they’re like cousins or 
                        something. 

           EXT. POND - LATER

           Amanda sleeps. Charlie takes pictures of the lake, the 
           turtle. 

           A flock of EGRETS fly south, waking Amanda. Charlie and 
           Amanda watch them rise and dip over the trees. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        The last ones. 

           Amanda’s deep in thought. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 AMANDA
                        That woman, Laurel? Who mom used to 
                        take pictures of. Do you think she 
                        can really talk to people after 
                        they die?  
                           (beat)
                        I’d ask mom, but I don’t want to 
                        upset her. 

           Charlie thinks about this. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why would everyone be scared of her 
                        if she couldn’t? 

           Amanda thinks about this. Doesn’t have an answer. 

           EXT. MARSH/LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Charlie rides his bike to Laurel’s house. Stops in front of 
           her bungalow. Watches a WOMAN go in. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie quietly drops his bike in the reeds and creeps up to 
           Laurel’s house. Peers in through a window on the porch. 
           Laurel gives the woman tea. They sit on cushions. Laurel 
           takes a picture from the woman, looks at it, closes her eyes. 

           Charlie can’t hear anything. 

           EXT. MORROW/MARSH - LATER

           Charlie watches the woman leave the house. The woman is 
           crying, but other than that seems totally fine. She gets into 
           her car, drives away. 

           Charlie quietly gets up, inadvertently knocking into a broom, 
           which clutters to the floor. Laurel opens the door. Charlie 
           freezes. 

                                 LAUREL
                        It took me two days to scrub that 
                        shit off, you know? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I didn’t do it. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 LAUREL
                        That’s what they all say, I’m 
                        innocent, my friends made me, blah 
                        blah. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I really didn’t!
                           (beat)
                        I don’t have friends, anyway. 

           Laurel regards him for a moment. 

                                 LAUREL
                        You like to spy, Polly’s son? 

           Charlie shakes his head. 

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Well? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was just....I wanted to see...if 
                        you could really talk to people. 
                        When they’re dead. 

                                 LAUREL
                        What do you think? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s scientifically impossible. 

                                 LAUREL
                        And how do you know this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Because when a person dies they 
                        just disintegrate. Their body and 
                        their brain, too. 

                                 LAUREL
                        How do you know this? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Everyone does. 

           She looks at him for a moment. 

                                 LAUREL
                        Tell your mother I hope she is 
                        well. 

           Laurel goes inside. Charlie glances at the faint outline of 
           spray paint under the new white coat. He goes to the reeds, 
           where his bike is hiding. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie rides. 

           EXT. POND - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie pulls up to the pond. It’s beginning to ice over. The 
           turtle is nowhere to be seen. 

           INT. CHESHIRE HALLWAY - DAY

           Charlie watches as Jessie and Amanda walk down the hall. 
           Amanda has to stop for a moment, Jessie waits for her. 

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - NIGHT

           Polly, Charlie and Ivan search for seats, which isn’t too 
           hard because the attendance is about half. Linda sits in the 
           front row with her husband, MARTIN, a small flower bouquet on 
           her lap.  

                                 POLLY
                        Towards the back. 

                                 IVAN
                        Over there? 

                                 POLLY
                        Fine. 

           Charlie spots a man in his seventies, baseball jacket and 
           baseball cap; a woman in her seventies, regal and dyed-blond. 
           These are Polly’s parents, AL and CLAIRE.

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                           (to Ivan)
                        You invited my parents? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Grandma and Grandpa?!

                                 POLLY
                           (to Ivan)
                        Why would you do that? 

                                 IVAN
                        Polly -

                                 POLLY
                        They’re not even sitting on the 
                        right side. 
                                 IVAN
                        You want to tell them to leave, be 
                        my guest. Jesus. 

                                 POLLY
                        They’re sitting on the wrong side. 
                        Everyone there is rooting for the 
                        other school. 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Charlie)
                        Go get ‘em, buddy. 

           Charlie looks up at his dad, his mom. Then decides: he runs 
           to his grandparents.

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie drags his grandparents to the right side of the gym. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Everyone on that side is rooting 
                        for the other school. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Silly of us. 

           Al and Claire clock Charlie’s rumpled clothes and the jeans 
           that are much too big for him. They reach Polly and Ivan. 
           Tense hugs and kisses. 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT’D)
                           (To Polly)
                        Hi, darling. 

                                 AL
                        How’s my favorite grandson? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m your only grandson. 

           Al slips Charlie a five dollar bill. Winks at him.

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - LATER 

           EAGAN crosses the gym and squats down, saying something harsh 
           to Jessie, who joins the other girls. Amanda sits down next 
           to her. She looks painfully thin. 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Polly)
                        Is she OK? 
                                 POLLY
                        Eagan wouldn’t have her out there 
                        if she wasn’t. 

           They both watch their daughter, nervous. 

           Kristy Gleason walks the balance beam. Sue flubs a back flip. 

           The meet is underway and Amanda hasn’t done one event. 

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - LATER

           Amanda moves to the center of the gym and stops, sets her 
           feet, arms reaching towards the sky. 

           Madonna’s “True Blue” begins. She’s suspended in the tension 
           of not moving. 

           Then, like a fish suddenly set in water, she does. 
           Cartwheels, layovers, back flips, hands stands, somersaults. 

           Amanda puts her whole self into this performance; when she is 
           on the mat she is another person - luminous, graceful, adept 
           beyond her years. 

           Even Charlie is riveted. 

           Amanda is done. In the center of the gym. Arms high again. If 
           you looked closely you’d see how hard she was breathing, that 
           this has taken everything she has. 

           The clapping starts. First the Coach, and this is something 
           he has never done. Then Jessie, then Sue, then most of the 
           other girls - even Evelyn.

           The gymnastics team is on their feet. Amanda beams.

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER

           A crowded hallway. Amanda runs out of the locker room and 
           hugs her grandparents.

                                 AMANDA 
                           (To Claire and Al)
                        What’d you think? 

                                 POLLY
                        Amazing, honey. Absolutely 
                        unbelievable. 

           Jessie comes over, hugs Amanda hard. Hugs Polly too. 
           INT. FARRELL LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           A game of monopoly on the coffee table. Polly, Ivan, Amanda, 
           Charlie, Al, and Claire play and eats ice cream. They are mid-
           conversation. Al talks with his mouth full.

                                 AL
                        - you’d think that, you’d think 
                        that, but I was useless as a rat in 
                        Rome. Hah! I was skinny- 

                                 CLAIRE
                        -he was skinny- 

                                 AL
                        -Got knocked over, got nosebleeds- 

                                 IVAN
                        Anyone want more ice cream? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        200! Passed ‘Go,’ 200! 

                                 AL
                        Coach used to say, ‘hey Alvin, you 
                        got shit in your blood?’ 

                                 POLLY
                        It’s your move, Dad. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You gonna buy? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You’re awfully thrifty, darling. 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m going to bed. 

           She stands, kisses her grandparents. Polly jumps up after 
           her. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I can do it myself! 

           Amanda shakily makes her way to the stairs and climbs them. 

                                 AL
                        Take a load off, kid, enjoy 
                        yourself. 

           Polly doesn’t sit. 
                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Relax, will you? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sit down, Polly, please. 

           Polly just stands there. Al goes over to her, puts his arm 
           around her. 

                                 AL
                           (quietly)
                        You’ve got two kids, don’t forget 
                        that. 

                                 POLLY
                        You think that I don’t know that? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Darling, your father didn’t mean 
                        anything - 

                                 POLLY
                        I would appreciate, if before you 
                        insult me, you swallow the ice 
                        cream you’re dripping all over my 
                        sofa - 

                                 IVAN
                        Pol - he wasn’t thinking. 

                                 POLLY
                        No, of course not, that’s the 
                        problem. 

           Polly turns, walks out. 

                                 IVAN
                           (to Al)
                        You’ve got a lot of nerve. 

           Ivan follows Polly. 

                                 AL
                           (to Claire)
                        If you can’t tell your own kids 
                        what to do, who can you tell? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Anyone else. 

           Charlie looks between his grandparents. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 CHARLIE
                           (to Al)
                        You owe me rent. A hundred dollars. 

           INT. FARRELL LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Charlie watches TV. Nearby, Polly cleans up the kitchen, 
           Claire moves to help. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Your father didn’t mean that. 

                                 POLLY
                        It’s fine. 
                           (off Claire’s attempt to 
                           help)
                        I said, I got it. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Why won’t you let us help you? 

                                 POLLY
                        Because all I can do right now is 
                        clean the kitchen and cook dinner, 
                        OK? I don’t have answers for 
                        anything. 

           Claire begins loading the dishes. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Mom, for god sakes. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        You were like this as a girl, too. 
                        Always had to control everything. 
                        It’s not helping you, sweetheart. 

                                 POLLY
                        Mom. Go to sleep. Please. 

           Charlie wanders over. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s late, Grandma. 

           Claire gives him a hug, kisses his hair, squeezes him, too 
           tight. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Come here, sweet boy, I never get 
                        to see you. 
           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - LATER

           Charlie can’t sleep. Loud coughing and whispered fighting 
           from the hallway.

                                 POLLY (O.S.)
                        Don’t wake my parents. 

           Charlie tiptoes into the hallway, looks into the bathroom. 
           Amanda’s sitting on the floor, back against the toilet seat. 
           Polly’s wiping her forehead with a cool cloth. Ivan sees 
           Charlie.

                                 IVAN
                        Go back to bed. 

           INT. FARRELL HALLWAY - LATER

           Polly and Ivan talk to Ed Reardon. Charlie peers through the 
           banister bars. 

                                 ED REARDON
                           (to Polly)
                        There’s fluid in her lungs, which 
                        could mean pneumonia - 

           Claire and Al come in.

                                 POLLY
                        Everything’s fine, Mom. 

                                 AL
                        Like hell it is. 

           Reardon puts his arm around Claire, leads her away. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        We’ve got it under control, the 
                        best thing you can do is get some 
                        rest. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie watches his parents’ car pull away. 

           INT. CHARLIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Charlie wakes up. There’s a brand new shirt and pair of pants 
           on the end of his bed. They are pretty formal and don’t look 
           like anything he’d wear, but they fit. 
           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - MORNING

           Charlie walks into the kitchen in the new clothes. His lunch 
           is on the kitchen table. Al is making coffee. 

                                 AL
                        Don’t you look sharp. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did grandma make these? 

                                 AL
                        No, you lucked out. She went to the 
                        Gap. 

           Charlie pulls Pop Tarts from the almost-empty cupboard and 
           puts them in the toaster.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        Ah. Pop tarts. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You want? 

           Al shakes his head. He’s boiling water.

                                 AL
                        Your grandma is addicted to my 
                        coffee. I bet you didn’t know that, 
                        did you? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know. 

                                 AL
                        Can you keep a secret? 

           Charlie nods. 

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        It’s instant. 

           He puts his finger to his lips.

                                 AL (CONT’D)
                        I’m trusting you on this. 

           Charlie smiles.

           INT. LUNCHROOM - LATER

           Charlie enters. A noisy cluster of kids. Jessie sits alone. 
           He walks up to her.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi. 

                                 JESSIE
                        Hi. 

           She motions for him to sit down. He does. He unloads his 
           lunch.

                                 JESSIE (CONT’D)
                        Looks good. 

           His grandparents have packed two slices of bread. Some sort 
           of rubbery lunch meat. A juice pack.

                                 JESSIE (CONT’D)
                        Here. My dad would kill me if he 
                        knew this was in my possession. 

           She hands him half a chocolate bar. They chew in silence.

           EXT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie and Jessie sit on the slide. Boys from Charlie’s 
           class run by, laughing and playing tag.

                                 JESSIE
                        They’re all morons. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I wouldn’t hang out with them if 
                        they asked me to. 

                                 JESSIE
                        Girls are worse. Trust me. 

           Jessie looks out at the playground.

                                 JESSIE (CONT’D)
                        My dad hasn’t shut up about her 
                        floor routine. She's like his 
                        favorite person in the world. He 
                        told my mom if anyone else used 
                        Madonna he'd confiscate the tape. 

           Bells chime. Kids start going back into the school.

                                 JESSIE (CONT’D)
                        You coming in? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. 
           But he doesn’t move. Jessie gets up.

                                 JESSIE
                        My teacher’s gonna be mad if I’m 
                        late. 

           Charlie nods and watches Jessie go. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL, AMANDA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Dim lights. Amanda sleeps, magazines with pictures of Cyndi 
           Lauper and Bruce Springsteen spread around her. Polly tucks 
           her in. 

           Reardon comes in, hands her a coffee. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        She comfortable? 

           Polly nods. Heads to the window, looks out at the parking 
           lot. It’s pouring outside. 

                                 ED REARDON (CONT’D)
                        You might want to grab the couch in 
                        the lounge. 

                                 POLLY
                        I’m staying with Amanda. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        Of course. 

                                 POLLY
                        I’m sorry. About the other day. I 
                        had no right to ask you that. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        Don’t worry about it. 
                           (beat)
                        I think I’ve been misleading you. 
                        Letting you think there were 
                        treatments, options. That this 
                        wasn’t terminal. 

                                 POLLY
                        I know that. 

           Polly turns to Ed. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I go to your office. It’s so 
                        stupid...I sit there and watch you 
                        with your other patients and I 
                        wonder what’s that like. To not 
                        have to worry? To know whatever it 
                        is, it’ll be better tomorrow. I 
                        can’t eat. I’d switch bodies with 
                        her if I could. 
                           (beat)
                        I don’t blame you, you know that, 
                        right?
                           (off Ed’s silence)
                        There could be a million reasons 
                        but it all comes down to, I wasn’t 
                        watching closely. I’m supposed to 
                        protect her. 

                                 ED REARDON
                        You’re doing the best you can. 

           Polly shakes her head. He puts his arm around her shoulder. 
           He holds her for a moment. 

           She leans in, kisses him. He reciprocates for a moment. They 
           both pull away. A beat. 

                                 POLLY
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to -

                                 ED REARDON
                        It’s all right. 

           She moves next to Amanda’s bed. 

                                 POLLY
                        Go home. Please. We need you too 
                        much for you to be tired. 

           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL - AMANDA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Polly presses her hand to her lips, puts it on Amanda’s 
           forehead. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie eats dinner with his grandparents. Charlie pokes at 
           his food. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 CHARLIE
                        Grandma and Grandpa? How much do 
                        you know about the extinction event 
                        that ended the Cretaceous Period? 

           Al and Claire just look at each other. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        It was an asteroid, wasn’t it, 
                        darling? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah but it killed off 75 percent 
                        of the animals. Why do you think 
                        some of them lived and some of them 
                        didn’t?

                                 AL
                        Beats me, Charlie. 

           Headlights glare through the windows. After a moment Ivan 
           comes in, pats Charlie’s head.

                                 IVAN
                        She’s staying there tonight.

           Charlie watches his father put vitamins away. The weight of 
           the world on his shoulders. 

           INT. FARRELL CAR/EXT. MORROW ROAD - LATER

           Charlie rides his bike, sees Ivan’s car behind him.  

                                 IVAN
                        Hey! Buddy! 

           Charlie doesn’t stop.

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Charlie!

           Ivan pulls up next to Charlie, who pulls over. Nervous and 
           caught. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you supposed to be in 
                        school? 

           Charlie doesn’t look at him. Ivan gets out of the car, walks 
           over to his son. Pats Charlie’s enormous backpack. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        What do you have in there? Rocks? 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Books, dad. 

                                 IVAN
                        Ah, I understand. You robbed the 
                        library and now you’re making a run 
                        for it. 

           Charlie doesn’t laugh. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Where you going? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just the pond. 

                                  IVAN
                        Take a load off. 

           Charlie leans his bike against the car. Ivan sits in the 
           grass on the side of the road and motions for Charlie to do 
           the same. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Great shirt. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Grandma bought it. 

                                 IVAN
                        Oh yeah? 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        It’s really blue. 
                           (beat)
                        Dad. 

                                 IVAN
                        Yeah? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is there anything that has the 
                        lifespan of a day? 

                                 IVAN
                        Mayfly. Genus ephemera. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What about a year? 

                                 IVAN
                        Mice. Chameleons. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        Is there any way to make it longer? 

                                 IVAN
                        I know you’re worried about your 
                        sister. They’ll find a cure. All 
                        they need is time and money. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you know? 

                                 IVAN
                        Science, kiddo. Polio. 
                        Tuberculosis. Scarlet Fever. All 
                        used to be critical or terminal. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Will it be in time for Amanda? 

           Ivan hesitates. 

                                 IVAN
                        Probably not. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes or no?

                                 IVAN
                        No. It won’t be in time for Amanda. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Then I wish she would just die. 

           Ivan watches Charlie pull at the grass.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t mean that.  

                                 IVAN
                        I know, bud. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Does mom know? 

                                 IVAN
                        I think she does. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shouldn’t you talk to her about it? 

           They sit in silence. After a moment: 
                                 IVAN
                        How would you feel about coming 
                        with me on a little trip? 

           EXT. IVAN’S CAR - DAY

           Ivan drives, Charlie looks out the window. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Do you think that turtles realized 
                        if they wanted to survive, they 
                        couldn’t be horrible to all the 
                        other animals?

           Ivan glances at him. A beat. 

           EXT. ASTRONOMY INSTITUTE - DAY

           Ivan’s car pulls up, Charlie’s bike on the back. They get out 
           of the car, walk towards the institute.

           Charlie looks up at the building, then at his dad.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You can’t see stars during the day. 

                                 IVAN
                        Ah. You have yet to experience the 
                        wonders of the Edwin Hubble 
                        Institute. 

           He holds the door open for Charlie, who ducks under his arm.

           INT. OBSERVATORY - CONTINUOUS 

           Ivan opens the door to a small room with two telescopes, a 
           glass domed ceiling. 

           Ivan closes the door. Turns off the lights. The room is 
           suddenly pitch black and the stars are visible, glowing even, 
           through the dome. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Wow. 

           Ivan pulls a chair up to the larger telescope and Charlie 
           climbs up, looks through the lense. 

                                 IVAN
                        The brightest northern star. Do you 
                        see that? 
           Charlie nods.

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        And the brightest southern star. 
                        That’s the constellation Orion. The 
                        stars in the middle are bigger than 
                        the sun. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why do they look so small? 

                                 IVAN
                        They’re two million light years 
                        away. I ever tell you how they got 
                        there? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No. 

                                 IVAN
                        I didn’t tell you that story? 

           Charlie shakes his head.

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        Ah, jeez, if I can remember- I 
                        think I’ve got it. OK. A long time 
                        ago, millions of years ago- 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Before the dinosaurs? 

                                 IVAN
                        After the dinosaurs. There was a 
                        bear. A big black bear that was 
                        gentle but hunters didn’t know it. 
                        One day the bear was running 
                        through the forest. And the hunters 
                        saw the bear and they were scared. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        They killed it. 

                                 IVAN
                        With a spear. Right through his 
                        heart. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And then what? 

                                 IVAN
                        They knew they had made a terrible 
                        mistake. Instead of eating the bear 
                        they buried him. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 IVAN (CONT'D)
                        Flowers grew out of his body. His 
                        teeth rose up into the sky. Turned 
                        into stars. 

           Charlie pulls back from the telescope. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I like that story. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - DAY

           Charlie and Claire draw cheerful pictures all over a sign 
           that says “Welcome Home Amanda.” 

           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE - DAY

           Polly parks the car, helps Amanda into the house. Amanda’s 
           limp has gotten much worse. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - DAY

           Polly and Amanda come in, are descended on by a surprise 
           party: Claire, Al, Ivan, Charlie, Jessie. 

           Amanda’s pleased but exhausted. Jessie throws her arms around 
           Amanda. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - LATER

           There’s cake, a sense of diluted celebration. “Hungry Like 
           the Wolf” plays, the song bringing Polly back to the gym meet 
           a couple months ago. Charlie remembers too. 

           Polly and Ivan look at each other, a quiet acknowledgement of 
           how much has changed. 

           INT. AMANDA’S ROOM - DAY 

           Charlie comes in. Amanda’s sitting on her bed, propped up by 
           pillows, counting the bills in her money jar. Listening to 
           “Hungry Like the Wolf” again. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you doing? 

                                 AMANDA
                        Resting. All mom thinks I should 
                        ever do. 
           Charlie sits on the edge of the bed. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Duran Duran. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s good. 

                                 AMANDA 
                        You really like it? 

           Charlie nods. She shoves the bills back in her jar. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        They’re kicking me out. Of school.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How can they do that?  

                                 AMANDA
                        I heard mom on the phone, I think 
                        with Linda. I can stay till the end 
                        of October but that’s it. 
                           (beat)
                        Charlie? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Would you think it was stupid if I 
                        wanted a different wish? 

           Charlie shakes his head. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I was thinking about it. It would 
                        be great to train with Bela. But I 
                        really want my braces off. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s a good wish. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You think? 

           Charlie nods. 

           INT. FARRELL STAIRCASE - DAY

           Charlie walks down the stairs. Ivan and Al and Claire watch 
           TV in the living room. 
           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Polly’s in the kitchen re-arranging everything Claire’s 
           moved, cleaning even though the kitchen is extremely clean.

           Charlie enters. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mom. 

                                 POLLY
                        You want something? There should be 
                        milk in here, I just bought some. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Grandma threw out a bunch of stuff. 

                                 POLLY
                        Of course she did. Spick and span 
                        and you can’t find a goddamn thing. 
                        Sorry. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not thirsty anyway. 
                           (a beat)
                        Amanda has a wish. 

                                 POLLY
                        Let me guess. A training session 
                        with Bela Karolyi. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She wants her braces off. 

                                 POLLY
                        You’re kidding. 

           She starts to laugh. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s such a little wish. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Polly picks up the phone, dials. 

                                 POLLY
                        Hi, Nancy? It’s Polly Farrell. 
                        Yeah, we need an appointment with 
                        Dr. Crosbie. As soon as possible, 
                        tomorrow, today, if he has time. 

           She rolls her eyes, grins at Charlie.
                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing sooner? Amanda’s 
                        sick, there’s no way he can squeeze 
                        her in? 
                           (beat)
                        Amanda, right. 

           Polly hangs up. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Shit. Where the hell is-? 

           She looks down at the counter, where the phone book used to 
           be. Stalks into the living room...

           INT. FARRELL LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 

           ...where Claire reads, calmly. Al watches a Red Sox game.

                                 POLLY
                        -Mom, where’s the phone book? 

           Claire waves at the coffee table. Books and papers have been 
           stacked with a maximum of organization.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Right next to - 

                                 POLLY
                        -did it not occur to you that I 
                        might want the phone book - oh, let 
                        me think - next to the fucking 
                        phone? 

           She tears through the pile, tossing books and magazines left 
           and right. Ivan, hearing the commotion, comes downstairs. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        There was so much clutter, darling - 

                                 IVAN
                        Pol, she was trying to help - 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Ivan)
                        Why don’t you go back to work, OK? 
                           (to Claire)
                        I did not call maid service. I did 
                        not ask for my entire house to be 
                        reorganized. All I wanted was to 
                        come home and find things where, I, 
                        left, them- 
           She finds the phone book. She stalks back into the kitchen, 
           slams the phone book on the table and thumbs through it. 

           Ivan trails behind, hands on Charlie’s shoulders.

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Shit-shit-shit- 

           Charlie points to a name. She picks up the phone. Waits 
           tensely as it rings. All three of them do. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        -I’m trying to make an appointment 
                        for my daughter. She needs to get 
                        her braces off today, Tuesday at 
                        the latest. 
                           (beat)
                        Amanda Farrell. Yes. No she would 
                        be a new patient. Yes I can hold.
                           (beat)
                        Hello? 

           She hangs up. Charlie points to another name. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m trying to make an appointment 
                        for my daughter, to get her braces 
                        off. Tomorrow. Today? Thank god. 
                           (beat)
                        We’re in Morrow but we heard great 
                        things. 
                           (beat)
                        Amanda Farrell, she’s had them on 
                        since - 
                           (beat)
                        Hello? 
                           (beat)
                        Hello?

           She hangs up. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh for fucks sake. 

           Ivan touches her shoulder. 

                                 IVAN
                        We could try Boston. A dentist in 
                        Boston. 

                                 POLLY
                        I’m going to call Ed. 
                                 IVAN
                        Sure, fine, call Reardon, he’s the 
                        only person that you’ll listen to. 

                                 POLLY
                        Excuse me?  

                                 IVAN
                        He’s always here. In the morning, 
                        at night, when the kids get home 
                        from school -

                                 POLLY
                        - how would you know? 

                                 IVAN
                        -Jesus, doesn’t he have any other 
                        patients?

                                 POLLY
                        No! Most of them left! If you 
                        haven’t noticed no one wants 
                        anything to do with us. 

           This stops Ivan. He hadn’t thought about this. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        You wouldn’t know because you’re 
                        never here.

                                 IVAN
                        Tell me, Polly, where do you think 
                        I am?

                                 POLLY
                        You’re working. That’s where I 
                        think you are. You’re studying the 
                        goddamn solar system.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sweetheart. 

                                 POLLY
                        Stay out of this, Mom -

                                 IVAN
                        You can’t seriously think that. 

                                 POLLY
                        I don’t know, Ivan. What am I 
                        supposed to think? I mean, I guess 
                        occasionally you buy her 
                        ineffective vitamins. 
           Ivan grabs his briefcase. Roots through it. Grabs a folder, 
           slams it on the kitchen table. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        What is that? 

                                 IVAN
                        Look. Have a look. 

           Polly picks up the papers with reluctance. Looks through 
           them. Ivan’s research on alternative therapies for AIDS 
           patients. On nutritional remedies for the immune system. On T 
           Cell regeneration. The folder is thick and the research is 
           extensive. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        There’s a database at the 
                        institute. Medical libraries. And a 
                        pharmacy where I’ve been getting 
                        those vitamins, which have been 
                        proven to boost t-cell count. 

                                 POLLY
                        You could have said something. 

                                 IVAN
                        I shouldn’t have had to. 

           Polly looks through his research. 

                                 IVAN (CONT’D)
                        I know you blame me. 

                                 POLLY
                        I don’t.

                                 IVAN
                        Yeah you do.

           Charlie looks between his parents. 

                                 CLAIRE
                           (to Charlie)
                        Let’s go upstairs, darling. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Ivan)
                        You know what? Fine. I do. You 
                        understood about the blood 
                        transfusion, you knew about the 
                        risk. I didn’t understand any of 
                        that. 

           Ivan puts on his coat. 
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going? Back to the 
                        Institute? You haven’t found 
                        anything. 

           Ivan leaves, slamming the door. 

                                 CLAIRE
                           (to Polly)
                        Darling, is there anything we can - 

                                 POLLY
                        Just leave! Jesus Christ! 

           Claire says nothing. Charlie runs out of the room. 

           EXT. MORROW/MARSH - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie rides as fast as he can. The trees are bare. The 
           beginning of frost. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - LATER

           Charlie rides his bike to Laurel Smith’s house. Drops his 
           bike in the reeds. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - LATER

           Charlie knocks. Laurel opens the door. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You have to tell me if you really 
                        can. Speak to people after they 
                        die. You have to.  
                           (beat)
                        Please. 

           Laurel looks at him for a long moment. 

                                 LAUREL
                        Come. 

           He hesitates. 

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Come in. 
           INT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurel’s bungalow is decorated sparsely, a big white lamp, a 
           few black and white photos of Laurel as a little girl in 
           Russia. 

           Charlie pauses to look. It’s not as scary in here as he 
           thought. It’s actually fairly pleasant. A black cat creeps 
           out, winds around Laurel’s ankles. 

                                 LAUREL
                        This is Stella. You like cats? 

           Charlie shrugs. He’s not sure, really. 

           INT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie sits in Laurel’s kitchen. Laurel brings him a piece 
           of tart, a mug of milk. 

                                 LAUREL
                        First, eat. The milk is warm. 

           Charlie hesitates. Then takes a bite. It’s surprisingly good. 

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        Do you like it? 

           Charlie nods. 

                                 LAUREL (CONT’D)
                        My grandmother’s recipe. She made 
                        it often, when I was your age. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you talk to ghosts when you 
                        were my age? 

                                 LAUREL
                        Why do you want to know this? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You said if I ate you would tell 
                        me! 

           Laurel nods at the plate. Charlie takes another bite. Pushes 
           it away. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Who was the first dead person you 
                        ever talked to?
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 LAUREL
                        My mother. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you see her? 

                                 LAUREL
                        I did not. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        So how did you know it was her?

                                 LAUREL
                        I felt what she felt. Her hands 
                        used to shake. Mine did too. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        What did she say?

                                 LAUREL
                        She told me she would always be 
                        there, as long as I remembered her. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        How old were you? 

                                 LAUREL
                        Thirteen. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        My sister’s thirteen. 
                           (a beat)
                        How did she die? 

                                 LAUREL
                        You ask a lot of questions. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know. 

                                 LAUREL
                        She was very sick. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who took care of you? 

                                 LAUREL
                        My grandmother came to stay with 
                        us. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did she die before you came here?  
                                Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)

                                 LAUREL
                        It was not safe, where we were. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why not? 

           Laurel gets up, moves to the sink. She clearly doesn’t want 
           to talk about this. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Who was the second person you spoke 
                        to? 

                                 LAUREL
                        A janitor. The first school I went 
                        to in America. A nice man. Used to 
                        sneak me bologna sandwiches when 
                        everyone else treated me like shit. 
                        He had a heart attack.  
                           (she touches her chest)
                        I could feel it, here. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Is that why you sometimes look like  
                        the people you talk to? 

                                 LAUREL
                        Perhaps. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        My mom said it was just lighting. I 
                        guess she lied. 

           Laurel regards him, thinks for a moment, finally speaks.

                                 LAUREL
                        It is different every time. All I 
                        can say is, I think of a person. I 
                        try to sense them. Sometimes it 
                        works, sometimes it does not. 

           On Charlie, thinking about this. 

           INT. FARRELL LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Polly looks through Ivan’s research. She’s been crying. 

           The door opens. Charlie comes in. 

                                 POLLY
                        Where were you? 
                                 CHARLIE
                        You never care when dad’s gone. 

           Charlie sits down at the kitchen table. Starts to do his 
           homework. 

                                 POLLY
                        Charlie. 

           Charlie ignores her. Polly walks towards him, puts her hand 
           on his shoulder. He shakes it off. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Charlie’s still doing his homework. Polly and Amanda watch 
           the Olympics on TV. 

           The doorbell rings. Polly answers, still holding the folder.

           Ivan steps in, carrying a box of pizza. Steam drifts from it. 

                                 IVAN
                        Your parents left. 

           She nods. She gestures towards the research. 

                                 POLLY
                        Thank you. 

           He puts the pizza on the table. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry. 

                                 IVAN
                        I found a dentist. Bernard 
                        Spielman. He’s affiliated with the 
                        Children’s Hospital but he’s based 
                        in Brookline. He can do it Sunday. 

                                 POLLY
                        Oh my god. Thank god. 

           Charlie watches his parents.

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I was ready to kill a dentist. I’m 
                        serious. Some poor slob would be 
                        filling a cavity and - bam. 

           He laughs.
                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 IVAN
                        You don’t know how to shoot a gun. 

                                 POLLY
                        A bee-bee gun! My father must have 
                        one somewhere. 

                                 IVAN
                        Would’ve used it on your mother. 

           They’re both laughing now.

                                 POLLY
                        A bow and arrow! A fly rod! 

           Amanda comes into the kitchen and stands behind Charlie.

                                 AMANDA
                        They’re crazy. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Definitely insane. 

           INT. DENTIST’S OFFICE - DAY 

           Amanda leans back as the dentist drills.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Ivan, Polly, and Charlie wait. Amanda limps out.

                                 IVAN
                        Well? 

                                 POLLY
                        Come on, show us. 

           Amanda pauses, shy. Then smiles. 

                                 IVAN 
                        You look beautiful. 

           Amanda throws her arms around Polly and Ivan. 

                                 AMANDA 
                        You’re the best parents in the 
                        whole world. The best. 
                                 POLLY
                        Come on now - 

                                 AMANDA
                        The best! The best. The best in the 
                        world. 

           Charlie watches his sister hug his parents. For the first 
           time in a long time he feels calm. 

           EXT. RESTAURANT - BROOKLINE

           A cozy restaurant with a jukebox. No one knows who they are 
           here. Amanda and Charlie are ordering everything on the menu. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mozzarella sticks - two orders. And 
                        calamari. 

                                 AMANDA
                        But we’re getting onion rings. 

                                 IVAN
                        Did you just hear her say that? I 
                        think my ears are playing tricks on 
                        me. 

                                 POLLY
                        We’ll get both. It’s a celebration. 

           A waiter brings drinks. A few glasses of wine. A coke for 
           Charlie. 

                                 IVAN
                        I think this calls for a toast. To 
                        freedom from braces forever! To my 
                        daughter’s first glass of wine. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Not my first... 

                                 IVAN
                        No? 

           Amanda laughs.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’ve done a lot of things that you 
                        don’t know about. 

                                 IVAN
                        Like what? 
                                 AMANDA
                        Just things. 

           Amanda takes a sip of wine, but it’s really hard for her to 
           swallow. Polly holds out water. She refuses. A song comes on 
           the jukebox. Credence Clearwater. 

                                 IVAN
                           (after a beat)
                        We love this song. 

                                 POLLY
                        You do. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You tried to make me do a routine 
                        to this song. 

                                 IVAN
                        That is not true. 

                                 AMANDA
                        It was way too slow. 

                                 POLLY
                        I think I remember that happening. 
                        You can be pretty pushy sometimes. 

                                 IVAN
                        Isn’t that the pot calling the 
                        kettle.. 

                                 POLLY
                        Yeah, it is. A little. OK, a 
                        little. 

                                 IVAN
                        Dance with me, baby. 

           Polly smiles at Ivan, allows him to pull her up. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Gross. 

           But Charlie and Amanda watch their parents dance and there’s 
           something kind of lovely about it. 

           EXT. MORROW - DAY

           Bare branches. The icy end of October. 
           INT. CHESHIRE LUNCHROOM - DAY

           Charlie, Amanda, and Jessie eat lunch together. No one sits 
           near them. Amanda looks thinner, sicker. 

           INT. CHESHIRE GYM - DAY

           Amanda, jeans and a sweatshirt swimming over her leotard, 
           watches Sue Sherman practice back flips. After a moment, she 
           gets up and walks over with effort - her limp is the worst 
           it’s been. 

                                 SUE
                        What? 

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re not tucking your legs in 
                        enough. 

           Sue stares at her. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        You need to kind of make your body 
                        a tight ball. And tuck your legs 
                        in. 

                                 SUE
                        Why do you care? 

           A beat. Amanda doesn’t quite know how to respond to that. 

                                 SUE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll never be as good as you. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You forgot the was. 
                           (beat)
                        As good as I was. 

           Sue thinks for a moment, then repositions herself and tries 
           again, tucking her legs in this time. It’s better. Sue seems 
           surprised. 

                                 SUE
                        Thanks.

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie, Polly, Ivan, and Amanda watch TV together. 
           Gymnastics. Amanda thinks about Sue, she’s quietly pleased. 
           INT. CHESHIRE LUNCHROOM - DAY

           Charlie watches Polly and Amanda pack up her locker. Jessie 
           comes up behind him. 

                                 JESSIE
                        I hate everyone else. I only like 
                        her. 

           Charlie doesn’t know what to say to this. 

           EXT. MORROW - ANOTHER DAY

           Charlie rides home. Miniature witches and Goblins and 
           Supermans run by. 

           INT. FARRELL LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Charlie watches a horror movie on TV. A huge basket of candy 
           sits at the front door, untouched. Ivan looks out the window. 

           Ivan plops down next to Charlie and tosses him a chocolate 
           bar.

                                 IVAN
                        What’s this? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        This monster guy? With claws 
                        instead of hands? He just killed 
                        like ten girls. 

                                 IVAN
                        Sounds great. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s really bloody. 

           The doorbell rings. 

                                 IVAN
                        Oh yeah! What did I tell you? Trick-
                        or- treaters! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t hold your breath. 

           INT./EXT FARRELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ivan opens the door. Linda Gleason, decked out in a witch hat 
           and gaudy broomstick earrings. Holding two baskets of candy. 
                                 IVAN
                        You’ve got it backwards. We’re 
                        supposed to give you something.  

                                 LINDA
                        Who came up with that rule?   

           Ivan opens the door a little wider. 

                                 IVAN
                        I hope you like mars bars. We’ve 
                        got about a thousand. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ivan goes upstairs. Linda sits down next to Charlie who 
           stares intently at the TV.

                                 LINDA
                        Hey you.   

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hi. 

                                 LINDA
                        So. My plan. It didn’t work great, 
                        did it? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It worked ok. It worked better than  
                        nothing. 

                                 LINDA
                        Ah, you’re just being nice. 

           Linda gives him one of the baskets. Charlie looks inside. 
           Chocolates. Glow in the dark bugs. 6 Foot Bubble Gum. He 
           empties it out on the coffee table. 

           Charlie holds up the glow in the dark bugs. A beat. Polly 
           comes downstairs, followed by Ivan. Polly looks paler, 
           thinner, stressed.

                                 POLLY
                           (to Linda)
                        Hi.
                           (to Charlie)
                        I thought you’d be out trick or 
                        treating. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s for kids. 
           Polly looks at him for a beat, at Linda seeming to understand 
           something she doesn’t. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Linda)
                        You didn’t have to bring all that. 

                                 LINDA
                        I never make house calls empty 
                        handed. 

                                 POLLY
                        Do you want coffee? Ivan, could you 
                        make coffee? 

                                 IVAN
                        You’re the boss. 

                                 POLLY
                           (to Charlie)
                        Amanda was asking for you. 

                                 CHARLIE
                           (picking up the other 
                           basket)
                        Can I bring her this? 

                                 LINDA
                        That’s what it’s there for. 

                                 POLLY
                        You didn’t have to do all that. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE/STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie crouches in the stairwell, watching Linda and his 
           parents talk. 

                                 LINDA
                        - they can shove their damn 
                        petition. I wasn’t fired. 

                                 POLLY
                        Where are you going to go? 

                                 LINDA
                        A private school in Maine. Very 
                        forward thinking, that’s what I’m 
                        told. And don’t ask what Kristy 
                        said. 
                           (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LINDA (CONT'D)
                        Is it possible by trying to protect 
                        our kids we’ve actually screwed 
                        them up more? 

           Charlie watches as Polly refills Linda’s coffee cup, the 
           adults silently contemplating her question. 

           INT. AMANDA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie pushes open the door. Amanda’s lying on her gym mat, 
           fiddling with a cassette cover. He sits down on her bed, 
           offers her the second treat basket from Ed. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Linda Gleason brought it. The gum 
                        is six feet long. 

                                 AMANDA
                        That’s disgusting. 

           She looks out the window. Watches kids running down the 
           street, passing their house.

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn’t not go because of me. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m too old. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Right. 

           She picks up the gum. Unravels it. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        I used to like this stuff. 
                           (beat)
                        I need you to do me a favor. 
                           (off his nod)
                        We had a really important meet. In 
                        Concord. I need you to tell Coach 
                        Eagan I tried to go. Can you tell 
                        him? 

           Charlie gives her gatorade from the night stand. She has 
           trouble swallowing. 

                                 AMANDA (CONT’D)
                        Can you do that? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah. 
                                 AMANDA
                        Can you find out if Sue got better 
                        at her back flips? And ask him if 
                        we won.

                                 CHARLIE
                        OK. 

                                 AMANDA
                        You won’t forget?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I promise. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Thanks, Beetle brain. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You don’t have metal anymore. 

           Amanda smiles a little. 

                                 AMANDA
                        Charlie? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah? 

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m scared...but don’t tell mom. 

           On Charlie, processing this. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           Charlie looks into the gym. Sixth graders practice 
           somersaults. Coach Eagan yells at them. Charlie tentatively 
           pushes open the door and waits for a moment. Eagan sees him. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Hey! Yeah, you. Get out of here. Go 
                        back to class. 

           Eagan jogs towards him.

                                 COACH EAGAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious, son. This isn’t a 
                        show. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Amanda wanted me to find out if Sue 
                        got better at her back flips. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                           (off Eagan’s pause)
                        I’m her brother, Charlie. 

           Eagan looks at him for a moment. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        She wanted to say she’s sorry for 
                        not going to the meet in Concord. 
                        She really tried.

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        She’s a great kid. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She also wanted me to ask you if 
                        you won. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Tell her we did. 

           Charlie nods. Eagan steps back, looks at Charlie. 

                                 COACH EAGAN (CONT’D)
                        Ever think about gymnastics? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m pretty bad at sports. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Come here. 

           Charlie follows him to the parallel bars, where one boy 
           struggles to lift himself up.

                                 COACH EAGAN (CONT’D)
                        Sean. Get your butt down. 
                           (to Charlie)
                        Hold the bar with both hands. 
                        That’s it. A little wider - good. 
                        Now pull yourself up. 

           Charlie hesitates, then tries. He is surprisingly strong. 

                                 COACH EAGAN (CONT’D)
                        Not bad. What grade are you in? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fourth. 

           Charlie drops back down. 

                                 COACH EAGAN
                        Let me know if you change your mind 
                        by sixth. 
           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Charlie pedals up to the house. Reardon’s car is in the 
           driveway. 

           Charlie drops his bike on the grass and runs inside.

           INT. FARRELL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie slams the door. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Amanda! 

           Charlie throws his backpack on the kitchen table, next to 
           Reardon’s briefcase. He runs up the stairs. 

           INT. FARRELL UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

           His parents are at the top of the stairs, talking quietly. 
           Ivan notices Charlie, moves towards him.  

                                 IVAN
                        Do your homework downstairs. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why? 

                                 IVAN
                        Because I said so. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I need to see Amanda. 

                                 POLLY
                        Listen to Dad. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        But I need to see her. 

                                 IVAN
                        You can’t now, so go downstairs. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I need to see her! 

                                 POLLY
                        Charlie, come...

           Charlie runs towards Amanda’s room. It’s too late, he’s seen 
           her. She’s skeletal, her breathing labored, sicker than he’s 
           ever seen before. Charlie stares for a moment, shocked. 
           Ivan grabs him, carries him down the stairs. 

           INT. FARRELL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Ivan throws Charlie on the couch. 

                                 IVAN
                        STAY DOWNSTAIRS! STAY DOWNSTAIRS! 
                        STAY DOWNSTAIRS! 

           Charlie sits in shock. A tense pause. Then he gets up, 
           yelling like his father was. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why can’t you save her? You’re 
                        supposed to be a scientist. You’re 
                        supposed to be able to save her! 

           Ivan slumps down on the couch and starts to cry. 

           Polly hurries down the stairs and over to Ivan. She puts her 
           arms around him. Ivan’s body shakes. 

           Charlie turns, runs out the door. 

                                 POLLY
                        Charlie!

           EXT. MORROW ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie pedals furiously, speeding from his house. A small 
           figure on a long dark road.

           EXT. POND - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie reaches the pond. It’s almost completely iced over. 
           The turtle is nowhere to be seen. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry. I said I’m sorry. 

           Still nothing. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Can you just come? 

           Still nothing. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        JUST COME. 
           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - DUSK 

           Charlie drops his bike in the reeds, bangs on Laurel’s door. 
           Bangs harder. No answer. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie runs around the back of the house. Marshland. Empty. 
           The birds have left. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - LATER

           It’s twilight. Charlie sits on Laurel’s porch, shivering. He 
           sees her bike from a distance, bells quietly jangling. 

           She rides up, takes a bag of groceries from the bike basket 
           and moves towards Charlie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        If I told you lots of things about 
                        my sister, would you be able to 
                        talk to her? 

           Laurel sits down next to Charlie. Puts her arms around him. 
           For the first time, Charlie starts to cry. 

           INT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - LATER

           Charlie’s calmed down. He drinks his milk and finishes his 
           cake. He looks around the house, pictures of Laurel as a 
           child in a landscape that’s worlds away from Morrow.  

           Laurel nods at Charlie’s empty plate. 

                                 LAUREL
                        More? 

           Charlie nods. She cuts him another slice. After a moment:

                                 CHARLIE
                        My sister is gymnast. She almost 
                        always scores a ten. She wears 
                        purple leotards, she has almost 
                        twenty in her closet. She calls me 
                        beetle brain even though she knows 
                        that I like dinosaurs. She listens 
                        to the same Bruce Springsteen and 
                        Duran Duran and Madonna songs over 
                        and over again. She likes 
                        strawberry ice cream which I think 
                        is disgusting. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        She saw Bruce Springsteen on the 
                        street once and started screaming 
                        his name and it was really 
                        embarrassing. I forgot about that.   
                           (beat)
                        I can make you a whole list. My mom 
                        and dad can too. 
                           (beat)
                        Every year when I start school I 
                        have to tell the class what I did 
                        over the summer and I have to tell 
                        them if I have brothers or sisters 
                        and I’m always going to say, I have 
                        a sister, Amanda, I’m never going 
                        to not say that. 
                           (beat)
                        Is that enough? Will you be able to 
                        talk to her? 

                                 LAUREL
                        I will try. 

           Charlie accepts this. Nods. 

           EXT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Polly’s car pulls up. 

           INT. LAUREL SMITH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Laurel leads Polly into the house. Charlie’s sleeping on the 
           couch. 

                                 LAUREL
                        He is all right. 

           Laurel hands her his backpack. 

                                 POLLY
                        Has he come here a lot? 

           Laurel motions with her hand - a little. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I stopped working on the 
                        book. 

                                 LAUREL
                        You have more important things. 

           Polly stands there for a moment. 
                                 POLLY
                        I thought about coming here. All 
                        the time. It would have been about 
                        comforting myself, not about her. 

           Laurel nods. Polly sits on the edge of the couch. Gently 
           brushes Charlie’s hair away from his face.  

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                           (to Charlie)
                        Amanda wants to see you. 

           INT. FARRELL HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charlie stands in front of Amanda’s bed. A loud MACHINE in 
           the room is now helping her breath. She looks so sick it 
           scares him, but he walks closer anyway.  

                                 CHARLIE
                           (whispering)
                        Amanda. AMANDA. 

           She opens her eyes. 

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to remember you. So you 
                        don’t have to be scared. 

           Amanda smiles.

           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE - DAYBREAK.

           Al’s car pulls up. Charlie watches from the window.

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Polly opens the door. Al and Claire stand on the porch. 

           Polly looks at her mother and her father. 

                                 AL
                        Hi, kid. 

                                 POLLY
                        Hi. 
                           (beat)
                        I’m sorry. 
           INT. AMANDA’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Polly watches her parents lean over Amanda’s bed, talking to 
           her. 

           Polly looks at her daughter, realizes something. 

           INT. FARRELL BASEMENT DARKROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Polly walks quickly down the stairs. Flips on the light. 
           Charlie’s bent over her darkroom, trying to develop a 
           picture. Polly looks at him, surprised.  

                                 POLLY
                        It’s a good thing someone was 
                        getting use out of this. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        They’re all blurry. They’re not 
                        very good. 

           Polly picks up a picture - half developed, but we can see the 
           turtle, half in the water and half on the land. 

                                 POLLY
                        How long are you leaving these in 
                        the solution for? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I just dip it in. Isn’t that what 
                        you do? 

                                 POLLY
                        See, that’s the problem. You need 
                        to time it. Put it back. 
                           (beat)
                        Now we have to wait. Another 
                        minute. 

           The picture slowly comes into focus. The turtle. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s a cryptodire. It could have 
                        been alive in the Cretaceous 
                        Period. 

                                 POLLY
                        Charlie, this is good. 
                           (off his doubt)
                        It is. You see things a lot of 
                        people wouldn’t. The way you’ve 
                        framed it - it’s very good. 
           She holds it up. Puts it on the bare line. Kneels down in 
           front of her son, really looks at him for a moment.

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        When you asked me about Laurel, why 
                        she looked the way she did - I 
                        didn’t know the answer. I still 
                        don’t. 
                           (beat)
                        Is that OK? 

           Charlie thinks about this. Nods. A moment between them, a new 
           understanding. Ivan comes to the top of the stairs. Watches 
           them for a beat. They notice him. 

                                 IVAN
                        Your dad insisted on Monopoly - 
                        he’s slaughtering us, Pol. 
                           (to Charlie)
                        Maybe you could help your Grandma 
                        out? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I guess. 

                                 IVAN
                        Good boy. 

           Polly picks up the Minolta. 

                                 POLLY
                        Stay right there! Both of you. 

           Charlie and Ivan freeze. 

           Polly holds up the Minolta. Snaps their picture. 

           She gestures for them to join her. Puts her arms around 
           Ivan’s waist. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        It’ll only take a minute. 

           Polly unfurls the negative. Holds it out for them to see. 

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s hard to see, but there we are. 

           INT. FARRELL KITCHEN - LATER

           Ivan carries Amanda down the stairs. Polly follows. 
           Charlie sits at the dining room table with his grandparents. 
           He hasn’t touched his soup.

           Ed holds the door open. Charlie gets up, trails them to the 
           porch.

           EXT. FARRELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ivan puts Amanda into the car. Polly and Ivan get into the 
           car, follow Ed’s car out of the driveway and into the street. 

           Amanda waves from the backseat, her hand small and white.

           Charlie watches from the porch, Claire and Al behind him. 

           The cars drive out of sight. They still watch. A long 
           silence. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m going for a ride. 

                                 AL
                        You’re awfully young to have a 
                        license, son. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        On my bike. 

                                 AL
                        That was a bad joke. 

           Charlie gets on his bike.

                                 CHARLIE
                        My dad would have made that joke. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Does your mother let you do that? 

                                 AL
                        It’s all right. 
                           (to Charlie)
                        Amanda left something for you. 

           EXT. MORROW - LATER

           Charlie rides down the street, Amanda’s GYM BAG slung over 
           his shoulder. It’s too light out for the dinosaur patch to 
           glow.
                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        My dad once told me facts were all 
                        I needed to believe in. Facts like, 
                        before the dinosaurs died, 
                        carnivores and herbivores may have 
                        lived all over the world. Oceans 
                        were forming and continents were 
                        breaking apart. This was the 
                        Cretaceous Period. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL - 5TH GRADE CLASSROOM - ALMOST A YEAR 
           LATER - INTERCUT

           Charlie stands in front of his new class, reading from his 
           specimen log. The DINOSAUR MURAL we saw him coloring in the 
           opening is pasted up behind him: big colorful dinosaurs, 
           birds, plants - and his picture of the turtle, which fits 
           right into the landscape. 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        The Cretaceous Period is famous for 
                        the extinction event that was bad 
                        for the dinosaurs but good for us.  

           EXT. POND 

           Charlie sits writing in his specimen log. Patches of light 
           snow on the ground. The pond is frozen. 

                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        When the asteroid hit seventy five 
                        percent of the species on our 
                        planet were killed off, but we 
                        don’t know why yet. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        How long did it take for the 
                        dinosaurs to die? Did they die 
                        because the earth got cold, or did 
                        they die because it was such a big 
                        explosion? All scientists know now 
                        is that reptiles like turtles 
                        survived. What can we learn by 
                        studying these amazing reptiles? 

           EXT. POND 

           Charlie looks out at the pond, then goes back to writing. 
                                 CHARLIE (V.O.)
                        We know they are adaptable, able to 
                        survive without food for long 
                        periods of time, store what they 
                        need for the winter. We know that 
                        they can live both in the water and 
                        on land. 

           INT. CHESHIRE SCHOOL - 5TH GRADE CLASSROOM

                                 CHARLIE
                        By studying these animals, maybe we 
                        can learn what made the greatest 
                        civilization die out so quickly. 
                        Maybe we can learn how to be 
                        better. 

           Charlie looks out at his classmates. 

           EXT. POND - END INTERCUT

           It’s almost dark. Charlie closes his specimen log. Puts it in 
           the gym bag. The dinosaur patch starts to glow.

                                 SEVRIN (O.C.)
                        Hey. 

           Charlie turns. Sevrin is there with his bike. 

                                 SEVRIN (CONT’D)
                        Your grandpa was looking for you. 
                        He called my mom. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She let you out? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        She was mad. But I came anyway. 

           Charlie throws a pebble in the pond. Sevrin shifts his weight 
           from foot to foot.

                                 SEVRIN (CONT’D)
                        Look - I don’t care if you hate me. 
                        You’re still my best friend. 

           Charlie throws another pebble. 

                                 SEVRIN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t believe me, do you? 

           Charlie plops down on the ground.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Get me my flash. 

           Sevrin scrambles towards the bag. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Isn’t that Amanda’s? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        She wanted me to have it. 

           Sevrin studies the bag. It’s very pink. Definitely not the 
           type of bag most boys would carry around. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        Cool dinosaur patch. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        It glows better when it’s darker 
                        out. 

           Sevrin sits down next to Charlie. He hands him the flash. 
           Charlie takes it. Takes a picture of the pond, which looks 
           eerily bare and beautiful. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        The cryptodire? 

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s probably burrowing. He won’t 
                        be back till April at least. 

           Charlie takes another picture. They sit in silence for a 
           moment.  

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Did you know that some fish can get 
                        stuck in the ice and swim again 
                        when it gets warm? 

                                 SEVRIN
                        How?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t understand how yet. But 
                        they can. 

                                 SEVRIN
                        We could look for other specimens. 
                        If you want. 
           Charlie looks over at Sevrin. He’s grateful, but he’d never 
           say it. The boys stare out at the pond, patchy ice, not a 
           ripple. 

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
